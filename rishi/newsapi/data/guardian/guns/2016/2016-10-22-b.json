  "<p>David Cameron was unequivocal. \u201cThe military,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military is definitely one sector where I don\u2019t see black people represented at the top.\u201d That was four years ago, and the former prime minister was talking to me about the sectors of society in which he felt people of African or African Caribbean heritage were most conspicuous by their absence.</p> <p>He had been spot-on in identifying the military; there are very few black faces in the senior ranks. Only 2.4% of officers are from a black or minority ethnic background \u2013 and that figure includes recruits from Commonwealth countries. However, he could just as easily have been talking about the civil service, the police or the media and still have been on the money.</p> <p>Six years before that conversation, I launched the <a href=\"http://www.powerlist.co.uk\">Powerlist</a>, an annual publication that profiles some of Britain\u2019s most influential people of African and African Caribbean heritage. Now, 10 years on, as we publish this year\u2019s list, we have found that despite some cause for optimism \u2013 mostly in the business sector \u2013 in many areas the situation is no better than a decade ago, and sometimes worse.</p> <p>Take, for instance, the government. Incredibly, there has never been an MP of African or African Caribbean heritage in the cabinet. The only black cabinet minister was Baroness Amos (a peer) who served in the decision-making body of the executive as secretary of state for international development and leader of the House of Lords between 2003 and 2007. Baroness Scotland, as attorney general, and before her Lord Boateng, as chief secretary to the Treasury, held positions in which the incumbent minister was regularly invited to attend cabinet meetings, but strictly speaking neither of those roles is regarded as being in the cabinet. Today there are no black people in the cabinet.</p> <p>A look at the judiciary shows that 10 years ago Dame Linda Dobbs, who currently chairs the Powerlist judging committee, was the only black high court judge. In 2004, when she was first appointed, she said of the fact that she was the first person of African heritage to fill such a role: \u201cI am confident that I am the first of many to come.\u201d Sadly, that has not been the case. Not only was she the one black high court judge throughout her tenure, but since Dobbs retired in 2013 there has been a total absence of black judges in the high court.</p> <p>Intriguingly, however, there has been a significant shift in representation on the list from the public to the private sector. There are no official data to back this up, but a look at corporate Britain reveals that the number of black people in senior positions has increased over the years \u2013 almost certainly as a result of aggressive diversity programmes instituted by many companies in this sector. In professional services, while the numbers are still far fewer than they ought to be, there are more black partners than ever before. It\u2019s the same in law firms: more black partners have come through over the past decade. And in banking, particularly investment banking, there are more black managing directors than ever.</p> <p>But when we look at board representation in FTSE 100 companies \u2013 the people who make the most important decisions in these firms \u2013 the picture once again turns ugly. There are just two UK-based black people \u2013 Dambisa Moyo, at Barclays and at SAB Miller, and Jean Tomlin at Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 serving on the board of a FTSE 100 firm. Both are non-executives. There are no black c-suite execs (chair, chief executive, chief finance officer etc) \u2013 the people who really run the company. In 2007 there were three, two of whom were executive directors.</p> <p>As our list has clearly shown over the years, this is not due to a paucity of talent. It\u2019s more to do with a lack of opportunities for that talent to shine, with some of the headhunters who have traditionally filled board vacancies particularly culpable because they simply don\u2019t know any black people.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not all bad news. The one area that seems to have thrived, somewhat ironically given the economic climate of the past decade, is the number of black-owned and run businesses that have come through.</p> <p>Ten years ago we struggled to find successful entrepreneurs. Now young people such as 24-year-old Steven Bartlett, who set up Social Chain, one of the UK\u2019s fastest growing social media firms, and former banker Martin Ijaha, the founder and CEO of Neyber, a company that offers affordable loans to company employees, are becoming serious trailblazers in the business sector. And then we have the more established entrepreneurs such as Ric Lewis, whose property investment firm Tristan Capital Partners has \u00a310bn under management, and Tom Ilube, who has set up and sold a number of tech companies. In the arts, Femi Oguns\u2019 Identity Agency Group has been at the forefront of supplying black British acting talent to Hollywood, <em>Star Wars</em> actor John Boyega being one high-profile success.</p> <p>On Tuesday we celebrate the Powerlist\u2019s 10th anniversary at the annual influencers\u2019 dinner, a black-tie event in the City which will feature leading figures in the UK\u2019s African and African Caribbean population as well as guests from the US, Africa and the Caribbean. London mayor Sadiq Khan, will deliver the keynote speech. It has become the most prestigious event in the black British calendar.</p> <p>Ten years on, Powerful Media, the company that publishes the list, has added <a href=\"http://powerful-media.com\">Future Leaders</a>, which profiles 100 of the UK\u2019s most talented black students every year and which has become an invaluable resource for our recruitment firm Powerful Personnel. Through it we work with some of the country\u2019s leading firms to assist them in their efforts to recruit the brightest and best, at all grades of seniority, regardless of their ethnicity.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always said that we will stop publishing the Powerlist when it is no longer necessary. But given the slow rate of change in so many areas of British life, it\u2019s arguably needed more now than ever before.</p> <h2>Corporates, financiers and entrepreneurs</h2> <p><strong>Nathaniel

  "<p>When Gordon Brown <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown/6170112/Gordon-Brown-Im-proud-to-say-sorry-to-a-real-war-hero.html\">made a touchingly phrased apology to Alan Turing</a> in 2009 \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, you deserved so much better\u201d \u2013 he regretted that he was unable to offer more: a posthumous pardon. \u201cWhile Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can\u2019t put the clock back,\u201d he said, \u201chis treatment was of course utterly unfair.\u201d</p> <p>This view was restated, in 2012, the centenary of Turing\u2019s birth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/feb/07/alan-turing-pardon-lord-mcnally-lord-sharkey-computers\">by the coalition government\u2019s Liberal Democrat justice minister, Lord McNally</a>. He reminded 34,000 petitioners for a full pardon: \u201cThe law at that time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.\u201d</p> <p>McNally, it turns out, was wrong (and not only about the strikingly unambitious alternative he adumbrated, of not going backwards). In 2013, to expressions of joy from subsequent justice minister, Chris Grayling, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25495315\">Turing was pardoned</a> by the Queen. As of last week, posthumously offered pardons, for people who would be innocent of any crime today, have gone from being out of the question, to Labour policy, to a Tory manifesto commitment, to an official <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-unveils-plans-to-pardon-thousands-under-turings-law\">pledge</a> from the current justice minister, Sam Gyimah.</p> <p>Turing\u2019s Law, an amendment to the policing and crime bill seems to mean that while living men must apply for \u201cdisregards\u201d of their convictions in the defunct \u201cgross indecency\u201d category, a selected number of the dead will benefit from the government\u2019s blanket, time-travelling pardon.</p> <p>Selected, because the latter, while all eligible, presumably require the living to act for them. Unless volunteers start combing through court records to ensure that the innocent but obscure also get the benefit, it seems unlikely the dead will get to enjoy Turing\u2019s Law on an equal basis. But since the pardons have only symbolic value, maybe it hardly matters if they end up restricted to the gloriously talented dead, the fashionable dead, dead subjects of successful biopics and those dead recently enough to benefit from concerned descendants. Assuming these various representatives can be sure about what their clients would have wanted.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to read much of <a href=\"http://upword.com/wilde/de_profundis.html\"><em>De Profundis</em></a> to wonder how much an intervention by, say, Chris Grayling would have meant to Oscar Wilde, occupied with pitiless self-examination, if the former had stepped out of a Tardis into Reading Gaol, brandishing a copy of the 2015 Tory manifesto. \u201cI surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the meaner minds,\u201d Wilde writes. \u201cI became the spendthrift of my own genius and to waste an eternal youth gave me a curious joy.\u201d</p> <p>Then again, posthumous pardons are entirely about the living and a pardon for Wilde, like a pardon for Turing, evidently has huge significance for many, though by no means all, of his admirers. If their abrupt adoption was perhaps less comprehensible by a Tory party whose members were, in the year of Turing\u2019s pardon, still voting against same-sex marriage, perhaps it came about precisely because a posthumous pardon is, unlike one for the alive, an exercise in doing nothing.</p> <p>The day after he extended, to long-dead victims of homophobia, the Tory party\u2019s most tender consideration for their wellbeing, <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/10/21/tory-mp-filibusterers-the-turing-bill-pardoning-men-criminalised-for-their-sexuality-6206626/\">Sam Gyimah filibustered</a> \u2013 or talked out \u2013 SNP MP John Nicolson\u2019s Turing bill, which would have pardoned living people with the same convictions.</p> <p>Coming soon, from the Tories\u2019 new Department of the Departed: warm homes for dead rough sleepers, swingeing tax rises for the decomposing rich, a second EU referendum for much-mourned Remainers. Jam yesterday.</p> <p>Admittedly, posthumous pardons were also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/miliband-promises-turing-law-posthumous-pardons-gay-conviction\">dear</a> to Ed Miliband. Supported by petitions and our more high-minded celebrities, they are, for the still numerous exponents of virtue-signalling, perhaps the ultimate gesture, better even than the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23424289\">Jane Austen tenner</a>. They cost legislators nothing, mean nothing, commit them to nothing and are designed to improve only one thing \u2013 their reputations. Conversely, anyone who argues against this sprucing up of history, while living same-sex couples are jeered at for walking hand in hand, is at risk of looking less enlightened than the party containing Peter Bone.</p> <p>It\u2019s not impossible, of course, that the posthumous pardoning of Turing, then Wilde, (Joe Orton will just have to live with his sentence for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/11/library-books-playwright-joe-orton\">library book defacement</a>), along with thousands of the currently forgotten, will be quite the thing to improve life for anyone identifying as LGBT, particularly in communities where they are considered an abomination.

If popular, his party\u2019s legislative death cult may have to be extended to cover, say, people jailed for attempted suicide, for blasphemy and for witchcraft. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, for one, <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/update/2013-06-17/campaign-to-pardon-bideford-witches/\">wants </a> a pardon for the Exeter Three \u2013 the last women hanged for witchcraft in England, in 1682.</p> <p>Should some sort of time limit seem sensible, in the light of Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/\">child sex abuse inquiry</a>, the number of convictions under the 1604 statute against witchcraft does look to be relatively manageable. By way of a precedent, the state of Massachusetts thought it necessary \u2013 Arthur Miller not having made it clear enough <a href=\"http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/sal_cru.htm\">in his play</a> \u2013 to establish, in 2001, that five of the women hanged as witches in Salem <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/us/massachusetts-clears-5-from-salem-witch-trials.html?_r=0\">were not, in fact, witches</a>.</p> <p>If these pardons did have value, the relevant dead people, or at least their descendants, would be at an advantage, you could argue, in becoming identifiably of interest, over the nameless millions with no criminal records, whose lives were ruined or destroyed in myriad ways less susceptible to retrospective contrition.</p> <p>Then again, the dead gross-indecency demographic, in all its variousness, is now reduced to a convenient method of Tory-burnishing. Maybe, like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37711518\">George Montague</a>, who appeared on <em>Newsnight</em> last week, they wouldn\u2019t even thank Mr Gyimah for one of his pardons? An apology, he might accept. \u201cI was not guilty of anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI was only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p> <p>An apology, however lame or pointless, would have the additional benefit of not rewriting history. Brown\u2019s earlier \u201cwe\u2019re sorry\u201d statement contained some sense and humility. Turing was a genius. The idea that his CV, or for that matter, that of Oscar Wilde \u2013 \u201cI was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age\u201d \u2013 needed an edit by the two stupidest governments in living memory is as vain as it is absurd. <em><br></em></p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 26 October 2016 to correct an error.

Last month, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime revealed that the programme had led to the seizure of drugs at Karachi airport that were bound for Saudi Arabia. Three men arrested in connection with the seizures now face potential death penalties, according to the human rights group Reprieve.</p> <p>There is evidence that some of those caught attempting to smuggle drugs from Pakistan are doing so under duress \u2013 to pay off family debt or because a relative is being held by a criminal gang. In other cases, those smuggling the drugs are poorly educated and unaware of the implications.</p> <p>The UN special rapporteur on migrant workers is one of several experts who have raised concerns that some smugglers sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia are trafficking victims.

Since the country lifted the moratorium on the death penalty more than 400 people have been executed.</p> <p>In a letter to home secretary Amber Rudd, Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, warns that the \u201cUK funding for counter-narcotics programmes may be not only contributing to the death penalty and other human rights abuse, but even leading to the arrest and execution of some of the very exploited people it is seeking to protect.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office denies funding the programme and insists all of its overseas engagement work is risk-assessed, which includes looking at any impact on human rights.</p>",
  "<p>Italian police are investigating a dozen doctors at a Sicilian hospital after the family of a 32-year-old woman who died after a miscarriage claimed she was not given adequate medical attention. The family says that her doctor had professed moral objections to abortion.</p> <p>The death of Valentina Milluzzo, who was five months pregnant with twins when she miscarried and fell ill, has reignited a debate across Italy about the high number of gynaecologists and obstetricians who refuse to provide abortions. As a result, women may not get the medical attention they require in emergency situations.</p> <p>The investigation into the Cannizzaro obstetrics and gynaecology hospital in Catania on the east coast of Sicily was opened after the family of Milluzzo, who became pregnant through in-vitro fertilisation, said a doctor refused to intervene even though her life was at risk.</p> <p>Milluzzo had been admitted to the hospital two weeks earlier, after going into premature labour. After the death of one of the foetuses, Milluzzo reportedly became very ill and her blood pressure dropped rapidly. Her family asked for the other foetus to be aborted but say her doctor refused. Milluzzo died within hours on 16 October of septic shock.</p> <p>Milluzzo\u2019s partner, Francesco Castro, told reporters that his wife was \u201cscreaming in pain for nearly 12 hours\u201d when he asked the doctor to intervene. Milluzzo had already given birth to one foetus, which was stillborn, but Castro said the doctor told him he could \u201cnot intervene\u201d because he objected to abortion and the other foetus still had a viable heartbeat.</p> <p>Milluzzo\u2019s parents have backed her husband\u2019s recollection of events but the hospital has disputed the account, saying that an abortion would not have been necessary in Milluzzo\u2019s case because she was already miscarrying.</p> <p>Paolo Scolio, a doctor at the Cannizzaro, admitted that all of the doctors in the hospital were conscientious objectors to abortion but that other specialists could technically have been called in if required.</p> <p>Catania\u2019s prosecutor is now investigating a dozen doctors, which could lead to charges of manslaughter, according to Italian press reports.</p> <p>Beatrice Lorenzin, the Italian health minister, said doctors were permitted to conscientiously object to performing voluntary abortions on patients, but that doctors were not allowed by law to withhold medical treatment when women\u2019s lives were at risk. This point was reiterated by a national association of Catholic doctors, who said they had to do whatever was necessary to save a woman\u2019s life it if was in danger.</p> <p>Abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978, but the rules surrounding the medical procedure are stringent. Under Italian law, doctors can perform an abortion during the first 90 days of pregnancy. But after that a woman must either be physically or mentally at risk because of the pregnancy or have evidence of a serious problem with the foetus.</p> <p>The most recent government figures show that about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages\" title=\"\">seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists </a>refuse to carry out abortions on the grounds of conscientious objection. The proportion of doctors who object has risen from about 59% in 2005 to 70% in 2013.</p> <p>The health ministry had previously denied that the increasing number of doctors in Italy who were refusing to perform abortions posed any risk to women, because the number of abortions was decreasing.</p> <p>When the health ministry was asked earlier this year whether Italy could ensure that women had access to safe abortions given the high rate of objectors, the ministry said that the workload of doctors who did perform abortions was sustainable.</p> <p>The number of doctors who object differs from region to region, but Sicily is among the areas with the highest number of doctors who will not carry out abortions, with a rate of about 87.6% of gynaecologists in the region refusing to perform the procedure.</p> <p>The International Planned Parenthood Federation, a global group that supports abortion rights, said the case had eerie echoes of the death in 2012 in Ireland of 31-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/14/ireland-woman-dies-after-abortion-refusal\" title=\"\">Savita Halappanavar</a>, who was admitted to Galway University clinic with severe abdominal pain and high fever but was denied an abortion. She died of septicaemia.</p> <p>\u201cItaly is not Ireland and abortion has been legal in Italy for 40 years,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe tragic death of Valentina highlights the brutality of a system that permits objecting health care providers to disrespect the law.</p> <p>\u201cFar too many doctors and medical staff put their personal conscience before a woman\u2019s conscience, life and dignity.\u201d</p>",

I would expect the government to set up a specialist team to negotiate this aspect of Brexit, and parliament should be kept fully informed at all times. These issues require ongoing cross-party support.</p> <p>\u201cOpting into the latest Europol measure is the first test of the government\u2019s resolve on this issue. The clock is ticking but so far the government has sat on its hands. This is not an issue that can be fudged to appease Tory backbenchers.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers must decide by the end of this year whether to accept a new, expanded remit for Europol, agreed by the 28 member states after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/25/police-arrest-men-brussels-paris-terror-attacks\" title=\"\">Paris and Brussels terror attacks</a>. If they do, the UK police and intelligence services will continue to have full access to Europol databases and services. However, many Tory MPs will see the move as a \u201cfudge\u201d and a sign that the prime minister is backing away from a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. Crucially, if the UK stays in Europol it will have to pay budget contributions to the EU and accept a role for the European Court of Justice in resolving disputes \u2013 two conditions unacceptable for hardcore Brexiters.</p> <p>Were the government to reject the deal, the UK would drop out of Europol from May next year. The many UK staff at its headquarters in The Hague, including its British director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/europol-chief-says-brexit-would-harm-uk-crime-fighting\" title=\"\">Rob Wainwright</a>, would have to go.</p> <p>May has raised the issue with international leaders in recent weeks, expressing her preference for remaining in Europol but also her fears that her party will see such a move as an early Brexit capitulation. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/04/theresa-mays-speech-on-brexit-full-text.html\" title=\"\">In a speech in April</a>, before the Brexit vote, she cited crime-fighting and sharing intelligence at EU level as a major reason for staying in the EU.</p> <p>\u201cOur response to Paris and Brussels cannot be to say that we should have less co-operation with countries that are not only our allies but our nearest neighbours,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In a recent report, the Commons European scrutiny committee demanded a debate in parliament before any decision is made and expressed disappointment that ministers had said so little on the subject.</p> <p>The Home Office said that no decision had yet been taken: \u201cThe prime minister has stated that law enforcement cooperation will continue when the UK is outside the EU, and we will do what is necessary to keep our people safe.

Rosa Curling, a lawyer at Leigh Day, said: \u201cWe are saying that the Dubs amendment is an important new duty and it must be implemented urgently.\u201d</p> <p>Josie Naughton of Help Refugees said \u2018 We really welcome the fact that, after bringing our legal challenge, we are seeing some movement at last on registering the Dubs Amendment children in Calais.\u201dLast week more than 60 unaccompanied minors arrived in London from Calais to cheers from wellwishers but a hostile response from some politicians and newspapers. Leaked emails sent from Home Office officials last week exposed panic inside the department because officials had not properly prepared for them: civil servants sent pleas for \u201curgent help\u201d to residential care services, stressing the issue was \u201ctime critical due to the need to bring the children here prior to the camp being dismantled\u201d.</p> <p>The failure to prepare adequately means some child refugees have been forced to stay at a \u201cpre-departure\u201d immigration detention unit called Cedars, near Gatwick airport. Cedars was shut by the government in July following criticism over the policy of imprisoning children and family awaiting removal from the country.</p> <p>Another negative side-effect of the Home Office\u2019s approach has meant that, despite all the Calais child refugees allowed into Britain having relatives in the UK, only a few have been settled with family members. Instead, a number of younger unaccompanied minors have been placed in foster care because the required background checks on family members have not been conducted.</p> <p>A source close to the process said: \u201cPolitically, the Home Office did not want this to happen, so it didn\u2019t do anything. Therefore as the camp comes to closure it\u2019s a panic \u2013 all the work you should have done over three to six months you do over three to six hours. They cannot place the child in a number of cases because none of the checks have been done.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Elvin, chief executive of Tact, the UK\u2019s largest fostering and adoption charity with more than 500 carers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing for a developed nation not to have managed this more professionally.

It doesn\u2019t feel particularly of its era \u2013 there\u2019s no sign that the stories are taking place in the 50s and the sensibility feels modern.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Jackson increasingly looks like an author ahead of her time. In addition to building up a reputation as the queen of gothic horror with unnerving spine-tinglers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/07/haunting-hill-house-shirley-jackson\" title=\"\"><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em></a>, she also turned her hand to nonfiction, writing essays about her life bringing up four children, running a household and ensuring everything ran smoothly for her husband, a literary critic and academic whom she ferried to work each day, fitting her writing around his schedule. Their light-hearted, sardonic tone feels almost like the 50s equivalent of today\u2019s popular mummy blogs.</p> <p>\u201cShe received all these letters from fans asking how she coped and saying that they were too exhausted after doing the housework to write \u2013 I call them her \u2018I don\u2019t know how she does it notes,\u2019\u201d says Franklin. \u201cShe would write back cheerful replies saying \u2018do less housework, write more\u2019, but of course the real answer wasn\u2019t so cheery: she was refuelling on amphetamines and tranquillisers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1e987fe6817dff7bf7f7568c2911bef5f1436a38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e987fe6817dff7bf7f7568c2911bef5f1436a38/30_193_1753_2192/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley Jackson in 1951.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shirley Jackson in 1951.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robert Weil, editor-in-chief of publishers Liveright, believes Jackson was largely ignored by the predominantly male literary establishment of the 50s and 60s because of her looks. \u201cI stand by my belief that if Patricia Highsmith and Shirley Jackson had looked like Sylvia Plath they would never have been condemned to the margins,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s this sense that people don\u2019t take Jackson seriously at the time because she\u2019s viewed as a dumpy, overweight housewife.\u201d</p> <p>Nor did it help that Jackson\u2019s subject matter was so exclusively female. \u201cYou can count the number of male protagonists on one hand,\u201d says Franklin. \u201cHer work is almost exclusively focused on women and women\u2019s lives and when her work came out the majority of book reviews were mainly by men. They either didn\u2019t get what she was doing or didn\u2019t regard the stories of women as important.\u201d</p> <p>Nor did it help that Jackson\u2019s most famous fiction saw her condemned as a \u201cmere\u201d horror writer. \u201cIt\u2019s so often a problem that people condemn certain genres as not literature,\u201d says Weil. \u201cPatricia Highsmith was described even in the late 90s as a \u2018mystery gal\u2019, Ursula Le Guin has argued for years about the need to treat science fiction as literature. Jackson was packed away as a horror writer and that allowed people to dismiss the work.\u201d</p> <p>There is also a slipperiness to Jackson\u2019s writing that can make her work hard to categorise. US novelist Jonathan Lethem has described her as \u201cone of this century\u2019s most luminous and strange American writers\u201d, and her best writing trades on ambiguity making you unsure as to what really happened and why.</p> <p><em>The Lottery</em>, published in 1948, tells the story of a murderous ritual in a New England village, and was described by the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-lottery-letters\" title=\"\"><em>New Yorker</em></a> as \u201cprobably the most controversial story [the magazine] has ever published\u201d.

I honestly feel as though she\u2019s one of those authors who\u2019s been in the background for a long time, yet has a huge influence on American fiction, and it\u2019s only now that we\u2019re beginning to see how important she is.\u201d</p> <p><em>A Rather Haunted Life is published by Liveright on 25 October, \u00a325; Dark Tales (Penguin Classics, \u00a39.99), is out now</em></p>",

But a new target market across the country is opening up now that it has been banned.</p> <p>\u201cThe rough sleeping population is being specifically targeted in Westminster by dealers,\u201d said councillor Nickie Aiken, cabinet member for public protection at Westminster city council.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve become aware of it really over the last couple of months.

Since it was outlawed there is anecdotal evidence that spice has become more popular among the homeless in several of Britain\u2019s cities.</p> <p>\u201cIt is terrifying, what I am seeing,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cI was in Soho last week. At 3.30 in the afternoon I saw a homeless man come up to a drug dealer with pence in his hand and hand it over. You can buy a spliff for 50p and that one spliff can have serious consequences.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'The cost to the public purse is out of control.

Will, who is 64, and has been on the streets for almost 50 years, said Nick was popular among the homeless. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a troublemaker, not violent. I had a few smokes with him, a few drinks. You don\u2019t get too close to people on the streets but I liked him.\u201d</p> <p>Will has been clean since the start of the year. But over half a century he has used crack, gas, LSD, glue and alcohol. Spice, though, is the one drug that has scared him.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t taken it since last Christmas because I ended up in hospital. They were cutting my clothes off and I thought that I\u2019d been kidnapped by aliens. I couldn\u2019t move my arm and shoulder. I thought I\u2019d had a stroke.</p> <p>\u201cThe hallucinations are terrible. You are gone in two to three minutes. You are incapable of looking after yourself.

More and more, though, I\u2019m hearing the latter. The question is: why are people choosing to do something that leaves them losing complete control of their bodies?\u201d</p> <p>The answer appears to be down to the way that spice is sustaining a symbiotic relationship between dealers and users.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a fraction of what it costs people to buy heroin or crack,\u201d Aiken said. Today a small bag costs between \u00a315 and \u00a320 compared with about \u00a310 before the drug was banned. \u201cA \u00a310 pack, if you\u2019ve never taken it before \u2013 that might keep you going for a week,\u201d Will said. \u201cYou only need four or five pulls [on a spliff] and you\u2019re out of it.\u201d</p> <p>Users report entering a state of oblivion \u2013 known as \u201cgouging out\u201d \u2013 that can last for days, enough time to get the money together for another bag by begging. \u201cYou smoke more so you can beg more so you can smoke more,\u201d says James Alexander.</p> <p>Beth Winter of Thames Reach helps run two London day centres, one in Hackney and another in Camden. She said that spice was a problem only at the centre in Camden, an area popular with beggars because it is a tourist trap \u2013 suggesting that local economic conditions are a factor in determining the drug\u2019s prevalence.</p> <p>This may help explain why spice, once considered a northern-England drug, appears to have migrated south \u2013 \u201cfollowing the money\u201d \u2013 after it was banned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"547544d0930d5c56c1855e2b288afd2038e15f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/547544d0930d5c56c1855e2b288afd2038e15f3e/0_0_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spice on sale as a \u2018legal high\u2019 in London before it was banned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spice on sale as a \u2018legal high\u2019 in London before it was banned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe streets of Westminster are paved with gold for beggars,\u201d said Aiken, who urged people to think twice before giving money to people on the streets.</p> <p>Aiken praised the Metropolitan police for arresting dealers \u2013 but the drugs keep coming. Will said that he had heard rumours that a spice factory had been established in Chinatown in the centre of London, ensuring a steady supply to the many homeless people who congregate around the Strand, where usage of the drug is rife.</p> <p>Those working with the homeless have been left shocked by the drug\u2019s effect on them. \u201cThe impact is so unpredictable,\u201d Winter said. \u201cPeople become emotional, angry and shouting. One guy was behaving so oddly we thought we were going to have to get him sectioned.\u201d</p> <p>Ewa Kapica, an outreach worker at Westminster-based homelessness charity The Connection, said she had witnessed people thrashing around on the floor, experiencing vivid hallucinations and screaming that they wanted to \u201cend it all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese fits are followed by crashes,\u201d Kapica said. \u201cThe person becomes unresponsive and the emergency services step in. It\u2019s terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to the psychotic problems, other known side-effects of spice include vomiting, seizures, hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, aggression and severe kidney injury.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had dozens of accident and emergency callouts because of spice in the last couple of months,\u201d said Aiken, who wants the police to be given more powers to confiscate the drug from users as well as dealers.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost to the public purse is getting out of control. The charities we are working with say they have never known anything like this ever. It\u2019s the ferocity of the drug \u2013 it\u2019s like nothing we\u2019ve experienced before.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>It was no doubt a relief to everybody at Chelsea, presumably, that when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was asked where it had all gone wrong he referred to a Portuguese saying \u2013 <em>n\u00e3o lavo roupa suja em p\u00fablico</em> \u2013 and explained, possibly with his fingers crossed beneath the table, that it meant he would never wash his dirty linen in public when it came to his former clubs.</p> <p>True, it jarred slightly with his introduction at Chelsea, the second time, when he led a group of football writers into the boardroom at Stamford Bridge and, unsolicited, proceeded to score some easy points at the expense of Iker Casillas, his former captain at Real Madrid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/jose-mourinho-chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: I will always respect Chelsea but am now United 100%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet Mourinho has always shaped the rules to his own liking.

But it is the detail from the start of that meeting that stands out. Mourinho kicked off proceedings, Webb says, by \u201cwiping the floor\u201d with the Premier League representative who had been invited. What was said is not recorded but, having made a few inquiries, it is fair to say it was unpleasant in the extreme.</p> <p>Another intriguing revelation is that Mourinho is said to have changed his email address during the first half of last season, purportedly out of concern that third parties might be going through his correspondence as part of the Carneiro case, and apparently sent a message to one contact with the opening line: \u201cNo emails \u2026 dangerous!\u201d</p> <p>Yet there is still an element of mystery about how much his treatment of the club\u2019s doctor contributed to his diminished status within the Chelsea dressing room and the almost implausible speed at which Mourinho lost the precious magic that once led Patrick Barclay, writing his biography <em>Anatomy of a Winner</em>, to note how the Portuguese loved \u201cscorning the convention that even the kindest coach must maintain a certain distance between himself and the players\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3eb19bdb66eb1b011f80fbf5ec472b967aea28e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3eb19bdb66eb1b011f80fbf5ec472b967aea28e/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as he was when he first joined Chelsea in 2004 and as he is now at Manchester United\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue turning red \u2026 and grey: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as he was when he first joined Chelsea in 2004 and as he is now at Manchester United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Tony O'Brien/Action Images; John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The footage after Internazionale win the 2010 Champions League final when he and Marco Materazzi tearfully embrace in the bowels of the Bernab\u00e9u, knowing it will be their last game together, is probably the most compelling reminder, but that kind of bonding technique was evident during happier times at Stamford Bridge, too.</p> <p>My mind goes back to a night at the Savoy in January 2014, with the Football Writers\u2019 Association honouring Mourinho at its annual tribute dinner, and a speech from Frank Lampard that was so moving virtually everyone on the top table seemed to be dabbing their eyes. Louis van Gaal, that giant bear of a man, was among them. Lampard had spoken like a man who would run through a plate-glass window for Mourinho, and Van Gaal, still wiping away tears, said he had never known a manager have such a relationship with his players.</p> <p>So far, that has not really been evident at Old Trafford although, equally, four months is not a great deal of time to build up the same kind of rapport. It does feel slightly different, though, and it has crossed my mind more than once that maybe Mourinho has been affected by his final half-season at Chelsea more than he probably wants to let on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d8c64caa63ade8f8b45964c60b12ba860aea52d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d8c64caa63ade8f8b45964c60b12ba860aea52d/0_47_1182_709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho reacts during the Manchester United\u2019s home defeat to Manchester City in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho reacts during the Manchester United\u2019s home defeat to Manchester City in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The old spark is not always there. Mourinho used to walk into press conferences and light up the entire room \u2013 infuriatingly handsome, immaculately turned out, nodding to the sound of his own words, as if he thought he was the Fonz. He looked as if he was auditioning to appear on a banknote. He had the indefinable quality that inspires curiosity, and he even had Sir Alex Ferguson on the ropes for a while. Ferguson\u2019s last public event in Manchester was at Bridgewater Hall and Mourinho\u2019s first stint at Chelsea was inevitably brought up. \u201cI watched his first press conference when he said he was the Special One,\u201d Ferguson told his audience. \u201cI said to myself: \u2018Och, I\u2019m not going to take him on.\u2019 He was young, vibrant \u2026 you don\u2019t take on young guys like that.\u201d That was the Mourinho who, having left Stamford Bridge the first time, explained that he could never return to say thank you to the supporters because he would die in the crush.</p> <p>Nowadays, the dark rings beneath Mourinho\u2019s eyes seem that much more pronounced. It used to be that his charm was on full-beam. For a while, he was the most admired personality in the game, one of the rare people who could make bigheadedness feel vaguely attractive when he reminisced about life at Porto with its \u201cbeautiful blue chairs, the Uefa Champions League trophy, God and, after God, me\u201d.</p> <p>These days, though, nobody really makes comparisons with Brian Clough, the last manager who seemed made for television. There isn\u2019t quite the old strut, or the air of insouciance that once had Mourinho, in the first part of his Chelsea duology, nominating George Clooney to play him in a film.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/21/chelsea-players-bear-scars-of-last-season-antonio-conte\">Chelsea players still bear scars of last season, says Antonio Conte</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps we know him too well now, warts and all. His stare is wild sometimes and, to be honest, I reckon a lot of us miss the old Mourinho and more innocent times. When he faced off with the comedian John Bishop for Channel 4\u2019s <em>Stand up to Cancer</em>, cracking up to the question of what do you call a sheep with no legs (answer: a cloud), it might be the first time I have seen him laugh \u2013 proper laughter \u2013 since his appointment.</p> <p>Maybe, as Ferguson said, it is just an age thing and Mourinho is different now, coming into his mid-50s. Perhaps the soft-focus Mourinho will come back into view once his team have recorded their first significant win, against an established rival, since he took the job. For now, though, it does leave the suspicion that he might still be carrying the effects of his first experience of hard failure. Mourinho, you might have noticed, seldom mentions his old club by name.</p> <h2>Shifting sands of FA\u2019s Big Sam story</h2> <p>It was tempting to wonder what must have been going through Sam Allardyce\u2019s mind, sitting in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at Manchester United to watch his first match since the inglorious end to his passing appearance as England manager.</p> <p>Allardyce\u2019s place next to Sir Alex Ferguson for the game against Fenerbahce felt choreographed, a clear vote of support<strong> </strong>from probably the most influential person within the League Managers Association, and though there is a tendency in their profession to protect their own I do detect a growing amount of bewilderment throughout the sport about the FA\u2019s mixed messages.</p> <p>That was certainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/18/damian-collins-mp-parliamentary-privilege-neil-warnock\">some admission from Robert Sullivan</a>, the FA\u2019s director of strategy, during a two-hour session with the parliamentary culture, sport and media committee when the subject of third-party ownership of players came up.</p> <p>No doubt you will remember the widely reported reason for Allardyce\u2019s departure was that he advised some undercover reporters how to get around the rules. What you won\u2019t have seen, now the story is already deemed as old news, is a deluge of headlines about Sullivan\u2019s admission that the FA does not actually believe he did that.</p> <p>It has taken some time but we are finally getting there. First, it was the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, admitting his initial reaction when the story blew up was that nobody needed to lose their job. Now there is another high-ranking FA official saying the story might not actually be quite how it has been presented.</p> <p>It all comes too late for Allardyce \u2013 hired for being Big Sam, and abandoned for being Big Sam \u2013 but hopefully a few more people might include the various updates when they are retelling the story and understand now why growing numbers within the sport have jumped off the bandwagon.</p> <h2>Maybe Strachan has hidden talents</h2> <p>A lot of people are no doubt surprised that Gordon Strachan is staying in the Scotland job after another run of galling results, with the England game coming up in a few weeks and his team as far away as ever from re-establishing themselves as serious competitors on the international<strong> </strong>scene.</p> <p>With that as the backdrop, I did enjoy his acceptance speech when he was inducted into the National Football Museum\u2019s hall of fame in Manchester a few nights ago. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic,\u201d Strachan began, \u201cme, in the English hall of fame when I\u2019m just about to be booted out of the Scottish hall of fame.\u201d</p>",

Along with Labour MP Frank Field, she set up the <a href=\"https://feeding-britain.org/\">Feeding Britain inquiry</a> into hunger and food bank use. They made dozens of recommendations to the government to tackle hunger at its root cause, but two years on, many of them have fallen on deaf ears.</p> <p>Not all Tories are atrocious heartless fiends, I concede. But those who wield hunger as a weapon while claiming their own meals on expenses, are beyond satire.

Even if those belts are tightened around the necks of the desperate, swinging from the rafters, starved, broken and left for dead.</p> <p>I took a call as a trainee journalist at the <em>Southend Echo</em> in summer 2013.

Hunger, the threat of and the reality of, is used to coerce and control. That sentence alone feels paranoid, more than a smack of the mad conspiracy theorist, until you start to look harder. Half of food bank users are there as a direct result of benefit sanctions. Benefit sanctions have been applied in cases where a person has failed to turn up to the jobcentre because they are in hospital following a heart attack.

As she gorged cold baked beans from a can with her fingers, having not eaten a thing for days. The young boy turning to his mother, asking her where her dinner was. She replies that she isn\u2019t hungry, but she wasn\u2019t hungry the night before, or the night before that, and <a href=\"https://cookingonabootstrap.com/2012/07/30/hunger-hurts/\">soon he\u2019ll realise that Mummy just isn\u2019t hungry any more</a>.</p> <p>The woman beside me, a stranger, squeezed my forearm as I choked on guttural, involuntary sobs.

But how infrequently we are invited to genuinely tell our stories. Trashy chat-show sofas are all we can aspire to, not BBC news chairs. Those of us lucky enough to find a platform are torn to pieces, commentators desperate to find some mud to sling, to reassure themselves that the working classes are a subspecies to be trampled out and kept in their places.</p> <p>On Twitter, a woman going by the name of Kayceeee accused me of being self-pitying. \u201cYou have to make this all about you,\u201d she wrote.

  "<p>When Laila learnt Islamic State was holding her son in an old school less than 100 miles from the refugee camp she now calls home, she could start to dream of a rescue attempt. Then, when she heard troops were advancing on the group\u2019s last stronghold in Iraq, she even allowed herself to believe they might liberate her boy.</p> <p>Days later the advance has slowed, there has been no mention of Yazidi captives by soldiers or politicians, and her despair has returned. \u201cHope is crushed,\u201d she said. \u201cEver since we lost our kids, no one has done anything, planned anything to rescue them.\u201d</p> <p>She has no idea where her son is now, and is haunted by fears that he could be forced to die fighting for his captors or in an air strike, or be transported to Syria for new torments.</p> <p>While the fight for Mosul is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/22/attack-on-kirkuk-toxic-chemical-sulphur-fire-isis-pushes-troops-from-mosul-frontline\">key step towards dismantling Isis\u2019s self-declared caliphate</a>, for a group that has endured some of its most extreme brutality and violence, it only poses new dangers. Relatives say the liberating forces have forgotten hundreds of Yazidi women and children held by Isis as slaves in Mosul and are calling for attacking forces to add rescue missions \u2013 or at least details of where captives are held \u2013 to their battle plan. \u201cWe know there are more than 1,000 Yazidi captives \u2013 women, girls and boys \u2013 in Mosul,\u201d said Ameena Saeed Hasan, a Yazidi activist recently awarded the 2016 Human Rights First award for her work running a rescue network.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the operation to liberate Mosul started a few days ago, unfortunately there is no plan to rescue these captives: no one even asks the Yazidis where they are. It seems no one cares about these things, they just want to take control of the city.\u201d</p> <p>Many families, like Laila\u2019s, have some idea where their captured relatives are held from reports via others who have been freed, smuggled details from local sympathisers or calls on stolen mobile phones. But the coalition of Iraqi forces, peshmerga fighters, Sunni and Shia militias and their foreign backers now marching on Mosul have ignored pleas to include rescue missions in their plans or even collect details of where captives may be.</p> <p>\u201cWe usually cry when we watch the news,\u201d said Kurte, 64, who lost three sons to Isis and asked not to be named in full because a teenage relative is still missing. She feared any criticism of Isis that the group stumbled across online might be used as an excuse to add to the girl\u2019s torment. \u201cEveryone is talking about the operation in Mosul,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are afraid Isis might use our girls as shields to defend themselves, that the army might shoot the boys if they mistake them for Isis.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a4bd3ac37a5e0c4ef7ead8b5c295cee88354d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a4bd3ac37a5e0c4ef7ead8b5c295cee88354d1/0_111_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunni fighters ride a motorcycle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunni fighters ride a motorcycle down a road east of Mosul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the jihadi group swept into Yazidi villages in the foothills of the Sinjar mountain in August 2014, murdering hundreds of men and taking women and children as slaves, 2,725 have escaped or been smuggled to freedom.

The militants had already transported them to another place,\u201d says Husain Qaide, head of the government\u2019s official bureau for the rescue of Isis captives in Dohuk city, adding that Mosul and Tel Afar were two key centres for Isis\u2019s disturbing slave trade.</p> <p>He has appealed to the troops fighting around the city to block routes where they can to prevent women being moved to Syria at the end of a battle widely expected to be difficult and protracted, but to end in Isis\u2019s defeat. There have been promises of help from peshmerga, though no action so far, and other forces have not bothered to respond.</p> <p>Mosul residents confirm that enslaved Yazidis are still inside the city, where conditions for civilians are rapidly deteriorating. Some Isis fighters have already retreated to Syria, and those that remain are increasingly jumpy. \u201cThere are three Yazidi girls in our neighbourhood, in Kurdish Daesh houses,\u201d said Abu Ali, a 24-year-old local using the Arabic name for Isis.

The north Nineveh plains around Mosul were famously one of the most diverse places in the region, even if the city itself was dominated by Sunni Muslims.</p> <p>One of the big questions hanging over the operation to rout Isis is whether that reputation for coexistence can be reclaimed after two years of sectarian violence and poisonous propaganda. Many minority communities now say they fear returning without protection.</p> <p>They say Isis could not have conquered or ruled without local collaborators, who may still try to kill and harass. And a recent attack on the city of Kirkuk, more than 60 miles from Mosul and meant to be firmly under government control, was a reminder of Isis\u2019s ability to spread death and destruction far from areas they control.</p> <p>This week church bells rang out over the liberated town of Bartella for the first time in two years, and there was excitement that the famous arak drinks of nearby Bashiqa, another Christian centre, would be back in production. Still missing, though, are the worshippers and drinkers who once enjoyed them. Father Bools Mate Afram, head of the Orthodox Church in Bashiqa before Isis arrived said he would definitely return, but fears that many of his parishioners have set up new lives elsewhere, or are wary about security.</p> <p>\u201cI know many families who want to go back but they need international protection to be able to live in Nineveh plains again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He fears Mosul\u2019s community \u2013 almost as old as Christianity itself \u2013 is likely to be decimated because of worries that the violent ideology of Isis will live on. \u201cMany Christians say that under no conditions will they return to Mosul city itself because the chances that it will be a secure and safe city, even after Daesh is gone, are very weak,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yazidis, too, worry about moving back, even if Isis fighters and bombs can be cleared from their old homes. \u201cSinjar [in Nineveh province] was safe, but then everything was destroyed, and now we are afraid to go back,\u201d said Kurte, who lost her health and her confidence along with her sons.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw videos of our girls.

  "<p>It is, to put it mildly, a complex picture. Bisexual men are paid on average a third less than their heterosexual counterparts, a groundbreaking new study has revealed. But to complicate the issue, the study also shows that gay men and lesbians earn about the same as heterosexuals, as do bisexual women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/same-sex-parenting-leave-entitlement\">Same-sex parenting: knowing your leave entitlement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Professor <a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=ABRYS65\">Alex Bryson, of UCL\u2019s Institute of Education</a>, analysed the historical earnings data of 20,000 employees in almost 2,000 workplaces in Britain. The results suggest, for example, that in real life, <em>Peep Show</em>\u2019s bisexual hero Jez Usborne would lose out financially to his heterosexual flatmate, Mark Corrigan.</p> <p>In an article in the journal <em>Work, Employment &amp; Society</em>, published <a href=\"https://www.britsoc.co.uk/?tQSafariFixApplied=true\"> by the British Sociological Association,</a> Bryson explains that the average gross hourly earnings for bisexual men were \u00a39.39, compared with \u00a312.30 for heterosexual men, a gap of 31%. Conversely, average hourly earnings for gay men were \u00a313.33, \u00a31.03 more than for heterosexual men.</p> <p>The study, which drew on the Workplace Employment Relations Survey conducted in 2011 and 2012, also showed that the average hourly earnings for lesbians were \u00a39.87, similar to the \u00a39.97 earned by heterosexual women. The average hourly earnings for bisexual women were \u00a39.58.</p> <p>Bryson then crunched the data further so that he could compare people of similar ages working in similar workplaces and jobs. Here again he found what he called sizeable wage gaps between the groups.</p> <p>When comparing workers in similar occupations, the data showed that average hourly earnings for bisexual men were still 20% less than for heterosexual men, even if the workplace had an explicit equal opportunities policy on sexual orientation. That gap was found across all workplaces and occupations, and applied in London as well as non-metropolitan areas. In similar occupations, the average hourly earnings for gay men were 5% less than those of heterosexual men, but Bryson said that this result was not statistically significant.</p> <p>While Bryson\u2019s study confirmed that there was no wage differential between gay and heterosexual men or between bisexual women and heterosexual women, it also found that lesbians were paid nearly 30% less than heterosexual women if they were not employed in a workplace that had an equal opportunities policy that explicitly refers to sexual orientation.</p> <p>The study, the first of its kind carried out in Britain since the passage of anti-discrimination legislation in 2003 and 2010, drew on survey responses from 312 gay men and lesbians, 118 bisexuals, 18,635 heterosexuals and 986 people who declined to identify their sexuality. Bryson said the finding that there was no significant wage gap between gay and heterosexual men was \u201cin contrast to most previous research in this area\u201d.</p> <p>While the sample was small, he said the findings were still statistically significant. He pointed out that his work built on earlier qualitative evidence from other researchers that had shown that \u201cthe attitudes of both employers and employees towards bisexual employees lag behind the positive developments there have been with respect to perceptions of homosexual employees\u201d.</p> <p>But he conceded that the study, which did not determine whether employers knew the sexuality of employees and could therefore not prove whether they were actively discriminatory, \u201craised as many questions as it answered\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a call to get other people out there to do more research on this and see what they find,\u201d said Bryson.</p> <p>A spokesman for equality group Stonewall said there was evidence that bisexual people were treated differently. \u201cWe have seen in our own research that bi people experience specific discrimination that differs from other lesbian and gay people.</p> <p>\u201cOur Workplace Equality Index Staff Survey showed that just 11% of bi people see role models at work, compared with 53% of gay colleagues and 42% of lesbian colleagues.\u201d</p>",

Their opponents had won their previous 10 games and not lost a group match on their own ground for four years.</p> <p>The Scarlets filled the role of underdogs admirably, but at no point did they look like winning. Saracens, even when indulging in attacking plays they rarely cover in the Premiership, were always in control. Their main concern was an arm injury to their England second-row, Maro Itoje, early in the second half that required an x-ray.</p> <p>Saracens lost their captain, Brad Barritt, whose neck stiffened up in the warmup, but that did not explain a start as stuttering as it had been scintillating in Toulon. The Scarlets, who had won their previous four matches, took the lead with a seventh-minute penalty after Gareth Davies had got away with a knock-on as he contested a high kick.</p> <p>Saracens\u2019 fumbles were more conspicuous, and dropping became so catching even Itoje joined in. The double champions do not do complacency, but there was not the focus they had in France. Nick Tompkins wasted a break by overthrowing an inside pass, Alex Goode lost control of the ball when he was running with it, Sean Maitland was stripped of possession by Jonathan Davies as he struggled to find space on halfway, and Owen Farrell wasted a turnover by kicking the ball straight to Rhys Patchell.</p> <p>They had by then taken the lead after Mako Vunipola sidestepped two defenders and broke the tackles of three others and, after Patchell and Farrell exchanged penalties, extended it with an even better individual try. Tompkins, Barritt\u2019s replacement, had a wall of defenders in front of him when he received the ball 40 metres out from a ruck but, after swerving away from one, he dodged the next two before jinking past a fourth.</p> <p>The Scarlets, already missing their injured Wales centre, Scott Williams, who turned an ankle on the morning of the game, lost the full-back Liam Williams after 13 minutes, also with an ankle injury. They were muted in attack, but slowed down Saracens\u2019 possession on the floor and competed strongly, initially, in the set pieces \u2013 although, by the end of the first half, a disintegrating scrum resulted in Farrell\u2019s second penalty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/22/castres-northampton-european-champions-cup-match-report\">Northampton humiliated as David Smith inspires Castres in Champions Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were too many mistakes for the game to flow. Saracens were surprisingly loose and, although they regularly forced their way over the gainline, too many passes failed to stick. The Scarlets were hanging on at times, but after Jonathan Davies had spearheaded their first meaningful attack two minutes before the break, Patchell\u2019s fourth penalty made it 20-12 to the holders.</p> <p>The Welsh region changed approach at the start of the second half, keeping the ball in hand and forcing stress fractures in the home defence.</p> <p>Itoje, at the end of a week in which his club and England second-row partner, George Kruis, had an ankle operation, left the field grimacing after trapping his left arm in a tackle.</p> <p>The Scarlets had hope, but within six minutes it had turned to despair. First, Vunipola set up a try for Marcelo Bosch and then Tompkins seized on a loose pass for Farrell to free Chris Wyles on the overlap and secure the bonus point. They were nowhere near their best, but still far too good.</p> <p>The Scarlets caught out their opponents with some lineout moves and Aaron Shingler scored their first try from one with 21 minutes to go. Farrell responded with a penalty, but when Jonathan Davies\u2019s strength took him through two tackles, the regions sighted a bonus point. Saracens were a man down, with Ben Spencer in the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on, but Farrell spotted space and Michael Rhodes completed the scoring.</p>",
  "<p>Greater challenges are still to come this autumn, but to all intents and purposes, England\u2019s victory in Avignon was a fairly satisfying first tick in the box for Wayne Bennett as coach. His side may well look back in a month\u2019s time and see this as vital preparation for the Four Nations.</p> <p>Anglo-French games at this level have been hindered by a lack of competitiveness in recent years, best epitomised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/24/england-france-rugby-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 80-point margin of victory for England</a> when the sides met in Leigh this time last year, their sole warm-up game for the Test series against New Zealand.</p> <p>This, however, had the feel of a proper Test match and a thorough examination for England. More importantly, it was, for the most part at least, a stern challenge to efficiently prepare them for the Four Nations opener against New Zealand next Saturday in Huddersfield.</p> <p>Bennett\u2019s team selection, and indeed his interchange rotation through the game, suggested this represented an open audition for a number of places in his 17 for the first group game and there were some encouraging performances for the England coach to deliberate over in the next week.</p> <p>In the absence of captain and elder brother Sam, the Burgess twins, George and Thomas, strengthened their case for inclusion with impressive performances. As did another forward, Hull\u2019s Scott Taylor.</p> <p>The new-look half-back pairing of Luke Gale and Gareth Widdop also showed promise, but Kevin Brown\u2019s impressive cameo from the bench suggests there are still one or two difficult decisions for Bennett to make.</p> <p>However, that the French led after 25 minutes was no fluke. They took the lead when the Leigh hooker, Eloi Pelissier, darted over from close range, but that was the moment England were sparked into life. By half-time they had forged a commanding 16-point advantage courtesy of four tries, three of which came in an impressive eight-minute burst.</p> <p>Ryan Hall touched down in the corner following a fine pass from Jonny Lomax, before further tries from Daryl Clark, George Burgess and a second for Hall put the visitors in control at the interval.</p> <p>There were moments of trepidation for the visitors in the second half again, but as the French tired and their discipline lapsed, England showed their ruthless side to add three further tries in the final quarter despite the pouring rain.</p> <p>Brown\u2019s impressive stint in the halves brought him a try 12 minutes from time before Jermaine McGillvary and Widdop crossed late on, the latter thanks to a great break from Brown, to round off a successful evening for England.</p>",

  "<p>A curious little cameo always plays out at the high court at the end of a day of evidence in the trial of a person accused of a serious sexual crime against women or young children. As the van carrying the accused sweeps out of the gates, a small crowd rushes forward, spitting venom at the alleged perpetrator. The police prevent the mob rushing the vehicle, but in a half-hearted fashion. After all, they seem to be saying, you can hardly blame these good, law-abiding and child-loving citizens for venting their fury at someone who has been accused of such heinous crimes.</p> <p>You always wonder, though, what else motivates some people to make their way to the courtroom and hang around before their quarry appears. I\u2019ve been at trials like this and watched the crowd surge forward. In the main, the throng is made up of people from edgy neighbourhoods of the type that make civilised people hold their noses.</p> <p>The trial of someone accused of evil doings gives them the opportunity to say to politer society: \u201cLook, you might think we are a thoroughly bad and disreputable lot, but at least we\u2019re not as bad as him.\u201d They feel better about themselves for a little while because they realise that they are not quite so bad after all.</p> <p>It\u2019s why sex offenders are targeted by other inmates. \u201cYou might think we\u2019re hopeless criminals,\u201d say the common thieves and murderers, \u201cbut we are still a few notches higher on the food chain than these nonces.\u201d They compete with each other to land a blow on these dregs of society, knowing that someone will call the <em>Sun</em> or the <em>Star</em>, which will report that the sex offender got his \u201cjust deserts\u201d.</p> <p>In the Commons on Thursday, another mob gathered and assembled stocks, in which they placed the virtual character of Sir Philip Green <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/philip-green-labelled-billionaire-spiv-in-commons-debate-on-knighthood\" title=\"\">before spending three hours lobbing rotten food at him</a>. Green was like the former boss of the <em>Mirror</em> group of newspapers, Robert Maxwell; he was an \u201casset-stripper\u201d. He was \u201ca billionaire spiv\u201d who ought never to have received his knighthood. In fact, to many who sat on the green benches, he was worse than all these things: he had \u201cshamed British capitalism\u201d.</p> <p>The right honourable ladies and gentlemen were beside themselves with glee at being handed this rare opportunity to show the country that, whatever we might think of them, they are essentially decent coves. None of them would ever stoop to the levels of avarice that Greenp did, as he enriched himself at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/28/frank-field-accuses-sir-philip-green-of-asset-stripping-bhs\" title=\"\">expense of BHS and its 11,000 employees</a> and their hard-earned pension funds.</p> <p>The Tories, though, have a higher category of opprobrium in which to bank all the disdain they have for Green. It\u2019s the one that they use for the crime of \u201cgetting caught\u201d. Green, you see, had become too greedy and had been caught and this had led to unwelcome scrutiny of capitalism and its nature. In normal circumstances, the Tories and their camp followers in the rightwing press can brand the enemies of capitalism as \u201csocialists\u201d or \u201cthe hard left\u201d, seeking to steal the hard-earned cash of successful people and break up their assets.</p> <p>Green, though, is one of them and so he would have to be sacrificed. Best to do it in public and let people know that as well as \u201cbad capitalism\u201d there is a lot of \u201cgood capitalism\u201d and that most people are \u201cgood capitalists\u201d. Soon, everyone will forget it as quickly as they forgot about all those people and all those companies whose names appeared in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers </a>and whose money has paid for thousands of prizes at Tory fundraising dinners. These Tories at Westminster, ably supported by Labour\u2019s Blairites, are famed for giving capitalism a good name. What is it they say again when, regrettably, a company is taken over, its name changed, its historic debts unpaid, its workers sacked, its assets liquidated and the business renamed with fresh funding? \u201cA little pruning now and then is cherished by the wisest men.\u201d</p> <p>Why, the Royal Bank of Scotland avidly sought to fill its boots by going after small businesses and imposing impossible terms and conditions on loans and overdrafts in a practice known internally as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37591335\" title=\"\">\u201cthe dash for cash\u201d</a>. This bank and its brother institutions in the UK\u2019s banking cartel, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/30/astounding-failures-in-bank-of-scotland-checks-led-to-corruption-court-hears\" title=\"\">Bank of Scotland</a>, brought the nation to the brink of economic catastrophe. In the eight years since, not a single boss has faced criminal charges.</p> <p>Perhaps next month Theresa May could organise another one of these fun-filled parliamentary occasions when MPs get to pillory people and institutions. I would go further and have an annual <em>X Factor</em> and <em>Great British Bake Off</em>-themed event in which the public gets to strip a handful of prominent people and venerable businesses that have been caught with their long-johns down. We could call it The Purge. Using our telephones and smart devices, we could gather around the television and vote for all the other Philip Greens (the UK supports loads of them). First up would be the aforementioned RBS. I would propose taking away its right to use the title Royal. As we have a Bank of Scotland, that would be the end of RBS\u2026 and good riddance. This institution has cost Britain much more trouble and money than Green.</p> <p>Then, of course, we\u2019d have Tony Blair. He doesn\u2019t have any UK honours but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/14/tony-cherie-blair-property-empire-worth-estimated-27m-pounds\" title=\"\">he has loads of massive properties</a>.

  "<p>Sean Dyche knows home form will be vital to Burnley\u2019s hopes of survival and he will be delighted with a return of 10 points from five games. They have yet to pick up anything on their travels but after inflicting only a second league defeat of the season on Ronald Koeman\u2019s side they can claim home wins against Liverpool and Everton.</p> <p>Turf Moor must have some sort of hoodoo over Merseyside, though there was nothing mysterious about this result. Burnley made two clear chances and took them both. Everton had a pile of pressure but little in the way of final product. It was almost like a rerun of events in the 1-1 draw with Manchester City at the Etihad last week, though this time it was Everton who were left feeling they had been mugged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/leicester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester back on track as Shinji Okazaki shines in win over Crystal Palace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take, going home with no points, but it happens,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cFootball is really unfair sometimes. You don\u2019t always get what you deserve.\u201d</p> <p>Dyche knows all about that, after Arsenal\u2019s dubious late winner in Burnley\u2019s previous home game, but his theory that luck evens out over a season seems to be holding up. \u201cWe were a bit lucky, but we still had to earn it,\u201d the Burnley manager said. \u201cEverton are a fine side and we did well to stay in the game, not to mention scoring two terrific goals.\u201d</p> <p>Burnley were riding their luck right from the start when a Yannick Bolasie run caused panic in Everton\u2019s first attack. The ball ran free to leave Kevin Mirallas a presentable shooting opportunity from close to the penalty spot and Tom Heaton had to rescue his side with a point-blank save. The Burnley goalkeeper was in action again after a quarter of an hour, diving to his left to beat out a shot from Ross Barkley, restored to the Everton side after being left out last week at City.</p> <p>With Ben Mee foiling Romelu Lukaku in the act of shooting and Mirallas seeing another effort blocked by Scott Arfield on the edge of the penalty area, Everton must have been beginning to feel like City in that game \u2013 well on top but constantly thwarted by last-ditch defending. It appeared to be only a matter of time before Burnley conceded, yet as Koeman admitted Everton\u2019s intensity dipped after a bright start.</p> <p>Even so it was a surprise when Burnley took the lead just before the interval. The Etihad hero Maarten Stekelenburg will not be so seen to watch replays of this weekend\u2019s work. Though he did well to get down to an Arfield shot that picked up a deflection on the way through, he neither claimed the ball or pushed it to safety and ended up offering the easiest of tap-ins to Sam Vokes, who had been following up more in hope than expectation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/hull-city-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">Stoke City add to Hull\u2019s woe thanks to Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s brilliance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second half began with a sharper-looking Everton swarming around the Burnley penalty area in search of an equaliser. A cross from Mirallas was fizzed along the six-yard line a touch too firmly for Lukaku to reach, but they were once again finding gaps to exploit in the Burnley defence and were back on terms after an hour. When a positional error by Mee allowed Lukaku a clear run at goal from Idrissa Gueye\u2019s pass, the striker found Bolasie at his elbow practically nudging him off the ball in his eagerness to take over the chance.</p> <p>If that took some confidence after the finishing prowess Lukaku showed in a similar situation at City, Bolasie did not disappoint, powering into the area to shoot early and decisively past Heaton.</p> <p>That left over half an hour for Everton to come up with a winner, and even with Gerard Deulofeu sent on to join Bolasie in making life uncomfortable for the home full-backs, they could not manage it. Though Burnley rarely crossed the halfway line following the equaliser, it turned out they were merely biding their time. \u201cThey waited for one moment and got it,\u201d a rueful Koeman said.</p> <p>Burnley put together a determined attack in the final minute and for the second time caught Everton cold. Johann Berg Gudmundsson\u2019s shot crashed against the bar, and before the defence could congratulate themselves on a lucky escape, Arfield expertly stuck away the rebound. Joyous scenes for one side, dejection for the other, but what comes around goes around.</p>",
  "<p>A suspicious device discovered by counter-terror police at an address in Devon on Saturday has been declared not viable. </p> <p>Metropolitan police officers investigating a package found at a tube station in London two days earlier had been at a property in Tudor Road, Newton Abbot, when they discovered an item they deemed suspicious. <br></p> <p>People were moved out of the area but a 200-metre cordon has now been lifted, the Met said. </p> <p>In a statement, they added: \u201cWork has been carried out and it has now been confirmed the device is not viable. Work continues with Devon and Cornwall Police at the scene.\u201d </p> <p>During the evacuation, three pitches at Baker\u2019s Park in the town were cleared. </p> <p>Phil Smith, 62, who was refereeing a football match, said: \u201cWe were eight minutes into the match when suddenly a policeman appeared on the touchline and said, \u2018Sorry, you are going to have to stop playing and get out of the park \u2013 we want to land some helicopters on the football pitch.\u2019 <br></p> <p>\u201cHe said there was an incident but couldn\u2019t say anything about it. He proceeded to hustle us all off and then he went to the children\u2019s play park and hustled all them out and was trying to get the car park clear as well.\u201d </p> <p>Saturday\u2019s discovery followed a security scare at North Greenwich station close to the O2 complex in south-east London on Thursday. A controlled detonation was carried out on the item, which was reported to have been handed to a tube driver and possibly contained wires and a clock. <br></p> <p>A 19-year-old man who was Tasered and arrested on Friday afternoon on Holloway Road in north London remains in custody.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the item found on the tube is believed to have been a homemade device, possibly constructed with the intention of exploding. It was unsophisticated and the suspect has been detained under terrorism legislation covering the \u201ccommission, preparation and instigation\u201d of a violent act.<br></p> <p>It is not believed by police to have been a hoax, and the leaving of the device on a train is being treated as a deliberate act.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism investigators believe whoever was behind the incident at North Greenwich station was acting alone, a so-called \u201clone wolf\u201d, if they establish it was terrorism.</p> <p>However, they have not yet done so, and an initial check of mental health records linked to the sole suspect has led to further inquiries into material held by the health service.</p> <p>The part of the investigation covering the health history of the suspect is complicating the part of the inquiry trying to establish the motive.</p> <p>The arrest in broad daylight is unusual in a counter-terrorism investigation.</p> <p>Commuters were told to expect to see more officers, including armed police, in and around transport hubs while patrols by British Transport Police officers on the underground and at stations are in place. <br></p> <p>The current threat level for international terrorism in the UK is severe, meaning an attack is \u201chighly likely\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Deeper and deeper Sunderland dropped, until they were almost defending from their six-yard box, and there was an inevitability about the cruel blow that came from Winston Reid\u2019s left foot in the fourth minute of stoppage time. Having decided to settle for a point when a braver side might have sought to test West Ham United\u2019s nerve in a stadium that still feels a little cold and alien, they ended up with nothing. Their air of resignation about their plight is becoming suffocating, a self-fulfilling prophesy that threatens to drag them into the Championship without so much as a whimper.</p> <p>As the cliche goes, goals change games and Reid\u2019s winner certainly altered the perception of a desperately poor game. If Sunderland had held out, David Moyes would have been able to praise their resilience or Lamine Kon\u00e9\u2019s fine performance in central defence.

Slaven Bilic added another striker, Ashley Fletcher, to West Ham\u2019s attack.</p> <p>In trying to hold what they had, it was no surprise that the league\u2019s bottom side proved so butterfingered.

Bilic kept faith with the 3-4-2-1 system that worked so well at Selhurst Park with Edimilson Fernandes, a young Swiss midfielder, making his first league start in place of the suspended Aaron Cresswell on the left and Dimitri Payet and Manuel Lanzini kept popping up in dangerous positions. \u201cWe were really good,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cJust we didn\u2019t score a goal.\u201d</p> <p>Payet threatened on three occasions, curling wide after a neat exchange with Mark Noble, shooting too close to Pickford at the end of a brilliant dribble through the heart of the defence and hitting the base of the right post with an effort from 18 yards out.</p> <p>An early goal would have extinguished the uncertainty that weighs West Ham down here, but their dip in intensity let Sunderland into the game. \u201cWe are still in a bit of cramp,\u201d Bilic said, pointing to his head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/leicester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester back on track as Shinji Okazaki shines in win over Crystal Palace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Far too isolated throughout the first half, Jermain Defoe perked up.

  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up \u00a352bn of losses since it was bailed out eight years ago this month: and when it reports third-quarter results on Friday it is expected to dive even deeper into the red.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s list of woes seem neverending, ranging from a potential \u00a39bn penalty from the US authorities for mis-selling mortgage bonds a decade ago to allegations of bad treatment of small business customers. Its share price is so far below the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped \u00a345bn into the bank that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/philip-hammond-drops-plan-to-sell-cut-price-lloyds-shares-to-public\" title=\"\">the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has abandoned any attempts to sell off any more shares</a>.</p> <p>RBS\u2019s troubles have prompted one thinktank to argue that it is time for a radical strategy rethink, after the bank scaled itself down from a global business with operations in more than 50 countries to one with a flag in just 13 and a renewed focus on the UK high street.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for the UK government to put all options for the bank\u2019s future back on the table and urgently examine whether there are alternatives that could deliver better value for taxpayers and the economy,\u201d Laurie Macfarlane, an economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF), <a href=\"http://neweconomics.org/taking-control-of-rbs/\" title=\"\">argues in a paper published this weekend</a>.</p> <p>The vote for Brexit has given the NEF fresh impetus in its call for RBS to be broken up into 130 regional UK banks. Macfarlane argues that RBS could turn its focus to \u201clending for investment in production services such as manufacturing, retailing and distribution, telecoms, construction and energy\u201d, which are spread across the UK.</p> <p>\u201cTurning it into a network of local banks could therefore help boost real-economy lending while investing in communities that have been left behind by our London-centric economic model \u2013 exactly the kinds of communities who voted to leave the EU,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It is not the first time that the NEF \u2013 among others \u2013 have called for a rethink of the strategy for RBS. Sir Vince Cable called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/04/vince-cable-rbs-break-up\" title=\"\">for the dismantling of the Edinburgh-based bank when he was the business secretary</a> in the coalition government. \u201cAt the very beginning of our government, we should have gone for the breakup option,\u201d the former Liberal Democrat MP says.</p> <p>\u201cThey should be trying to create sensible smaller banks out of the greater whole,\u201d Cable adds. However, he acknowledges he has been told that the cost of breakup would be too high \u2013 illustrated by the problems RBS has experienced in trying to spin off just 300&#xa0;branches, as stipulated by the EU as punishment for receiving state aid.</p> <p>The difficulty RBS has encountered in selling off these branches, intended to be rebranded Williams &amp; Glyn, was referred to by Hammond when he announced that ambitions to sell off the remaining 73% stake had been put on the back burner. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the disposal of RBS shares at a price that recovers taxpayers\u2019 investment is not practical at the moment,\u201d Hammond said. The shares closed on Friday at 190p.</p> <p>Hammond\u2019s predecessor, George Osborne, had indicated that selling the government\u2019s stake at a profit was not a priority. He sold 5% at 330p a share \u2013 and a \u00a31bn loss \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/rbs-sell-off-george-osborne-defends-1bn-loss\" title=\"\">in August 2015</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a958f0375c6429a40cd4cd8cd32880af06c9014\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a958f0375c6429a40cd4cd8cd32880af06c9014/0_37_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross McEwan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ross McEwan, RBS\u2019s chief executive, would be unlikely to welcome a radical review of strategy for the bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Analysts hold out little expectation that the RBS share price will ever get back to 502p. According to Bloomberg, the average forecast by analysts is 180p a share \u2013 and thus, Macfarlane argues, it is time for a rethink: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that there is no way the taxpayer can make its money back by selling RBS back to the private sector.\u201d</p> <p>The Treasury, though, is unlikely to have much appetite to embark upon a strategy reversal. Osborne commissioned a review into whether RBS should be split up in 2013. It backed off radical action and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/royal-bank-scotland-losses-internal-bad-bank-rbs\" title=\"\">instead focused on putting \u00a338bn of troublesome assets into an internal bad bank</a>.</p> <p>Ross McEwan, now entering his fourth year as chief executive of RBS, would be unlikely to welcome a full-blown review either. He has embarked on an effort to put a fresh focus on NatWest \u2013 the now-revived brand name for RBS\u2019s high street banking business in England and Wales \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/royal-bank-scotland-turns-back-fred-goodwin-era-natwest-ads\" title=\"\">through a new advertising campaign</a> launched last month, and has turned the focus on the remaining businesses, which generate \u00a31bn of profit a quarter. His problem, though, is that those profits are being wiped out by tackling the so-called \u201cconduct issues\u201d of the past.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, also points out that RBS is the fastest-growing among its UK peers in terms of lending for mortgages and business. \u201cBut that is being drowned out by the bigger, more volatile, \u2018known unknowns\u2019,\u201d says&#xa0;Gordon.</p> <h2>RBS\u2019s problems</h2> <p>\u25a0 A settlement, yet to be negotiated, with the US Department of Justice over the way <strong>mortgage bonds were packaged up a decade ago and sold on</strong> to consumers. RBS has not been able to estimate the financial impact of this settlement but analysts put figures on it ranging from \u00a34bn to \u00a39bn.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>The sale of 300 branches, to be branded Williams &amp; Glyn,</strong> stipulated by the EU as punishment for the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. The bank admitted in August that there was no longer any prospect of spinning this business out onto the stock market and is looking for a trade buyer. However, the obvious bidder, the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander, is said to have pulled out.</p> <p>\u25a0 A much-delayed<strong> report into the treatment of small business customers</strong>. The investigation, commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority, began after allegations first surfaced in 2013 that the bailed-out bank was deliberately wrecking small businesses to make profits.</p>",

Not only has Trump confounded expectations all year, but like those campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union, he has closed within touching distance of his opponent several times already.</p> \n<p>Four weeks ago, on the morning of the first presidential debate, his position in key swing states was so strong that the statistician <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\">Nate Silver</a> estimated his chances of overall victory at more than 45%. After the Republican convention in July, Silver briefly projected Trump would win.<br></p> \n<p>As in the case of Brexit, average poll numbers tilted back in favour of the status quo. The murder of MP Jo Cox was credited with shocking the British electorate back into a <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/\">two-point poll lead for Remain by the time of the referendum</a>. Outrage over a tape of Trump boasting about sexual assault precipitated his latest popularity slide and left Clinton with the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">near-six-point lead she now enjoys</a>.</p> \n<p>But Britons proved less ashamed of Brexit\u2019s dark reputation once they were inside the privacy of a polling booth, eventually <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-brexit-referendum/\">voting in favour of leaving by a nearly four-point margin</a>. What if US pollsters are missing shy Republicans? Or failing to account for Trump\u2019s ability to inspire people to turn out in greater numbers?</p> \n<p>It is certainly a complacency Democrats wish to avoid. Fortunately for them, this may be where the similarities with Brexit begin and end.</p> \n<h2><strong>Playing the system</strong></h2> \n<p>The biggest difference can be seen as a combination of America\u2019s voting system and its political tribes.</p> \n<p>A simple majority of the national popular vote was enough to rewrite Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, but US presidents are required to win a majority of electoral college votes, which can be decisively achieved with a series of wins at the state level. In 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan secured 97.6% of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_Electoral_College_margin\">electoral college votes</a> with 58.8% of the popular vote, because Walter Mondale lost every state except Minnesota.</p> \n<p>Even if she defeats Trump in Republican strongholds like Texas, Utah, Arizona and Georgia, Clinton is unlikely to ever match Richard Nixon\u2019s landslide over George McGovern in 1972 or Lyndon Johnson\u2019s epic defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964, for the simple reason that America has become more politically polarised in the years since.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a337725e0611f6cd2a72299d0010eb75d507487\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a337725e0611f6cd2a72299d0010eb75d507487/0_23_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman is moved to tears as Trump takes the stage at a campaign rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman is moved to tears as Trump takes the stage at a campaign rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But even a relatively small lead in the popular vote can translate into a decisive win, as Barack Obama found when he went into the 2012 election just 0.2% ahead of Mitt Romney in the polls yet emerged with a four-point majority in the popular vote and nearly two-thirds of the electoral college.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

Nonetheless, projections point to a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/senate-update-the-last-week-has-been-very-kind-to-democrats-hopes-for-a-majority/\">growing likelihood</a> that Trump\u2019s woes will help Democrats take back the Senate and a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/12/heres-how-good-a-shot-democrats-have-of-actually-winning-the-house/\">small but rising possibility</a> the same could happen in the House of Representatives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/22/trump-the-world-hates-obama-and-the-us-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58jbm\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2828839\" data-video-name=\"Trump: the world hates Obama and the US \u2013&nbsp;video\" data-video-provider=\"AP|POOL|\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580b2022e4b0d7abfb253893\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/22/161022worldhatesob_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/22/161022worldhatesob.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/22/161022worldhatesob_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/22/trump-the-world-hates-obama-and-the-us-video\">Trump: the world hates Obama and the US \u2013 video</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Demographic changes also suggest a clear win for Democrats on 8 November. The white men who favour Trump may do so in part out of resentment that they no longer control the country so completely as they did, but the Democrats\u2019 far larger lead among female, African American, Asian and Latino voters is likely to only grow as the country diversifies. As each side adopts the insults of the other as a badge of pride, Clinton\u2019s \u201cnasty women\u201d and their allies simply outnumber Trump\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d.</p> \n<p>Charts reveal other lines dividing the US in 2016. Educational attainment, often a proxy for class in a country that doesn\u2019t like to talk about it, is particularly indicative. College-educated voters flock to Clinton\u2019s message of optimism about the economy while those without degrees are among the biggest supporters of Trump\u2019s thesis that the system is rigged.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s comments about race and immigration have also polarised voters, driving non-whites back toward the Democratic coalition built by Obama but appearing to shock some white voters less.</p> \n<p>And, if it is about anything, this election is about gender. Although men overall may now lean narrowly toward Clinton after a month of Trump\u2019s misogynistic outbursts, it is striking that the average white American male is still pro-Republican.</p> \n<h2><strong>The unpopularity contest</strong></h2> \n<p>Of course, opinion pollsters can get demographics wrong too. Polls that listen to registered voters are better predictors of electoral outcomes than polls that listen to anyone who\u2019s willing to talk. But those polls still aren\u2019t perfect, partly because before voters actually vote, they\u2019re just people and people change their minds. Especially a long time before election day.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s why now, with just over two weeks to go until the US votes, the polls are far more accurate than they were months ago. A lot has happened over those months \u2013 two party conventions, three debates and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">10 allegations</a> of sexual assault against one candidate. After all the boosts and dips, the overall effect has been that Trump has fallen in popularity while Clinton has risen.</p> \n<p>Or, to be more specific, the polls show that Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">unpopularity</a> has risen while Clinton\u2019s has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">fallen</a>. Both candidates are disliked by the majority of Americans.</p> \n<p>But it is not just Brexit and Romney that have given polling methodology a bad name. There has been a string of polling failures: the Israeli election, the Scottish independence referendum and the last UK general election. If anything, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">problems of polling</a> have got worse since those votes, partly because it is getting even harder to contact people who are willing to share their voting intention.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/democrats-texas-hillary-clinton-polls-donald-trump\">'It's surreal': is a Democratic uprising afoot deep in the heart of Texas?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, though polls will not perfectly predict the US election, state by state and down to the decimal point, they are likely to accurately guess who will win nationally, especially if Clinton has a large enough lead.</p> \n<p>The accuracy of polling in this election will hinge on the margin of error. Buried in the methodology of most polls is a note that says something along the lines of \u201cmargin of error: \u00b1 4%\u201d. It means if you repeated the poll 100 times with different respondents each time, the overall results would be within 4% of the results in at least 95 of those 100 polls.</p> \n<p>Right now, Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">polling average is 48% and Trump\u2019s is 42%</a>. If the margin of error on those numbers is \u00b14%, that means Clinton\u2019s support could be as low as 44% or as high as 52% with Trump\u2019s somewhere between 38% and 46%. The bigger the gap between the two candidates, the less the margin of error matters.</p> \n<p>The margin of error in this election could well be more than 4%, because polling has become less accurate. For Clinton supporters to really sit back and relax, the candidate needs to widen her lead to the extent that even if the polls are wrong on the numbers, they are still right about the result.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"Membership Drive\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">Membership Drive</a> \n</figure>",
  "<p>According to more than one member of Gibraltar\u2019s business community, it felt \u201clike someone had died\u201d. The day after Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, this outpost of Albion on Spain\u2019s southern tip was in shock.</p> <p>The Rock\u2019s residents voted 96% to remain. Its flourishing economy, built around financial services, e-commerce and online gaming, is based on the single market and free movement: every day, nearly half its entire workforce \u2013 12,000 Spanish and other EU nationals \u2013 commute across the border.</p> <p>Worse, Madrid has made it clear that it views the UK\u2019s eventual departure from the European Union as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-16/brexit-hands-spain-chance-to-reclaim-gibraltar-margallo-says\" title=\"\">its best chance in three centuries</a> to reclaim sovereignty over a territory it has regretted ceding to Britain ever since 1713.</p> <p>Alarmed by the government\u2019s apparent preference for a hard Brexit, prioritising immigration controls and judicial sovereignty over single market access, Gibraltar\u2019s leaders \u2013 and its businesses \u2013 are scrambling to devise a Plan B.</p> <p>\u201cI think a hard Brexit would be very, very challenging to the economic model that has been the source of our prosperity for 30 years,\u201d Gibraltar\u2019s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, said in an interview.</p> <p>So while Theresa May talks of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\" title=\"\">great repeal bill</a> to end the authority of EU law in the UK, Picardo is working on what he terms a great continuation bill \u2013 aiming to preserve as many of Gibraltar\u2019s EU advantages as he can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0d1b57dde5f23d4df650db335d6a699974b71d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0d1b57dde5f23d4df650db335d6a699974b71d0/0_89_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gibraltar\u2019s chief minister Fabian Picardo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gibraltar\u2019s chief minister Fabian Picardo \u2018will be looking for a new relationship with the EU\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That will not, he concedes, be easy, and may even entail trying to negotiate a separate relationship with the EU. \u201cOur reality is different: we are part of the physical continent of Europe,\u201d the chief minister said. \u201cSo yes, we\u2019ll be looking for a relationship with the EU that may differ from the UK\u2019s, perhaps an associate-style status. There are models: Andorra, Greenland, Liechtenstein. As part of the UK\u2019s exit, we\u2019d like an agreement to continue to give us single market access, and freedom of movement.\u201d</p> <p>Drawn by the territory\u2019s position in the EU, a 10% corporate tax rate and ready access to regulators, nearly 500 financial services firms have set up shop in Gibraltar, including subsidiaries of major British insurers such as Hastings and Admiral. The territory has also carved itself a niche in the online gaming business: it hosts 35 big-name operators, employing more than 3,500 people. All that has helped the Rock\u2019s economy to near double-digit growth \u2013 even during the euro crisis \u2013 and boosted employment by more than 50% in a decade.</p> <p>Sitting in the handsome government office building off Main Street, Picardo said the greatest single threat would be if Spain closed the border, as it did in 1969 during the Franco dictatorship, leaving residents effectively stranded unless they used boats or planes. (It was not fully reopened until 1985, when Spain wanted to join the EU.)</p> <p>But this is not the only way in which Spain could make life difficult. Three years ago, during a particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/04/gibraltar-comments-madrid-london-uk-spain\" title=\"\">bitter row over territorial waters</a>, Spanish authorities intensified border checks, creating traffic jams hours long at the crossing. Eventually the European commission had to step in.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the UK calls uncontrolled immigration, Gibraltar calls the essential flow of workers,\u201d Picardo said. So what we are working on now is how we can ensure our job market stays as open as it is now, for people who have the right, as EU nationals, to work in Gibraltar.\u201d</p> <p>Would Spain take that step? Picardo said he could not imagine that \u201cin the 21st century, a democratic Spanish government is seriously going to say, that if Gibraltar leaves the EU it will shut the gates\u201d. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has insisted Britain will maintain \u201can implacable, marmoreal and rock-like resistance\u201d to any change in Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06285c538c9e50a78abf6ba6ea388165145445e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06285c538c9e50a78abf6ba6ea388165145445e0/0_34_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spanish foreign minister Jose  Garcia-Margallo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Garcia-Margallo ays Gibraltar\u2019s access to the EU will come only via shared sovereignty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Nazca/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Madrid may have other ideas. Johnson\u2019s equally bombastic counterpart, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo, who earlier this month threatened to \u201cplant his flag\u201d on the enclave, has repeatedly said Gibraltar\u2019s only post-Brexit access to the single market will come through shared sovereignty. Spain, he also likes to recall, can veto any trade deal between the UK and the EU. The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/mariano-rajoy-if-uk-leaves-eu-so-does-gibraltar-brexit-theresa-may-single-market/\" title=\"\">reportedly told May in Madrid last week</a> that once the UK abandons free movement and the single market, Gibraltar will have to do so too \u2013 unless it agrees to joint rule.</p> <p>The nightmare, many here agree, would be if, some years down the line, Madrid were to force London to choose between Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty and \u2013 for example \u2013 enhanced access for UK firms to the EU single market.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the $64,000 question,\u201d said Marcus Killick of leading Gibraltar law firm Isolas. \u201cIf there\u2019s a deal that\u2019s pivotal to the City of London and requires Spanish support, how far will the UK government go to defend Gibraltar? How deep is that loyalty, really?\u201d</p> <p>For the time being, such concerns seem some way off. \u201cThings are going to get tough,\u201d said Edward Macquisten of the Gibraltar chamber of commerce, in his office above the main Casemates Square. \u201cBut look, this is a small, agile, adaptable jurisdiction: we can change direction fast. The people here are not unused to uncertainty \u2013 we\u2019ve been living with it for 300 years. If one market closes, we\u2019ll find others.\u201d</p> <p>Killick, who has set up a Brexit support unit for his clients, was similarly optimistic: \u201cA shock followed by a reinvention can be a powerful thing. When the meteorite hit the earth, it was the dinosaurs that died out, not the mice.\u201d</p> <p>So businesses based on the Rock are urgently exploring alternatives. The online gaming industry will not be hit: it has never benefited from a single market as the EU requires companies to negotiate national licences. Others, though, may now switch their focus back to the UK \u2013 in effect reinventing themselves as entry points for European firms keen to access the post-Brexit UK market via Gibraltar\u2019s attractive tax and regulatory regime and lower start-up costs. That will require new laws in Gibraltar and Britain, but looks as though it can be done.</p> <p>A second option could be to move some operations to another EU state. Steve Quinn, who founded Quest, now Gibraltar\u2019s largest insurance management firm, said his clients who operate mainly in the UK market \u201cwill probably not be affected even by a hard Brexit, as long as bilateral trade is formalised\u201d. But those selling into the EU will be looking for solutions. \u201cSome are already talking to authorities in places like Malta, Dublin, Luxembourg, the Baltic states: places that are tax-benign and in the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Cowan, managing director of the fast-growing Gibraltar Stock Exchange, which has helped borrowers raise \u20ac400m of investment capital so far this year, said its business model had been \u201cbuilt on passporting \u2013 being able to sell, say, a UK carpet manufacturer\u2019s bonds into every country across the EEA\u201d.</p> <p>Brexit would force the GSX to reconfigure, Cowan said, possibly by opening a subsidiary in another EU state \u2013 he\u2019s already sounded out Malta \u2013 and almost certainly by passporting into the UK.</p> <p>\u201cPost-Brexit,\u201d Cowan said, \u201cif you\u2019re a German corporate wanting to market to the UK, you\u2019ll have to either seek approval from the FCA in London \u2013 or come to us. As a jurisdiction, Gibraltar is likely to be faster, more user-friendly and more competitive on price. We sit down the corridor from the regulator. Issues can be resolved fast.\u201d</p> <p>Many here believe there is broad support for Gibraltar\u2019s cause in Brussels and other EU capitals \u2013 and mounting frustration with Spain for seeking to profit from Brexit. Macquisten said: \u201cGibraltar is almost a model of what the EU set out to achieve: cross-border cooperation, jobs for EU citizens, economic growth, full compliance \u2026 Surely the EU won\u2019t want that to end, Gibraltar to be punished? Especially when we showed our commitment to the EU ideal so overwhelmingly last June?\u201d</p> <p>But it may not be down to Gibraltar, or to London. \u201cSpain,\u201d <a href=\"http://en.mercopress.com/2016/10/19/spain-anticipates-closed-frontier-if-gibraltar-does-not-accept-joint-sovereignty\" title=\"\">Garc\u00eda-Margallo reiterated last week</a>, \u201cwill never give up its claim\u201d to the Rock \u2013 and free movement across the border would \u201cautomatically end\u201d unless Gibraltarians accepted shared sovereignty.</p> <h2>The meaning of leaving: on life, visas and health</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dddc7ef2056cc1550d1f4086c678b56a1df4a82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dddc7ef2056cc1550d1f4086c678b56a1df4a82/0_147_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British expats in Benalmadena, Spain:\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British expats in Benalmadena, Spain: no one yet knows yet quite how daily life there will be affected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brexit could affect the residence rights of the 1.2 million British citizens who live in other EU countries, as well as their ability to work visa-free and access free healthcare \u2013 but no one yet knows how.</p> <p>With article 50 yet to be triggered and the UK government refusing to reveal its hand, all that can be said with certainty is that issue will form a important part of the negotiations due to begin before April next year.</p> <p>Lawyers say it\u2019s unlikely anyone already living abroad will be kicked out, particularly if they\u2019ve lived there legally for five years (the point at which they can become long-term residents, a status granted to non-EU citizens, which British nationals will be). Whatever is agreed will mostly be reciprocal, so if Britain requires residence permits, proof of income and work visas for new EU migrants, this will almost certainly apply to British citizens moving to the EU.</p> <p>Inheritance and tax laws may change, although existing property rights and UK pensions \u2013 which are paid anywhere in the world \u2013 are unlikely to be affected. But British workers may be hit by rules in more than half of EU states that say a non-EU citizen can be hired only if no EU candidate is found.</p> <p>The Spanish government, for example, has already suggested that after Brexit, the UK will have to pay the healthcare costs of Brits living in Spain. For the time being, almost nothing is certain \u2013 which explains the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/19/huge-increase-britons-seeking-citizenship-eu-states-brexit-looms\" title=\"\">huge rise in Britons abroad seeking EU citizenship</a>.</p>",

Many wardens simply put their facilities on lockdown to forestall the action completely. </p> <p>Alex Friedman, the managing editor of Prison Legal News and an associate director of the Human Rights Defense Center, a group which advocates for prisoner rights, estimated that about 24,000 inmates took part, making it the largest in history. Cole Dorsey, an organizer for IWOC based in Oakland, put the number of participants as high as 72,000.</p> <p>\u201cThe 13th amendment didn\u2019t really abolish slavery,\u201d said Friedman, who himself spent 10 years imprisoned in Tennessee. \u201cIt permitted exceptions; it restricted, not abolished, slavery in the US.\u201d </p> <p>For Friedman, the 9 September strike is part of a groundswell movement among America\u2019s 2.3 million incarcerated people which compares to the civil rights movement or the fight for LGBT equality.<br></p> <p>\u201cThese things take generations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the [9 September] work strike is part of a continuum: they acknowledge, yeah, they\u2019re prisoners, they\u2019re serving their time, but that doesn\u2019t mean they should be exploited, used as slaves, denied medical treatment, held in solitary.\u201d</p> <p>Most workers in the South Carolina prison system \u2013 as in several other states including Texas \u2013 are paid nothing for most of the work they are forced to do. In other states, some may earn between 30 cents and a dollar an hour, which can be redeemed at the prison commissary, which Friedman likened to the company store in John Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes Of Wrath. </p> <p>\u201cIn Tennessee, prison wages start at 17 cents an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re on the lowest end of the scale and want to send a letter to your family, you have to work three hours to be able to afford a stamp.\u201d</p> <p>The California prison system made $58m profit from the work of prison inmates in the financial year 2014-15, according to <a href=\"http://solidarityresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Prison-Strike-in-California-10-07-16.pdf\">a study by the Solidarity Research Center</a>, which also found that 4,000 incarcerated workers earn $2 a day fighting California wildfires. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9e977e3a8a28641548d6da793672b14050348034\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e977e3a8a28641548d6da793672b14050348034/0_0_640_800/400.jpg\" alt=\"Pamphlet in support of the nationwide strike in support of prison workers\u2019 rights in the US.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pamphlet in support of the nationwide strike in support of prison workers\u2019 rights in the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IWOC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The California Prison Industry Authority, which manages manufacturing, service, and agricultural work in 34 state prisons, did not respond to a request from the Guardian to confirm these figures, and a spokesperson for the California department of corrections told the Guardian that they had \u201cno reported strike activities or work stoppage in our state prisons\u201d.</p> <p>This claim was directly contradicted by the IWOC.<strong> </strong>Many inmates in the California system have only just ended a hunger strike, Dorsey said, while 300 others in the Santa Clara main jail have just started a second wave.<br></p> <p>In Merced, Castillo and more than 100 of his fellow inmates went on hunger strike between 9 and 19 September, then again between 30 September and 17 October. The specific demands of the strikers varied from prison to prison; in Merced, Castillo and his comrades had a specific sartorial grievance.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is mass segregation here,\u201d Castillo told the Guardian over a payphone from Merced. \u201cWe\u2019re general population, but they\u2019re housing us separate from the general population, [and dressing us] in green and white stripes.\u201d </p> <p>That outfit is used for gang members, Castillo said, and it means that those in green stripes are viewed by judges and jurors as dangerous gang members. \u201cThey\u2019re giving us maximum sentences rather than minimum sentences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting harsher sentences because of our clothing.\u201d</p> <p>Nationwide, the striking inmates, some of whom are still taking part in ongoing hunger strikes, say they have have faced retaliation. Often, they are placed in solitary confinement or face withdrawal of privileges; contraband phones can be confiscated, cutting lines of communication with the outside world.</p> <p>Others say they have lost visitation rights or other privileges; some missed court dates or medical appointments because of lockdown or being placed in solitary. Taking part in the strikes can also affect a prisoner\u2019s possibility of parole.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhat they do is lock you down and replace you with other prisoners who are willing to work,\u201d Tony, in South Carolina, said. \u201cAnd \u2026 if you\u2019re not working on one of these slave jobs you lose all privileges. You have to be doing something or you face punishment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The bars against participation in industrial action are much higher in prison, where there are no national legal protections and guards can often act arbitrarily, violently, and with impunity \u2013 another key part of the prisoners\u2019 demands is an end to excessive force by prison officers. </p> <p>Castillo, who is still awaiting trial, said that in June his hand was broken in 10 places during a raid when he was shot with a \u201cblock gun\u201d \u2013 a shotgun-like weapon which fires wooden blocks. His leg and ear were also damaged.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/06/13th-review-ava-duvernay-jailing-black-men-netflix-selma-13th-constitutional-amendment-slavery\">13th review \u2013 Ava DuVernay's angry, persuasive film about the jailing of black men</a> </p> </aside>  <p>IWOC\u2019s Dorsey said that as well as block guns, in some prisons dogs had been deployed to control striking inmates.

She\u2019s quite a vibrant woman who likes to do things, and this was her way of going out.\u201d</p> <p>At 15, he won the Philip Morris foundation scholarship to the School of American Ballet (\u201cMy mother was like, \u2018Oh, you must be quite good, then\u2019\u201d) and in New York, for the first time in his life, he heard people refer to him as \u201cthe black one\u201d. Did that hurt? \u201cNo. My mother had always told me I was beautiful and amazing. I thought it was their problem. I never felt negative about being black. I\u2019ve always thought, \u2018I look great, I can dance, I\u2019ve got some rhythm. Things are on the up and up! I\u2019m just going to go home, put on some Marvin Gaye and have a blast!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cef560a9cf083b34f7b48dd0c4c801c91ead4f18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cef560a9cf083b34f7b48dd0c4c801c91ead4f18/0_232_4075_4903/831.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Underwood\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I never felt negative about being black.

He tells me about something that happened on tour in Mississippi: he and Copeland were entering their hotel at the same time as a homeless man was being denied access. The man watched them go in and then screamed, \u201cYou won\u2019t let me in, but you let these fucking niggers in?\u201d Underwood remembers the sense of shock. \u201cI felt singled out and defeated. In that moment, I wasn\u2019t just one of the dancers.\u201d</p> <p>Until recently, ballet shoes for black feet didn\u2019t exist \u2013 the \u201cflesh tone\u201d shoe was always a pale pink or beige \u2013 and Underwood\u2019s pre-show ritual used to include a laborious 45 minutes spent caking his \u201cnude\u201d ballet pumps with dark makeup. Once, in Italy, he failed to find the right makeup and struggled to cover his shoes for a performance. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/5UE6auBFO9/\">I posted an Instagram to some companies</a>, suggesting there should be different coloured shoes. A Russian ballet company replied, saying, \u2018You\u2019re black. You should wear black shoes.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But one major manufacturer, Bloch, responded by creating a line in darker tones, including one co-designed with Underwood, which they call Eric Tan. Underwood has been dancing in them <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BC0vjC3l_B_/\">since March this year</a>.</p> <p>He believes that visibility is the best way to get more diversity in ballet. \u201cIt\u2019s about having ballet on your radar, and it\u2019s important to see people who reflect you doing it. Ballet can be incredibly elitist and expensive. Unless you can afford those luxuries, you don\u2019t see it as being a possibility.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"032b37eb89b6bc66d7c9aa87003578bdc75f66cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/032b37eb89b6bc66d7c9aa87003578bdc75f66cc/0_0_4724_4975/950.jpg\" alt=\"Jumper, trousers and trainers all Polo Ralph Lauren.\" width=\"950\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All clothes by <a href=\"http://ralphlauren.co.uk/\">Polo Ralph Lauren</a>, available from the new flagship store on Regent Street, London.

Out of 60 boys, he identified two whom he thought had real talent. One of the mothers went on to enrol her son in classes, but the other mother was immovable in her view that boys don\u2019t do ballet. \u201cShe said, \u2018His father wants him to play football. He doesn\u2019t dance.\u2019\u201d Underwood shrugs: \u201cPeople ask me why there aren\u2019t more dancers of colour, or boys, and it\u2019s about the parents.\u201d</p> <p>His own father\u2019s reaction to his dancing was positive. \u201cMy father was quite a shy man. He said, \u2018So I hear you\u2019re dancing?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Well, as long as you\u2019re happy\u2019. That was the end of that.\u201d</p> <p>Underwood joined the Royal Ballet in 2006, and in 2008 became a soloist and moved to London; he recently became a British citizen. He says he loves London\u2019s diversity, and now feels like a visitor when he goes back to the States to visit his mother, who has moved to North Carolina. His brother is now a furniture builder and his sister a teacher.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When people are getting shot outside your house, your priorities are different</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recently, Underwood has begun to look beyond dancing. \u201cI love dancing,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut I want to be able to stop early enough that I can reinvent myself.\u201d Last year, he signed to the same talent agency as Alexa Chung, and has since been photographed by David Bailey (a full-frontal nude for British GQ); <a href=\"http://www.vogue.it/moda/cover-fashion-stories/2016/02/09/laugh-by-mario-testino/\">Testino snapped him with Kate Moss for Italian Vogue</a>, an experience he describes as \u201cin-cre-dible. She knew every angle. It was genius.\u201d</p> <p>He has loved fashion from a young age, and cites model <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Beckford\">Tyson Beckford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVbQo3IOC_A\">the Fresh Prince</a> as early style icons. \u201cI think of clothing as costume. One day I can be punk, and another I can be Ralph Lauren on a yacht.\u201d Today, he\u2019s wearing a maroon, button-down shirt that\u2019s more normcore than out-and-out fashion. \u201cI\u2019m in a classic look because of work,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>You\u2019d think a lifetime of focusing on his body and what it can do, as both a dancer and a model, would make Underwood self-critical, but he\u2019s too well-adjusted for that. \u201cWhen people are getting shot outside your house, your priorities are different,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about having a bit of fat under your leg.\u201d</p> <p>But he once described training as \u201cnine hours staring at your faults\u201d, dancing in a room full of mirrors. What does that do to a person? \u201cIt can be a great thing or it can destroy you. I think it\u2019s important to know who you are when you\u2019re looking into that mirror.\u201d </p>",

In August, the pharmaceutical company Insys Therapeutics also cited concerns for child safety when, <a href=\"http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-drug-firm-insys-makes-synthetic-pot-compound-spends-big-to-defeat-legal-pot-8628614\">with a $500,000 contribution, it became the largest donor to Arizona\u2019s anti-legalization drive</a>. But their stated concerns have raised a few eyebrows across the state. Insys manufactures Subsys, a prescription painkiller derived from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/what-is-fentanyl-prince-deadly-overdose\">fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine</a>.<br></p> <p>And although child safety is a legitimate concern as states legalize cannabis \u2013 in Colorado, <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2534480\">child emergency room visits for marijuana intoxication have increased</a> <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2534480\">to 2.3 per 100,000 kids aged 10 and under since legalization in 2014, up from from 1.2 per 100,000 kids</a> before that \u2013 accidental ingestion of pharmaceuticals sends about 318 per 100,000 kids aged five years and under to the emergency room, <a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED.pdf\">according to government figures</a>. The frequency of hospital visits from kids accidentally taking narcotic painkillers have increased 225% between 2004 and 2011, the US Department of Health and Human Services said.<br></p> <p>Instead, critics say, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/pharma-opioid-marijuana/\">the Insys contribution in Arizona is a ploy to protect market share</a>. And it mirrors other large donations to anti-marijuana campaigns by pharmaceutical and alcohol companies that fear the growing clout of legal marijuana. In November, five states \u2013 Arizona, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and California \u2013 could <a href=\"http://norml.org/legal/legalization\">join four others that have already legalized recreational cannabis</a>. Currently, 25 states permit the plant\u2019s medicinal use. They represent a national marijuana market that will top $6.7bn in sales this year, according to the research firm ArcView Group, and $20bn annually by 2020.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen a more active opposition from the pharma industry,\u201d said Amanda Reiman, manager of marijuana law and policy at the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group that promotes drug reform. \u201cResearch conducted by myself and others shows that medical cannabis patients are substituting cannabis for pharmaceuticals at a very high rate, and for alcohol at a pretty high rate as well.\u201d<br></p> <p>Indeed, alcohol and pharma groups have been quietly backing anti-marijuana efforts across the country. Besides Insys, the Arizona Wine and Spirits Wholesale Association gave one of the largest donations to the state\u2019s anti-legalization campaign <a href=\"http://apps.azsos.gov/apps/election/cfs/search/PublicReports/2016/D7C794C8-8150-4B0A-A46E-E31E86C42564.pdf\">when it paid $10,000 to Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy</a>. And the Beer Distributors PAC <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/09/14/beer-pot-ballot/\">recently donated $25,000 to the Campaign for a Safe and Healthy Massachusetts</a>, making it the state\u2019s third-largest backer of the opposition to recreational cannabis.<br></p> <p>Purdue Pharma and Abbott Laboratories, makers of the painkiller OxyContin and Vicodin, respectively, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/anti-pot-lobbys-big-bankroll/\">are among the largest contributors to the Anti-Drug Coalition of America, according to a report in the Nation</a>. And the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, considered one of marijuana\u2019s biggest opponents, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000504&amp;year=2015\">spent nearly $19m on lobbying in 2015</a>.</p> <p>The plant\u2019s threat to the alcohol industry is difficult to chart. <a href=\"http://www.dmarkanderson.com/Medical_Marijuana__Accidents_and_Alcohol_7-8-13_v1.pdf\">Some researchers claim consumers substitute alcohol with marijuana</a> when the plant is legalized. But in Colorado, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2014, that scenario has not played out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/31/alcohol-industry-sales-marijuana-colorado\">Alcohol sales there have increased since cannabis legalization</a>, according to state tax data. And despite the alcohol industry\u2019s opposition to cannabis in Massachusetts and Arizona, in neighboring Nevada the alcohol industry is among the biggest donors to the pro-legalization drive. It has given nearly $88,000 to the pro-legalization campaign, according to the Center for Public Integrity. That\u2019s because approval of Nevada\u2019s initiative would hand alcohol distributors the sole right to sell cannabis for the first 18 months.<br></p> <p>For big pharma, however, an expanding amount of data explains their fears. <a href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/1898878\">Opiate overdoses dropped by roughly 25% in states that have legalized medical marijuana</a> compared to states that have prohibited sales of the plant, according to a 2014 study from the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study implies that <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/states-medical-marijuana-painkiller-deaths-drop-25-266577\">people could be using medical marijuana to treat their pain rather than opioid painkillers</a>, or they\u2019re taking lower doses. And research published this year by the University of Georgia shows that <a href=\"http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/35/7/1230.abstract\">Medicare prescriptions for drugs used to treat chronic pain and anxiety dropped in states that have legalized medical marijuana</a>. Medicare saved roughly $165m in 2013, according to the study, which estimated that expenditures for Medicare Part D, the portion of the government-funded health insurance program that subsidizes prescription drug costs, would drop by $470m annually if medical marijuana were legalized nationally.<br></p> <p>Combine this data with the growing cost of prescription drugs \u2013<a href=\"http://lab.express-scripts.com/lab/insights/drug-options/protection-against-continued-drug-price-inflation\"> brand-name drug prices have increased 127% since 2008</a>, according to the pharmacy benefit management company Express Scripts \u2013 and an opioid epidemic that is the leading cause of accidental deaths in the US, and it\u2019s easy to understand why pharmaceutical companies are closely monitoring cannabis legalization.<br></p> <p>But they might be fighting a losing battle. In Colorado alone, <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/09/colorado-marijuana-sales-skyrocket-to-more-than-996-million-in-2015/\">marijuana sales reached $996m in 2015 and raked in $135m in tax revenue</a>. Towns have earmarked the money for road improvements, recreation centers and scholarships for low-income students. With that much money in play, investors and special interest groups have begun to flex their muscles. Pro-pot lobbyists in Denver now battle on equal footing with their counterparts in the pharmaceutical and alcohol industries.<br></p> <p>\u201cTheir [marijuana] lobby has grown quite a bit, and they have become increasingly sophisticated,\u201d said Colorado state senator Pat Steadman, who was heavily involved in the implementation of Amendment 64, the measure that legalized recreational marijuana in 2014. \u201cThey\u2019re investing more money in government relations, elections, marketing and public relations.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/28/tattoo-ink-cancer-regulation\">Tattoo ink contains cancer-causing chemicals \u2013 so why isn't it regulated?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And pro-pot political action committees such as <a href=\"http://norml.org/normlpac\">the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) PAC</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.mpp.org/about/mpp-pac/\">Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) PAC</a> are putting these resources into action by supporting state and federal candidates who are committed to legalizing medical marijuana and regulating recreational cannabis like they do alcohol. That includes California, where the lobbying arm of the Drug Policy Alliance, a group that works to change drug laws, <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)#Campaign_finance\">has backed November\u2019s recreational legalization measure with $4.47m</a>, according to government records.<br></p> <p>Legalization proponents in California have raised nearly $18m, compared to the opposition\u2019s $250,000 in fundraising. In a sign of broad approval \u2013 and likely passage, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-pot-survey-20160913-snap-story.html\">according to polls</a> \u2013 Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, the California Democratic Party and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of California all back the measure. If approved, Proposition 64 would result in $1.4bn in annual revenues within the first year alone, <a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2016/Prop64-110816.pdf\">according to legislative analysts</a>, which is <a href=\"http://www.thecannabist.co/2016/08/23/california-marijuana-market-report/61494/\">expected to balloon to $6.5bn by 2020</a>. In other words, legalization in the Golden State \u2013 with its 39 million residents and the world\u2019s sixth largest economy \u2013 would triple the size of the country\u2019s legal cannabis market.<br></p> <p>\u201cGiven California\u2019s size, given its history as the source of legal and illegal marijuana for California and much of the nation, the fact that it\u2019s coming online changes the equation significantly,\u201d said Sam Kamin, a professor of marijuana law and policy at the University of Denver.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes it harder for federal prohibition to continue, and I think it accelerates a push for legislative change at the federal level.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The very inclusion of a specific sustainable development goal (SDG) to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/\">reduce inequality</a> is a gamechanger.<br></p> <p>For a generation or more, any serious mainstream discussions of inequality had been off the table. In the formulation of the millennium development goals all the key players knew that income or asset inequality was to be kept off the agenda. Governing elites and international organisations would hardly acknowledge it as a relevant concept for development, often dismissing inequality focused academics and activists as hard-leftists. Many commentators vehemently argued that inequality promoted competition, by reducing inefficiency, which in turn created jobs and profit.</p> <p>The global financial crash of 2008 and the fallout that continues to affect so many people, has changed the conversation. A small group of people made vast profits while tens of millions lost their jobs, houses and dignity. The evidence of the damage to society caused by high levels of inequality has been re-examined, while new research and popular <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/01/62-people-own-same-as-half-world-says-oxfam-inequality-report-davos-world-economic-forum\">campaigns</a> have seen a new consensus form relatively rapidly. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/05/sustainable-development-goals-most-difficult-targets\">How can we reach an SDG target when we're moving in the wrong direction?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett set the ball rolling in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/13/the-spirit-level\">The Spirit Level</a>. They argued that rising inequality in rich nations negatively impacts on our physical and mental health, education, experience of work and even life satisfaction, and is associated with the use of illegal drugs and mental illness. Detailed studies by <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=780485\">Martin Ravallion</a> and World Bank colleagues showed that as inequality rose in poor countries, the poverty-reducing impacts of economic growth declined. Subsequent work revealed how rising inequality also slowed downs rates of improvement in human development indicators. Rising income inequality was bad for the citizens of both rich and poor countries. </p> <p>The SDG for reducing inequality, with a specific target to \u201cprogressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average\u201d encapsulates the broad acceptance of the perils of inequality, not just between countries, but within them. The fact that the target applies and demands action from all countries enhances its potency as evidence of shifting global norms. </p> <p>However, this is not a radical goal, such as arguing that top incomes must be capped or that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient\">Gini coefficient</a> must be reduced every year. Rather, it is a modest, reformist goal that seeks to ensure that those at the bottom of the income scale are not left behind as economic growth moves forward. </p> <p>Yet for all the evidence, the hand-wringing from business elites at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/davos-2015-tackling-inequality-world-economic-forum\">Davos</a>, calls from parties across the political spectrum and increasing disaffection with the status quo from those left behind (at least in rich nations), relatively little is being done to seriously address the problem of rising inequality around the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The real income of the global top 1% rose by more than 60% over 1988-2008</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since 2000, the incomes of the bottom 40% have experienced slower growth year in, year out. Inequality is rising at spectacular rates. While different measures (wealth or income), different datasets (national accounts or taxation) and different analysts disagree on the detail, they all agree that the wealthiest are getting richer faster than anyone else (except in Latin America). The real income of the global top 1% rose by more than 60% over 1988-2008.</p> <p>Turning this situation around will take a Herculean effort, for two main reasons. First, contemporary capitalism is based on economic processes that permit those who manage to amass money by their brain power or political connections or both, to increase their wealth faster than others. As Thomas Piketty tells us, the returns to capital (owning physical and financial assets) are greater than the returns to labour (working). So the rich get richer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/23/paradigm-shift-needed-governments-fight-poverty-inequality\">A 'paradigm shift' is needed from governments to fight poverty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Secondly, when the rich get richer, they have the ability to keep it that way. They are able to shape national and international public policies to such an extent that they remain on a rising tide of prosperity. They can also safeguard national and international patent and competition laws, enabling them to dominate the markets in which they operate, and influence rules which allow them to avoid paying tax. </p> <p>To top it all, by gaining control of the media plutocrats, the super-rich even persuade the public that inequality is good for everyone. Billionaire Donald Trump somehow becomes the voice of those left behind. Gold taps in private jets seem to be a qualification for public office in what Francis Fukuyama terms \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-rise-of-trump-brought-to-you-by-the-decay-of-americas-institutions/2016/03/10/ca6438b4-e6f2-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html?utm_term=.a9c7aff2c01c\">political decay</a>\u201d in the US.</p> <p>So what can be done? Few support the 20th century revolutionary solution of seizing and redistributing land and assets, as happened after the second world war in China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Perhaps more reformist measures are a more popular 21st century answer? In most low income countries, effective public expenditure on domestically-financed education, health and social protection would raise the prospects for sustained growth, structural transformation and welfare advances. The evidence for such policies is clear but, enacting them in the places they are most needed is very problematic. The nature of domestic business and political elites \u2013 often greedy, extractive and predatory \u2013 allied to international business elites and the social norms they transmit, means that socially beneficial policies are not effectively implemented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f156da1939bf531ce7ed3ec5edf66eed6ceba9d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f156da1939bf531ce7ed3ec5edf66eed6ceba9d1/0_0_3210_2211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian Maria Nilza, 36, and mother of four, shows her Bolsa Familia social plan card.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazilian Maria Nilza, 36, and mother of four, shows her bolsa familia social plan card.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanderlei Almeida/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Significantly reducing inequality doesn\u2019t have to be the stuff of utopian dreamers. In Brazil, a sustained decline in inequality levels has been of the most striking aspects of its development performance over the last 10 years. In addition to raising an estimated 40 million people out of poverty, the Brazil\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?end=2014&amp;start=2014&amp;view=map\">Gini coefficient fell by 12%, from 0.59 in 1995 to 0.52 in 2012</a>. While inequality in Brazil remains high, this reduction stands in stark contrast to other OECD and Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, which have seen levels rise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/oct/18/the-e-waste-reduce-waste-old-technology-mountains-in-pictures\">The e-waste mountains - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently published research <a href=\"http://www.brazil4africa.org/\">investigating the Brazilian development model</a> looked in detail at the factors behind this trend. An estimated 35-50% of the reduction in inequality in Brazil can be attributed to changes in non-labour incomes, largely as a result of growing social assistance programmes. Despite costing just 0.7% of GDP, the extremely effective targeting of the  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/17/brazil-bolsa-familia-decade-anniversary-poverty-relief\"><em>bolsa familia</em></a>, a conditional cash transfer scheme, has been vital. A further 10% or so can be attributed to demographic factors, particularly the declining household size among poorer families. The remaining 40-55% is attributed to changes in the distribution of labour earnings. This had previously been attributed to the effects of an increasingly educated workforce, but our research suggests that reduced wage gaps for women and ethnic minorities actually made the biggest impact.</p> <p>Achieving the SDG target to reduce inequality will require a huge shift in how economies and political systems operate right around the world. Some Latin American countries, such as Brazil, demonstrate that sustained reductions in inequality are achievable, when there\u2019s a fairly explicit shift in the social contract, enabling politically difficult decisions to be taken and sustained over a long period. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/12/angus-deaton-wins-nobel-prize-in-economics\">Angus Deaton tells us</a>, humanity has made amazing progress in reducing income poverty and raising health standards. The next big task is reducing inequality so that we can all enjoy a better life. </p> <p>Reducing inequality in every country will be extremely difficult. But a growing tide of protest and its consequences (sometimes socially progressive and sometimes regressive) may persuade the 1% that they will not get the world they want for their grandchildren if business continues as usual.</p> <p><em></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>Eight years ago, the US economy went to hell. Lehman Brothers bank collapsed, the first of many. As a financial crisis swept the globe, unemployment soared, house prices and stock markets collapsed. Today, stock markets are at record highs, house prices have bounced back, the unemployment rate is 5%, half its peak during the recession. And yet ...</p> <p>Earlier this month we told the stories of five people who lived through the recession, many of whom said the recovery feels hollow. Below readers who responded to the story share their experiences and how it will impact their vote.</p> <h2><strong>Craig from Jacksonville, Florida</strong></h2> <p><strong>Are you better off today than you were in 2008?</strong> I am about the same. In 2008 I was just two years out from finishing my undergraduate degree. I had the option to graduate early but when things began to turn dark, every intelligent person I knew told me to hold off. I remained in school for another year thinking I could wait it out. Boy, was I wrong. I ended up going to graduate school hoping to wait out the storm again. Turns out, that didn\u2019t help much either. After graduating as a highly skilled student, finding full-time employment was about as easy as finding affordable living in Manhattan.</p> <p>Since then, I worked just about everywhere. I have done consultant research, bussed tables, worked in an emergency room and even spent a year working at a Florida beach bar all while applying for applicable jobs in my field that came with benefits. I finally have a job, but the amount of debt I have acquired and the amount of job insecurity I still feel has me on edge about as bad as 2008.</p> <p><strong>Who will you vote for? </strong>I am absolutely terrified of what is to come November 8. I am still a Florida registered voter so maybe my vote counts (if it does not end up on a beach somewhere). I plan to close my eyes and vote for Clinton. My biggest fear is that an economic bubble worse than 2008 is coming and that I will go back to bussing tables and serving drinks again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2016/oct/08/great-recession-financial-crisis-recovery\">Eight years after the Great Recession, recovery still rings hollow</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Lori from Denver, Colorado</h2> <p><strong>Are you better off today than you were in 2008?</strong> I am better off than I was in 2008.

I went from earning $70,000 a year to now working two jobs, one full time for $37,000 a year and one part time (evenings and weekends) to bring my salary to $41,000. My health insurance costs have skyrocketed. Food is more expensive. I have a home that I cannot sell as I am still underwater.

I was transitioning from foster care to adulthood while balancing a part-time job with my first and last attempt at higher education.

I also pay $200 a month for health insurance and bills on top of barely supporting myself. The stress is still the same but I\u2019ve gotten better at handling it. Lowering my hopes and expectations significantly has helped too.<br></p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> I had more faith in Bernie than Hillary regarding the economy but since he\u2019s not an option, I\u2019m with her.

It isn\u2019t just the loss of decent paying jobs that has been an issue. It\u2019s also the erosion of savings meant for retirement.

Clinton mentioned Putin or Russia seven times in one response in the third debate when asked by Chris Wallace about a speech she gave to a Brazilian bank that was released by WikiLeaks. </p> <p>The economy consistently ranks among the most important topics for voters, often followed closely by national security and terrorism. In this respect, the candidates\u2019 focus on the debates was closely aligned with public interest. </p> <p>However, the supreme court is one of the most divisive issues, especially for conservatives voters conflicted on whether to vote for Trump, and it only featured prominently once in the third debate. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/where-is-climate-change-in-the-trump-v-clinton-presidential-debates\">Climate change would not have been mentioned at all</a> if it hadn\u2019t been for one question in the second debate from a man in a red sweater named Ken Bone. </p>",
  "<p>Selling on the streets is hard. It doesn\u2019t matter if one is slinging handbags or doughnuts, shish kebab or art \u2013 vending is for those who are tough. The hours are long, the pay low and precarious. Competition is cutthroat, and cops drown you in tickets. Worse, the space legally available to vend keeps shrinking. Which is why, on a rainy summer afternoon, two dozen street vendors gathered in Times Square to demand their place in the city.</p> <p>The group was barely noticeable amid the crush of tourists, private security and grubby ersatz Spider-Men. Their signs were handmade; some presented simple demands: more permits, fewer tickets and restricted streets, and an end to the 20ft rule that keeps vendors from working near building entrances. Others insisted the vendors were workers with families to feed.</p> <p>Osama Khatlan strode the front of the crowd. He wore a cape made from the hundreds of tickets he and other vendors had received for various offenses such as \u201cvending in a restricted area\u201d<strong>.</strong></p> <p>An Iraqi artist in his mid-50s, Khatlan is a lifelong activist. Declined entry to university for refusing to sign a Baathist loyalty pledge, Khatlan learned his trade illustrating for communist newspapers, and spent the late 1970s resisting Saddam Hussain alongside Kurdish guerrillas in Iraq\u2019s north. While Khatlan exhibits his fine art internationally, he makes his living in part as a portrait artist in Times Square. He began organizing with other street artists informally in the 1990s, after other vendors attempted to threaten a Haitian artist out of his spot. Khatlan intervened and physically defended him. </p> <p>Through the years, he also witnessed police harassment and arrest of his colleagues. During one such arrest, police complained to Khatlan that street vendors made New York resemble Baghdad. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m from Baghdad,\u201d he answered furiously.</p> <p>The group Khatlan addressed that rainy day was a cosmopolitan group \u2013 a Latina burrito vendor, Chinese artists who make graceful name paintings, a west African handbag seller working in Queens, as well as a smattering of organizers. To the chant of \u201cvendor power!\u201d and waving banners, they headed downtown. </p> <p>The march snaked down 8th Avenue, until it arrived in front of the Midtown South precinct police station. The officers eyed them suspiciously. Out came the barricades. Khatlan began another speech: \u201cWe sell art to showcase the beauty of this great city. We are not criminals!\u201d</p> <p>Despite their timeless presence in New York \u2013 where, according to a report by the <a href=\"http://ij.org/press-release/groundbreaking-report-highlights-economic-impact-of-new-york-city-vendors/\">Institute for Justice</a>, they contribute $293m annually to the economy \u2013 street vendors are embattled on all sides: by the police, by the brick-and-mortar storeowners who view them as unfair competition, by the bureaucracy that they believe strangles their ability to make a livelihood. </p> <p>Cops slap vendors with tickets that can eat up half their take-home pay. BIDs (Business Improvement Districts, or areas where business owners pay an extra tax to fund services) deploy private security to hassle vendors, and use their influence with the city to lobby for the closure of more streets. To BIDs, vendors like Khatlan are flies in the ointment of the sleek corporate neighborhoods they hope to build. To vendors, who are working class and predominantly immigrants, it\u2019s a battle for more than survival. </p> <p>They\u2019re fighting for the right to be ambitious in New York.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, Donald Trump led a jeremiad to close Fifth Avenue to street vendors. \u201cThe street-peddler plague is infecting the entire city of New York,\u201d he <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=JuUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=The+street-peddler+plague+is+infecting+the+entire+City+of+New+York&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nTHdwbS19L&amp;sig=NtSXQ_Op2xDBJKIOkzPYpwIbEBk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivkpW_3-nPAhUBRSYKHVTcA-oQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20street-peddler%20plague%20is%20infecting%20the%20entire%20City%20of%20New%20York&amp;f=false\">said</a> a few years earlier, in 1987. His words could speak for many members of the city elite.</p> <p>New York glorifies entrepreneurship. We love the hustler, the poor boy or girl who made good. We\u2019re the city of Jay Z and Madonna. We fetishize the scrappy businessman who bleeds for his dream. Yet as the city becomes more gentrified, and the police ubiquitous, there\u2019s less and less space for poor people who work for themselves. This goes double if those people are brown, immigrants or can\u2019t speak English, like most of the protesters in front of the 8th Avenue police station.</p> <p>After a half hour, the station sent out a detective.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked Khatlan.</p> <p>\u201cWe are here to say please respect us, respect us as business owners,\u201d Khatlan answered. He demanded to know why he kept receiving criminal charges while doing his art.</p> <p>The officer smirked. \u201cThe police department isn\u2019t in charge of legislation.\u201d</p> <p> The vendors presented a petition. The police moved them to the other side of the street. They stayed for another half hour, beneath the slow drizzle of summer rain. Time passed, work called and soon the protest dissolved into the city.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>A labyrinthine bureaucracy governs a street vendor\u2019s life. Fifty-four pages of rules regulate food sellers, covering health rules, limiting them to certain streets, even forbidding them from tucking their licenses into their shirts. If vendors sometimes don\u2019t fully understand the rules, police know them even less, leaving a huge margin for miscommunication, error and quota-fulfilling tickets. </p> <p>In 2015, the city\u2019s environmental control board wrote 18,744 vending violation tickets.</p> <p>\u201cVendors are kind of sitting ducks,\u201d Sean Basinski told me. \u201cThey are out there in the same spot every day. Imagine that you are a police officer and you need to write a ticket to somebody \u2026 There are so many rules [for vendors]. They are either breaking one or you could say that they are breaking one. They are almost definitely going to be an immigrant who is going to be scared of you, and they are not going to file a complaint against you.\u201d</p> <p>Basinski is the director of the <a href=\"http://streetvendor.org/\">Street Vendors Project</a> (SVP), the group that called the Times Square demonstration. Basinski founded SVP in 2001 when he was just 23, after a summer working as a burrito vendor during law school. The Giuliani administration had just closed many streets to vendors, and Basinski became involved in a wave of organizing. </p> <p> One of SVP\u2019s major goals is to persuade the city to increase the amount of permits it issues. Because of first amendment protection, artists and booksellers need no license to sell on the streets, and in New York, disabled veterans also have the right to vend. Everyone else needs a permit. The city caps these at 3,000 and the waiting list stretches for decades, so frustrated vendors turn to the black market, where one vendor told me that the $200 permits can go for up to $20,000<strong>.</strong></p> <p>SVP, which has 2,000 members, functions at once as an activist group, professional association, and legal aid society for vendors. They maintain an emergency fund for vendors, a small business lending program and an annual food cart competition. At their monthly meetings, vendors organize around grievances, network and give each other moral support. </p> <p>On the legal front, the SVP has won some major victories, including the reduction of a vendors\u2019 maximum ticket from $1,000 to $250 in 2013. SVP\u2019s staff lawyer helps vendors fight these civil tickets, but they don\u2019t have the resources to represent their members in criminal court. No clear, public data is available on the number of vendors charged with misdemeanors, but the vendors I spoke to reported it was a constant concern. Khatlan has received 60 criminal tickets, as well as 90 civil ones. Most were dismissed, but a few times, he was sentenced to attend a class, or waste a day stamping envelopes or cleaning streets. </p> <p>Unlicensed vendors also face potentially violent arrests, or worse: in 2014, SVP members marched in solidarity with Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who died after officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a chokehold during an arrest.</p> <p>Immigrant vendors who don\u2019t speak English face particular difficulties, said Angela Ni, a legal intern with the Street Vendors Project. Ni got involved with the organization at 13, interpreting for her father, a Chinese immigrant who drew portraits in Times Square. Many of the artists her father worked with had been newspaper illustrators in China, and some studied at the Beijing Academy of Fine Arts, but in America, their inability to speak English led them to practice their trade on the streets. </p> <p>Over the last 10 years, Ni watched the already tense relationship between the artists, the police and the BID deteriorate. \u201cThey should feel protected by the police, but they feel persecuted,\u201d she said. Banned from most Times Square streets before 7pm, artists work till past midnight for between $50 and $100 a day, but see up to half their incomes swallowed by tickets.</p> <p>This is what happened to De Zhao, who has drawn caricatures of tourists in Times Square for the last eight years. </p> <p>I met Zhao at the Midtown community court, where he was dealing with a charge for \u201cvending on a restricted sidewalk\u201d. Through a translator, Zhao spoke about the discrimination endured by Chinese artists, who \u201cdon\u2019t have any way of explaining themselves or fighting back\u201d. Zhao described a squad of six cops who he says often targeted him, shoving arbitrary tickets into his hand without bothering to speak to or look at him. When he asked for explanations, the police just wrote more tickets. </p> <p> \u201cThe police need to be more concerned with getting the bad guys, with helping people instead of oppressing them,\u201d he said, frustration making him speak faster. \u201cBut what can I do? I don\u2019t understand any English.\u201d </p> <p>The Midtown community court was founded in 1993, during the start of efforts to \u201cclean up\u201d Times Square. It is sold as a kinder, gentler, \u201cproblem solving\u201d court, where defendants are sentenced to community service, classes or rehab rather than incarceration. At first, police rounded up the sex workers, touts and three-card Monte dealers who gave Times Square its seediness \u2013 but street vendors were also on the list. </p> <p>The court is a public-private partnership, and from the beginning received significant financial contributions from the Fifth Avenue Association, a local BID. </p> <p>New York\u2019s first BID hit Union Square in 1984. They\u2019ve since proliferated wildly. New York now hosts 72, more than any other city in the country, and the relationships between BIDs and the police have always been close. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1266&amp;context=ylpr\">Yale study</a> released a year after the court\u2019s foundation wrote \u201cthe fact that strong private interests are making significant financial contributions to the court has caused many criminal justice officials to voice questions about the propriety of such contributions. Many of the people interviewed expressed their concern that the court was the direct result of a rich special interest buying its own system of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Claims of undue influence are also raised by Midtown community court conditions panel meetings that take place between the DA, judges, police and members of local BIDs. Though technically open to the public, these meetings are not advertised, and it took the Street Vendors Project considerable time to find out when they are held. </p> <p>Basinski, who attended several of them, described a judge who drilled police on how to write tickets that wouldn\u2019t get dismissed. (The Times Square Alliance BID declined requests to comment on this article.)</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Videos become the vendors\u2019 testimony to their experiences. </p> <p>Mohammed Omar, a kebab cart vendor, showed me a cellphone video footage he\u2019d taken to document harassment by the BID\u2019s private security. In the video, the guard approached Omar\u2019s kebab cart aggressively, saying something I couldn\u2019t make out. \u201cEvery day you bother me,\u201d shouted Omar. When he saw Omar was filming him, he covered his face. </p> <p>Omar, who\u2019s also a board member of the SVP, told me that two weeks before I met him in July at the Urban Justice Center\u2019s offices, a police officer tried to ticket him for selling during restricted hours. When he explained his cart was closed, the officer barked at him to shut up, and when, as SVP advocates, he took out his camera to document the interaction, the officer threatened him with arrest, then slapped him with another ticket. </p> <p>Omar started working on the streets at 22, selling vegetables in his hometown of Port Said, Egypt. Business flourished, and he soon owned a clothing store but in 2011, he packed up his wife and five kids and moved to America. He didn\u2019t mention the revolution that broke out that year, telling me only: \u201cAmerica is a free country. It\u2019s safe here for women to walk on the street.\u201d</p> <p>In New York, Omar got a job at a food cart owned by another Egyptian immigrant. If he was restarting his life, he figured, he might as well start on the street.</p> <p>On Omar\u2019s second day, a cop slapped him with five tickets he couldn\u2019t hope to pay. Not knowing enough English to protest, Omar broke down in frustration. Seeing his distress, a fellow food cart worker told him about the Street Vendors Project. Soon, he was going to all their meetings, and, as his English improved, he joined the group\u2019s board.</p> <p>Omar owns his own cart now, and he\u2019s taken on his friend\u2019s daughter, Doa Abdolla, as an assistant. She has also joined the SVP leadership board. </p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>New York tells itself a story. It goes like this. We are sharp-elbowed bastards who live in filth, surrounded by sewer rats, but with enough chutzpah, drive and determination, any of us can rise high enough to scrape the sky. It\u2019s a myth, of course, and like all myths, it contains a narrow shard of truth. But with each year that shard shrinks, under the weight of gentrification, corporations and police. People like Khatlan and Omar fight to keep it alive.</p> <p>It was Ramadan when I interviewed Omar, so he invited me to break the fast with him at his cart. Beforehand, I wandered through Times Square. A few topless showgirls were all that remained of the neighborhood\u2019s outlaw cachet, but the streets are still theaters of working-class, largely immigrant ambition. Beggars demanded money for Viagra. Disabled veterans sold scarves. Touts hollered in praise of comedy shows, and dozens of blinking, smoking halal food carts offered cheap plates of protein that have fed generations of workers. </p> <p>On the billboards, Global Capital reigned supreme, but the streets still surged with the human-scale hustle that has always defined this city. </p> <p>When I found Omar\u2019s stall, it was a few moments before sunset, and he was dying for a cigarette. As observant Muslims, he and Doa refrained from food and water during Ramadan\u2019s daylight hours \u2013 a hard task in their line of work. In his free moments, Omar laid out supplies. Dates, a sticky fruit drink called Qmar-al-din, and skewers of lamb. Finally, the sky darkened. Despite the neon, we could make out the moon. </p> <p>\u201cEat!\u201d Omar demanded in Arabic and shoved twin mountains of food towards me and Doa. Then, he lit a cigarette.</p> <p>Business was slow, he said. Vendors who owned several carts were stealing spots, and officers bedeviled him with tickets. But he worked for his kids, not himself.</p> <p>Then he smiled. \u201cI like the streets.\u201d He said. \u201cI think, if today is not good, there\u2019s tomorrow. If this week is not good, there\u2019s the next. If I take one day off, what can I do? Relax? That\u2019s not life. The street is my life.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>\u201cSo, what are you headed to Texas for?\u201d asked the woman in the airport lounge last week.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got this friend,\u201d I said, and took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019ve never met, but we were online coworkers for a few years. We talked every day. And now he\u2019s really sick.\u201d</p> <p>I explained that Kurt was in the intensive care unit with multiple organ failure. His vital signs had nosedived twice, what people on TV medical dramas call \u201cflatlining\u201d and real medical personnel call \u201ccrashing\u201d. They managed to shock his heart back into rhythm, but since then, he hadn\u2019t regained consciousness.</p> <p>\u201cAnd y\u2019all have never met?\u201d the woman \u2013 her name was Sharon \u2013 asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cand I might just get there in time to squeeze his hand while he\u2019s in a coma and say goodbye. But for a couple of years, he was the first person I\u2019d check in with every morning.\u201d</p> <p>It was only when I watched the parade of expressions that passed over Sharon\u2019s face that I kicked myself for not just saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to a wedding.\u201d Sometimes I forget to be blithe and casual when people ask me a question, and then I end up feeling like I just made like my cat did the other morning and unceremoniously dumped a dead bird into their lap.<br></p> <p>Regardless, there I was, flying to Texas on air miles donated by friends to meet someone whose favorite comic book I knew, whose cats\u2019 names I knew, whose first wedding dance song choice I knew, but whom I\u2019d never met in the flesh, never hugged, never walked down the street with. And for all I knew, he would never know I was even there before he died.</p> <p>I would hardly be alone, in our social media age, in grieving someone I\u2019ve never met in person. These days, we show our food online, our outfits, our birthdays, wedding parties and promotions at work. And we share our injuries, our broken hearts, our grief and now our deaths.</p> <p>Twice, I have read people\u2019s suicide notes on Facebook as I scrolled through my morning feed. One friend \u2013 a guy I met at an LGBT recovery meeting in Atlanta who relapsed \u2013 was successful. For the other, I was able to work with other online friends to contact local authorities and have him remanded to medical care.</p> <p>He\u2019s fine now, so far as I know, but it was a hell of a thing to stumble upon between ads for Christian Mingle and Amazon Prime deals.</p> <p>Other friends have lost their fights with cancer, addiction or other diseases. I get notifications on their birthdays, which is always unnerving.</p> <p>I was one of the people lucky enough to know Aids activist Spencer Cox, who had a hilarious, irreverent, righteous, sarcastic online presence. We never met in person, but we had many late-night Facebook chats in which I confided things to Spencer that I\u2019ve never told anyone \u2013not my partner, not my twin brother and certainly not my parents. </p> <p>When Spencer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/nyregion/spencer-cox-aids-activist-dies-at-44.html\">died</a> in 2012, I wasn\u2019t the only person who\u2019d never met him in \u201creal life\u201d but grieved him like a childhood friend.</p> <p>\u201cThe day he died, I had to leave work because I couldn\u2019t stop crying at my desk,\u201d one friend told me.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have seen New York again if I hadn\u2019t met Spencer through Facebook,\u201d said another who \u2013 like many of us \u2013 traveled to a memorial and celebration of Spencer\u2019s life a few weeks after his death. Her Facebook Memories, she said, are \u201cconstantly painful\u201d because of all the hundreds of comments Spencer left behind.</p> <p>I spoke with other friends who have lost people they only knew online, and many of them have similar stories of being shocked at how hard the loss of a person they only really knew as an abstraction, a personality at the other end of their internet connection, hit them.</p> <p>\u201cWe talked daily for hours, for a few years,\u201d said one friend of an online acquaintance who succumbed to a brain tumor. \u201cI still have his name in my contacts, and every time I see it my heart lurches.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe died in 2007,\u201d another friend said of a blogger she read and admired. \u201cI only talked to him on the phone that one time, but he really felt like a friend.\u201d</p> <p>Kurt did not die. In fact, when he heard my voice in his ICU room, his eyes flew open. He was there with us, unable to speak around the ventilator tube down his throat, but able to nod, shake his head and even be kind of a smartass. He is continuing to improve and now I have a new friend in the real world who is actually my old friend from the internet. </p> <p>When we get close to people online, we run the same risk as getting close to people in the real world: that we will love them and then lose them. And yet, just like in the real world, we reach out anyway, because that\u2019s the kind of creatures we are: ones who crave emotional connection, be it across cyberspace or right across the table.</p>",
  "<p>In life, people like moral certainty. Not least in the world of hospitality, where, for we Guardian types in particular, the superiority of indie, owner-operated pubs, restaurants and hotels is an article of faith \u2013 one usually borne out by reality.</p> <p>We disdain chains as cynical corporate behemoths which, pumped full of private equity money, are determined to make us accept their bland mediocrity. Except that \u2013 whisper it \u2013 not all chains are the same. Take <a href=\"http://www.peachpubs.com/\">Peach</a>, for example. You may scoff at its PR flannel (\u201cPeach is not a chain, it\u2019s a group of like-minded enthusiasts\u201d), but undeniably this 17-strong pub group is a relative maverick. It has, for instance, published two novels by co-owner Jo Eames: you will find Not Only the Good Boys by your bed at The High Field Town House.</p> <p>Importantly, Peach is not churning out identikit venues; instead, its pubs (most are in villages and market towns in the Midlands and south-east) are individual entities run with some autonomy, which is evident in their menu designs.

It is in the wealthier half of Edgbaston which, while only a half-hour walk from Birmingham New Street, feels worlds away. The leafy streets are lined with huge (whitewashed) Victorian villas now home to fee-paying schools, private clinics, banks and, opposite High Field itself, the Michelin-starred restaurant <a href=\"http://www.simpsonsrestaurant.co.uk/\">Simpsons</a>.</p> <p>The Town House and the adjacent High Field pub are of a piece with all this luxury, albeit in an entry-level way. The pub is a swanky affair: a slick extension of an art deco building which, through huge retractable glass doors, opens out onto well-groomed terraces. There are expensive finishes. There are ornamental champagne buckets. There is a \u201cflutes and fizz\u201d menu. Naturally, this attracts a certain crowd. I have never seen so many people dolled-up in designer duds on a Tuesday night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57e4516cc175fc0fbcec272d459b8fd85f9cb074\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e4516cc175fc0fbcec272d459b8fd85f9cb074/100_0_800_1000/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Highfield Townhouse entrance.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If the pub is borderline bling, the Town House (smooth key-pad entry/ self-check-in; although I had to chase the notification email for the code) is both more dramatic in its juxtaposition of retro and modern design features, and more sedate in its overall effect. A listed Victorian building, its (large, quiet, broadly well-equipped) rooms are decorated in soothing Farrow &amp; Ball tones and dressed with beautiful antique beds and wardrobes. These are artfully offset by contemporary digital print wallpaper (in my room, a hugely magnified section of an ornithological painting), quirky lights and stylish armchairs. So-so toiletries and hollow-fibre pillows apart, it is difficult to criticise these bedrooms: they are handsome spaces.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are ornamental champagne buckets.

A lightweight, ineffectual mini-loaf and then salt beef croquettes (the salt beef lost in an overly sweet, gluey b\u00e9chamel, \u00a36.75) are drab openers. The kitchen is better at the classics. Lemon sole with samphire, girolles, new potatoes and butter sauce offers a good interplay of woody, earthy and salty, creamy flavours (\u00a319.75). The sticky toffee pudding is an accomplished rendition. At breakfast, eggs benedict cleared the difficult hurdle (the Hollandaise was spot-on), but was a bit mean on the ham and served on insubstantial English muffins. It could have been better.</p> <p>Nonetheless, in a city that lacks interesting accommodation, The High Field Town House is useful to know.

  "<p>Having a Citro\u00ebn Cactus is a bit like painting your house pink; it sounds extraordinary and daring; it looks it for a while, but since you\u2019re mostly inside it rather than outside, it\u2019s your neighbours who have to live with it. I\u2019m talking mainly about the side panels: bubbly sheets whose purpose was never plain to begin with. The Rip Curl keeps the panels and adds a number of driving modes (snow, sand, slipperiness), to ensure you\u2019re ready for more than just bumping into things: you can now bump into things that are also driving on sand. It\u2019s not obvious what the point is, for those of us not planning to reinvade Africa. It does have a mud setting, though, so is not totally inappropriate for the British weather.</p> <p>That is its metier: rugged jaunts across tricky terrain. Round town, it doesn\u2019t get much chance to show off, though it does have a pleasing interior. The driver\u2019s seat is armchair-roomy, like going to a posh cinema. Bright red seatbelts give everyone the look of wearing a ceremonial sash, which can be discombobulating, especially when you catch your kids in the rear-view and try to remember when you made them the Icelandic ambassador. Heavily stylised stitching and natty door pulls make you feel as though you\u2019re sitting inside 1930s luggage. The younger passengers were unimpressed with the pop-out back windows and moaned constantly about not being able to stick their heads out. (It was like being able to hear the internal monologue of a dog.) The satnav was so sluggish that on roundabouts you just had to get used to being told to take the exit you\u2019d just passed.</p> <p>On motorways, I found it all a bit workmanlike. The long-throw gear shift left you in no real doubt that it could accelerate, but feeling, guiltily, that it didn\u2019t want to. The diesel engine is extremely thrifty (I thought the petrol gauge was broken when I got to Birmingham without making a dent on the dial) but not keen. Steering gave me nothing to complain about, but nor did it give any sense that you were in a relationship with the car, that it understood you better than you understood yourself. Maybe that kind of intimacy is an unreasonable thing to want.</p> <p>You wouldn\u2019t spend the extra money on the grip control unless you had specific, recurrent grippy needs: a Welsh hill for mud, or a Scottish valley for snow, or at the very least an incredibly slippy drive. But then that market, in this price bracket, is not wildly overpopulated, so maybe they\u2019re smarter than we know.</p> <h2>Citro\u00ebn Cactus Rip Curl: in numbers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c75aa12ef74ed8085cfe110260c22e85ef4f97c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c75aa12ef74ed8085cfe110260c22e85ef4f97c6/884_0_2400_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Citro\u00ebn Cactus interior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Price </strong>\u00a320,760 <br><strong>Top speed</strong> 114mph <br><strong>Acceleration </strong>0-62mph in 10.6 seconds <br><strong>Combined fuel consumption</strong> 80.7mpg <br><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</strong> 95g/km <br><strong>Eco rating</strong> 8/10<br><strong>Cool rating</strong> 6/10</p>",
  "<p>The industrial apartment that theatre designer Tom Scutt calls home is tucked away on an unassuming street in east London. Flitting around his kitchen making coffee \u2013 and it\u2019s exactly the sort of kitchen you see in coffee adverts, all open shelves and aspiration \u2013 you\u2019d never guess from his breezy chat that Scutt is horrifically jetlagged. Later, he\u2019ll show me a rooster he drew at 3am in the absence of sleep. It\u2019s brilliant, detailed and, given that the rooster is wearing a wrestling singlet, a little leftfield \u2013 much like Scutt himself.</p> <p>The jetlag is due to Scutt\u2019s return from New York, where he designed his second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2016/aug/28/vma-2016-mtv-video-music-awards-live-kanye-britney-beyonce\">MTV Video Music Awards show</a>, and where he\u2019s preparing for the opening of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, <a href=\"http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/donmar-warehouse/donmar-new-york/2016/les-liaisons-dangereuses#joADtoB6uY1qj4Hy.97\">transferring to Broadway after its sell-out run at the Donmar Warehouse in London</a>.

But it\u2019s what Scutt has filled the space with, from furniture to curiosities that draw the eye.</p> <p>Many of the items (such as a driftwood figure and stones he collected on a beach last New Year while away with friends) remind him of memorable, happy times. Others reference his career: a butterfly glass display box, from a production of Alice Through The Looking Glass, that Scutt has filled with old family photos; a poster for a production of Coriolanus his dad produced while at Cambridge; and, of course, souvenirs of Scutt\u2019s own productions.</p> <p>We conduct the interview sitting on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/26/anna-chancellor-young-chekhov-the-seagull-national-theatre-q-and-a\">Anna Chancellor</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/29/kara-tointon-interview-absent-friends\">Kara Tointon</a>\u201d. Scutt explains: \u201cMost of my furniture comes from shows I\u2019ve done. This Ercol sofa is from a [2011] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/15/south-downs-browning-version-review\">double bill at Chichester</a> of Terence Rattigan\u2019s The Browning Version and South Downs by David Hare that starred Anna Chancellor. She spent a lot of time sitting on the sofa, so it\u2019s named after her.

The things that inspire me are constantly changing, so I like to have regular clear-outs. It\u2019s a bit like clothes \u2013 the ones you haven\u2019t worn for years can be got rid of. The same is true of objects: if there\u2019s something I haven\u2019t got anything from for a while, I know it\u2019s time for it to go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"801dc6828b0ee98643b412f57674cf529e57b3e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/801dc6828b0ee98643b412f57674cf529e57b3e6/2562_468_1323_2883/459.jpg\" alt=\"An MTV Video Music Award \u2013 Scutt designed the 2015 and 2016 shows.\" width=\"459\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An MTV Video Music Award \u2013 Scutt designed the 2015 and 2016 shows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are other bits of pop culture detritus, too: Kermit the Frog (Scutt is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/the-muppets\">Muppets</a> fan), and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tintin\">Tintin</a> figure.

I fooled myself into believing I needed loads of space because I\u2019m a theatre designer, and have all these model boxes and stuff. Moving here, I was apprehensive about downscaling, but I realised that actually the problem all along was that I had too much space. I just couldn\u2019t control it.\u201d</p> <p>Furthermore, his parents moved from the family home, so he \u201ccan\u2019t physically return to that nostalgic place any more\u201d; and he rents rather than owns, which means \u201cI\u2019m on the move every three years or so.\u201d As a result, home is more about people and less about the physical space.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nomadic, often lonely, lifestyle that comes with my job, not only in terms of geographical places, but the way people pass through your life. You make these families on the job, and then you move on. So I made the decision to live near friends and have that support network close by. My best friend lives 45 seconds away, so living here is the best I\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ng-interactive/2016/jan/27/stage-designs-kanye-west-tom-scutt-mr-burns-constellations-king-charles-iii-donmar-vmas\">Designs fit for Kanye and a future king \u2013 the stage worlds of Tom Scutt</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>House rules</h2> <p><strong>Most treasured possession </strong>My Muhammad Ali autograph. <br><strong>Design heroes </strong>Peter Greenaway, Ken Adams, Saul Bass.<br><strong>Where do you relax?</strong> On my Ercol sofa.

  "<p>Australia had the ball but New Zealand scored the tries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/22/bledisloe-cup-australia-vs-new-zealand-live-wallabies-action\" title=\"\">as they set a new record</a> for consecutive Test victories by a Tier 1 nation, reaching 18 but having come of age long before. The Wallabies played some of their best rugby since last year\u2019s World Cup, taking the game to the All Blacks and enjoying 65% of the possession, but they lacked the opportunism of their opponents.</p> <p>Despite having to make more than twice as many tackles as Australia and spending nearly 70% of the match in their own half, New Zealand scored six tries to one and had a seventh disallowed in the final minute. They were some way below their fluent best, hustled into mistakes and forced to bring on replacements early, but only three times had they scored more points against their greatest foes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/22/hanson-accuses-fuming-michael-cheika-of-hijacking-all-blacks-celebrations\">Hansen accuses fuming Michael Cheika of 'hijacking' All Blacks' celebrations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was not only New Zealand\u2019s 18th straight Test victory, a run that started last year after they had been beaten by Australia in Sydney, but their 45th in a row at home, another record. They have still to be beaten at Eden Park in the professional era and they take off for their four-match tour of the northern hemisphere, which starts against Ireland in Chicago on 6 November, determined to beat Cyprus\u2019s record of 21 consecutive wins.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not happy with 18 and want to keep going,\u201d said the New Zealand captain, Kieran Read. \u201cAustralia really brought it to us and we had to dig deep. It took 70 minutes to open them up and it is not going to be any easier in the north.\u201d</p> <p>It would have been more difficult against Australia but for a controversial refereeing decision five minutes into the second half. The Wallabies trailed New Zealand 15-7 at the interval but a Bernard Foley penalty brought them within touching distance and they thought they had drawn level when Henry Speight scored in the right corner after Foley\u2019s break.</p> <p>As the referee, Nigel Owens, awarded the try, the television match official, Shaun Veldsman, told him to hold back as he wanted to review an incident off the ball when the Australia wing Dane Haylett-Petty, running behind Speight, moved into the line of Julian Savea and put out his hand to check his opposite number.</p> <p>The try was disallowed, and with it the chance for Foley to give his side the lead with the conversion, even though Savea appeared to have had little chance of catching Speight. The decision was balanced a couple of minutes later when Foley looked to have impeded Dane Coles as they raced to get first to the ball over Australia\u2019s line, but the Speight call was a game changer. Fortune tends to favour the successful.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a big moment for sure,\u201d said the Australia captain, Stephen Moore, as he reflected on his side\u2019s second 3-0 setback of the year after being whitewashed by England in the summer. It would probably only have reduced the margin of victory given the flourish with which the All Blacks have come to end matches, but it was hard on a side that, on this form, will be a threat in Europe next month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22cd7e1edb7a2e0d6d8c771e91787122f9083b77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22cd7e1edb7a2e0d6d8c771e91787122f9083b77/0_0_3636_2423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Israel Dagg dives in to score the opening try of the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Israel Dagg dives in to score the opening try of the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Walter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New Zealand are a class apart because they have so many match-winners. Savea spent the opening period looking like a man who had been asked for his ticket at the door of a party and could not find it. He turned gatecrasher after the break, bouncing off challenges from Speight and Nick Frisby to score his second try, his 45th in 49 internationals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/22/bledisloe-cup-australia-vs-new-zealand-live-wallabies-action\">Fast-finishing All Blacks beat Wallabies to make it 18 straight \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dane Coles again played like a three-quarter with the No2 on his back. He was rewarded with his side\u2019s final try, which ended a passage of play, lasting more than two minutes, that started when the Australia flanker Dean Mumm intercepted a pass and ran into New Zealand\u2019s half. The force of Coles\u2019s challenge made him spill the ball and when Savea again broke the defence, Coles was on hand to take the wing\u2019s pass one metre out.</p> <p>Beauden Barrett has been one of New Zealand\u2019s standout players this year, but the outside-half lasted 44 minutes before being replaced by Aaron Cruden. He had missed three conversions and a penalty. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/aaron-smith-new-zealand-apology-disabled-toilet-female-friend\" title=\"\">There was no Aaron Smith at scrum-half</a>, but that was no inconvenience as TJ Perenara sniped, hounded and harried, scoring a try when he anticipated Reece Hodge would waste a moment by switching feet in attempting a clearance kick and charged it down.</p> <p>Australia took the game to New Zealand, not wobbling when they went 10-0 down against the run of play, but they were made to pay for mistakes, not least the hapless Speight. The All Blacks march on, fallible for sure, but buoyed by the self-assurance greatness bestows.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the best All Blacks team I have ever seen,\u201d said the former captain Sean Fitzpatrick, who played in a few that could lay claim to the title. The best, it is hard not to suspect, is yet to come.</p>",

Australia had 817 run metres to 583, and laid 86 tackles while forcing New Zealand into 183, plus also dominated possession for large periods of the game, but they lacked the finesse and finishing touch to get the job done. </p> <p>The disallowed try that would have made it 15-15 set them back, but they weren\u2019t beaten by the ref. Their formidable opponent simply crushed them in the final 20 minutes. </p> <p>With this win, New Zealand have 18 straight Test wins, a new world record, and the Wallabies are still to break through for an Eden Park Test win since their last in 1986.

We\u2019ll start with the obvious. Australia haven\u2019t beaten the All Blacks in New Zealand since 2001, when the Baha Men\u2019s \u201cWho Let the Dogs Out?\u201d was enjoying its three-month run at the top of the charts and each member of The Strokes still had hair.</p> <p>What hope do the Wallabies have tonight at Eden Park? Well, none. They haven\u2019t won at this venue in three full decades and face a side looking for its 18<sup>th</sup> win on the bounce. The ABs haven\u2019t lost on home soil since 2009, nor at Eden Park since 1994. It\u2019s been 18 matches since the Wallabies last won at any New Zealand venue. I\u2019d call that a tall task of Robert Wadlow dimensions, wouldn\u2019t you?</p> <p>The Aussies are sitting on three wins from nine starts this year \u2013 hardly imposing \u2013 but they\u2019ve at least changed things up for tonight\u2019s game; Quade Cooper heads to the bench, Bernard Foley returns to hatural habitat of flyhalf, while Reece Hodge pairs with Samu Kerevi in the centres. The net result is that Henry Speight gets to return on the wing. David Pocock is also back earlier than expected from a wrist injury (OK, quieten down there at the back of the room) and takes his place on the bench.</p> <p>New Zealand head into this one with a 57-15 thrashing of the Springboks as preparation. Julian Savea gets the nod in front of Waisake Naholo for the starting side, while Matt Todd is favoured ahead of Ardie Savea for the starting seven spot. Can the Wallabies cause the upset of the year and party like it\u2019s 1986? With a lineout like theirs, probably not, but that shouldn\u2019t stop the rest of us.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbkOZTSvrHs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbkOZTSvrHs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>John Farnham - You\u2019re the Voice</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580aebb3e4b05ae7c6c55cb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-22T04:33:01.917Z\">5.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Russell will be here shortly.

But his ability to develop universal criminal justice lessons from forced confessions, the pressure of pubic opinion and misinterpretation of scientific evidence have chilling echoes in a country that jailed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/mar/12/gareth-peirce-birmingham-six\">Birmingham Six</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/20/guildford-four-detectives-cleared\">Guildford Four</a>.</p> <p>Only this year, the UK\u2019s supreme court ruled that for the past 30 years British judges have been misconstruing crucial aspects of the joint enterprise guidelines, which may yet lead to scores, if not hundreds, of cases being reassessed and possibly retried.</p> <p>Britain and China\u2019s judiciaries, if not on the road to convergence, are sharing more and more legal experience through exchange visits and lectures.

His English is crisp and fluent; his personal odyssey from agricultural labourer to pre-eminent legal scholar verges on the fantastical.</p> <p>He was born in Beijing in 1953. During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion\">cultural revolution</a> he was sent to work on a farm. \u201cI believed in communism,\u201d he recalls. After a few years, though, he began to feel he had been fooled, and started writing a novel to prove he possessed talent. When he completed it, he was allowed to return to the capital, where he worked as a plumber. There he fell in love with a beautiful young woman. \u201cShe was a doctor; it was a very good job,\u201d he says. Her parents tried to separate them.</p> <p>They set up a challenge. \u201cIf I could pass a national exam for university \u2026 they would be happy to meet me. I had had only six years of education,\u201d He recalls. \u201cThe examination was very competitive. I prepared for six months and passed.\u201d</p> <p>On enrolment at university, he randomly selected law. \u201cI didn\u2019t know [about it],\u201d he admits. \u201cUnder the cultural revolution there was no law.\u201d Two years later, after finishing his course in record time, he married his girlfriend. They have been together for 35 years, and have a daughter and a grandson.</p> <p>He is an optimist. Accustomed to hard work on the farm, he believes the experience helped him power through academic challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing for people to have hard lives and frustrations when they are young,\u201d he says. Of the cultural revolution, he is less forgiving: \u201cMy second novel [published by Penguin] is entitled <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/books/article/1628965/book-review-black-holes-he-jiahong\">Black Holes</a>. The cultural revolution was a black hole. It changed the lives of millions of people.\u201d</p> <p>The death penalty, real and fictional, has been a recurrent theme in He\u2019s work. Eventually, he hopes, its use may cease. Opinion polls conducted in 2002, he says, showed public support for executions running at around 93% of the population. It was considered a natural part of Chinese culture.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time, I said that we cannot abolish the death penalty. We have to respect public opinion. If you kill somebody then you should be killed. About 10 years later, I changed my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cPublic opinion can be changed with education. More and more people think that [considering human rights] the death penalty is not a natural role for human beings.\u201d</p> <p>Around 2005, the Chinese authorities introduced a criminal justice reform known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/29/china-death-penalty-executions\">\u201ckill fewer, kill carefully\u201d</a> reforms. In 2014, an amendment to the criminal law further reduced the number of offences that carry the death penalty.</p> <p>Support for capital punishment is now around 70-80%, and coming down. He has advocated abolishing it gradually over the next two decades. \u201cIn fact, we may not abolish the death penalty [straight away],\u201d he suggests. \u201cWe might not use it. We would wait and see; if we don\u2019t use the death penalty for a number of years, then people in China would be persuaded. Then we may legally abolish the death penalty in 20 years. But it all depends on the situation \u2026 the government is facing the threat of terrorists [militant groups from within <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/24/china-uighurs-blamed-as-18-die-in-xinjiang-attack-says-report\">the separatist Muslim Uighur ethnic group</a>] and drug trafficking.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_China\">number of executions</a> is a state secret. Figures are disputed. While as many as 12,000 people might have been killed in 2002, according to the Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights campaign group, the annual total estimated by foreign observers is more than 1,000 deaths.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not keep secret the numbers \u2026 policy has been changing in the supreme peoples\u2019 court in China,\u201d He says. \u201cWe should have stricter scrutiny of death penalties. We have to change the mentality of the decision makers. These wrongful convictions made [the authorities] have second thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, the authorities decided to return to the supreme people\u2019s court the power to review any death penalty. It had previously been entrusted to lower courts because there were too many cases for the supreme court to consider. Trafficking in the organs of those who have been executed has also been banned.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, Back from the Dead could not have been published, He admits. \u201cI started studying wrongful convictions in 2005. And at the time people thought it was wrong. It was difficult to have a dialogue openly in conferences at first.</p> <p>\u201cChinese people would say: \u2018We have some dirty things, but we should not let foreigners know.\u2019 That was quite natural. But the leaders of the judiciary have had to accept that we must deal with the problem more openly, and that wrongful convictions can teach us lessons,\u201d He says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4d65fd53e48cccfda67ac5bb1526cd1ed96174f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4d65fd53e48cccfda67ac5bb1526cd1ed96174f/0_0_2048_1427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sentencing rally in the Chinese city of Wenzhou in 2004, after which 11 prisoners were executed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sentencing rally in the Chinese city of Wenzhou in 2004, after which 11 prisoners were executed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is not a matter of viewing police or prosecutors as evil gangs.

It\u2019s a challenge for all human societies.\u201d</p> <p>In terror trials, He points out, there may be greater public demand to convict and to use torture on top of all the other pressures. Beatings were widely misused in the 1980s and 90s. \u201cNow we have rules against torture. You can\u2019t say it\u2019s very good, but it\u2019s better [at preventing] illegally obtained evidence,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd interrogations are videotaped.

Inspiration for the first in his series of five detective novels, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17221887-hanging-devils\">Hanging Devils</a>, came from his research into miscarriages of justice. It is set on a state farm in a city in the north-east of China.</p> <p>The book\u2019s protagonist, Hing Jun, is a defence lawyer. \u201cHe has to travel up north to solve a wrongful conviction case. I had a problem with how to frame the story at first. In China at the time, defence lawyers had only seven days to prepare the trial. It would not have been enough time to collect all the evidence.</p> <p>\u201cThen we revised our criminal procedure so that defence lawyers would have two months to prepare a case [on appeal]. In 2012 we made further progress when the accused were given the right to a lawyer at the first investigation. Crime fiction is just a way to tell the story.\u201d</p>",

A scar on his cheek and salt-and-pepper flanks in his hair, he is in character as <a href=\"http://marvel.com/characters/14/doctor_strange\">Doctor Strange</a>, the next superhero protagonist from Marvel Studios. Eerily enough, Strange\u2019s story, the latest to emerge from the Marvel\u2019s multi-dimensional cinematic universe \u2013 those dimensions being film, T-shirt, lunchbox \u2013 is about space and time and religion and mysticism. It also features Tilda Swinton as an ageless kung fu monk.</p> <p>It\u2019s fair to say that this new hero is not the most famous name in Marvel\u2019s roster of characters. Then again, he\u2019s a bit out there. \u201cI wasn\u2019t familiar with Doctor Strange as a child, not at all,\u201d says Cumberbatch. \u201cSo it\u2019s been a fast catch-up. But like all comics in their origination, they\u2019re very much tied into the era that they were born in, and so, you know, this one came about in an era of psychedelics and experimental drugs.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HSzx-zryEgM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Billed as a \u201cmaster of black magic\u201d, Doctor Strange was created in 1963 by <a href=\"http://www.steveditko.com/\">Steve Ditko</a>, one of Marvel Comics\u2019 defining artists. Stephen Strange was a selfish young neuroscientist whose life was shattered when he suffered a car accident and lost the use of his hands. Seeking meaning in his life, Strange went on a pilgrimage to the east and found a source of magic in a Tibetan sanctuary.</p> <p>Taught by a guru named the Ancient One and coming into possession of not only his amulet \u2013 the Eye of Agamotto \u2013 but a sentient cloak, Strange returned to the west as a Sorcerer Supreme. From that point it got weirder as, not content with depicting magic, Ditko took Doctor Strange on adventures into other dimensions, creating surreal spacescapes with structures that looked like they\u2019d fallen out of a <a href=\"http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/\">Kandinsky</a> painting. Ditko\u2019s panels were vibrant, a bit bonkers, and also prescient. By the second half of the 1960s, Doctor Strange had his own title, and anyone with a keen interest in psychedelics had a new favourite superhero.</p> <p>Just like the hippies themselves, Strange has been in and out of fashion ever since. But now, in 2016, his big moment has arrived. Alongside Cumberbatch, a premier-league cast has been assembled including Swinton (as the Ancient One), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chiwetel-ejiofor\">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/12/mads-mikkelsen-lars-von-trier-hannibal-danish-cinema\">Mads Mikkelsen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jul/24/rachel-mcadams-five-best-moments\">Rachel McAdams</a>. A production crew of more than 500 have created everything from functional operating theatres to opulent Greenwich Village interiors. They have even built an entire Hong Kong street \u2013 incorporating 35 shops stocked with goods \u2013 purely for the purposes of destroying it in a fight. And, of course, there are the special effects. The film\u2019s signature scene throws Strange into a Manhattan that has folded in on itself. And not metaphorically. Viewers might reasonably expect Marvel\u2019s take on Inception or The Matrix; the phrase commonly used on set is \u201cmind-bending\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad35db68bebf415ced3aa7bde3699b44a9c5e23d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad35db68bebf415ced3aa7bde3699b44a9c5e23d/14_0_1893_1136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One with Cumberbatch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One with Cumberbatch and the inevitable Marvel portal thing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marvel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a movie business that is increasingly plagued by nightmares of multi-million pound blockbusters crashing round its ears, and after a year of critical maulings for superhero films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/08/suicide-squad-hollywood-creativity-blockbuster-films\">Suicide Squad</a>, Marvel still has a palpable swagger.

Says executive producer Stephen Broussard: \u201cWe approached [the ethnicity in the film] from an honourable place. We want to show things that are fresh.

I think that Marvel is a magnet for big names because they love [the experience]. And there\u2019s a lot of things to love.\u201d</p> <p>For Derrickson, who persuaded the studios to hire him over the course of eight separate interviews, the scale of the ambition attracted him, too. \u201cI\u2019ll be shooting one scene and then doing some script revisions, and at the same time I\u2019ll be looking at VFX tests,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s never much down time, but I rather like that. Doctor Strange has long been my favourite Marvel comic book. I grew up reading them, and I do think it\u2019s the only comic that I\u2019m personally suited for because of the nature of the material. It\u2019s an aberration, and we\u2019re making a film that I think is a real left turn in the Marvel Comics Universe.\u201d</p> <p>Whether that turn will be a successful one remains to be seen, and a man with a cloak casting spells could sound a bit hokey (pocusey) for audiences. But then Chris Pratt as a modern-day Han Solo seemed a weird call until Guardians Of The Galaxy became a hit. Trailers have shown off Cumberbatch\u2019s wit as well as his kung fu skills, and you wouldn\u2019t bet against Marvel continuing the successful expansion of its \u201cuniverse\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f28367b6c5b5066d2363b6830aeb01c0c52436e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f28367b6c5b5066d2363b6830aeb01c0c52436e/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton with Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swinton with Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marvel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ever since Iron Man rocketed on to the screen eight years ago (feels longer, right?), Marvel\u2019s ambitions have grown in sync with its success.

Doctor Strange, it is widely held, will play a key role in helping weave disparate strands of narrative together, unless people feel they haven\u2019t had enough of superheroes by then.<br></p> <p>\u201cEvolve or die,\u201d says Derrickson of the challenge ahead for Marvel. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for any major studio to fearlessly evolve. But I think Marvel don\u2019t operate out of fear at all. Marvel now has the greatest library of intellectual property there is. I think that Marvel will continue to evolve and surprise audiences in the way they want to be surprised.\u201d</p> <p>Is he right? Only time will tell.

  "<p><strong>What is happening in the article 50 court case?</strong></p> <p>Judgment is awaited on whether parliament or the government has authority to give formal notification under article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union of the UK\u2019s intention to leave the EU. The government claims it is entitled to do so under the executive powers it has inherited from the crown under the royal prerogative. </p> <p><strong>How does this tie in with the article 50 case in Belfast?</strong><br></p> <p>A similar claim, which additionally stressed devolution law, has already been heard in the high court in Belfast. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement prevents Brexit being imposed on the people of Northern Ireland, Ronan Lavery QC told the court earlier this month. The former Northern Ireland justice minister, David Ford, nationalist and Green politicians have brought the claim. Judgment in that case is also awaited. Both claims, whichever way they go, are expected to be appealed directly to the UK\u2019s supreme court in Westminster. A hearing, probably in front of at least nine justices, has been pencilled in for early December. </p> <p><strong>Who has brought the cases?</strong><br></p> <p>While attention has focused on the lead claimant in London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/gina-miller-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-parliament-legal-challenge\">51-year-old Gina Miller</a>, a Guyanese-born and British-educated businesswoman, there are scores of other litigants and interveners. The second lead claimant there is Deir Dos Santos, a London hairdresser. Both Miller and Dos Santos are British citizens. Others funding the challenge include people living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, British expatriates living in the EU, Gibraltarians worried about the future status of the Rock and the children of non-EU nationals. All worry that Brexit may deprive them of existing rights. Death threats have been made against claimants, prompting the judges to warn that those interfering with the case could be imprisoned for contempt of court.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/article-50-legal-case-is-attempt-to-reverse-brexit-court-told\">Article 50 legal case 'is attempt to reverse Brexit', court told</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>If they win, could this stop Brexit?</strong><br></p> <p>Victory for the claimants would hand responsibility for triggering Brexit to MPs. Whether a majority would have the nerve to delay or defy the referendum result is unknown. Many, though personally committed remainers, may feel bound by the popular plebiscite. Other politicians might respect constituency pressures. Both the Scottish and Welsh devolved governments retained barristers on a watching brief at the London hearing. They could join the case at the supreme court, reinforcing legal opposition to Theresa May\u2019s executive action. </p> <p><strong>How worried is the government?</strong><br></p> <p>It is difficult to predict the outcome of a case. The attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, the government\u2019s most senior legal adviser, led its team of lawyers in London to demonstrate political commitment to Brexit. The judges hearing the case include the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, who at one point in the three-day hearing admitted that he was \u201cslightly baffled\u201d by government lawyers\u2019 arguments. Sir Terence Etherton, the new Master of the Rolls, asked whether the fact that parliament had not specified the precise limits of the royal prerogative meant that \u201cthe government can remove common law rights?\u201d The claimants have exploited the Bill of Rights 1689, a piece of legislation revered by Eurosceptics, pointing out that it \u201cexpressly prohibits the use of the prerogative in circumstances where its exercise would \u2018suspend\u2019 or \u2018dispense\u2019 statutory law\u201d. The outcome is hanging in the balance. </p> <p><strong>If it goes to the supreme court, then what?</strong><br></p> <p>Technically, there could be an appeal to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the EU\u2019s highest court, on a point of law. No one, however, wants the EU to decide on the limits of parliamentary sovereignty. If the supreme court rules against the government, parliament is likely to be given a vote on when, and possibly how, to trigger Brexit. </p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s paying?</strong><br></p> <p>Miller, who is an investment manager, has been funding her claim. Much of the additional cash has come from various crowdfunding websites. </p>",
  "<p>From Bowie to Brexit, it is generally agreed that 2016 has been a disaster of such epic proportions that the sooner we race to 31 December and start over, the better. But I\u2019d like to propose a slighty different take: it is also the year that people finally started to listen to the voices of women who have suffered sexual assault. Instead of dismissing them as faceless sluts who somehow brought this on themselves, public and politicians alike are saying: \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to draw my line right here.\u201d</p> <p>The ultimate example of this \u2013 the one looming just a little too close over your shoulder \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, whose campaign was finally derailed by his boasts about sexual assault. Trump has spent millions on his campaign, only to be exposed in a similar way to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/jimmy-savile\">Jimmy Savile</a> \u2013 in the sense that everything was always in plain sight, but few cared enough about the victims to complain. Until now. Since the leak of the tapes in which he shared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">his sexy assault tactics</a> with his grinning chimp of a sidekick Billy Bush (just when you think you\u2019ve plumbed the depths of the Bush family, there\u2019s always one more moron in the cupboard), the stories that have been around are finally being heard: the women whose breasts he grabbed, whose dressing rooms he strode into.</p> <p>Trump had been doing all of this for years; in many instances, he\u2019s done it on air. Back in 2004, when he was 58, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/14/media/donald-trump-on-lindsay-lohan/index.html\">he said on the radio</a> that he\u2019d like to sleep with the then 18-year-old Lindsay Lohan, because \u201cdeeply, deeply troubled women are the best in bed\u201d. Like Savile, Trump revelled in his brazenness: in 2006, when Howard Stern told Trump he was \u201ca sexual predator\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/19257-video-shows-trump-laughing-at-sexual-predator-label-during-howard-stern-interview\">he nodded with a laugh</a> while his daughter Ivanka \u2013 that self-described supporter of women \u2013 giggled and patted her father\u2019s shoulder.</p> <p>Like I say, none of this is new. In 1992, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-donald-trump-girls-chicago-tribune-archive-20161013-story.html\">the Chicago Tribune reported</a> that Trump told a pair of 14-year-old girls: \u201cIn a couple of years, I\u2019ll be dating you.\u201d Back then, that story was headlined Such A Comedian; this year, it is being retold as evidence of his unacceptable grossness. This is not about a gradual enlightening of attitudes; rather, a sharp corner has been turned.</p> <p>The pivot was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bill-cosby\">Bill Cosby</a>. Last year, New York magazine published its now iconic cover, featuring <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/NYMagCover_July27.jpg\">portraits of 35 of the women who accused Cosby of assaulting them</a>. It became impossible for people to keep ignoring them, as they had been for years (again, these were not new allegations). Whispered rumours of sexual assault are no longer seen as amusing or alpha male behaviour \u2013 boys will be boys! \u2013 even if Trump still seems to think they are. They are, finally, a bridge too far.</p> <p>The public is catching up with this quicker than&#xa0;the law or the media. Earlier this year, American student Brock Turner was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/stanford-swimmer-sexual-assault-brock-allen-turner-palo-alto\">convicted of sexually assaulting a woman</a>. Newspaper reports of the case invariably refer to Turner as the \u201cStanford swimmer\u201d, which is either Latin for \u201crapist\u201d (I&#xa0;didn\u2019t go to Stanford, so what do I&#xa0;know?) or a&#xa0;suggestion that Turner\u2019s education and hobbies are more important than his proclivity for sexual assault. After Turner was sentenced to just six months in prison, the victim\u2019s impact statement sparked widespread fury; a petition for the judge\u2019s removal has more than 1.3m signatures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/15/brexit-britain-where-not-wanted\">When the Tories talk about curbs on foreign workers, they don\u2019t mean me.

Whatever anyone thinks of the case, and the way the victim\u2019s sexual history was used to humiliate her in court, the contrast between Evans\u2019 demonstrably repulsive attitude towards women and the absurdly romantic depiction of his family life was like something out of the 80s. Nowhere in the interview was he asked whether he often creeps into hotel rooms to watch his friends having sex. Instead, there were photographs of Evans playing with his dogs like a&#xa0;modern-day St Francis, alongside the girlfriend who bankrolled his case, and their baby.</p> <p>Anita Hill, who knows this subject too well, recently wrote <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/10/10/what-can-still-learn-from-sexual-harassment/jCF5rxYbFMgE3bOKR984pI/amp.html\">an editorial in the Boston Globe</a>. \u201cResponses to sexual harassment and other forms&#xa0;of sexual violence must start with a belief that women matter as much as the powerful men they encounter,\u201d she argued. The powerful man Hill encountered, and whom in 1991 she accused of&#xa0;sexual harassment, is still sitting on the Supreme Court. But 2016 is looking a little different. The man who has become emblematic of all the worst&#xa0;things about male privilege and sexual entitlement is on the verge of being beaten to the&#xa0;highest political office by a woman. Things aren\u2019t perfect. But they\u2019re getting better. Step by&#xa0;step, woman by woman.</p>",
  "<p>Radicalism was in Angela&#xa0;Carter\u2019s blood. Her grandfather, Walter Farthing, was a soldier whose career took him&#xa0;around the Raj to Malabar, Rangoon and the Andaman Islands, a particularly brutal penal colony. What he saw there made him a revolutionary and he once chaired a meeting at which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-lenin\" title=\"\">Lenin</a> spoke. Except he didn\u2019t.<strong> </strong>The truth was less glamorous:<strong> </strong>Carter\u2019s grandfather, who died five years before she was born, was commended as an \u201cexemplary\u201d soldier, promoted to sergeant and eventually invalided out with an eye injury. The exciting life and times of Walter Farthing was a story by Carter. He was, as Edmund Gordon puts it in his finely judged and elegantly written biography, the \u201cgrandfather she would have designed for herself\u201d. \u201cI exaggerate terribly,\u201d she once warned a friend: \u201cI\u2019m a born fabulist.\u201d</p> <p>Though known for her novels and her journalism, it was as a fabulist that&#xa0;she found her widest readership with the reimagined fairytales of <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> \u2013 readers who have generated their own myths about her since her death in 1992. All in all, she is something of a biographer\u2019s nightmare, but, as the double meaning of his title suggests, Gordon is up for the challenge.</p> <p>Born in 1940, Angela Olive Stalker was the \u201cintensely loved and thoroughly spoiled\u201d daughter of Hugh, a journalist, and his wife, Olive. During the war she lived in Yorkshire with her grandmother, who told her stories. Grandmothers generally come out well in her&#xa0;fiction; mothers less so. Olive was a clinging presence who kept her daughter dependent by fattening her up until she was, her sister-in-law remembers, \u201cenormous\u201d. Carter\u2019s rebellion took the form of anorexia, and it left her with a complicated relationship to food. Gordon makes no trite elisions between the fiction and the life, but it&#xa0;is hard not to look at his illustrations in which Carter balloons and shrinks, becoming by turns vampish, boyish, girlish and bohemian, without thinking of all the metamorphoses and chimeras that recur in her work.</p> <p>Her writing life began in her early 20s in Bristol, where she and her first husband, Paul Carter, were part of the folk scene. The 60s were only just starting to swing and her early novels are set against a landscape more postwar than pop, of derelict houses and bombsites turning to waste ground. The first, <em>Shadowdance</em>, came out in 1966. Two more followed, establishing her as a promising writer, albeit not one likely to prop up the literary establishment. Shy, with a slight stammer, she veered from gauche to wildly outspoken. After a reading by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/06/stevie-smith-steel-soul-of-suburbs-novel-on-yellow-paper\" title=\"\">Stevie Smith</a> in 1968 she buttonholed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/asbyatt\" title=\"\">AS Byatt</a>, who recalled: \u201cThis very disagreeable woman stomped up to me and she said, \u2018My name\u2019s Angela Carter \u2026 and I&#xa0;wanted to stop and tell you that the sort of thing you\u2019re doing is no good at all.\u2019\u201d The \u201csort of thing\u201d she meant was the realist novel in which \u201cpeople drink tea and commit adultery\u201d.</p> <p>That year Carter won the Somerset Maugham Award, which funds young writers to travel. She went to Japan and on the way back left her wedding ring in an ashtray at Tokyo airport. The gesture was dramatically simple, the collapse of her marriage necessarily more complex, and Gordon faces thorny ethical questions in dealing with a life&#xa0;in&#xa0;living memory. Paul Carter, who declined to talk to him, has&#xa0;since died, and&#xa0;Gordon teases out&#xa0;the tangled facts with gentle even\u2011handedness, setting aside some of what Angela said as bravado, for she&#xa0;had been much in love when she got married. Unfortunately, what she said was often more vivid than the truth: her dismissal of Paul as a man \u201cwith a&#xa0;kiddie\u2019s windmill for a heart\u201d is&#xa0;as&#xa0;unforgettable as it is&#xa0;unfair.</p> <p>The visit to Japan marked a caesura in her writing and her life. She had love affairs, read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jorgeluisborges\" title=\"\">Borges</a> and found in Japanese culture a combination of delicacy and violence that fed her imagination, opening a way out of the constraints of realism. The work that followed divided critics, though her claim to have gone from being \u201cpromising\u201d to \u201cignored\u201d in two novels was another exaggeration. She became instead something of a cult writer and, as such, was at the mercy of her admirers. Gordon feels free to take issue with the doctrinaire strain of&#xa0;feminist critique that attempts to shoehorn Carter into a politically correct shape she doesn\u2019t fit.</p> <p>In her lifetime, relations with \u201cthe sisters\u201d, as she called them in inverted commas, were volatile. She was a feminist but her views were too peculiarly her own for any orthodoxy, and she was often accused of letting down a&#xa0;side she never joined. The biggest uproar came with her book on Sade, <em>The Sadeian Woman</em>, in which she aimed to \u201cgive the old monster his due\u201d for putting \u201cpornography at the service of women\u201d. Gordon thinks more highly of her argument than I do, but the book is certainly a daring raid on areas of sexual experience normally handled with the sterilised tongs of academic theory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/24/classics.angelacarter\">Helen Simpson on Angela Carter's Bloody Chamber</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually she found herself in a curious situation whereby, as she told the Sunday Times: \u201cI get a lot of stuff asking me to subscribe to anti-pornography groups and others asking me to subscribe to pro-pornography groups, but very little actual pornography.\u201d Her wit&#xa0;is one aspect of Carter that Gordon brings out in contrast to the ethereal Wise Witch myth that grew around her in middle age. Another is the sheer hard work it took to survive as a freelance writer. At times she seems to have spent almost all her waking hours hunched over a typewriter next to an overflowing ashtray, writing the journalism that made ends meet.</p> <p>Eventually the fiction paid, but it was years before shared houses and friends\u2019 spare rooms gave way to a home of her own.

She admired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie\" title=\"\">Salman Rushdie</a>, who became a close friend.</p> <p>Despite the need to be in control in relationships, she was in many ways helpless. She couldn\u2019t ride a bicycle, and on her third and last driving lesson she demolished a brick wall. It was repaired by Mark Pearce, the builder whom she met when he came to mend a pipe and who became her second husband. They had a son in 1983, and, to the disappointment of some of her admirers, she settled happily into family life until she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1991. She died the following year. \u201cThe <em>fin</em>,\u201d as she put it, had \u201ccome rather early in the <em>si\u00e8cle</em>\u201d.

Mainly, that it\u2019s exhausting: it\u2019s definitely preferable, wherever possible, to get some benign media oligarch to bung you a million quid to make a show. Having to power a crowdfunding campaign, then make a show, is a bit like having twins: you don\u2019t actually understand, half the time, how you\u2019re managing to do it.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We want to include paid internships for production and writing, to discover new talent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve so far raised \u00a372,000 and need \u00a3320,000 to make a final, tying-up-all-the-loose-ends episode (if we get more, we\u2019ll make more). Yes, I know \u2013 \u00a3320,000! You could literally buy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wolverhampton\">Wolverhampton</a> for that. But that\u2019s what TV costs and why a commission is so precious. It is a genuine privilege to be able to make a show. Also, we want to include paid internships for production and writing, in order to discover new talent. I essentially got my entire career when I won the Observer young reporter of the year award in 1990, and I\u2019ve never forgotten how, if you come from a working-class background, you feel you kind of need to be \u2026 invited to join the arts and media.

  "<p>Michael Fassbender is either one of the world\u2019s most well-adjusted human beings, or the most brilliant liar. \u201cI can lie pretty easily to journalists,\u201d he tells me, and he says he\u2019s good at it. \u201cI have to be.\u201d But as this is the policy a well-adjusted movie star might adopt, talking about it only reinforces the impression of someone unusually at peace with himself.</p> <p>Fassbender came to fame playing men who are decidedly not at peace with themselves. In 2008, he starred in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986233/\">Steve McQueen\u2019s debut film, Hunger</a>, as the Republican prisoner Bobby Sands on hunger strike. McQueen then cast him as a sex addict in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723811/\">Shame</a>, followed by a sadistic plantation owner in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/\">12 Years A Slave</a>. Fassbender has appeared in Fish Tank and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/19/inglourious-basterds-review-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino\">Inglourious Basterds</a>, played Carl Jung in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/16/a-dangerous-method-fantasy-female\">A Dangerous Method</a>, Mr Rochester in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/11/jane-eyre-philip-french-review\">Jane Eyre</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/\">Steve Jobs</a> in the eponymous biopic, as well as the mutant antihero Magneto in the X-Men franchise, and Macbeth. Once dubbed \u201cBritain\u2019s Brando\u201d, he brings to every part an intensity of commitment that makes audiences feel they are not watching a performance, but spying on a man\u2019s rawest private self. This sense of intrusion is both electrifying and unsettling; it can feel almost indecent.</p> <p>Twice nominated for an Oscar, the 39-year-old stars in three new films between now and January alone, one of which he also produced. And all this with barely a misstep (he opted not even to watch the 2010 flop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/02/jonah-hex-film-review\">Jonah Hex</a>), nor gossip column indiscretion. It is about as flawless a movie star career as would be possible to perfect. \u201cJesus, I know!\u201d he agrees. \u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s nuts. It\u2019s been pretty incredible.\u201d There is no actor alive, he says, with whom he would want to swap places. \u201cBut then, you know \u2013 and this is dead true \u2013 I\u2019ve never wanted to swap places with anyone.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is your own moral compass? You've got to stay true to that, regardless of what your loved one's compass is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fassbender has made 10 films back to back since 12 Years A Slave, and must be exhausted, but you wouldn\u2019t guess it. In fact, I\u2019m not sure I would have recognised him. He\u2019s wearing board shorts when we meet in a Soho hotel, having been to the gym that morning, and his face is covered in a careless fuzz of gingery hair. I hadn\u2019t expected his accent to have survived 20 years in London, nor so many roles demanding different nationalities, but he still sounds unmistakably Irish. He has that actorly alchemy which makes his face look quite different in every film, so it\u2019s a surprise to find that in real life he looks like Sharon\u2019s brother Fergal in Channel 4\u2019s Catastrophe.</p> <p>We are about to see him in a stunning film adaptation of the 2012 novel, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2547584/\">The Light Between Oceans</a>, set on a remote island off Western Australia shortly after the first world war. Fassbender plays Tom, a taciturn veteran who takes a job as a lighthouse keeper, soothed by the isolation until he falls in love with a vivacious young woman from the mainland, Isabel, and marries her. The couple are torn apart by two successive miscarriages, and when a rowing boat washes up containing a dead young man and a crying baby girl, Isabel implores Tom to let her keep her. Against every instinct, he agrees and they pass the baby off as their own. \u201cWhat I liked about it is, it\u2019s a film about decent people,\u201d Fassbender says. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not, \u2018Here\u2019s the baddie, here\u2019s the goodie.\u2019 That\u2019s the great thing about the story.

I would like to think that I would do the same as him.\u201d</p> <p>In the film, Tom delivers the anguished line, \u201cWe have to do what\u2019s right\u201d, even when that means hurting people you love. \u201cI think you have to be true to yourself in life,\u201d Fassbender says. \u201cWhat is your own moral compass? You\u2019ve got to stay true to that, regardless of what your loved one\u2019s compass is, because we\u2019re all individuals. You can co-exist with somebody and love somebody, but I think if we\u2019re honest with ourselves, we know what our make up is, and what sits well with us and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Fassbender dries up when I ask about the biggest moral dilemma he has ever faced himself. \u201cOh shit.\u201d He falls silent for 10 seconds. \u201cI don\u2019t know. There are so many, I guess. Let me think about it.\u201d He pauses again. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours? Then maybe I\u2019ll get an idea.\u201d</p> <p>He does this a lot, turning a question back to me or throwing out one of his own. It\u2019s a very likable quality in a person, but not ideal in an interviewee, and he deploys the device to deflect attention from anything he\u2019d rather not say. I offer up a number of my own moral challenges, hoping for the best, but when it\u2019s his turn he offers an apologetic grin. \u201cI\u2019m so guarded. I feel a little uncomfortable. I\u2019m not going to say.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c321a429c9bd28ddf4cde268ddb4a4979d83a2e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c321a429c9bd28ddf4cde268ddb4a4979d83a2e6/67_56_5094_6363/801.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Fassbender\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t worry about things I can\u2019t control.

Fassbender feels less confident now than he thought he did about where he stands on forgiveness. \u201cWell, it\u2019s the only way forward, I do believe that. For the person that is forgiving, for sure, more than the person that needs forgiveness. There\u2019s a great line in the film about it: you only have to forgive once and it\u2019s done; but if you don\u2019t, you have to carry on and on resenting.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses. \u201cBut I was thinking about this, this morning. I ended up watching one of those videos online, I don\u2019t know how I got on to it, but it was five girls beating up this girl \u2013 teenagers \u2013 and I thought, oh God, it\u2019s so brutal. And then it led to another video of this 15-year-old girl in McDonald\u2019s in New York being kicked to the ground. They were stomping on her head and they pulled out her hair extensions. There was a group of five or six of them. I thought, \u2018God, if I was that girl\u2019s parent, I don\u2019t know if I could forgive that.\u2019 Because I was watching it myself, not as a parent, and I thought, God, those girls are vile.\u201d</p> <p>When Fassbender was a teenager, he used to let everything get to him. \u201cI was a bit of a worrywart. I would just sit worrying.\u201d About? \u201cAnything.\u201d Aids? Nuclear war? \u201cOh yes.\u201d Getting someone pregnant? \u201cExactly, yes.\u201d Failing exams? \u201cAbsolutely. And pimples. I had a lot of pimples. So yes, and then I\u2019d be sitting there going, \u2018I\u2019m not worrying about anything \u2013 what should I be worrying about?\u2019\u201d He laughs and shakes his head.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve tried to work on not doing that. I don\u2019t worry about things I can\u2019t control. I don\u2019t spend much time looking back, because I think it\u2019s pointless. There are mistakes that have been made, perhaps, but mainly it\u2019s just experiences. Things that gnaw at you, that you have no control to change, are pointless. And if you\u2019re not careful, you can start almost to enjoy that self-obsessive martyrdom and self-loathing. Things can become patterns that become comfortable, because they become habitual. I learned that sort of stuff doing Shame \u2013 how patterns become safety blankets, even if they\u2019re fucking killing you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cab9ae114f839a1ba5348cecf6dadf312a63058\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cab9ae114f839a1ba5348cecf6dadf312a63058/713_29_2233_1341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Fassbender in Shame\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As a sex addict in Shame, 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c.FoxSearch/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only residual trace of resentment I glimpse comes when I ask how he felt about finding himself sexually objectified, after Shame was released. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/12/shame-film-review-fassbender\">The film</a> featured an awful lot more full-frontal nudity from Fassbender than audiences are accustomed to seeing from a male lead, and caused something of a sensation.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I guess at times I was like, \u2018Well, you know there\u2019s so much more to the film than me with my cock out.\u2019 One journalist kicked things off saying, \u2018So what\u2019s it like to have a big cock?\u2019 That was the first thing she said to me. And then she said that I was flirting with her in the interview. Total bullshit, you know. The whole interview was so wrong.\u201d He looks properly offended, then shrugs.</p> <p>\u201cBut again, you know, it sells more to paint that picture of me than of a guy who wasn\u2019t interested and was nonsexual towards her. So I get all that. I suppose I took myself more seriously back then. My mum always says, whenever we\u2019re watching a film, \u2018Oh here we go again. The women are always naked, and the guy is always covered up.\u2019\u201d He smiles. \u201cSo I was like, this one\u2019s for you, Mum.\u201d</p> <p>Fassbender\u2019s parents weren\u2019t thrilled when he announced he wanted to be an actor. He was born in Heidelberg in 1977 \u2013 his father is German, hence the name \u2013 but when he was two, the family moved to County Kerry, where they opened a restaurant. At 16, Fassbender began working alongside them, and took up acting in his spare time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was so lucky. I thought, I\u2019ll just keep knocking on the door \u2013 and when the opportunity comes, I\u2019m going to take it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey wanted me to go to university, because they were of that generation when anybody who went to university had security and got a good job.\u201d Fassbender\u2019s sister took a degree and became a neuropsychologist, but he knew academia wasn\u2019t for him, and he told his parents he wanted to act. \u201cThey said, \u2018Go to university first\u2019, and I was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to waste time and money, I need to do this now.\u2019\u201d The argument continued until, at 17, he directed his own stage production of Reservoir Dogs. \u201cThey saw me put on that play and they thought, \u2018Shit, he\u2019s serious.\u2019 When they saw that I\u2019d made up my mind, they knew that\u2019s what I was going to do, and I have to say they supported me immediately after that.\u201d</p> <p>Success appeared miraculously effortless at first. He won a place at drama school in London, and before even graduating had landed an agent and a part in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/\">Steven Spielberg\u2019s TV mini-series Band Of Brothers</a>. And then... nothing. After two years in Los Angeles, Fassbender had clocked up a grand total of six weeks\u2019 work, and returned to London, where long periods of bartending were relieved by the occasional part in Holby or a TV commercial. Reluctantly, he was forced to have \u201ca conversation with myself where I said, what else can I do?\u201d Opening a restaurant was the best he could come up with, and \u201cit wasn\u2019t something I wanted to do\u201d. But despite all this, he says the years of unemployment were \u201cfine, really. There are a lot of good actors who are still in that position at 40. Bundles of them. I was so fucking lucky. I thought, I\u2019ll just keep knocking on the door \u2013 and when the opportunity comes, I\u2019m going to take it.\u201d</p> <p>The opportunity came with Hunger. Under McQueen\u2019s direction, Fassbender established his reputation as an unusually intelligent actor, but protests, \u201cI\u2019m definitely not in the intelligent bracket. I mean, I was never academically smart. I don\u2019t really consider myself intelligent. I just have a good \u2013 if I have, I don\u2019t know \u2013 intuition. I\u2019m a very intuitive person, and I guess I think very simply.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him to explain. \u201cWell, I just think, \u2018Oh, the character might do something like that because he has an inferiority complex, so therefore he\u2019s sadistic towards somebody else\u2019, or whatever. That\u2019s a very crude example, but I just keep things very simple. If I can make them logical to myself, then I apply them, and that\u2019s really it. But there are a lot of very intelligent actors out there, I would say. I just think maybe what comes across as unintelligent is, we end up talking about ourselves an awful lot. And that\u2019s sort of boring and unintelligent and uninteresting. That is the danger of the job, because it\u2019s a lot of thinking about a character, and thinking about yourself, and so one can fall into that trap pretty quickly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aae9dee393803b17323db2b9da71d91f391740b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aae9dee393803b17323db2b9da71d91f391740b7/0_654_1653_992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Fassbender with his mother at the 2014 Oscars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his mother at the 2014 Oscars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ethan Miller/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s certainly true that journalists don\u2019t ask plumbers to talk them through how they repair a boiler. \u201cNo. And they don\u2019t say to plumbers, \u2018Oh, it must have been very difficult work.\u2019 And yet people are out there working long hours every day.\u201d</p> <p>If Fassbender was hoping to disprove his intelligence, this doesn\u2019t really swing it. It only leaves me even more puzzled by the appeal, for him, of blockbuster roles in action movies such as X-Men. Why would someone who can lead a film such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/the-light-between-oceans-review-michael-fassbender-alicia-vikander\">The Light Between Oceans</a> want to play a comic book mutant?

That\u2019s satisfying. They\u2019re hard to make, the big ones.

He appears in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3305308/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_5\">Trespass Against Us</a> this autumn, co-produced by DMC, and the production company\u2019s first major film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2094766/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4\">Assassin\u2019s Creed</a>, will be released on 1 January, starring Fassbender opposite Marion Cotillard, his Macbeth co-star. Only eight years ago, he couldn\u2019t even land a part; what does he still long for, beyond his reach? \u201cI\u2019d like to try and direct,\u201d he says softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see, you know. I hate to say it and then for it never to happen. But I\u2019d like to try and do that.\u201d</p> <p>What he really needs, he admits, is a break. He claims to be \u201cvery good at doing nothing\u201d, and got rid of his TV 10 years ago because \u201cI end up watching shit \u2013 I\u2019ll be watching the God channel at one in the morning. I could watch anything, so I thought I\u2019d just get rid of it.\u201d He is still in the same Hackney flat he bought 10 years ago, but wants to move, and is toying with the idea of moving to the countryside. He took up surfing four years ago, and spends any free time he gets on the water, but doesn\u2019t fancy moving to LA because it\u2019s too much of an \u201cindustry town\u201d. He thinks about San Francisco, and Austin or New Orleans. \u201cBut I like Europe, you know. I really do enjoy Europe.\u201d</p> <p>By the time he has located himself across two potential continents, it\u2019s clear that his vagueness has more to do with privacy than indecision; he doesn\u2019t even want to say where he goes surfing. He maintains that fame hasn\u2019t changed his life terribly; he\u2019s still close to the mates he grew up with, and has made several more Irish friends in London. But it\u2019s interesting that he says he \u201cstreamlined\u201d his friendship circle at 30, the year before Hunger\u2019s release; I\u2019d guess he knew his status was about to change.</p> <p>He has \u201ca few\u201d celebrity friends, but they wouldn\u2019t be in his top five. \u201cI always think if you\u2019ve got five friends that you can definitely depend on, that\u2019s a lot, and I definitely have that.\u201d He can walk out of the hotel without strangers screaming at him. \u201cAnd I walk around the streets.

Give me a distance: where am I walking to?\u201d Imagine walking out of the hotel, I suggest, stopping in a newsagent on his way through Soho, and walking on. But before I\u2019ve even got him to Oxford Circus, a distance of less than a mile, he says, \u201cOK, I would have been stopped three or four times.\u201d That\u2019s a lot! He looks embarrassed, and quickly tries to backtrack \u2013 \u201cBut, but there could be nothing\u201d \u2013 as if worried it sounded like he was showing off.</p> <p>One of the ways he has maintained some privacy is by keeping his romantic relationships away from the cameras. In the past he has been linked to actors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/zoe-kravitz\">Zo\u00eb Kravitz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2718512/\">Nicole Beharie</a>, but he will have a job remaining under the radar now that he is going out with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alicia-vikander\">Alicia Vikander</a>, his Swedish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2016/sep/01/venice-film-festival-2016-the-light-between-oceans-premiere-in-pictures\">co-star in The Light Between Oceans</a>. They make a luminous on-screen couple, and he concedes awkwardly that \u201cI suppose it translates, yes. Obviously chemistry is something that is tangible.\u201d Their relationship maybe made the sex scenes slightly less uncomfortable, he agrees, but with every syllable he is withdrawing farther into himself. If the gossip columns are hoping for the next Brangelina, they will be disappointed.</p> <p>It\u2019s no easy trick to sustain an impression of casual normality while guarding one\u2019s privacy so closely. I suspect the easy classlessness of being Irish helps, and he agrees at once. \u201cI definitely still consider myself Irish. Yes, yes. And I\u2019m definitely European.\u201d After 20 years in London, does any part of him feel British? \u201cI would never consider myself British,\u201d he says firmly. Does he mind being claimed by our media for a Brit? He laughs. \u201cWell, they only do it if I\u2019m doing well. If I\u2019m not, I\u2019m Irish.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Light Between Oceans is released on 1 November, Assassin\u2019s Creed is released on 1 January</p>",

From there it spirals out to a world of imagination interleaved with history. I wanted to write a novel about the conditions left behind by a century of political revolution, and about a present moment that is as intricate as a single lifetime. I immersed myself in the expressive worlds of music, the filial act of copying, survival in an age of destruction, in the effort to understand how a person tries to be free. Bach\u2019s <em>Goldberg Variations</em> played in my head and on the page, showing me how structural constraint \u2013 limitations on freedom \u2013 might provoke artistic creativity, individuality, resonance. To write a novel is to find many other ways of being alive. I wanted to bring to life not myself and not my mother, but the imaginary and forever incomplete world between us.

What I actually did want to write was of course harder to say.</p> <p>As so often happens, I stumbled into it by chance. In the autumn of 2012, I wrote a 30-page story for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/15/granta-list-british-novelists\">Granta</a>. It was called \u201cEuropa\u201d and it was about a Hungarian prostitute and her male minders, one of whom is also her boyfriend, travelling to London for a week of high-end money-making. At the time I was disenchanted with the whole enterprise of writing fiction, and this simple, self-contained little tale was a way of feeling my way back to some sort of enthusiasm for it. In that respect, it certainly succeeded, because I found that by the spring of 2013 I had a definite appetite for writing more. Specifically, I had this idea of a book of stories that would speak to each other somehow, that would work together to express things that none of them would be able to express on their own. Such a book would need some kind of unifying scheme or structure.</p> <p>The first idea was that it would be a book about Europe \u2013 that each of the stories, like \u201cEuropa\u201d, would be about a person or a group of people from one European country travelling, for some reason, to another European country. It would be a book about the extreme human fluidity of contemporary Europe. (This was, remember, three and a half years ago, and the word Brexit didn\u2019t even exist \u2026) These ideas, of a Europe in motion, are of course there in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/09/all-that-is-man-by-david-szalay-review\"> <em>All That Man Is</em></a>, but it was quickly clear to me, as I pondered my unwritten book back in 2013, that the European theme was really just that \u2013 a theme, not a structure. It was simply not strong enough to fuse the disparate stories (only one of which had then been written) into a single, unified, indivisible work. Something more was needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95b24237621a9c06633a40f91764f402b9aa552a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95b24237621a9c06633a40f91764f402b9aa552a/557_318_5203_3122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Szalay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Szalay: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to write a conventional novel.

During my disenchantment with fiction, I had spent a while tinkering ineffectually with traditional verse forms, and one of the very worst poems I had written was a sonnet on the subject of the three ages of man. Happening to reread it one afternoon, I had one of those rare, clarifying moments that all creative artists are so grateful for \u2013 those moments when the door that you have been battering yourself against for weeks or months just swings open of its own accord. The book would be a series of stories about progressively older male protagonists \u2013 starting in adolescence and ending in retirement \u2013 and their stories would embody the massively simple and seemingly timeless notion of life as three stages: youth, maturity and old age.</p> <p>I then just wrote the stories. Initially there were seven, a nod, perhaps, to Shakespeare. Later I expanded the number to nine, first of all to smooth over a couple of jumps that seemed too abrupt \u2013 I was very keen for time to sneak up on my men, as it does in life \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/50387\">Ah! yet doth beauty</a> like a dial-hand,/ Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived\u201d \u2013 and also to achieve the pleasing symmetry of three stories for each of the three ages. All of the stories, with the exception of \u201cEuropa\u201d, were conceived specifically to fit into their place in the structure of the book: this was not a collection of disparate material organised opportunistically into book-form; it was the form of a single book organising the material of reality into conformity with its conception.</p> <p>\u2022 Published by Vintage.

This is a massive, daunting subject, and I did not know where it would take me. However, I knew from the start that I would call it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/23/hot-milk-deborah-levy-review-novel\"><em>Hot Milk</em></a>, for the many queasy associations this title triggers. A mother and daughter would embark on a modern pilgrimage to seek a cure for a mysterious and undiagnosed illness. It would be set in an ideologically turbulent and fragile Europe \u2013 but where? In the end I decided to land my characters in a fishing village in the semi-desert of southern Spain, a landscape I know well. Over the years, I had observed how the desert is never silent and never still \u2013 the cries of small animals at night, the shrubs that vibrate with invisible insects, all of this had got under my skin.</p> <p>I wanted to use this parched, vast terrain to write about a young woman in her 20s who is ashamed of her small life and of her own despair. She would be the main carer for her mother, who perhaps (this was not set in stone) uses her various aches and pains as a means to control her daughter and keep her by her side, way after she should have left home. The theme of hypochondria offered a rich menu to explore the ways in which the body speaks for us. It\u2019s a strange language, this grammar made from mysterious symptoms that apparently defy diagnosis. It\u2019s as if the hypochondriac wants to mess up the story a physician might offer her, a bid to not be pinned down to a single narrative. Likewise, it\u2019s hard to pin down <em>Hot Milk</em> to a single storyline; there are multiple stories about the contemporary world within the main daughter-mother relationship.</p> <p>Yet, I was very taken by a deceptively simple quote from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2010/nov/05/helene-cixous-france\">H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous</a>: \u201cWe live in a history not a story.\u201d The history of the daughter in <em>Hot Milk</em>, Sofia, is that she has witnessed how her mother\u2019s wishes and hopes for herself have been lost in the winds and storms of a world that is not arranged to her advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1640b6d801d278494982dfda78af2e62e318f081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1640b6d801d278494982dfda78af2e62e318f081/889_422_3608_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Levy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deborah Levy: \u2018I wanted to write about hypochondria.

The novel is her anthropological gaze on everything. To my surprise, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/neil-gaiman-top-10-mythical-characters\">Medusa myth</a> and her monstrous gaze began to tiptoe lightly through my book. <em>Hot Milk</em> puts the Medusa to work to ask Sofia a question: what is so \u201cmonstrous\u201d about a young woman, who constantly has to endure the violence of the ways in which she is societally gazed upon, returning that gaze full-on?

One story he told me will be lodged in my mind and heart forever. It involved a boy whose father had sexually abused him for years, and whose mother had been complicit in the abuse. The boy killed his father, and will live the rest of his life in prison. A year later, when I set myself the task of writing a novel, that story resurfaced in me: why do we hurt the people we love? Why is denial so powerful? Can we ever escape the identity we\u2019re born into? What does it mean to be free?</p> <p>To be honest, the answers to these questions frightened me. I was scared to confront my optimism for fear that it would be shot down with painful truths such as \u201cThere is no such thing as altruism,\u201d and \u201cViolence and trauma are basic elements of life on Earth,\u201d and \u201cThere is no escaping who I am,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll only be truly free when I\u2019m dead.\u201d That fear was the flare that lit the path to discovering my narrator, Eileen Dunlop, and ways by which she could narrate through these complex and disturbing issues.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/eileen-by-ottessa-moshfegh-review-bell-jar\"><em>Eileen</em></a> was to be my first novel, and I wanted it to appeal to a wide range of readers, from those literary types who had known me as a short-story writer, to travellers who might be browsing through the airport bookstore looking for a quick read on a flight. I decided to take a traditional novel structure and see what would arise if I followed certain narrative cues (plot points, you could say). I even bought a book called <em>The 90 Day Novel</em> to educate myself about the stylistic and structural conventions of mainstream fiction. I laughed at how simply the three-act structure of the novel was laid out, as though art could be made by plugging random variables into an algebraic formula.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4d4317090996a0fbaa686a962c683b4a7e141a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4d4317090996a0fbaa686a962c683b4a7e141a1/25_117_2077_1246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ottessa Moshfegh:\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ottessa Moshfegh: \u2018Why do we hurt the people we love?

These are the questions that frightened me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Marker/BFA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I saw that the structure existed as a distillation of works over the past century, what we\u2019ve come to understand as \u201cclassics\u201d. The structure is very much like the three-act structure used as a template in Hollywood films. I liked the idea of a reading experience that played with a reader\u2019s canned expectations. So I took the traditional form and said: \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d I thought it would be an interesting creative experiment, sure, but I also knew it was the perfect architecture to house the larger question at hand: can you be free within the confines of a system? I discovered that I could not, but that limitations can sometimes lead to ingenuity.</p> <p>So I invented Eileen. She is a single woman in her early 20s in a small town in coastal New England. She works at the juvenile prison and cares for her alcoholic father, a retired cop. I chose to set the book in 1964 because America was on the precipice of a great cultural transformation at that time, and I envisioned Eileen\u2019s story as a transformation, too. I decided to make Eileen\u2019s story run in tandem with the inspiring story of the young man in prison; his was not my story to tell, but Eileen\u2019s felt very close to my own, at least emotionally. Lastly, I envisioned the book as a satire, which gave me permission to push the narrative into awkward extremes. Why did I not take a straightforward approach? When you look directly into the eyes of the beast, it attacks you. It is best to come around from the side. More is revealed to you that way.</p> <p>\u2022 Published by Vintage.

What made the case exceptional, however, was not the violence itself, but rather that Rivi\u00e8re then wrote an eloquent account of what he had done. In 1838, a Stornoway tenant farmer named Malcolm MacLeod strangled his wife Henrietta. A relative testified that he \u201chad a peculiar temper owing to some strange notions he had formed in his head\u201d; yet in a letter to his brother written from prison, MacLeod was capable of writing this: \u201cWhat can I say to you but I have a low eye and a trembling heart and a low hope that the Lord have mercy on me, a poor cursed man.\u201d</p> <p>This idea of an individual capable of an act of terrible violence yet also able to write articulately about what they have done fascinates me, and was the initial spur for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/12/his-bloody-project-by-graeme-macrae-burnet-review\"><em>His Bloody Project</em></a>. My research led me to the concept originating in 19th-century criminal psychology of \u201cmania without delirium\u201d or \u201cmoral insanity\u201d, a condition whereby an individual might be seized by \u201cparoxysms of maniacal fury\u201d, yet at all other times appear to be fully in possession of their reason. My protagonist, Roddy Macrae, a 17-year-old crofter who kills three people in the tiny village of Culduie in 1869, began to form in my mind.</p> <p>It was quite natural for me to set my story in the barren but stunning landscapes of Wester Ross. My mother\u2019s side of the family comes from there and I have been visiting the area all my life. The Scottish Highlands, however, is not the rural idyll imagined by the Victorians. It has a dark history of clan warfare and later of the brutal \u201cclearances\u201d, when crofters were forced off the land to make way for the more profitable ventures of sheep farming and gaming estates. An inventory of 25 regulations governing the lives of crofters in Lewis in 1881 brought home to me the draconian nature of the regimes under which the native population lived. The cropping of heather from the hills, taking fish from the burns, harvesting shellfish or even seaweed from the shore: all were outlawed. Thus, the feudal conditions under which Roddy Macrae lives form a backdrop to his crimes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a361038bdaa7214a96e4ab2324cae079de62d3e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a361038bdaa7214a96e4ab2324cae079de62d3e1/769_53_4217_2530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graeme Macrae Burnet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graeme Macrae Burnet: \u2018I was fascinated by the idea of an individual capable of terrible violence, and also writing articulately about it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But historical research and abstract ideas alone will not bring a novel to life.

An Iranian-run power plant was among the first sites that the extremists seized, shortly after 3am. The attack left at least 16 workers dead.</p> \n<p>Kurdish forces rushed to Kirkuk to defend the city and, in doing so, at least partly fulfilled another of the group\u2019s goals: relieving pressure on it in the main battlefield, where Iraqi and peshmerga forces continue to face intense resistance as they grind towards Mosul.</p> \n<p>Iraqi police said on Saturday morning that the assault was over. Brigadier General Khattab Omer said that all the attackers were killed or blew themselves up. </p> \n<p>The past five days have seen clashes on a larger scale and intensity than at any time in the 28 months since Isis seized Mosul. While both the Iraqi and Kurdish military said ahead of the battle that it would not be easy, the willingness of Isis to stand its ground has surprised senior officers, among them an Iraqi commander stationed 10 kilometres from Hamdaniya, once the largest Christian town in Iraq.</p> \n<p>\u201cFalluja took five weeks and Ramadi took five months [to reclaim],\u201d said Col Hamid Samariae. \u201cThis will be somewhere in between, maybe two months. \u201cThey shoot mortars at us and send suicide bombers, but they don\u2019t often stand and shoot.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-21T08:43:30.html\" data-alt=\"Kirkuk locator\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-21T08:43:30.html\">Kirkuk locator</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The colonel sat alongside peshmerga officers in traditional dress and was insistent that relations between both sides remained warm as the jointly conducted war neared its second week. </p> \n<p>Down the hill, giant Shia flags fluttered from artillery pieces.

Its recapture would mark a significant moment for the state military, which fractured as Isis surged towards them in June 2014.

Market reforms have been driving down wages and security for decades now, and driving up profits, creating complex troubles and difficulties that only a burgeoning public sector can even hope to solve. Yet try telling a neoliberal that the only thing money can solve is poverty. She\u2019ll tell you, rather counterintuitively, that poverty is the only thing money can\u2019t solve. Go figure.</p> <p>However, a modest experiment drives a coach and horses through such ideological fences. Research conducted in Britain and the US has found that giving financial incentives to economically disadvantaged pupils does wonders for GCSE results. Carrying with it echoes of the last Labour administration\u2019s educational maintenance allowance, which went in the coalition\u2019s first bonfire of the sanities, the idea is pretty similar, but more motivation based. It\u2019s payment by results, with children as its targets. But don\u2019t let that put you off.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/21/offer-cash-rewards-to-underachievers-to-boost-gcse-results-study-says\" title=\"\">An experiment</a> involving 10,600 pupils has found that offering cash incentives of up to \u00a380 per half-term improves the results of underachievers by up to 10%. Progress is most marked in maths and science.</p> <p>For some, such blatant marketisation of the classroom will be anathema. Children and schools are already driven far too narrowly by the idea that education is something you do to further your career prospects. Why, oh, why can\u2019t education be promoted as a joy and a pleasure in itself, a way of helping children understand their own strengths and their own potential?</p> <p>The answer? Such ideals are wonderfully desirable. But they can work only when the classroom is surrounded on all sides by a society that is keen to model itself on the needs and desires of decent people, not the needs and desires of \u201cwealth creators\u201d.</p> <p>Schools, I\u2019m afraid, really do have to prepare young people for the world in which they will live. And this world gets nastier, pushier, more selfish and more cut-throat by the day, despite the best efforts of millions. The awful truth is that idealism doesn\u2019t have much of a place in the classroom because it doesn\u2019t have much of a place in the screwed-up mainstream.</p> <p>People who cling to the idea that the classroom is currently free of financial incentives are kidding themselves anyway. Currently, those incentives are subtle and indirect, built into what used to be called \u201cthe rat race\u201d but is now called \u201cthe aspirational society\u201d. Anyone from a background secure enough to allow them a chance to look at the world can see from an early age that poverty is ugly and scary, hard work for next to no pay, something to be feared.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re no longer being a sucker for the dream of joining the people who look down on you: you\u2019re being pragmatic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those who are already in that position?

Making an effort to get out from the bottom of the heap? Why try, why advertise your hope, when you can see that the system is rigged against you? The fear of failure becomes terrifying.</p> <p>Acceptance is the last stage of grief. Why not cut to the chase? Underachievement at school is an intractable problem, because for many children it\u2019s a coping technique to maintain a modicum of emotional resilience, a way of resisting a foul competition in which losers are punished mercilessly by winners, no matter how big a head start they had.</p> <p>What if you\u2019re not trying at school, being attentive in class, engaging, because you know you first have to be an underachiever to be rewarded, and there\u2019s cold, hard cash, or tokens that will get you cool things at the end of it? You\u2019re no longer being a sucker for the weird, abstract dream of joining the people who look down on you: you\u2019re being pragmatic. You\u2019re making your life better in just a few weeks.

No need for anyone to know that maybe there\u2019s a smidgen of abstract joy and pleasure there too.</p> <p>The flaw in the argument is that those who really try but end up disappointed will be punished by life just as hard as if they\u2019d never even bothered.

This is mainly because employers are not obliged to provide references (unless specifically included in the original employment contract or in certain regulated occupations such as financial services); there is no advantage to the ex-employer in providing such a reference; and a growing fear of litigation for having provided a misleading reference makes companies wary of saying anything at all.</p> <p>When such a refusal incurs no penalty, and when the provision potentially opens them up to legal action, it\u2019s easy to see why companies choose to do nothing. And there\u2019s very little the former employee, whose potential new employer is understandably demanding references, can do about it.</p> <p>In the case above where 10 years or more have passed since the employee last worked for those two companies, their failure to provide references or respond to requests doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. Since employers can\u2019t be forced to provide references, the frustrated employee has to think of alternatives.</p> <p>In both cases, personal references can&#xa0;help fill the gap, and can certainly provide reassurance on questions of character \u2013 the more authoritative the referee, of course, the better. Ex-teachers or university tutors are often happy to oblige. It\u2019s also worth thinking of senior people who have left the company you used to work for, but with whom you had a good relationship. Their endorsements can\u2019t, of course, be official and shouldn\u2019t pretend to be \u2013 but&#xa0;by assembling quite a number of such \u201cunofficial\u201d references you can provide substantial comfort to the recruiting company.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 I couldn\u2019t get a reference due to the company ceasing trading, but I got a statement of employment dates from the pension scheme they moved funds into when the company scheme closed. I then had a reference from volunteering and a personal reference. <strong>ajchm</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Just provide potential employers with contact details when asked for a reference and hope for the best. Besides, it\u2019s not unusual for references not to be followed up. <strong>walkinginthesand</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s the duty of the new employer to contact the old one to confirm any information, quite often through a background check company who will go through your CV to check all your claims. <strong>whatamilike</strong></p> <p><strong> \u2022 </strong>Ask the HR department at your previous company instead. They will normally just give confirmation that you worked there and the start and end dates.<strong> Vinnyr</strong></p> <h2>My daughter\u2019s probation service job has put her in a false and difficult position</h2> <p><strong>My daughter works for the probation service. She started as a part-time receptionist and had a long commute, but early in the spring was accepted for a full-time post supporting clients in her home town.</strong></p> <p><strong>The job has been bedevilled from the start. First, the company took well over six months to relocate her, arguing that it was designing the job package as it was a new post. She then discovered the post was designed for a probation service user, to reintroduce workplace experience. When she complained that she felt uncomfortable that she was not regarded as a bona-fide employee, her manager said she was there \u201cto break down discrimination\u201d.&#xa0;But my daughter is not a \u201cservice user\u201d and has therefore been placed in a false position.</strong></p> <p><strong>After doing three weeks\u2019 training she has been placed in the local office, where she is given literally nothing to do. She\u2019s been told she cannot offer to help other staff in any way, as that is not her job. When she tried to help a colleague with a new computer protocol that my daughter was familiar with, she was reprimanded. Her manager has simply said she should \u201cresearch training opportunities on the internet\u201d. </strong></p> <p><strong>She desperately wants to leave, which is a shame as she entered the probation service with a keen desire to work with clients. Her position is further weakened by the fact her new role is only a short contract, whereas her previous role (taken before the probation service was privatised) was a permanent contract.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>As I am sure you are aware, the part-privatisation of the probation service has not been without its critics, and the National Audit Office, among others, has raised a number of concerns. It seems as if your daughter is the helpless victim of a lengthy process of organisational change that has yet to be completed.</p> <p>However, it can\u2019t be in her company\u2019s interests that this bizarre situation is allowed to continue. I can quite understand her disillusionment and wanting to get out \u2013 but she has a vocational drive to help rehabilitate clients and I can think of no obvious alternative jobs to which she could turn.</p> <p>So I believe you should encourage her to hang on in there for a little while yet. A privatised company, conscious of the need at the very least to cover its costs, is surely not going to go on paying someone to do nothing for much longer.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your daughter believed she had been offered a full-time role supporting probation service users. This sounded like a good step up from being a part-time receptionist, so she accepted. Once in post it seems as if she has been mistaken for a service user herself. There must be emails and paperwork \u2013 not least an offer of employment \u2013 which can clarify what exactly was offered to her. <strong>Theresa Thomson</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your daughter should take a long and hard look at her files in the HR department and find out how she became a \u201cprobation service user\u201d. Her manager, by the sound of it, may not be aware that she is not. Also, you should seek legal advice. Obviously your daughter would be better off in another working environment, but I cannot see how a reference showing that she was employed as a probation service user could do her any good. <strong>Aranzazu</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

  "<p>It beggars belief that there can be clauses in a property contract which allow a freeholder to backdate the ground rent and then present an extortionate bill to the unsuspecting buyer of a flat. That we can run a story about Kadian Kennelly, who was expected to pay ground rent of \u00a38,000 a year, and as much as \u00a38m in the future (yes, on her one-bed flat), shows the staggering greed at the extreme end of this \u201cmarket\u201d. But perhaps we can thank her freeholder for one thing: helping us to throw a spotlight on a seedy practice for which there is no ethical basis.</p> <p>Only in Britain do we persist with an archaic form of property ownership that allows the rich to extract an income out of hard-working homebuyers and provide absolutely nothing in return. What\u2019s more, rather than seeing this practice wither on the vine, it is, astonishingly, actually getting worse.</p> <p>Big housebuilders have spotted an easy cash stream and are knocking out what would previously have been freehold houses as leasehold \u2013 6,000 last year, according to government figures. Usually there is a spurious \u201ccommon parts\u201d to a new-build estate that gives an excuse to the builder to say the property is leasehold. Ground rent is stuck in the lease, to be ramped up later. The builder sells it on to rapacious investors who can \u201csecuritise\u201d the \u201crevenue stream\u201d from the rents. If you\u2019ve watched the Big Short on Netflix recently, you\u2019ll know the game.</p> <p>My brother was about to spend around \u00a3250,000 on a leasehold flat until my sharp-eyed father spotted a clause, in highly obtuse language, which enabled the freeholder to double the ground rent every decade.</p> <p>\u201cEach review date the rent is to be increased to double the rent reserved before the relevant review date and the reserved reviewed rent will be payable from and including the relevant review date.\u201d This gobbledegook translates into: \u201cWe will stiff you for a 7% annualised rise in the rent.\u201d</p> <p>No wonder financiers love this stuff. Bundle up loads of ground rents, create a fund effectively paying 7% and you can sell it for twice the price you paid, because even a 3.5% yield is attractive these days. And all for doing absolutely nothing. Ground rent is almost the definition of a socially useless activity.</p> <p>As campaigner Sebastian O\u2019Kelly of Leasehold Knowledge Partnership says: \u201cFreeholds represent 5% or less of the capital value of a block of flats yet have a preponderance of the power. That does not make sense, even capitalistically \u2026 a tough monetising property spiv should get a 20% annual return on a freehold.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the buyer of the apartment, who has probably used their life savings for the deposit and is handing over nearly half their income to the mortgage company, doesn\u2019t really own the property. Legally, it can be forfeited if ground rent is not paid, although thankfully that happens rarely. Far more common is the repulsive squeeze put on homebuyers whose leases are less than 80 years \u2013 and there\u2019s two million of them in Britain \u2013 to pay absurd amounts to extend them, or see their property become unsaleable. The winners, especially in London, are generally the aristocratic estates to whom these unearned incomes flow.</p> <p>The rest of the world (including Scotland) has forms of commonhold: flat owners know they own the flat, fractions of the corridors and roof and land, and are responsible for it. Australia rejected leasehold in the 1960s, as have other parts of empire saddled with this legacy of colonial rule.</p> <p>The solution here? \u201cNew leases should be indefinite; ground rent should be abolished; all flats should be built with residents\u2019 management companies, so the residents take control once a majority of the flats are sold,\u201d says O\u2019Kelly.</p> <p>French philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon famously coined the phrase \u201cLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c\u2019est le vol\u201d. Maybe not all \u2013 but leasehold certainly is.</p>",
  "<p>You\u2019ve just bought your first flat, and were told by your solicitor that the ground rent is \u00a3250 a year. So, on moving in, you are staggered to be presented with a bill for \u00a38,000 a year.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not the end of the nightmare. In the small print of the lease is a tortuously worded clause stating that this will double every 10 years, so that in 35 years it will have soared to \u00a3128,000, and in 95 years it will be \u00a38m \u2013 for a one-bed flat that you bought for \u00a358,000.</p> <p>This scenario might sound like fanciful nonsense but, incredibly, it is the real-life situation faced by Kadian Kennelly, who bought the flat a year ago.</p> <p>Kennelly told Guardian Money it is \u201csimply scandalous\u201d. And she is not alone: several other people who own leasehold flats in the same building are affected, with others scattered around the country.</p> <p>Unusually, the man said to be behind these outrageous charges was recently \u201couted\u201d in parliament by veteran Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley. <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-05-18/debates/16051856000002/DebateOnTheAddress\" title=\"\">During a Commons debate in May</a>, the MP said property company boss Martin Paine was changing the terms of leases \u2013 for example, doubling the ground rent every 10 years, and backdating this change \u2013 in such a way that the flats ended up being \u201cworthless\u201d. However, Paine insists the terms were always openly negotiated with the tenants\u2019 solicitors.</p> <p>Bottomley told MPs that \u201cthe greatest difficulty comes from the way the lease is written, as lawyers do not normally spot that the ground rent has been doubled back to the time when the lease was originally granted\u201d.</p> <p>He said his understanding was that sometimes Paine would offer to buy the property back. However, he said Paine sometimes appeared to remarket a property \u201cwithout drawing the attention of the potential auctioneers or the potential purchasers to what those buying it will be letting themselves in for. It is not for me to judge whether that is criminal, but doing this on an organised basis certainly demands attention\u201d.</p> <p>The MP said he was asking the relevant authorities \u201cor the police\u201d to intervene.</p> <p>Kennelly\u2019s flat is in Blythe Court, a 1960s development in Coleshill, near Birmingham \u2013 but to properly understand what\u2019s been going on we need to spool back a couple of years.</p> <p>In February 2011, solicitors acting for a previous owner of the flat who had died agreed to a request for a deed of variation to extend the lease term by 99 years, according to the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a charity which provides advice to leaseholders and <a href=\"http://www.leaseholdknowledge.com/martin-paine\" title=\"\">has been investigating this issue</a>.</p> <p>But also hidden in the document was a clause that meant this extension did not, as one might have assumed, start from 2011, but from 1961, when Blythe Court was built. The lease variation also doubled the ground rent every 10 years from an initial \u00a3250 in 1961.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f447842b329ac93638a9c76095c3a42c2c527f07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f447842b329ac93638a9c76095c3a42c2c527f07/55_6_366_457/366.jpg\" alt=\"Kadian Kennelly\" width=\"366\" height=\"457\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Scandalous\u2019: Kadian Kennelly was shocked by the terms of her lease</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first person to buy the flat following the deed of variation was Michael Herring, who paid \u00a385,000 in February 2011. He bought it as an investment using an insurance payout following a car accident which had meant he was no longer able to work as a scaffolder. His understanding was that the ground rent was a few hundred pounds at most \u2013 so he was stunned to receive a demand for \u00a38,000.</p> <p>Herring, 52, told Money that his solicitors \u201chad overlooked the small print that Mr Paine had put in,\u201d and he later received a five-figure compensation payout.</p> <p>However, he had been advised not to pay the \u00a38,000, which led to him being issued with a county court judgment for non-payment. In the end, says Herring, he sold the flat to one of Paine\u2019s companies for around \u00a330,000 after deciding that he just wanted to get rid of it and cut his losses. \u201cI just about broke even. I put it down to a bad loss,\u201d says Herring, who lives in Nuneaton.</p> <p>According to Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, in April 2015 the flat sold at auction for \u00a372,000, but this buyer \u201cevidently decided to get out quick\u201d because it was soon on sale again. In October 2015, Kennelly bought it for \u00a358,000. The 35-year-old social worker says she was told by her conveyancers that the ground rent was \u00a3250 a year. Just like Herring, she promptly received a demand for \u00a38,000.</p> <p>Kennelly told Money: \u201cWhat [Paine] was doing was really cunning. It was a ploy ... if you can\u2019t afford it, the only other thing would be to forfeit the property and hand it back.\u201d</p> <p>Kennelly is still living in the flat but says: \u201cI tend to stay away because it\u2019s filled with awful memories.\u201d She adds that the one sliver of semi-good news is that, for the time being, Paine \u201chas agreed to put a hold on [the \u00a38,000 a year bill] until an agreement is reached\u201d.</p> <p>Bottomley\u2019s decision to name Paine was not the first time he had intervened on this issue: in January this year <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmedm/160121e01.htm\" title=\"\">he tabled an early day motion</a> requesting that flat 1, Blythe Court \u2013 in the same development as Kennelly\u2019s \u2013 be withdrawn from an upcoming auction. He also asked the auctioneers to \u201crefer the sellers to the appropriate authorities for withholding essential information of penal ground rent provisions that make the premises worthless\u201d.</p> <p>That piqued the interest of law firm Hogan Lovells, which obtained a copy of the lease. In a blog headlined \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ukrealestatelawblog.com/2016/02/04/beware-the-hidden-costs-of-ground-rents/\" title=\"\">Beware the hidden costs of ground rents</a>,\u201d it said the ground rent wording was introduced in 2014 by a deed of variation. \u201cThe initial \u00a3250 ground rent is backdated to 1961 and doubles every 10 years. Since 1961, it has doubled five times and is now \u00a38,000 a year ... This compounding means that in 2021 the rent will increase to \u00a316,000, and by the end of the lease it will be over \u00a38m.\u201d</p> <p>Mari Knowles, managing partner at Croydon-based specialist law firm Leasehold Law, is representing a number of affected leaseholders across the country.</p> <p>So what do we know about Paine? He owns a number of companies including Cheltenham-based Circle Residential Management, which manages leasehold properties. On its website the company says that following concerns raised by Blythe Court residents it had \u201cagreed to a dialogue with leaseholders regarding payment of their ground rent\u201d. It adds: \u201cWhile the terms of the lease at Blythe Court are not uncommon, we understand the need for a more ethical approach to charges, in line with our company philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, Circle Residential Management told us: \u201cWe want to resolve matters at Blythe Court, working with our tenants to achieve a way forward. Circle has always tried to act with the best of intentions and integrity.</p> <p>\u201cThat has included taking legal advice in relation to leaseholds and ground rent because, like any company, we need to comply with the law. Circle also worked with tenants\u2019 solicitors to try to ensure they advised their clients before any agreements were made with them. You cannot informally rewrite a lease \u2013 the terms were always openly negotiated with the tenants\u2019 solicitors and approved by them.\u201d</p> <h2>What leasehold means</h2> <p>If the property you are buying is leasehold (most flats are), it means the land it stands on is not part of the sale. You have to pay ground rent to the owner of the land, who is the freeholder.</p> <p>The My Property Guide website says that generally the rent will be \u201cquite low\u201d, adding: \u201cIt can vary from lease to lease. Some modern flats may have ground rents of \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 per year, while many ex-local authority flats may have a ground rent as low as \u00a310 per year.\u201d The site adds that in a typical 99-year lease, it might be set at \u00a350 a year for the first 33 years, then \u00a3100 a year for the next 33 years, then \u00a3150 a year for the final 33 years.</p> <p>Mari Knowles, partner at Croydon-based Leasehold Law, says: \u201cLeaseholders have a statutory right to extend their leases, whereby the ground rents will be reduced to a \u201cpeppercorn\u201d. Quite often, however, the freeholder and leaseholder will agree an informal lease extension between them. This can happen where, for example, the leaseholder is trying to sell and needs to extend their lease in a hurry.</p> <p>\u201cWhere the parties agree an informal lease extension there is nothing to stop a freeholder demanding onerous terms (including high ground rents) and adopting a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d attitude. Sellers feel like they have no choice due to time constraints, and are often not made aware of their statutory rights. Unfortunately, outgoing leaseholders don\u2019t have an interest in what the terms are as they are selling and won\u2019t be stuck with the problem.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Holdway was sitting outside her Yorkshire home in July while her baby, Violet, slept. As her four older children picnicked beside her, two strangers approached. \u201cThe man said he was from Humberside police,\u201d says Sarah, \u201cand that this was a social worker and&#xa0;that we had been reported for child trafficking.\u201d</p> <p>Three months earlier, Sarah\u2019s baby had been born in an unassisted birth \u2013 also known as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/14/freebirthing-birth-without-medical-support-safe\" title=\"\">freebirth</a>. After two homebirths attended by medical professionals, she planned for her third and fourth babies to be born without medical help. In England and Wales, there is <a href=\"http://www.birthrights.org.uk/library/factsheets/Unassisted-Birth.pdf\" title=\"\">no legal obligation to have medical care</a> in pregnancy or childbirth, her midwife had been fully supportive of her decision, and both births went well. Pregnant for a fifth time, living in a new area, Sarah, 33, once again gave birth easily at home.</p> <p>Weeks later, a health visitor (who hadn\u2019t met the family) grew concerned after a clerical error involving Violet\u2019s birth registration alerted her to the family. Sarah believes that a lack of understanding of the law, and suspicion of the family\u2019s alternative lifestyle and the unassisted birth, played a major role in police and social services being informed that lives might be at risk.</p> <p>The police and social worker were reassured that Violet was indeed Sarah\u2019s baby and, after asking specifically about the unassisted birth, they left. Sarah\u2019s case was eventually closed with no further action taken.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/14/freebirthing-birth-without-medical-support-safe\">Freebirthing: is giving birth without medical support safe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Social services involvement following pregnancy or birth choices is not isolated to Sarah\u2019s case, however. Jean Robinson, president of the <a href=\"http://www.aims.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services</a>, says her organisation has dealt with many hundreds of cases where such choices have prompted referrals to child safeguarding teams.</p> <p>I first became aware of the issue through my work as chief executive of the human rights in childbirth charity <a href=\"http://www.birthrights.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Birthrights</a>. Since 2013, our legal advice service has helped 25 women with problems related to social services.</p> <p>Laura Moore, 33, from Bedfordshire contacted us earlier this year with a copy of a letter from her obstetrician. It said that if she didn\u2019t change her birth plans, \u201cThis may be a safeguarding issue with reference to your unborn child which may have to be addressed further.\u201d Laura says that she felt threatened by the letter. \u201cThe safeguarding issue was being used to intimidate me into complying with their care plan.\u201d This was her third pregnancy following two straightforward births.</p> <p>\u201cI am obese and in both previous pregnancies I had gestational diabetes,\u201d she says. After a range of tests in her first pregnancy, she agreed with her doctor to a more hands-off approach in her second, as long as her blood sugar levels remained under control. All went well and after a happy homebirth she requested the same approach for her third pregnancy, but instead of support she received the uncompromising letter.</p> <p>Elizabeth Prochaska, a human rights barrister and chair and co-founder of Birthrights, says: \u201cThe suggestion of referral should never be used to intimidate, bully or coerce someone into accepting a particular medical intervention.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, if a woman has made a decision, she can\u2019t be compelled to change her plans unless she lacks mental capacity. Such referrals are also unhelpful to social workers, as Maris Stratulis of the <a href=\"https://www.basw.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Association of Social Workers </a>explains. \u201cIf a referral to social services is used as a \u2018threat\u2019 by a professional, it does not provide a good foundation for a social worker to build trust and rapport.\u201d</p> <p>After Birthrights\u2019 involvement in Laura\u2019s case, Bedford hospital wrote to Prochaska confirming that \u201cthe woman has the right to what she chooses\u201d. It offered an apology for the remark regarding a referral to social services, adding, \u201cWe would have no reason to do this unless we have proven concerns about the parenting, which we did not.\u201d</p> <p>The obstetrician has been referred for further learning.</p> <p>The use of social services as a tool for coercion also featured in a 2012 case concerning Southern general hospital in Glasgow. The hospital was forced to apologise after a woman was bullied into taking precautionary antibiotics during labour in hospital. Following her complaint to the <a href=\"http://www.spso.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Scottish Public Services Ombudsman</a>, the hospital admitted that she had been threatened with having her baby removed from her care in order to gain consent for its&#xa0;planned course of treatment. The ombudsman upheld her complaint, stating that she&#xa0;\u201cdid not properly consent to the treatment administered and was wrongly put under extraordinary pressure during labour when she was in a very vulnerable situation\u201d.</p> <p>Prochaska says the threat of referral to social services \u201cseems to have become a common tool used by health professionals when they are uncomfortable with women\u2019s choices\u201d. And we have also been contacted by women who have found police outside their home or hospital room as a direct result of their birth plans.</p> <p>A senior obstetrician (who wished to&#xa0;remain anonymous) echoed these concerns, blaming the trend in part on a culture of fear linked to safeguarding in the NHS as a result of high-profile cases where children have not been adequately protected and individual professionals have been publicly vilified. The obstetrician added, \u201cThere also isn\u2019t enough understanding of the basic medical ethical principle of the right to autonomy.\u201d Pointing to how prevalent the word \u201callow\u201d is in maternity care, the obstetrician says there is \u201cclear evidence that women\u2019s right to make their own informed choices is not clearly understood\u201d.</p> <p>While some people struggle to understand the motivation of those whose choices differ from the norm, Simon Mehigan, deputy director of midwifery at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London, does not. \u201cWomen don\u2019t take decisions around their pregnancy and birth lightly,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In more than 20 years as a midwife, he has met women whose decisions have been considered inappropriate by other professionals, but he has \u201cyet to meet one whose decision-making process wasn\u2019t rational or sensible, with each having undertaken their own research and weighed up all the advice and guidance they have been given\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe skill is to accept that ultimately it is not the health professionals\u2019 decision to own,\u201d says Mehigan.</p> <p>Yet for women such as Elle Forrest, 30, who is based in Manchester, erroneous social services involvement has even interfered during birth. After an easy pregnancy with her second child, Elle was planning a home birth with local NHS midwives. After not attending an antenatal appointment (because she had not been alerted to it), she received a torrent of calls and notes instructing her to ring the hospital. \u201cIt was as though there was an emergency, but it was never made clear what the danger was.\u201d</p> <p>When Elle went into labour, she informed the hospital, as is routine in a home birth. Two social workers then came to her door instructing her to call the out-of-hours service immediately or \u201cthings would escalate\u201d.</p> <p>Due to the stress, her contractions stopped and she called the number she had been given. \u201cA woman told me that I had a secret plan to give birth without midwives present, that I was not registered with a hospital, that I had not attended any antenatal appointments and that I did not consider the needs of my unborn baby to be paramount,\u201d says Elle.</p> <p>In shock and through rising panic, Elle offered to put the social workers in touch with her midwife to clear up the misunderstanding, but, she says, \u201cShe was not interested in my explanations and accused me of lying when I tried to set her straight.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Twice they waited outside and she heard them say, 'If you just let us in to see the baby, this will all go away.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though informed that she was \u201cnot allowed to labour at home\u201d and that an ambulance would be sent to collect her, Elle stayed firm. \u201cI&#xa0;was terrified but once my labour resumed, it was fast and furious. My baby could not wait for the midwives or the ambulance we had called. It was never my intention to give birth without medical assistance and when I saw my baby for the first time I thought she was dead. She was completely healthy, but I didn\u2019t know that. The shock of it all remained for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>For the next few days, social workers would knock loudly at the family\u2019s door. Twice they waited outside and she heard them say, \u201cIf you just let us in to see the baby, this will all go away.\u201d</p> <p>Cases such as Elle, Sarah and Laura\u2019s are not aberrations and, though they represent the extreme end of a complex problem, they are symptomatic of a culture and maternity system that can be unfriendly, even punitive to pregnant women. It is perhaps unsurprising that a society increasingly dictatorial about pregnant women\u2019s behaviour, that fetishises parenting and points the finger of blame all-too-frequently at the mother, is punishing women in this way.</p> <p>Combined with an overstretched maternity system in which stress and bullying is rife among staff, and where fear of litigation and professional sanctions meets a lack of understanding of women\u2019s rights, it can make for a toxic cocktail that damages new families at an intense and vulnerable time. But awareness is growing. The appetite for much-needed human rights in childbirth training is genuine and the <a href=\"https://www.rcm.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of Midwives</a> is working closely with Birthrights on education for its members. Professor Lesley Regan, president of the <a href=\"https://www.rcog.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists</a>, says the college \u201cwelcomes any opportunity to improve human rights issues relating to childbirth\u201d.</p> <p>Elle now wishes she had made a formal complaint, but the experience has led her to find out more about her rights, and support other women through pregnancy and birth as a doula. \u201cI have since learned about the law, and I know that, even if the social worker on the phone had been correct about any of the things she accused me of, I was within my rights to make those decisions.</p> <p>\u201cIf I became pregnant again, I would put the onus back on whoever was putting pressure on me, to change their behaviour instead of making myself more accommodating in order to be seen as compliant.

  "<p>In my clearest memories of my grandmother, she was already gone in all the ways that mattered. She was in her 70s when I&#xa0;was born, and Alzheimer\u2019s slowly stripped the person she had been out of her. So I only knew her, really, from the stories my mother told \u2013 those bits and pieces you stumble on when someone is inspired to share a memory. Which is to say, I&#xa0;knew her hardly at all.</p> <p>A few years ago, my parents and I&#xa0;were discussing jazz age Paris when the subject of my grandmother came up. \u201cYou know,\u201d my father said casually, \u201cshe lived in Paris in the 1920s.\u201d</p> <p><em>The</em> Paris? Hemingway Paris? Picasso Paris? That Paris?</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d my mother said. \u201cAnd we have all the letters she wrote home.\u201d</p> <p>Well, when I went home a few days later, I was carrying a box full of my grandmother\u2019s letters.</p> <p>The story was much better than that casual mention had led me to believe. In 1923, my grandmother had left the US to go on a sort of Grand Tour with a&#xa0;friend. They went to England and were scheduled to head on to France and then Italy. Except that, when my grandmother got to Paris, she decided she wasn\u2019t going home.</p> <p>So she got a job at the <a href=\"https://www.americanlibraryinparis.org/\" title=\"\">American library in Paris</a>, rented a room at the American Girls\u2019 Club, which provided accommodation and social activities to&#xa0;young women from the US, and wrote to her parents to announce her decision. They were less than thrilled, and a significant number of her letters involve lengthy accounts of her finances and dramatic declarations of how mature she has become, desperate attempts to convince them of the wisdom of her plan. Here is one of her&#xa0;more successful arguments: \u201cI&#xa0;seem to&#xa0;have gotten more or less of a&#xa0;perspective on myself and to realise how spoiled and contrary I have always been. Of course it was your fault for spoiling me in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>How could they argue with that?</p> <p>What I admire most about my grandmother during her time there is&#xa0;how she set out to suck the marrow from Parisian life. She worked and made friends, hung out at artists\u2019 cafes and watering holes \u2013 Le D\u00f4me, Harry\u2019s New York Bar, Le Select \u2013 danced at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alNVgdC4Oyw\" title=\"\">infamous nightclub Zelli\u2019s</a> until 4am, went on a number of dates and, most deliciously of all, had a romance with a&#xa0;French artist. \u201cHe is thoroughly fascinating,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak any English so he\u2019s very good for&#xa0;my French, and besides I like the way he kisses my hand.\u201d</p> <p>She had caught the flu in the 1918 pandemic and was never quite well after that, so the late nights caught up with her and she became ill. After heading to the south of France to recover, she returned home. A few years later, she was married. Her Parisian adventure was over.</p> <p>Reading these letters was a revelation. Because, of course, even if I had known my grandmother, I wouldn\u2019t have known this version of her, this brash and funny and curious and adventurous young woman who threw herself at life with the general force and enthusiasm of a hurricane.</p> <p>The more I thought about the contents of her letters, the sadder I&#xa0;became that this was all I had of her. We so often feel alone, certain that every problem we face is new. Yet reading her letters, I was startled to see that, aside from the slang, I could have written them when I was 23. We had the same worries \u2013 our families, our futures, our work, our weight, our romances, our friendships, our lives. It made me feel reassured that I wasn\u2019t alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0e98022cf5d5bc882731375786d8b4d46256dd84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e98022cf5d5bc882731375786d8b4d46256dd84/0_0_5482_7605/721.jpg\" alt=\"Eleanor Brown\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eleanor Brown: \u2018What I most admire is how my grandmother set out to suck the marrow from Parisian life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Henson/HarperCollins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All this made me wonder about what&#xa0;we are leaving behind. If our grandchildren, 100 years from now, want to get to know us, what will they find? In some respects, we are telling our stories more than ever before. We photograph our meals and post them on Instagram. We share our passing thoughts on Twitter. We mark&#xa0;life changes \u2013 new jobs, new relationships \u2013 on Facebook. We leave a&#xa0;trail of our movements by marking our location on Instagram. But it strikes me that the record we are leaving behind is much less intimate than letters written to someone\u2019s family \u2013 it is curated with real awareness of an audience, and there is a slippage of honesty in that. We share not the truth, but what is most flattering. I recently read an interview with a teenage girl who said she might take as many as 70 selfies before finding one she found worthy of sharing. Seventy! That\u2019s a part-time job.</p> <p>For all the detail, our adventures as&#xa0;portrayed on social media don\u2019t necessarily add up to a coherent picture of what our life is like. And by&#xa0;using third-party services to communicate and document our lives, we are releasing control of those stories. We are leaving a detailed list of&#xa0;the days of our lives on Facebook, but what happens if Facebook goes out of business?</p> <p>So, what can we do?</p> <p>I believe we should think about our&#xa0;legacy. We should offer future generations the opportunity to get to know us, to connect with us, to learn from us. History often obscures the richness of&#xa0;individual stories in favour of an examination of trends, or a focus on the powerful. But in order to have a&#xa0;sum, there must be parts.</p> <p>I believe it matters that we leave stories that are authentic, intentional, and within our control. That means speaking as honestly as if we were confiding in our closest friends. It means taking the time to record the entire experience, including our thoughts on its meaning or importance. And it means sharing them on paper, or on digital files that we own and back up.</p> <p>I believe that as the world seems to become more fractured, as we bury our true selves under the veneer of public perfection, it is even more important to do what my grandmother did \u2013 to reach out across the years and whisper to each other, \u201cYou will make it through this. You are not alone. You have never been alone. I was here, too.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Light of Paris by Eleanor Brown is&#xa0;published by HarperCollins, \u00a312.99.

  "<p>On a few occasions recently I\u2019ve overheard myself talking despairingly about \u201cthe English\u201d. I feel ashamed of it. I don\u2019t think of my wife or my children as \u201cthe English\u201d or my friends, neighbours and colleagues as \u201cthe English\u201d \u2013 though many, probably most of them, were born in England and could be so described.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/stand-up-for-an-open-tolerant-country\">Let\u2019s stand up for a vision of an open, tolerant and outward-looking country | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a guide to human characteristics, \u201cthe English\u201d isn\u2019t useful. Like many general descriptions, it falters in the face of the particular. \u201cThe masses are always the other, that we do not know, and cannot know,\u201d wrote the scholar and critic <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2008/02/work-life-williams-english\" title=\"\">Raymond Williams</a> in 1958, and perhaps I\u2019m starting to use \u201cthe English\u201d in a similar way, to describe people other to myself and the people I&#xa0;know at first or second hand.</p> <p>Not good. No doubt my upbringing had many flaws, but on the plus side (so I like to think) it taught me to distrust what had yet to be called national stereotypes. That there was \u201cgood and bad everywhere\u201d might have been stitched in samplers and hung in every room (instead of which, in one room only, we had the <a href=\"http://www.robertburns.org/works/97.shtml\" title=\"\">lines from Burns</a>, about seeing ourselves as others see us).</p> <p>The tragedy of the first world war bred a distrust of nationalism among many of my parents\u2019 generation, and increased the appeal of the internationalism offered by socialist groups such as the <a href=\"http://www.independentlabour.org.uk/main/history/\" title=\"\">Independent Labour party</a>. Enhancing that broad philosophy, in my parents\u2019 particular case, was the experience of migrating from lowland Scotland to northern England, where they preferred to be seen as themselves \u2013 individuals who happened to be from Scotland \u2013 rather than as \u00e9migr\u00e9s announcing a group identity with spectacular enthusiasms such as kilt-wearing and Highland dancing.</p> <p>Sometimes these attitudes had a practical effect. At the end of the second world war my father and elder brother befriended a prisoner of war, a soldier in the Wehrmacht, who lived in a camp nearby. The friendship began when my brother, then a schoolboy, exchanged a German-English pocket dictionary for some souvenir scraps of German uniform \u2013 epaulettes and badges \u2013 and continued by letter after the sergeant was released and went home to Hamburg.</p> <p>His name was Karl Bohnsack, and he and his family regularly corresponded with us into the 1980s, with parcels at Christmas that smelt of eau de cologne and marzipan. I never met them, but they were as strong a presence in our family as our relatives. In our house \u201cthe&#xa0;Bohnsacks\u201d was a phrase that was&#xa0;heard more, and meant more, than&#xa0;\u201cthe Germans\u201d.</p> <p>As to our own national identity, I suppose we thought of ourselves as British/Scottish, but the question hardly came up. By the time I was old enough to take an interest in such things we were living back in Scotland, not far from a Royal Navy dockyard. Sailors with English accents filled the dancehalls, the cinemas, the buses and the pubs. Still, nobody thought of them as \u201cthe English\u201d: their accents didn\u2019t make them different people to us, culturally and politically. It may even be that we saw them as a norm, the standard British issue, the straightforward types in British films where actors from Scotland, Ireland and Wales took the character parts.</p> <p>We might complain about Cockney gabbiness or joke about English parsimony \u2013 a random memory is mockery of a family from somewhere like Chatham who thought of thinly spread meat-paste sandwiches as a special teatime luxury \u2013 but that was probably revenge for the English canard that the Scots are mean.</p> <p>Of course, to be British had once been a braggart identity. Some of that boastfulness, rekindled by the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/2/newsid_2654000/2654501.stm\" title=\"\">coronation</a>, dimmed by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/suez_01.shtml\" title=\"\">Suez</a> and kept alive by war films, survived into the 1960s. But then, in the century\u2019s last decades, \u201cBritish\u201d as a self-description began to offer something else. With fewer connotations of blood and soil than the growing nationalisms of the United Kingdom\u2019s constituent parts, it had room for newcomers from abroad and for people like me who found its capaciousness and slackness attractive. Here was a civic nationalism that meandered attractively like an old river, its dangerous force spent far upstream.</p> <p>Constitutional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/scottish-referendum-david-cameron-devolution-revolution\" title=\"\">devolution</a> and the strength, in particular, of the Scottish independence movement provided serious threats, but in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/scotland-independence-no-vote-victory-alex-salmond\" title=\"\">Scottish referendum campaign</a> of 2014 many people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/28/scottish-independence-emigration-ian-jack\" title=\"\">including me</a>, argued for the preservation of Britain as a state and British as an identity; and of the people who voted, 55% agreed.</p> <p>I\u2019m now much less sure. What Britishness went on concealing until very recently \u2013 like a host body with a very large grub inside, struggling to emerge \u2013 was Englishness. The England/Britain confusion has existed for centuries: all kinds of people, ranging from London dockers through foreign diplomats to writers such as George Orwell, imagined that the terms were coterminous and interchangeable. (Glasgow was \u201cthe centre of the intelligence of England\u201d according to the Grand Duke Alexis, who attended the launch of his father Tsar Alexander II\u2019s steam yacht there in 1880.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>English nationalism has found its opportunity and is taking us out of Europe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The separatist movements of Scotland and Wales began to dent this idea in England, but the English response was slow. A competing English nationalism was at first confined to fringe meetings about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/sep/19/west-lothian-question-english-votes-laws\" title=\"\">West Lothian question</a> and a campaign for an English parliament. Then came the rise of Nigel Farage\u2019s Ukip, the Tory strategy for dealing with it and that strategy\u2019s failure in the EU referendum.
