  "<p>There are many sides to the refugee debate in Australia, but an overarching question is this: how can we create a more sustainable and humane policy that accords with international law?</p> <p>I was challenged to identify a single intervention that could have this effect. It seemed a formidable task, but the answer is quite simple if we go back to first principles.</p> <p>We could insert a legislative requirement that Australian law must be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with our responsibilities under international refugee law and international human rights law.</p> <p>In most democratic countries, no one would blink at such a proposal. It simply reflects basic rules of international law. It\u2019s sobering that in Australia, a provision like this would be seen as radical.</p> <p>Australia is the only country whose law explicitly says it is \u201cirrelevant\u201d whether or not our <em>non-refoulement </em>obligations are engaged when removing an asylum seeker. Indeed, under the Migration Act, an official\u2019s duty to remove such a person \u201carises irrespective of whether there has been an assessment, according to law, of Australia\u2019s <em>non-refoulement</em> obligations in respect of the non-citizen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The principle of <em>non-refoulement</em> is the cornerstone of the international refugee regime. If there is one thing on which all states agree \u2013 even those that are not parties to the Refugee Convention \u2013 it is that this principle is sacrosanct. It prohibits the return of people to places where they risk being persecuted, tortured, subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrarily deprived of life. </p> <p>This September, the principle will be reaffirmed unreservedly in the political declaration that world leaders will adopt at the UN secretary general\u2019s summit on refugees in New York.</p> <p>To my knowledge, Australia is also the only country to have deleted all references to the refugee convention from its domestic law. Instead, it has replaced them with a \u201cself-contained statutory framework\u201d setting out Australia\u2019s own interpretation of its protection obligations under the refugee convention. International law makes clear that states do not have the right to auto-interpret their treaty obligations. </p> <p>Basic rules of treaty interpretation state that a treaty must be interpreted in good faith, and in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context, and in the light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose. Furthermore, asserting that a treaty obligation is inconsistent with domestic law provides no justification for breaching it.</p> <p>If Australia did insert a legislative provision requiring a principled, good faith interpretation in accordance with international refugee law and international human rights law, our approach to asylum would necessarily change.</p> <p>For a start, it would flip our focus towards the responsibility to provide protection, as part of a global cooperative effort, rather than deflecting those in need. It would mean that people seeking asylum would live among us in the Australian community, not in closed mandatory detention. </p> <p>Offshore processing could not continue, and families would not be separated. Children\u2019s best interests would be a primary consideration in every decision affecting them. Refugees would be welcomed into Australian society quickly, resulting in greater cultural, economic and social benefits over time. People would not be pushed back at sea without the opportunity to have their protection claim thoroughly examined and reviewed. </p> <p>Principled, effective and transparent refugee status determination in Australia would be reinstated, with well-trained decision-makers, access to legal assistance, and robust independent merits and judicial review.</p> <p>All this might sound like wishful thinking in today\u2019s political climate. But each element reflects a feasible past practice in Australian asylum policy.</p> <p>By learning from history and effective practices, we could model \u201cprotection in action\u201d. In turn, we could help to grow the capacity for protection and assistance within our region. We would regain our international reputation as a welcoming country that respects human rights and the rule of law \u2026 and we would also save a lot of money.</p> <p>The drafters of the refugee convention \u2013 including Australia\u2019s representative \u2013 were well aware that refugee protection was not a way to short-circuit migration controls. In fact, the refugee regime requires the most stringent checks of all. But what they also recognised was that never again should the world bear witness to millions of people fleeing for safety and being turned away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-claim-that-locking-asylum-seekers-up-in-nauru-and-png-saves-lives-is-bogus\">The claim that locking asylum seekers up in Nauru and PNG saves lives is bogus | Philippe Legrain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Refugees and other vulnerable migrants embark on dangerous land and sea journeys because there are no safe alternatives. Governments could rectify this situation, and save lives, with some simple policy changes \u2013 for instance, by creating humanitarian visas allowing travel to places of safety, by increasing resettlement, or by abolishing carrier sanctions that impose hefty fees on airlines that transport people without visas.</p> <p>Acknowledging that forced migration will continue for as long as war, persecution and human rights violations continue, it is imperative that we adopt a policy that does the least damage to people who have been forced to leave their homes. </p> <p>Our current approaches are not sustainable, fiscally responsible or protection-sensitive. We must develop and promote durable, legal and humane solutions for people in need of protection.

  "<p>A raft of data published this week will offer the latest health check on the state of the UK economy following June\u2019s vote to leave the EU, with economists expecting the figures to suggest businesses were so far \u201cproving resilient\u201d. </p> <p>On Monday, figures will show how confidence is holding up in the UK service sector, from the latest survey of purchasing managers.

He added: \u201cSpeaking to businesses it seems confidence has improved as they have realised that the UK economy is not falling off a cliff.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expected the industry survey to show \u201cmodest expansion\u201d in August. \u201cBoth the manufacturing (especially) and construction (to a limited extent) surveys have shown activity picking up in August after marked weakness in July, and we suspect that this will be the case for the services sector as well,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>Although he added that there were likely to be falls in activity in sectors involving commercial property and house sales, which have both taken a hit since the vote to leave. </p> <p>Archer was generally upbeat about this week\u2019s slew of data, some of which is covering the post-referendum period for the first time. \u201cThere is likely to be further evidence that the economy is proving resilient so far following June\u2019s Brexit vote,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>Sentance said unless there was anything shocking in this week\u2019s figures \u201cit would reinforce the view that the economy might not grow that quickly in the short term but will hold up reasonably well in the final quarter\u201d.</p> <p>Consumer spending appears not to have taken a knock, with shoppers who are spending getting more for their money. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/04/morrisons-cut-food-prices-12-percent-uk-deflation\">Morrisons launched a new grocery price war at the weekend</a>, and food prices have been tumbling. The latest index from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and industry analysts Nielsen showed a 1.1% fall in prices in August, following a 0.8% drop in July. <br></p> <p>Meanwhile the cost of non-food items fell by 2.5% over the month, compared with a 2.2% drop in July. The report said a combination of promotional activity by retailers, softening oil prices and a global glut of wheat had all pushed down prices.</p> <p>When the BRC releases a separate report on retail sales on Tuesday, Archer said he expected the numbers to be healthy, with low prices and rising pay supporting consumer spending. The CBI has already published data covering the first half of the month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/cbi-retail-sales-growth-expected-to-slow-after-summer-bounce\">which showed a summer bounce in sales,</a> while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\">Office for National Statistics reported a 1.4% increase in July</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRetail sales appear to have been helped in August, as they were in July, by good weather lifting demand for clothing,\u201d said Archer, adding that they may also have been boosted by the feelgood factor of Team GB\u2019s Olympics success, and by visiting tourists exploiting the weakness of the pound to splash out on luxury goods. However, Archer warned that consumer purchasing power could wane as companies look to limit pay increases and inflation rises.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said that prices could start to rise given the devaluation of sterling following the referendum result. \u201cBut that\u2019s likely to take several months to properly feed through, given that retailers won\u2019t feel the brunt of the cost increases until existing contracts with foreign suppliers come to an end,\u201d she said. <br></p> <p>\u201cEven then, retailers will have to make a decision about when and how much to pass onto consumers. Given the strength of competition in the market, and if the economy softens in line with predictions, any pass through may be more limited than implied by the exchange rate movement.\u201d</p> <p>Official figures on manufacturing and construction due out this week are for July, and only cover the very early days after the referendum. Archer said he expected the ONS data on manufacturing output to show a 0.7% fall month-on-month, with some work having been postponed or cancelled as a result of uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of the vote. Sentance said he would be looking at the figures for capital goods as an early indicator of whether businesses were still investing. However, he said it was very early to reach conclusions on the impact of Brexit. This was echoed by the manufacturing employers group EEF, which said its members were seeing \u201ca mixed picture\u201d so far.</p> <p>Its latest manufacturing outlook survey, produced with accountants BDO, showed that in the third quarter of the year activity levels remained largely unchanged but that confidence in the overall UK economy had taken a knock. Mechanical equipment suffered a big decline but export orders had exceeded expectations, particularly for electronics and electrical equipment. And while recruitment of new employees had fallen, EEF\u2019s members said they did expect to take more people on in the future. </p> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, said: \u201cSigns of an export revival are helping to drive more optimism about activity in the second half of the year, but concerns about whether the UK economy can shrug off post-referendum challenges is clearly evident.\u201d </p> <p>She added: \u201cThese risks are expected to hit some sectors \u2013 such as industries linked to investment goods and construction \u2013 harder than others. Despite the short-term outlook for manufacturing remaining broadly stable, the continued downward slide in investment plans should keep policy makers alive to the potential risks facing the sector.\u201d</p>",

However, a rapidly growing Hispanic population means the state\u2019s politics are turning steadily from red to purple, if not yet blue, prompting Clinton to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/politics/hillary-clinton-arizona-advertising-immigration/\">advertise</a>. In attacking Flake, Trump is unlikely to aid his own Arizonan cause.</p> <p>Senator John McCain, Flake\u2019s fellow Arizona senator and the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, has started running an ad that look toward a hypothetical Clinton presidency.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy opponent, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, is a good person,\u201d he says <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLAdOwaIQ-E \">in the ad</a>. \u201cBut if Hillary Clinton is elected president, Arizona will need a senator who will act as a check, not a rubber stamp, on the White House.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is conspicuously absent from the ad: his name unsaid, his image omitted and his ideas implicitly rejected as McCain tells voters: \u201cWe need more control over our borders but also smarter immigration policies that enforce the law and reflect our values.\u201d</p> <p>McCain has not explicitly rejected Trump, who last year mocked the Vietnam war veteran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">for having been captured</a> by the Vietcong, but he has repeatedly asked the businessman to apologize to other former prisoners of war. Months of such harsh rhetoric from Trump have painted Republicans like McCain in a corner, Flake admitted, by threatening to turn reliably red states like Arizona into swing states. </p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be up for grabs,\u201d he said, \u201cbut frankly it is.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018When America is safe, we will be open to all of the options\u2019</h2> <p>Even Trump\u2019s most stalwart allies could not seem to agree about his immigration message, even though the businessman said in Phoenix: \u201cYou can call it whatever the hell you want.

According to the former mayor, Trump \u201cwould find it very, very difficult to throw out a family that\u2019s been here for 15 years, and they have three children, two of whom are citizens. And that is not the kind of America he wants.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told ABC\u2019s This Week through crosstalk with the host that it was \u201ccorrect\u201d the businessman would deport more than just migrants with a criminal record \u2013 and then changed her tone. </p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cno, but he also said that, once you enforce the law, once you get rid of the criminals, then we\u2019ll see where we are.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be. We don\u2019t know who will be left. We don\u2019t know where they live, who they are.

In an interview aired Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/mike-pence-will-release-tax-returns-next-week\">with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press</a>, he said: \u201cWhat Donald Trump laid out this week in Arizona was really a roadmap to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Pence then rattled off some of Trump\u2019s ideas, including a wall on the southern border, targeting people who have overstayed visas and increasing border patrol staff, but left details for the future. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give consideration, working with the Congress, in a new and reformed immigration system, to consider it at that time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>All three said Trump would prioritize deportations of people with criminal records, the same strategy Barack Obama has taken during his two terms, during which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/latino-immigrants-us-war-on-terror-study\">record numbers of migrants have been deported</a> and Border Patrol staffing has reached an all-time high. Obama has also deferred deportations for several million migrants who came to the US as children through executive actions that Trump has said he will rescind.</p> <p>Giuliani also conceded the limits of Trump\u2019s shifting deportation plans, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">would eject between 4 and 11 million people</a> and cost <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/01/trumps-big-immigration-crackdown-comes-with-a-big-5-year-price-tag-more-than-50-billion/\">an estimated $50bn</a>. But he and Conway insisted that Trump will somehow force Mexico to pay for the proposed border wall, even though Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">told Trump this week</a> it would not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"831ff957c45156a52f27689a8fad0b3e5130fbcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/831ff957c45156a52f27689a8fad0b3e5130fbcf/0_18_4365_2619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump and Pena Nieto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Donald Trump shake hands after a meeting in Mexico City on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/who-will-win-presidential-election-2016-labor-day-prediction\">Who will win the presidential election?

Labor Secretary Tom Perez told CNN that Trump was \u201ca loose cannon\u201d and said his week of Janus-faced speeches \u201cwas a perfect illustration of why he\u2019s not fit to be president\u201d. </p> <p>In a taped interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, Obama was more stoic, saying anti-immigrant sentiment could be traced to the founding of the US, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the majority of America\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe next generation of Americans, they utter \u2013 completely reject the kinds of positions that he\u2019s taking,\u201d the president said. \u201cSo overall, I\u2019m optimistic. But, you know, I think we have to pay close attention to what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>Polls suggest that only some voters were swayed by Trump\u2019s winding week.

The coach will be disappointed, even so, that a contest that had seemed under control ended up with Wasps deservedly on top, thanks in large part to 15 points from Jimmy Gopperth and sterling forward efforts from Joe Launchbury and the new hooker Tommy Taylor.</p> <p>In a game billed in advance as a showdown between two of England\u2019s most gifted fly-half candidates and cultured left boots, Danny Cipriani and Henry Slade, it was probably to be expected both would be upstaged by the right-footed Gopperth, shunted out to No12 to allow Cipriani to wear the 10 jersey on his first league appearance since rejoining the club from Sale. Exeter fans will need no reminding of Gopperth\u2019s nerveless touchline kick to clinch last season\u2019s European quarter-final on this ground and he was similarly clinical here, contributing a sharply taken try and applying the coup de grace from the kicking tee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/northampton-saints-bath-rugby-union-premiership-match-report\">Bath and George Ford\u2019s boot too much for Northampton\u2019s damp comeback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not everything Cipriani attempted came off, with Dan Robson looking the sharper of Wasps\u2019 half-backs, while it is still too early to reach a definitive verdict on the merits of Slade\u2019s deployment at fly-half ahead of the experienced Gareth Steenson. While it would be fair to say the Chiefs\u2019 midfield triumvirate of Slade, Sam Hill and Ollie Devoto did not instantly click, Baxter still has every intention of giving Slade \u201cfurther opportunities there\u201d.</p> <p>Devoto, newly arrived from Bath, will also need a little time to settle and came dangerously close to being shown a card on his Chiefs\u2019 league debut. Referees have been ordered to be extremely strict on players attempting to kick the ball on the ground when prone opponents are in the vicinity so his heart would have skipped a couple of beats when replays appeared to show his boot making contact with Cipriani\u2019s head at a first-half ruck.</p> <p>Young thought it should definitely have been a penalty to Wasps but absolved the player of any deliberate foul play: \u201cIt was an obvious kick through but there\u2019s nobody in that Exeter team who would look to kick any one of our players in the head. I don\u2019t believe for one minute it was intentional.

To most in the ground, including Wasps\u2019 supporters, a familiar driven maul try for Thomas Waldrom, who scored five tries in two games on this ground last season, and a smart dummying score by Will Chudley looked to have given the visitors a winning edge either side of Gopperth\u2019s fleet-footed finish.</p> <p>Instead Wasps rejected the orthodox script and narrowed the gap, another pacy breakout and good hands from Cipriani and Elliot Daly creating a try for Robson. The momentum was suddenly with them and, with 16 minutes remaining, a lineout drive borrowed from Exeter\u2019s normal repertoire, finished by Taylor, edged them ahead.</p> <p>Slade narrowly missed a long-range penalty that could have regained the lead, leaving the stage clear for Gopperth to seal the deal in the 79th minute.</p> <p>Both sides, one suspects, will be significantly sharper with half a dozen games under their belts, with Young firmly of the view the Chiefs \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s not a shadow of a doubt in my mind they\u2019ll be a top-four side\u201d \u2013 will again be strong challengers.</p> <p>For Wasps, though, there are many positives to carry into this weekend\u2019s derby with neighbours Leicester.

  "<p>Little things can mean a lot. The minutiae of diplomatic protocol seem trivial when the subjects on the G20\u2019s table are so huge, including climate change, global economic growth, tensions in the South China Sea and \u2013 for the UK \u2013 the fall-out from the vote for Brexit. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/barack-obama-deliberately-snubbed-by-chinese-in-chaotic-arrival-at-g20\" title=\"\">the red carpet-less greeting</a> for Barack Obama in China matters more than one might think. Even the British and Japanese prime ministers got the VIP reception, despite Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/03/hinkley-point-c-theresa-may-china-g20-summit\" title=\"\">Hinkley Point hesitations</a> and Tokyo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/japan-to-develop-missile-as-tensions-with-china-mount-reports\" title=\"\">fraught relationship</a> with Beijing. Only the US president had to use what one might call the Naughty Steps, an uncarpeted flight descending from the bowels of the plane.</p> <p>Cock-up or conspiracy? Chinese arrangements can be surprisingly last minute, and official visits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/queen-chinese-officials-very-rude-xi-jinping-state-visit\" title=\"\">are frequently tense</a>. But at the very minimum, it shows a telling carelessness from a nation so consumed by presentational issues that rooftops in the host city of Hangzhou <a href=\"http://qz.com/768676/how-to-host-a-successful-international-event-from-the-g20-to-the-olympics-just-like-beijing/\" title=\"\">were reportedly repainted</a> to improve aerial views. The G20 is supposed to reinforce the country\u2019s standing as a major power; the row has made China look petty, bolshy and graceless, rather than confident and magnanimous. Had the Chinese president received this welcome at a US-hosted summit, the cries that the US had hurt the feelings of the Chinese people would have been deafening.</p> <p>That formulation, peculiar to western ears from a country so large and powerful, has a potent history behind it. Xi Jinping has doubled down on the Communist party\u2019s heavy promotion of the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/rows-japan-china-historical-grievances\" title=\"\">a \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d</a> at the hands of foreign powers, from the Opium wars onwards. Without a democratic mandate, its leadership rests on its provision of a better standard of living (a task getting harder by the year) and its restoration of national pride. Deng Xiaoping, focused on domestic development, urged his country to \u201chide our brightness, bide our time\u201d. As China began to reemerge as a world power, some in the region feared a new Goliath. But the country itself thought it was David, still kicked about by bullies.</p> <p>Then, in late 2008, came the global financial crisis. Beijing began to believe the hype that China had saved the world. It read Mr Obama\u2019s attempt to reset relations as a sign of weakness, and was alarmed by his subsequent \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia. Not unreasonably, it believes the US wants to maintain its power in the Pacific and contain China\u2019s rise. It chafes at criticism from western powers that portray themselves as disinterested moral voices even when the stakes are evident and even though, in their own ascendancy, they bullied and beat down others. As rising states do, it is pushing the boundaries. It wants to reshape international institutions created in a very different age, and will build its own if others resist.</p> <p>It is not only, or even primarily, the west that is alarmed by China\u2019s more xenophobic tone and increasingly forceful stance. The irony is that Beijing wanted the summit to present a more attractive image to the world, highlighting its global contribution. It wants to reshape the G20 into a more effective format, tackling problems strategically instead of summoning ad hoc responses to the latest crisis. It wants to portray itself as a bridge between the \u201cglobal south\u201d and \u201cglobal north\u201d, hence the invitation of countries such as Chad. It has flagged up space cooperation and its peacekeeping contribution. And then it undid its hard work with a foolish row on an airport runway.</p> <p>The dangers of misplaying its hand are evident at home, too, as Sunday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/liberate-hong-kong-calls-independence-china-elections-loom\" title=\"\">legislative council elections in Hong Kong</a> demonstrate. The region enjoys considerable autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework introduced on its return to China, but the party\u2019s tightening grip has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/-sp-hong-kong-protests-more-join-crowds-urged-keep-going-national-holiday\" title=\"\">alienated large parts of the community</a>, who now see themselves primarily as Hong Kongers rather than Chinese citizens and who are even, in some cases, prepared to support independence calls they would previously have shunned as ridiculous. While some are intimidated into taking Beijing\u2019s line, others are pushed into confrontation.</p> <p>The conclusions for China are obvious, though it does not appear to be drawing them. Other countries have much to learn too. They should continue to push back on issues from China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea to the sweeping crackdown under Mr Xi\u2019s leadership and attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/02/chinese-foreign-minister-canada-angry-human-rights-question\" title=\"\">export its controls on expression</a>. But they must also help to build a positive role for China in the world \u2013 even when, as Mr Obama\u2019s arrival shows, engagement is far from easy.</p>",
  "<p>Hopes that the US and Russia could reach agreement on a joint initiative to tackle Islamic State and stem the violence in Syria\u2019s brutal civil war have suffered a setback after the US said Russia had retreated on some issues it believed had been settled.</p> <p>The US Department of State had said it was hopeful that the US president, Barack Obama, and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, would reach an understanding at the G20 summit taking place in China. But on a day that saw Syrian government troops resume their siege of the city of Aleppo, a planned joint press conference between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was cancelled. The agreement would have been the culmination of long-running talks between the US and Russia in Moscow, Washington and Geneva. </p> <p>The deal focuses on a slowdown in the Syrian air campaign against rebel forces in return for an agreement that Russian and Syrian air forces can target Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the former al-Nusra Front forces linked with al-Qaida. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">Al-Nusra changed its name to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham</a> (Conquest of Syria) in July in what was seen as a rebranding exercise by some but a genuine ideological shift by others.</p> <p>Many US-backed Syrian rebel groups have worked alongside al-Nusra and are reluctant to abandon that cooperation, arguing it is an effective fighting force willing to risk lives to defeat the common enemy, President Bashar al-Assad. </p> <p>In practice, it would be hard to disentangle US-recognised forces from al-Sham and would mean a level of unprecedented intelligence sharing between the US and Russia. Negotiators on both sides have spent weeks looking at maps of areas where opposition groups operate and where Assad\u2019s forces would be prohibited from launching airstrikes. A deal might also open the way for the restoration of UN humanitarian convoys across Syria, and a ceasefire in Aleppo, where 250,000 civilians are still under the threat of starvation in the east of the city.</p> <p>Speaking on the sidelines of the <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barack-obama-xi-jinping-discuss-south-china-sea-thaad-deployment-during-night-stroll-eve-g20-1579548\">G20 summit that got under way in Hangzhou</a>, China, on Sunday morning, Obama said both countries still had \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syrian-regime-warplanes-allegedly-bomb-rebels-response-major-offensive-hama-1579267\">grave differences</a>\u201d over the future course of action to put an end to the five years of violence in Syria. \u201cI think it\u2019s premature for us to say there\u2019s a clear path forward, but there\u2019s the possibility at least for us to make some progress,\u201d the US president said.</p> <p>The UN special envoy on Syria had said he hoped a deal could be struck between in Geneva on Saturday before the G20, at separate meetings in London next week with the main Syrian opposition negotiating committee, and then the UN general assembly in New York later in September. But the talks have not made the expected progress, due partly to the lack of trust between Russia and the US. </p> <p>The Turkish incursion into northern Syria, part of a bid to force back Kurdish forces supported by the US, has complicated the already multi-layered civil war. </p> <p>Speaking to the G20, Obama said: \u201cIt is a very complicated piece of business. These are difficult negotiations. We have grave differences with the Russians in terms of both the parties we support but also the process that\u2019s required to bring about peace in Syria.</p> <p> \u201cBut if we do not get some buy-in from the Russians on reducing the violence and easing the humanitarian crisis it\u2019s difficult to see how we get to the next phase.\u201d</p> <p>The US has been sceptical of forging military ties with Russia, blaming the country for <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russias-claims-it-killed-key-isis-leader-abu-muhammad-al-adnani-laughable-says-us-1579176\">violating ceasefire treaties</a> during the Syrian civil war.

Speaking at a dinner with non-government organisations in the south-eastern city of Diyarbak\u0131r, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said: \u201cFrom Azaz to Jarablus, 91km (57 miles) of our border has been completely secured. All the terrorist groups are pushed back \u2013 they are gone.\u201d <br></p> <p>Much of the work to expel Isis from other parts of the border has been carried out by the Syrian Kurdish YPG, working with the US-led coalition.

That may well undermine Ecclestone\u2019s position as the sport\u2019s chief executive, with Eddie Jordan, a former team owner-turned-pundit, suggesting the 85-year-old could be gone by the Singapore Grand Prix in two weeks\u2019 time.</p> <p>However, when this was all put to Ecclestone after Sunday\u2019s race in Monza he had a one-word reply. \u201cBullshit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The news of a possible takeover was welcomed by Toto Wolff, the head of motorsport at Mercedes and one of the most powerful figures in F1. He said: \u201cIf there is an investor that wants to buy the shares it is good news for Formula One. It was unbelievable out there \u2013 full grandstands \u2013 so, maybe it is good news that an American media company buys Formula One.\u201d</p> <p>Regarding Ecclestone, Wolff added: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens in terms of management. Bernie has done an awesome job for 50 years and made it what it is. He has built an empire and we are all benefiting from that empire.</p> <p>\u201cThat thing generates millions of live views and full racetracks like we had today, and one and a half billion in profits every year, so he has done an awesome job. What the future will show is whether there are things that can be improved or not, I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t want to speculate because this is just wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Ecclestone told the German magazine Auto Motor Und Sport that Liberty Media would transfer the first of two tranches of payment in the $8.5bn deal on Tuesday. Ecclestone was unclear about how his role would change if the deal went through but told the magazine: \u201cI will do what I have always done. What role I play is my decision.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside CVC\u2019s 35.5% stake, the US fund manager Waddell &amp; Reed holds a 20.9% stake in F1, while Ecclestone\u2019s share stands at 5.3% and his Bambino Trust has another 8.5%. Removing Ecclestone from F1 could involve difficult negotiations. Even though some of his control has been dissipated by the deals he has made with individual teams, he remains the most important single figure in the sport.</p> <p>Liberty has been considering a move into F1 since 2014. RSE Ventures, the owner of the Miami Dolphins NFL team, teamed up with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to make a separate bid since then and Sky TV has frequently been linked with the sport.</p> <p>Things continue to move in the drivers\u2019 market.

Listeners have heard Rob alternate between charm and abuse, subjecting Helen to years of psychological torture as well as physical violence. Sadly, Helen\u2019s experiences mirror what so many abused women feel and experience every day \u2013 she has been manipulated and controlled by a violent and bullying partner. </p> <p>\u201cIf you have been moved by Helen\u2019s story, I would urge you to consider the real-life Helens Refuge supports every day.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/helentitchener\">Helen Titchener Fund</a>, set up by Archers listener and Refuge supporter Paul Trueman has already raised more than \u00a3130,000 for the charity, and Horley urged people to continue to donate to reach the target of \u00a3150,000. That would be the equivalent of almost 2,900 nights in a refuge for a woman and her children \u201cat a time when domestic violence services are experiencing huge cuts\u201d, she said.</p> <p>As the storyline intensified in February, there was a 17% increase in calls to the <a href=\"http://www.nationaldomesticviolencehelpline.org.uk/\">national domestic violence helpline</a>, run by Refuge and <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/\">Women\u2019s Aid.</a></p> <p>As the trial opened, the prosecution tried to portray Helen Titchener as an unstable woman who had left her abusive husband in fear, before stabbing him.</p> <p>Rob Titchener claimed that she threatened to stop him seeing the child she was carrying and that he tried to restrain her to protect her from herself. But his mask slipped briefly as he responded angrily to questions from the defence about his quick temper.</p> <p>Ahead of the opening of the trial, which will run over a week\u2019s worth of episodes, listeners expressed their support for Helen on Twitter, as well as for the plight of real-life victims.

  "<p>Calm, cautious, careful, with a dash of determined optimism and opportunities for all: such has been the impression created by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-tory-leadership-bid-with-pledge-to-unite-country\" title=\"\">Theresa May in her first two months as prime minister</a>.

Or on the other hand, the realist: \u201cI am not going to pretend that all will be plain sailing.\u201d</p> <p>May is fortunate that her first big international occasion is the G20. An EU&#xa0;summit would have been complicated for obvious reasons. The G7 makes the UK look smaller and poorer than it is.

With David Cameron, there was always just a hint of the end of empire. The accent, the bearing, the nocturnal tantrum at an early EU summit, all limited his international appeal. If Tony Blair had continued as the convinced European he started out, the UK would surely not be where it is today. Although he has retained something of the salesman \u2013 silver-tongued, but over-promising. Internationalist ambition, and an unrealistic idea of the country\u2019s power, got the better of him.</p> <p>Theresa May, on first acquaintance at least, has less baggage. There is a technocratic anonymity about her; a notable absence of ideology or ostentation, which was evident at the start of her trip to China. Visually, she and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, seemed almost indistinguishable from the British Airways staff at the top of the aircraft steps.

This is not because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/manufacturing-figures-uk-economy-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">supposedly good economic news</a> of recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/damaging-fallout-brexit-armageddon-economies-ties-eu\" title=\"\">which risks being a short-term illusion</a>, but because in foreign relations at least, Brexit could bring a long overdue clarity of purpose.</p> <p>In the frenzy of politics that followed the referendum, little was made of the bigger cataclysm. It was not just that the&#xa0;UK had voted to leave the EU, it was that this one vote had, overnight, negated 50 years of British foreign policy. For the best part of the postwar period, successive prime ministers had been fixated on the EU (or its predecessors). They had sought membership, been rebuffed, tried again, been admitted, and then agonised endlessly about its costs and benefits.</p> <p>For all the complexity of the negotiations to come, that preoccupation can be no more. The UK must learn&#xa0;to survive \u2013 sink or swim \u2013 without the protective cocoon of the EU,&#xa0;and without all the excuses it offers. A new gauge of success will indeed be the country\u2019s attractiveness as an economic partner \u2013 those trade deals \u2013 but perhaps also a political one, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/japan-brexit-demands-range-from-possible-to-fanciful\">Japan's Brexit demands range from possible to fanciful</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the UK, there was always a spectre in our EU membership of the legacy of empire and the self-imposed \u201cduty\u201d to be an autonomous global player. Can Brexit perhaps help exorcise this ghost, too? Iraq, but not only Iraq, has left an aversion to intervention among UK voters that has not always been reflected in government or parliament. Hence, to an extent, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s appeal. There is surely room for a review of whether going back \u201ceast of Suez\u201d was really such a good idea. Brexit means that May must urgently reconsider what sort of international player the UK really wants to be.</p> <p>If the answer is more regional than&#xa0;global, then this is where the relevance to the UK of Europe, if not of the EU, may return. As May set off for China, defeated remainers thronged British streets to insist on their EU allegiance. It is a bit late, alas, for that. But if a large part of the remain campaign\u2019s problem was its association with an establishment elite, perhaps a pro-Europe movement that behaves with the creativity and commitment of an insurgency has prospects.</p> <p>As a realist, Theresa May will know&#xa0;that 48% is a constituency she cannot afford to ignore. Add her caution, and it could be as a regional player with a shorter, more selective reach that the UK, post-empire and post-EU, ultimately comes to rest.</p>",
  "<p>When a final measure is taken of Paul Nicholls\u2019 training career, the greatest single achievement might be his victory in the trainers\u2019 championship last season, when his no-star team somehow held off a determined assault by Willie Mullins\u2019 astonishing army of talent. But with the core jumps season once more on the horizon, the Somerset man is making no bullish predictions about a title defence.</p> <p>Indeed, he sounded slightly doubtful about it last week, shooting the breeze over lunch in his local, the Manor Inn, a short step down the lane from his stables. The champion trainer, now 54, was relaxed as he usually is in early autumn, with Cheltenham\u2019s first race meeting still more than a month off, having plenty of time to focus on his 128 horses, none of whom have disappointed him yet. Still, there is realism in his expectations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough season. I\u2019ve got a lot of young horses, lots and lots of young horses, which we had last year. Not many Grade One horses at the moment, we\u2019ve got to get that next generation.</p> <p>\u201cI always insist I\u2019m not setting out to win the trainers\u2019 championship. You\u2019ve just got a nice bunch of horses and if you get in that situation, of course you give it a go.</p> <p>\u201cHaving had 111 Grade Ones already and all those good horses, I can hardly complain. I\u2019ve been so lucky to win the 10 championships and whether you win one or two or three more, or no more, it doesn\u2019t actually make a massive difference now. We\u2019ll just do the best we can with what we\u2019ve got. You\u2019re only as good as your team, same as a football team. You know you\u2019ve got a good setup and everything works.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholls does not have horses for the Gold Cup, the Champion Chase or the Champion Hurdle unless one of his handsome youngsters shows unexpected improvement. The high points of last season came with horses such as Old Guard, punching way above his weight to win three times at Cheltenham before Christmas, and Vicente, landing April\u2019s Scottish National at 14-1 to pull the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/23/paul-nicholls-10th-trainers-title-willie-mullins-sandown-horse-racing\" title=\"\">trainers\u2019 title out of the fire.</a></p> <p>That will have to be the way of it once more because it is Mullins who has the big-spending owners to provide him with some of the best raw material. Nicholls recalls that in the days when he sourced Kauto Star, Master Minded, Big Buck\u2019s and Neptune Collonges from France, there was much less competition for such types from other British or Irish trainers.</p> <p>They may each have cost more than a quarter of a million euros, but he describes them as \u201cprobably the cheapest horses ever bought \u2026 the prize money they won was phenomenal. But you knew they were good as long as you did your job right.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d had seven or eight runs, you knew they were top class when you bought them. Now in France, they have one run or two runs and you\u2019ve got to buy them because if you don\u2019t someone else will. Horses that go seven or eight runs without being sold must have had a problem. They literally get sold on their debut. You\u2019re taking a massive chance because a year down the line, that form could be useless.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/04/godolphin-ambassadorial-dundalk-andrew-balding-blond-me-turkey-horse-racing\">Godolphin\u2019s Ambassadorial puts Classic potential on show at Dundalk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>November will bring the 25th anniversary of Nicholls\u2019 first runner, so this is not a bad time to reflect on the ways the game has changed. But despite those changes he has consistently gathered in more than \u00a32m in prize money for the last 14 seasons, maintaining a strike rate of 20% or higher since 1995 and, title or not, he is a good bet to keep going at that level.</p> <p>Silviniaco Conti is one of the horses most likely to help him do so this winter, despite having reached the age of 10. Twice a King George winner, his last season was blighted by problems with sarcoids, lumps on the skin, which limited his ability to train and may have been a key cause of his disappointing run in the Betfair Chase.</p> <p>While sarcoids never disappear completely, Nicholls believes that Silviniaco\u2019s are currently dormant. \u201cWe were treading on egg shells all along, training him, I think we only had him right once last year. But now we\u2019ve started off with no problems at all, getting a lot of hard work in him.\u201d He will go to Down Royal in early November for a three-mile race, accompanied by Le Mercurey, who will try to give Nicholls an eighth success in nine years in the Powers Irish Whiskey Chase.</p> <p>Zarkandar and Irish Saint, both missing last winter through injury, are back in full training and expected to contribute from early autumn. Others who ran only sparingly, like Dodging Bullets and Aux Ptits Soins, are reportedly in rude health. The latter is an exciting prospect for novice chases, as is Politologue, who also carries the yellow colours of John Hales.</p> <p>Nicholls has long been among the most communicative of trainers and those seeking detail on all his horses in training can find it in the <a href=\"http://www.paulnichollsracing.com/brochure.htm\" title=\"\">98-page brochure</a> he now sells through his website, the profits from which go to charities including the Injured Jockeys Fund.</p> <p>His is a team long on depth and perhaps the quality will emerge over time. But Mullins is not his only concern, as Nicholls expresses much respect for the Warwickshire stable of his former assistant, Dan Skelton, where the facilities have been built up by investment from the trainer\u2019s father, Nick, a gold-medal winner in the Olympic show jumping this summer.</p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Dan was to challenge for the trainer\u2019s championship, if not this year then in the years to come,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be thinking, just upgrade his horses a bit and \u2026 He\u2019s got some good horses now. He\u2019ll be right up there.</p> <p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s not 66-1 next year for the championship. He might not be 66-1 halfway through this season. They\u2019ve done well and good luck to them.\u201d</p>",

Taking possession of the goat is a tricky manoeuvre in which the rider gallops past the carcass and swoops down to grab a leg and pull it up. There follows an almighty horse melee in which punches are thrown, whips fly and the goat is tugged back and forth, before one horseman emerges in a cloud of dust to gallop towards the goal, shaped like a paddling pool, and dunk the goat in to score. </p> <p>Kok-boru games are being held at a brand new 10,000-seat hippodrome in Cholpon-Ata on Issyk Kul, a high-altitude lake four hours\u2019 drive from Kyrgyzstan\u2019s capital, Bishkek. The hippodrome was also the site of the opening ceremony, which featured hundreds of whirling nomad women, stunt horsemen galloping across the arena with their clothes on fire, and graphics on a vast screen telling the story of the Kyrgyz nation, which has a long and storied history as a rugged nomadic tribe, before Central Asia was conquered by Tsarist Russia and then absorbed into the Soviet Union.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIf Genghis Khan were alive, he\u2019d want to be here,\u201d the announcer\u2019s voice boomed out as the ceremony got underway. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/kyrgyzstan/giv-31075Xb79vnvgddec/\" data-alt=\"Location of Kyrgyzstan, and Lake Issyk-Kul.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/kyrgyzstan/giv-31075Xb79vnvgddec/\">Location of Kyrgyzstan, and Lake Issyk-Kul.</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the modern world, people are forgetting their history, and there is a threat of extinction for traditional cultures,\u201d Kyrgyz president Almazbek Atambayev said at the opening. \u201cNomadic civilisation is an example of sustainable development, which is what all of humanity is looking for today.\u201d</p> <p>As the ceremony drew to a close, shaven-headed security guards frantically cleared a corridor in the media area of the stadium, and with a burst of dramatic music, Steven Seagal entered the arena atop a horse, clad in the armour of an ancient Kyrgyz warrior.

She also made 34 unforced errors. Sevastova conceded that the light \u2013 bright at one end, dark at the other \u2013 made things difficult, but ultimately she coped with those conditions better than Konta. Whether she also handled her emotions as well as she might have, only she\u2019ll know. But she often looked somewhere between distraught and despairing, and Konta was unable to take advantage of that. It was a strange match, partly because of that emotional dynamic, but the bottom line is that Konta is out, spelling the end of the British challenge in the women\u2019s singles, while Sevastova is through to her first grand slam quarter-final.

Sevastova didn\u2019t know whether to hit it. Or even if she could hit it.

It\u2019s not like either player has been winning every game at one end and losing every game at the other. A more persuasive explanation is the distinctive if so far up-and-down brilliance of Sevastova. Konta loves to develop a rhythm and, so far, the Latvian is giving her none. After a brilliant angled sliced forehand winner at 15-15 \u2013 a rolled forehand from Konta had her way out of court \u2013 Sevastova steers a wonderful forehand winner down the line to bring up set point. She takes it at the first time of asking and, with three-quarters of an hour gone, Konta has it all to do. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ddb71469dc85ba3ffc39b03fcd9dec83b749e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ddb71469dc85ba3ffc39b03fcd9dec83b749e6/0_117_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia reacts against Kateryna Bondarenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia reacts after winning a point against Johanna Konta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Goodlett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-04T17:25:54.806Z\">at 6.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cc43e4e4b0456abb93d910\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-04T15:59:59.863Z\">4.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: Sevastova</strong><strong>*</strong><strong> 5-4 Konta</strong><strong> (*denotes server)</strong></p> <p>The match takes another surreal turn when Sevastova, having won the opening point, challenges her own first serve \u2013 which was called in \u2013 following a winning forehand return from Konta, one so good that you can hardly believe it came from the same player who conceded her serve so tamely in the previous game.

That the British No1 has been inspired rather than inhibited by her return to the scene of last year\u2019s heroics is a measure of the mental resolve that has underpinned her extraordinary rise since. Ranked just inside the top 100 this time last year, when she accounted for Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza and Andrea Petkovic in successive rounds before falling to Petra Kvitova, she is now ranked 14th and bearing down on a place in the top 10. Victory here would make her the first British woman in the last eight since Jo Durie in 1983. In short, she is there to be shot at this time out. Yet Konta has not only defended the ranking points she earned in New York last year but literally pulled herself up off her knees to do so, overcoming humidity, hyperventilation and on-court collapse to squeak past Bulgaria\u2019s Tsvetana Pironkova in round two. Whatever one made of that controversial episode \u2013 and Pironkova, for one, was not altogether happy about the extended delay it occasioned \u2013 Konta\u2019s ability to come through it and win spoke of a hard-as-nails competitor, an impression confirmed by her 6-2, 6-1 dismissal of Belinda Bencic in the next round.</p> <p><strong>Then again, </strong><strong>Sevastova \u2013 whose own backstory is barely less impressive than Konta\u2019s \u2013 also knows a thing or two about overcoming physical adversity. </strong>In 2013 the Latvian, beset by injuries and clearly out of love with the sport, retired aged just 23. \u201cI had many injuries, and I wasn\u2019t happy with my tennis or where I stood on the tennis court,\u201d she reflected after emulating Konta by claiming the scalp of Muguruza in the second round on Thursday. \u201cSomething different was hurting all the time: back, arm, and legs. Then I decided to go out and retire. I did some studying. I coached some kids, but nothing serious. Just lessons, and lived a normal life.\u201d After about 18 months, though, Sevastova \u2013 who reached a career-high of No36 in January 2011 \u2013 began to miss the big stage. She felt her way back into the sport gingerly at first, playing a few ITF Challenger events, but a sustained run of form and fitness has lifted her back up to No48. Crucially, Sevastova is also enjoying her tennis once again. Her time away from the game has given her a balanced and mature perspective \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s life after tennis, that if you lose a match, it\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d she says \u2013 and she backed up her win over Muguruza with a straight-sets dismissal of Kateryna Bondarenko, a former US Open quarter-finalist. So forget the rankings. If Sevastova brings her A-game, we can expect Konta \u2013 who won their only previous meeting, at the Australian Open three years ago, in three tight sets \u2013 to have her hands full.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-04T14:53:45.369Z\">at 3.53pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The number of families agreeing that their loved ones\u2019 organs can be donated for transplantation may be rising more quickly in Wales than other parts of the UK following the introduction of a <a href=\"http://organdonationwales.org/?lang=en\">groundbreaking new consent system</a>, new figures suggest. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/13/its-better-than-winning-the-lottery-readers-organ-donation-stories\">'It's better than winning the lottery': readers' organ donation stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Health officials and ministers in Wales are encouraged by how the so-called \u201cdeemed consent\u201d system is working and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has said the picture in Wales is promising. </p> <p>Under the new Welsh system, which came into force last December, residents are deemed to have consented to organ donation unless they positively opt out. </p> <p>In June the Welsh government said the scheme had already saved dozens of lives after revealing that in the first six months, of the 60 organs that were transplanted, 32 came from people whose consent had been \u201cdeemed\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/news-and-campaigns/news/highest-number-of-organ-transplants-ever-across-uk-but-many-families-still-say-no-to-donation/\">New figures from NHSBT </a> show that in the financial year 2015/16 the family consent/authorisation rate increased in Wales from 49% to 59%. Across the UK the rise was smaller: 58% to 62%. </p> <p>Although the overall UK rate is higher, the more significant percentage increase in Wales last year may signal a change in attitude. </p> <p>The number of living donors in Wales also increased by 20% to 49. Across the UK the number of such donors dropped by 2%.</p> <p>Organ Donation week takes place across the UK from Monday. One priority in Wales is to get its messages across to young people and the Welsh government is mailing every new student arriving in the country this autumn to explain the system.</p> <p>Under the Welsh system people who want to be an organ donor either register a decision to opt in or do nothing. For those who choose to do nothing, if they are 18 or over, have lived in Wales for more than 12 months and die in Wales, they will be regarded as having consented to organ donation. </p> <p>Family consent, however, is still important because if a person has not opted in or out, relatives are still involved in the process and if they say their loved one would not have wanted their organs removed, a donation would not go ahead. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/mar/24/seeing-family-donate-childs-organs-stay-with-me-forever\">Seeing a family donate a child's organs will stay with me forever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Frank Atherton, chief medical officer for Wales, said he was pleased with how the scheme was working. \u201cThings seem to be moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is encouraging. We\u2019ve put a lot of effort into campaigns to help people understand their options. All that is starting to make an impact.\u201d </p> <p>He made it clear that the scheme was still in its very early days. The 2015/16 figures relating to family consent have to be treated with caution as the Welsh scheme was launched with only four months of the financial year to go and experts warn there could be fluctuations from year to year.</p> <p>But Atherton said the move towards the system has certainly led to many more families discussing the topic. \u201cNext year there will be a full evaluation of what the impact of deemed consent has been.\u201d </p> <p>Overall, the figures show there is still a long way to go if the UK target of increasing consent rates to 80% by 2020 is to be met. In Wales and in the UK as a whole, around four out of 10 families who were approached did not agree to organ donation taking place.</p> <p>Last year in the UK, 466 patients died in need of an organ and a further 881 were removed from the transplant waiting list. Many of them would have died shortly afterwards.</p> <p>Sally Johnson, director of organ donation at NHSBT, expressed optimism about what was happening in Wales. \u201cWe welcome the opportunities that the legislation and communications programme in Wales is providing in getting everyone in Wales to think about and talk about organ donation. </p> <p>\u201cWe have been working closely with the Welsh government on the introduction of deemed consent and are working with them to make it a success. It\u2019s early days, but things look promising.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Case study</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/25/organ-donation-wales-pioneers-opt-out\">Kimberly Chard, 31, from Cardiff, who was born with cystic fibrosis, underwent a double lung transplant at the end of last year.</a></p> <p>She said: \u201cEvery day I think of the selfless gift my donor and their family gave me, how they chose to save lives despite their loss.

I will always treasure the future my donor and their family gave me.</p> <p>\u201cThe new system has created an opportunity for everyone to get involved and discuss their choices and what their decision would be if they were ever in the situation to be able to donate their organs. </p> <p>\u201cBy talking to their loved ones, people are making it so much easier for their family as they would know what their decision was and be able to honour their loved ones decision.\u201d</p>",

I\u2019m not sure what their decision will be.\u201d</p> <p>Vaz seems to be hoping that that he will be able to temporarily stand aside without having to give up the chairmanship, which he has held for nine years, for good. But his fate will depend on whether fellow members of the committee accept this solution or whether they take the view that the allegations have made his position as chairman permanently untenable.</p> <p>On Saturday night, when the story first broke, Vaz gave a statement to the Mail on Sunday saying that he was \u201cgenuinely sorry for the hurt and distress that has been caused by my actions in particular to my wife and children\u201d and that he would be \u201cstanding aside\u201d from chairing home affairs committee hearings with immediate affect.</p> <p>On Sunday morning his office released a statement to the media which said nothing about being sorry or standing aside, but which criticised the Sunday Mirror and said he was referring the allegations to his lawyers. His office refused to say whether he stood by the comment issued to the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>Then, on Sunday afternoon, Vaz issued a fresh statement signalling that he intended to duck out of the limelight. \u201cAt this time I do not want there to be any distraction from the important work the home affairs select committee undertakes so well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSelect committees do vital work in holding the government and others to account. We are due to publish two reports, one into antisemitism and the other into FGM in the next few days, in addition we have a number of key witnesses.</p> <p> \u201cI will of course inform committee members first of my plans when we meet on Tuesday.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday the committee is scheduled to take evidence from the immigration minister Robert Goodwill and on Wednesday it will be questioning Amber Rudd, the new home secretary. Vaz\u2019s office and the committee\u2019s spokesperson were unable to say who would be chairing those sessions.</p> <p>Naz Shah, a Labour MP who sits on the committee, said on Sunday that it was right for Vaz to stand aside from the chairmanship. John Whittingdale, the Conservative former culture secretary, also said this was the correct move for Vaz. \u201cGiven the areas [for] which the committee is responsible, that does seem to me to be a sensible course of action,\u201d Whittingdale told Sky News.</p> <p>Diane Abbott, the shadow health secretary, told the same programme that she did not want to comment on Vaz\u2019s future but that \u201cthis must be a dreadful time for him, and his family \u2013 his wife and his two children.\u201d </p> <p>According to the Sunday Mirror, which has illustrated its report with a picture showing Vaz with a man said to be one of the escorts, the MP met two eastern European male sex workers eight days ago in a flat he owns in north London.<br></p> <p>According to the paper, Vaz asked one of the men in a text message sent before the encounter to bring poppers, the sex-enhancing drug used by gay men that the government came close to banning in a law passed this year.</p> <p>Vaz argued in parliament that poppers should not be included in a list of substances banned by the Psychoactive Substances Act and in the paper he is quoted as telling the escorts that he did not use them himself.</p> <p>Vaz, who reportedly told the men his name was Jim and that he was a washing machine salesman, is also quoted discussing with the men the possibility of obtaining cocaine for the next time they met, although Vaz reportedly said he would not want to take the drug himself.<br></p> <p>The paper says two payments of \u00a3150 each were made into a bank account before the 27 August encounter after one of the escorts supplied the account details to Vaz. </p> <p>The Sunday Mirror also claimed that the money paid into the bank account of one of the escorts on behalf of Vaz was paid in by a man linked to a diabetes charity set up by the MP.</p> <p>The Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he would be urging the Charity Commission to investigate. Bridgen also said he would be writing to the parliamentary commissioner for standards regarding Vaz\u2019s conduct.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Charity Commission said it was aware of the allegations made regarding an individual linked to the charity Silver Star. \u201cThe commission has asked journalists to forward any details and evidence they have in order to determine whether there is a regulatory role for the commission.\u201d</p> <p>There is no suggestion in the newspaper report that the charity\u2019s money was used in the affair or that the man knew what the payment was for. <br></p> <p>In its interim report on prostitution in July, the home affairs committee said: \u201cWe are not yet convinced that the sex buyer law would be effective in reducing demand or in improving the lives of sex workers, either in terms of the living conditions for those who continue to work in prostitution or the effectiveness of services to help them find new ways to earn a living.</p> <p>\u201cEvaluations of the impact of sex buyer laws are largely based on data about street prostitution, and therefore offer little insight into the large parts of the sex industry which take place in various indoor environments, and there are indications that the law can be misused to harass and victimise sex workers, who are the very people whom the law is seeking to protect.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to Vaz\u2019s comment, a spokeswoman for the Sunday Mirror said the paper \u201cstands by the story\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>5 September 2016.</strong> This article has been edited to re-emphasise that the Silver Star charity did not make any payments in connection with the recent claims concerning Mr Vaz.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>Taking to the lake is a natural enough pursuit in Finland so it made perfect sense for Albert Bunjaki, the Kosovo manager, to organise a rowing trip for his players in the waters beside their base in Eerikkila. It was not quite the relaxing Saturday-afternoon activity some may have envisaged; the squad were put into two boats and the chagrin when Bunjaki ordered three in each vessel to put down their oars is not hard to picture. The six redundant players would have to content themselves with offering moral support; everyone else would just have to work that little bit harder.</p> <p>The exercise had been carefully calculated. Kosovo\u2019s first World Cup qualifier takes place in Turku on Monday evening and Bunjaki is still awaiting confirmation from Fifa that half a dozen of his best players will be eligible. That was hindrance enough on Saturday; imagine, then, the inconvenience when Kosovo were informed the final decision would not be given until 3pm on matchday, fewer than seven hours before kick-off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/road-to-russia-2018-how-will-northern-ireland-republic-of-ireland-wales-fare-world-cup\">Road to Russia 2018: how will Northern Ireland, the Republic and Wales fare?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be about minutes, not hours,\u201d says Bunjaki of the margins involved in finalising his selection, and while the coach refuses to complain about his lot there is no escaping the farcical nature of the situation. His Finland counterpart, Hans Backe, summed it up well enough when terming it \u201ca total disaster from Fifa\u201d, and the authorities certainly appear to have been caught badly cold by a development that should have been foreseen long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/kosovo-accepted-uefa-member-vote-congress\" title=\"\">before Kosovo were accepted into football\u2019s governing body in May</a>.</p> <p>The issue surrounds players of Kosovan birth or heritage who have played for other national sides, or did not hold Kosovan nationality before their admission. Those wishing to represent Kosovo have been allowed to put their request to the Fifa players\u2019 status committee, a body headed by the former FA chairman Geoff Thompson, for consideration. The deciding criteria appear to be anyone\u2019s guess. Four of Bunjaki\u2019s squad \u2013 including the Manchester City midfielder Sinan Bytyqi, who has under-21 caps for Austria \u2013 have been given the all-clear but it will go to the wire for the rest. The likely outcome is they, too, will be allowed to play. \u201cI have plan B and plan C, of course. I have to,\u201d Bunjaki says, \u201cbut I still don\u2019t want to think about plan B, because it will change everything.\u201d</p> <p>The six players left on the edge are Samir Ujkani, Alban Meha, Herolind Shala, Milot Rashica, Amir Rrahmani and Valon Berisha. Of that list, the first five have represented Albania and there is a sense inside the Kosovan camp that their colleagues in Tirana could, to put it lightly, have been more forthcoming in assisting with the relevant paperwork. Any reticence at the other end can be understood: the Vitesse Arnhem winger Rashica, in particular, is a thrilling young talent and the implications of losing him to neighbouring Kosovo, where he was born, are troubling.</p> <p>Relations between the two states have certainly been complicated by the issue and the reaction towards those players in Shkoder, an Albanian city where Kosovo must play their home games until facilities in Pristina are up to scratch, is unlikely to be complimentary when they face Croatia there next month.</p> <p>It will be a relief when the football starts and there is certainly frustration that administrative foot-dragging has deflected attention from the occasion\u2019s significance. Kosovo have been working towards this since long before their declaration of independence in 2008 and the emotions when they take to the Veritas Stadion pitch will be visceral and complex. Part of Bunjaki\u2019s job is to keep them in check and he is concerned that his team \u2013 which is top-loaded with forwards who include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/11/manchester-city-bersant-celina-demanded-place-norway-starting-xi\" title=\"\">another young Manchester City player, Bersant Celina</a> \u2013 will be too headstrong.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a big problem in training,\u201d he says. \u201cThe aim of the session was defence but by the end it was just attack, attack, attack. It was like I had 23 forwards. At dinner I wrote on the whiteboard: \u2018Are you happy with what you did today?\u2019 I need them to be compact together, because at the moment they are not. They all try to be Ronaldo or Messi.\u201d</p> <p>There is not much time in which to instil some conservatism and Bunjaki has taken the unusual step of organising an extra training session, based on positioning without the ball, for Monday morning. Bunjaki himself requires some reining in at times, too. He is based in Sweden and has been advised throughout his coaching career by the former England assistant Tord Grip, who sat beside him in the dugout in Kosovo\u2019s first Fifa-recognised match, a friendly against Haiti, in 2014 and is still consulted informally. Grip, 78, is in Turku to watch the game and says he has already had to talk Bunjaki out of putting his players through double training sessions each day.</p> <p>Six of them will hope that is not the only football they play this week. Veritas Stadion\u2019s capacity is only 9,372 and it is expected around half the crowd will be cheering on Kosovo; around 10,000 Kosovans live in the region \u2013 many of whom, like the Inter Turku manager and the former Ipswich striker Shefki Kuqi \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/20/shefki-kuqi-interview\" title=\"\">emigrated before or during the civil war in the 90s</a>. The ties are close and best summed up by the plight of Perparim Hetemaj, a Kosovo-born Finland and Chievo midfielder, who asked Backe to be stood down from this fixture while he considered his future allegiance.</p> <p>Perhaps Hetemaj will decide to join Bunjaki and company for a potentially combustible October night in Shkoder. He will have no shortage of people to ask about the switching process. \u201cWhether or not they can play, they have to be supporting the guys that are,\u201d Bunjaki says. Even if they do not all make it in time, Kosovo\u2019s squad are firmly in the same boat.</p>",

  "<p>When Michael Lakey stopped off at his local gas station in Hayden, Alabama, to pick up ice for a barbecue, he was greeted with clenched-teeth hostility by the clerk.</p> <p>Something, he knew, was awry.</p> <p>At the store counter was a stack of copies of <a href=\"http://justbustednews.com/72505/2376/1/home\">Just Busted</a>, a \u201crogue\u2019s gallery\u201d tabloid costing $1 featuring the mugshot photographs of people arrested in the local area and the crimes they are suspected of committing.</p> <p>And inside, on page 20, was a picture of Lakey, 39, a law-abiding metal worker with a wife, Gloria, a one-year-old granddaughter and four foster kids to support.</p> <p>The caption next to his mugshot read, to his shock, \u201cthat I\u2019d been arrested for sexual assault of a child under 12 years old\u201d.</p> <p>The caption was, to put it mildly, erroneous.</p> <p>In May 2009, Lakey had been issued a ticket for driving on expired license plates and duly paid the fine, but the payment had been incorrectly logged into the police computer system. Then just over a year later, he was pulled over again. With no receipt on his person to prove he had paid his fine, he was arrested and had his mugshot taken.</p> <p>And under state public access laws, Just Busted\u2019s publishers could access arrestees\u2019 mugshots from police departments.</p> <p>It later emerged that the Just Busted graphic artist responsible for compiling the issue had mistakenly paired Lakey\u2019s picture with another suspect\u2019s charges.</p> <p>Lakey knew that the chances of people in the community seeing his mugshot with the inaccurate accompanying charge were high \u2013 Just Busted had a circulation of over 10,000 in the area. But he did not anticipate that those he had considered friends and confidants would make a pariah of him.</p> <p>Three days after publication, the door of the Lakey\u2019s house rapped purposefully. On the stoop stood several social workers from the state\u2019s department of human resources, responsible for child protection services.</p> <p>\u201cThey had seen my mugshot and they came out with the intention of taking our foster kids and our granddaughter if we could not prove that my mugshot with those charges was false,\u201d Lakey said in a south Texas brogue.</p> <p>The agony lasted for the four hours it took to reach the Blount County officer responsible for sexual abuse cases, who confirmed that Lakey was not a child molester.</p> <p>Just Busted printed a series of retractions, but locals\u2019 suspicions festered and grew. Death stares on the street escalated.</p> <p>\u201cA few days after the magazine article came out my wife started receiving [anonymous] threatening phone calls from people telling her I was gonna get what I had coming to me and if she knew what was good for her she would pack her and the kids up and leave, that [I was going to] get beat up or killed,\u201d Lakey said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d9cc6470e464d5a6870e16f5a6373bfd363bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d9cc6470e464d5a6870e16f5a6373bfd363bac/0_0_1090_1378/791.png\" alt=\"Michael Lakey\u2019s mugshot in Just Busted erroneously describes him as having been charged with child sex abuse.\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Lakey\u2019s mugshot in Just Busted erroneously describes him as having been charged with child sex abuse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their home was vandalised on numerous occasions.</p> <p>Months later, shortly after his wife died, Lakey and his granddaughter packed up and left Hayden for Texas.</p> <p>Then last year, Lakey successfully sued Just Busted for defamation, winning a five-figure sum.

Each issue is put together by a graphic artist rather than a journalist.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lakey is not the paper\u2019s first victim of an egregious error. A previous designer had made five mistakes in seven issues. And in 2014, a Sevierville, Tennessee, man sued Just Busted for defamation, saying he was wrongly described as a rape suspect; that suit was eventually settled.</p> <h2>A \u2018deprivation of liberty\u2019</h2> <p>Just Busted is a major player in the mugshot publication market with titles across several states. But since 2010, copycats have sprouted across the country: Gotcha! covers central Virginia, the Hard Times in Alabama, Green Mountain Mugshots in Vermont, Jailbirds Rocks in Oklahoma. </p> <p>There are others who have been defamed by mugshot magazines, including James Suddarth, a 46-year-old Charlottesville, Virginia, man who successfully sued for defamation in 2012 after the Crime Times wrongly labelled him as a felon who had fired a gun in a public building.</p> <p>Some mugshot websites have also failed in their fact-checking duties. A lawsuit that gained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/08/mugshot-websites-stop-charging-photo-removal\">national attention in 2014</a> was filed after people complained about being charged hundreds of dollars to remove the mugshots even if the cases against those arrested had been dropped. Two sites eventually settled the suit and agreed to stop charging.</p> <p>Mugshot publications and free-press advocates argue that they are providing a civic service, and one of Just Busted\u2019s owners, Wanda Gilham, said in December that her magazines have led to the capture of fugitives.</p> <p>In 2011, a woman who had been been sexually assaulted three years earlier in Saginaw, Michigan, <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/02/first-degree_sexual_assault_co.html\">identified James W Gunn</a> as her attacker only after seeing his picture in a local mugshot magazine after he had been arrested on a separate charge.</p> <p>Scott Ciolek, an Ohio-based attorney who brought the 2014 lawsuit, said that cases such as Lakey\u2019s are extremely hard to win, which does little to incentivise editors to take measures to prevent defamation. </p> <p>\u201cWhen a magazine makes mistakes like this they will argue that the error was made by the local sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d Ciolek said. \u201cAnd in most states, sheriff\u2019s departments have immunity from tort liability.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e49d4d3982259986837cad46e50a277ca471f21a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e49d4d3982259986837cad46e50a277ca471f21a/0_0_508_246/500.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Lakey looking at Just Busted magazine before his case.\" width=\"500\" height=\"242\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Lakey looking at Just Busted magazine before his case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny McDevitt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ciolek, who says there are at least 200 mugshot publications across the country, went on to say that while regulating mugshot magazines seems unlikely, there are other options available to reign in \u201cfly-by-night operations\u201d. He pointed to the FBI\u2019s discretionary policy on the availability of booking photos as one that could be rolled out to other law enforcement agencies. He also called for magazines to be held to the same defamation standards as an individual rather than a newspaper. </p> <p>\u201cJust like if you were to keep a lion in your backyard and somebody climbs over the fence and gets attacked by it, you are liable as its owner,\u201d Ciolek said.</p> <p>Some states have moved to restrict public access to mugshots. In July, the federal appeals court in Ohio for the sixth circuit ruled 9 to 7 that federal booking photos are no longer public records, with Chief Judge R Guy Cole Jr remarking that \u201cthese images preserve the indignity of a deprivation of liberty, often at the [literal] expense of the most vulnerable among us\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018My reputation completely shredded, that was the worst part\u2019</h2> <p>Gemma, who does not wish to have her real name published, was a well-respected hospital staff nurse in upstate South Carolina.

  "<p>In early 1963, Richard Neville, who has died aged 74, gathered together a band of fellow students at his parents\u2019 home in suburban Sydney to put together a satirical magazine. Along with Richard Walsh, the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/dec/06/martin-sharp\">Martin Sharp</a> and others, Neville created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/mar/06/return-oz-most-controversial-magazine-60s-goes-online\">Oz</a>, a 16-page black-and-white publication. The first issue appeared on April Fools\u2019 Day, with 6,000 copies selling out by lunchtime.</p> <p>Using humour to mock the conservative nature of Australian society and show up the hypocrisy of its sexual mores, that first issue kicked off with a piece on the history of the chastity belt, as well as a long feature by Richard exposing the dangers of back-street abortion \u2013 at a time when abortion was not only illegal, but a taboo subject. Later issues would focus on censorship, homosexuality, police brutality and the \u201cWhite Australia\u201d policies of the Australian government.</p> <p>Oz immediately attracted the ire of the establishment. Shortly after the third issue appeared, the three editors were charged with bringing out an indecent and obscene publication. Advised, wrongly, that they would get off if they pleaded guilty, they did so, but were duly charged and fined.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/04/revolutionary-artists-60s-counterculture-v-and-a-you-say-you-want-a-revolution\">The revolutionary artists of the 60s\u2019 colourful counterculture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In March 1964, they were again accused of obscenity, for issue No 6, which carried a cover photograph of Richard and two mates pretending to urinate into a wall fountain, on the side of the new P&amp;O building in Sydney, which had recently been opened by the prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.nma.gov.au/primeministers/robert_menzies\">Robert Menzies</a>. This time the editors pleaded not guilty. They were tried and convicted, and given prison sentences of between three and six months with hard labour. They eventually won on appeal, on the basis that the magistrate had misdirected the jury, but the case dragged on for two years.</p> <p>By now Richard was ready to travel. In 1966 he and Sharp took the overland route through Asia to London, where Richard met up with his girlfriend, Louise Ferrier, who had left Sydney the year before. There he found the lure of starting a London Oz irresistible. He recruited writers and artists, and brought out the first issue in February 1967. Aided by the visual brilliance of Sharp and the flexibility of offset litho printing to experiment with colour, Oz became the iconic magazine for that loose set of attitudes known as the counterculture.</p> <p>Energised by the optimism of the era, Richard gave Oz an eclectic, imaginative breadth, with a pioneering internationalism and an opposition to prejudice, and subjects ranging from American Yippies to student activists, from mystical dreamers to new age ecologists, which meant the magazine was only sometimes as superficial as the sloganeering banner of sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll suggested.</p> <p>He had an Australian knack of brushing aside the systemic barriers of British class. He published New Left writers but disagreed with their revolutionary politics, declaring himself against all \u201cisms\u201d and abhorring any ideology backed by violence. Yet by 1970 he acknowledged that violence had erupted on the edges of the alternative society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e3846eaf55b33b2b1f5a0f89a61a949ab87c566\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e3846eaf55b33b2b1f5a0f89a61a949ab87c566/0_0_2528_3572/708.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of issue No 3 of Oz magazine.\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover of issue No 3 of Oz magazine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Wollongong Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To address this, Richard was preparing his \u201cEnd of an Era\u201d issue of the magazine when, in 1971, he had to endure the notorious Oz obscenity trial in the UK for No 28 (May 1970), put together by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/aug/02/pressandpublishing.g2\">schoolchildren</a>, who had responded to an ad in Oz to create their own issue. Linked to an additional charge of conspiring to corrupt public morals, for which the penalty had no limits, the trial went on for a nerve-racking six weeks.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/16/mortimer-rumpole-dies-obituary\">John Mortimer</a> QC defended Richard\u2019s UK co-editors, Jim Anderson and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/23/felix-dennis\">Felix Dennis</a>, while Richard defended himself, displaying oratorical skill. Humorous exchanges during the case related, for example, to the Rupert Bear comic strip: one of the schoolboy contributors had collaged Rupert on to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/24/robert-crumb-interview-art-and-beauty-exhibition\">Robert Crumb</a> cartoon. A pop single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnIMsOBH6po\">God Save Oz</a>, by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, contributed to the Oz defence fund.</p> <p>Public outrage at the long prison sentences handed down to the editors ignited after they emerged from remand with their hippy locks shorn. After rigorous further work by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/geoffreyrobertson\">Geoffrey Robertson</a>, junior counsel to the defence, the case was won on appeal, again on the basis that the judge had misdirected the jury.</p> <p>In the same year, Richard co-founded the newspaper Ink, to bridge the gap between the underground and the mainstream press. It folded in February 1972. Exhausted by the trial, he shed the editor\u2019s mantle. The final issue of Oz was published in November 1973.</p> <p>Richard was born in Sydney, an interesting place to grow up in the postwar years. Despised as a cultural nowheresville by Britain, but valued by migrants from war-torn Europe, it was a city of equality, promise and low unemployment. But in Australia the Indigenous population had no vote, and there was stifling censorship of the arts, widespread police corruption, and a prime minister who showed his support for the US invasion of Vietnam by reintroducing conscription in the form of a birthday ballot.</p> <p>Richard was the youngest of three children of Betty (nee MacKnight) and Clive Neville. His father was a bookkeeper who had commanded an infantry battalion in the second world war \u2013 earning the nickname Colonel \u2013 and then became managing director of Country Life newspaper. Richard was sent as a boarder to Knox grammar school in Wahroonga and, following a period working in advertising, enrolled for an arts degree at the University of New South Wales, Sydney.</p> <p>There he found his metier as editor of the student newspaper, Tharunka, turning it into a platform for student pranks. He met Walsh, a Sydney University student also involved in journalism, who became a sparring companion with a wit to match his own and, on a road trip to a student editors\u2019 conference in Adelaide, the idea to launch a magazine of dissent was born.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_MovAWNxMc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8_MovAWNxMc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Richard Neville on Climate v the Rich</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Richard applied his charm and enthusiasm to the co-editorship of Oz as well as flair, originality and a steadfast loyalty to its values of tolerance and freedom. I first met him when I went to work as the magazine\u2019s secretary in 1964. I observed his wide smile, his generous brown eyes and dark hair, already longer than the norm, and responded to his humour by making a joke of my own, which surprised me. He was a man who inspired others; he was a catalyst and innovator, who displayed a charisma that was sometimes the envy of others.</p> <p>In the years following the end of Oz, Richard wrote freelance pieces from an alternative perspective for several newspapers. In 1974 he met Julie Clarke, a writer and journalist, and they moved to New York and then to Sydney, where they married in 1980. Together they wrote a biography of Charles Sobhraj (1979), who murdered young backpackers travelling in Asia in the 1970s. It was a harrowing experience for Richard, who felt he had come face to face with the antithesis of the counterculture.</p> <p>At the end of the 60s, he had posed the tricky question: out of the alternative society, what exactly had \u201cthe greatest relevance for the future\u201d? In his book Playpower (1970), he had predicted the rise of computer technology and envisaged more leisure, hence the need to develop the \u201cpolitics of play\u201d. But in the digital world of the 21st century, he asked: what if \u201cthe promise of free time turns out to be stealing our time?\u201d In these later years, as writer, journalist, television presenter and speaker, he sought to trace the footprints of the future, framing the urgent questions as a \u201crace between self-discovery and self-destruction\u201d.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Richard appeared on the Australian TV programme The Midday Show as a cultural commentator, and then created and hosted his own show, Extra Dimensions, in which he explored the subject of sustainability, searching for promising alternative projects and offbeat ventures, although his penchant for being the entertainer occasionally took centre stage.</p> <p>His life changed again after a serious car accident in the mid-90s, which damaged Julie\u2019s spine. Richard became the sole breadwinner and home carer. He continued to write articles and books, including Hippie Hippie Shake (1995), a memoir of the 60s, and in 1997 he co-launched the Australian Futures Foundation, to help organisations plan for the future and engage traditional businesses and environmentalists in dialogue. For more than a decade he wrote a <a href=\"http://richardneville.blogs.com/\">blog</a> underlining the enviromental as well as the human cost of militarism and war.</p> <p>He is survived by Julie and their daughters, Lucy and Angelica.<br><strong>Marsha Rowe</strong></p> <p><strong>Geoffrey Robertson writes:</strong> Richard Neville reached the pinnacle of his influence in the summer of 1971, on his release from prison on bail after an Oz trial that had produced more letters to the Times than the Suez crisis. His trademark hippy hair newly cut by the prison barber, he was rushed to the BBC studios and accorded an overly respectful interview by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/david-dimbleby\">David Dimbleby</a>, agog for further details of his \u201calternative society\u201d condemned by the prosecution as involving \u201cdope, rock\u2019n\u2019roll and fucking in the streets\u201d. It turned out to be a commitment to sexual equality, rock\u2019n\u2019roll and human rights. One of his aphorisms was picked up by Tony Blair, 25 years later, for his New Labour election campaign: \u201cAs Richard Neville said, there is only an inch of difference between us and the Conservatives, but it is an inch worth living in.\u201d</p> <p>Oz (with a nod to the Wizard) was a late 60s counterculture magazine with specific issues directed to arguing for the rights of oppressed groups \u2013 women, black people, gay people and schoolchildren. It was the last of these that gave Scotland Yard the opportunity to pounce, when bright teenagers were given the chance to edit a Schoolkids Oz. They railed against paedophile teachers and mischievously depicted Rupert Bear with a truly bear-sized erection.</p> <p>Neville was arraigned at the Old Bailey on a charge of \u201cconspiracy to produce a magazine with intent thereby to debauch and corrupt the morals of young persons within the realm\u201d. It carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYfeiKAL5Ds\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pYfeiKAL5Ds?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>John Peel (Nigel Planer) and Richard Neville (Hugh Grant) in Geoffrey Robertson\u2019s BBC drama The Trials of Oz, 1991</figcaption> </figure>   <p>After a trial lasting six weeks and testimony to the public benefit of Oz from experts including the psychiatrist <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-hans-eysenck-1238119.html\">Hans Eysenck</a>, the creative thinker Edward de Bono, the jurisprudence professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/feb/14/ronald-dworkin\">Ronald Dworkin</a> and the comedian <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/04/obituaries/marty-feldman-film-comic-victim-of-heart-attack-at-48.html\">Marty Feldman</a>, the jury acquitted on the conspiracy charge.

Violence shocked and actually frightened him. The revolution he sought was in the mind and he was always willing to change his, if the evidence demanded. (He discarded his youthful belief that soft drugs were conducive to peace when he researched the killings of Vietnamese civilians by GIs high on cannabis.) He was a provocateur, an adventurer and a journalist.</p> <p>Those who knew him will never forget his delight in new ideas, his ability to enthuse his friends to think about future prospects and perils of a technological and interconnected society, and his endless curiosity about what lay beneath the emperor\u2019s newest clothes.</p> <p>Neville tired of London but not of life, which he rediscovered with Julie Clarke. Their marriage was a joyous ceremony beside a waterfall at Happy Daze, his family property in the Blue Mountains outside Sydney.</p> <p>His books remain essential reading for those interested in decoding the 60s, from Playpower (a mischievous sub-Marcusean manifesto) to Hippie Hippie Shake, a slightly rueful, but very funny, look back in languor. Those of us privileged to have played against power alongside him will remember the warmest and most generous of friends, a man with a deep moral vision and, when it came to the crunch, the courage of his convictions.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Clive Neville, editor, writer and broadcaster, born 15 December 1941; died 4 September 2016</p>",
  "<p>Mel Gibson has stated the faith-oriented basis of his new film Hacksaw Ridge by explicitly comparing the Christian-inspired bravery of conscientious objector Desmond Doss with the kind of comic-book characters previously played by his lead actor Andrew Garfield. Speaking to journalists at the Venice film film as Hacksaw Ridge received its world premiere, Gibson said: \u201cDesmond attributed his actions to a power greater than himself, and the difference between a real superhero and a comic-book superhero is that real superheroes didn\u2019t wear any Spandex.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/04/hacksaw-ridge-review-mel-gibson-finds-a-conscience-in-gruesome-war-story\">Hacksaw Ridge review \u2013 Mel Gibson finds a conscience in gruesome war story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hacksaw Ridge is Gibson\u2019s first film as director in a decade, since 2006\u2019s Apocalypto, and it is a sometimes gruesome study of Doss\u2019 time in the military during the second world war, when he became the first conscientious objector to be <a href=\"http://www.cmohs.org/recipient-detail/2717/doss-desmond-t.php\">awarded the Medal of Honor</a>, in recognition of his bravery as a combat medic during the battle of Okinawa. Doss, who died in 2006, was a Seventh Day Adventist and refused to carry a gun, but served as a company aid man in 1st Battalion, 307th Infantry in the bloody assault on the island.</p> <p>Gibson reiterated his interest in Doss\u2019 religious commitment: \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable what the essence of Doss was: he was a man of great courage and strong conviction, and strong faith; to go into a battle zone like that \u2013 which the Japanese called it \u2018steel rain\u2019, with the artillery and lead flying around \u2013 to go into that armed with only your faith, your faith has to be strong in you.

He said: \u201cThe man who refuses to touch a weapon, and do something much higher than something as venal as killing in a war; it\u2019s a very high calling ... You have to love the warrior, and give him homage and honour him. I hope this film does that.\u201d</p> <p>On a more technical note, Gibson was asked about the extended battle scenes, which show the repeated attempts by US army units to take Okinawa, with enormous casualties incurred on both sides. In several of his films, including Braveheart and Apocalypto, Gibson has displayed a particular proficiency in filming combat, and said: \u201cThe important thing about depicting battle on screen, is to be clear with it, and not confusing. You give the impression of chaos, but be absolutely clear what it is you want the audience to see and extract from the sequences. It\u2019s all about screen direction and knowing who the players are; you have to approach it almost as a sporting event. It sounds mercenary to say that about battle; but if you are not able to follow the strategies, somehow [the audience] become less involved.\u201d</p> <p>The Venice film festival continues until 10 September. <br></p>",

Distributed free with the newspaper every Wednesday, and infused with many ideas similar to those that had boosted Nova\u2019s fortunes, it failed to attract sufficient advertising and was closed, prematurely many thought, within a year. Hackett, not dissimilar in drive and personality to the mercurial Cudlipp, paid the price of its failure and departed.</p> <p>Son of Sarah (nee Bedford) and James, a postman, he was born in Sheffield and educated there at De La Salle college. Hackett started his journalistic career at the <a href=\"http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/\">Sheffield Telegraph</a> before national service in the Royal Navy. Having rejoined the paper on demobilisation, he moved to the Daily Herald in 1954, before embarking on an series of eclectic job-hops that led to him working for Illustrated magazine, where he became deputy editor; the Daily Express, writing caption-story material for the groundbreaking Photonews; the Daily Mail and the Observer, where he was art editor (1961-62).</p> <p>At Queen he was able to withstand the eccentricity of his proprietor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/14/sir-jocelyn-stevens\">Jocelyn Stevens</a> (whose management style, he remembered dispassionately, included a hectoring manner and the tendency to throw typewriters through windows), to become editor and tap into the zeitgeist of the 1960s. There, and at Nova, Hackett assembled a network of talent that included the sportswriter and screenwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/nov/26/football.guardianobituaries\">Arthur Hopcraft</a>, painter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/04/molly-parkin-artist\">Molly Parkin</a> (as fashion editor), flamboyant astrologer <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-patric-walker-1576878.html\">Patric Walker</a> and the American writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/02/irma-kurtz-my-life-in-agony-review-katharine-whitehorn\">Irma Kurtz</a>, who became an agony aunt.</p> <p>At the ill-fated Mirror magazine he supervised a largely young staff.

If they are mobilized as a bloc to vote against Trump for these reasons, 2016 could mark the national debut of Missouri\u2019s \u201cBosnian vote\u201d, costing Trump the state\u2019s 10 electoral votes.</p> <p>\u201cI know for a fact that a lot of people have gone out and registered to vote,\u201d said Nedim Ramic, a Bosnian American attorney in St Louis who has twice met with Clinton during campaign stops in the city. \u201cI think that the Bosnian community could really make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Since religion and ethnic background are not recorded as part of the voter registration process, there is no record of how many Bosnian American voters are actually registered in St Louis. Anecdotally, community leaders estimate that voter registration in St Louis\u2019s Bosnian community has surged by the thousands over the past two years.</p> <p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m expecting to see a higher turnout than before,\u201d said insurance agent Ibro Tucakovic, who came to St Louis from Sarajevo in 1998 and, in 2015, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/04/28/the-unlikely-community-that-drew-inspiration-from-the-ferguson-protests/?utm_term=.469956a3f58a\">became the first Bosnian American</a> to run for elected office in Missouri. \u201cThis election is really, really important, but especially for Bosnian Americans because we have seen what hate speech can do in a country. Some of the older ones are scared, because this is a similar thing going on back in Bosnia in the 1990s before the election.\u201d</p> <p>St Louis is home to one of the largest populations of Bosnian Muslims in the world outside Bosnia-Herzegovina itself. The community has its origins in the Balkan refugee crisis in the 1990s, when Yugoslavia was ripped apart at its seams, displacing millions. Bosnian refugees were resettled in St Louis by the thousands, and eventually the city became the anchor of the United States\u2019 Bosnian diaspora.</p> <p>Historically, Missouri has been a swing state, though is often assumed by pundits to be a Republican giveaway. In 2008, Republican John McCain won the state\u2019s electoral votes by a margin of less than 1% \u2013 mere thousands of votes. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney won the state by 10%, but liberal Democrat Claire McCaskill also kept her seat in the US Senate by more than 15%. The state also has a Democrat governor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I came here just like those Syrian refugees are coming here.

  "<p>British courts should be able to issue Islamic divorces via a specialised unit set up to protect the rights of Muslim women, a leading expert in sharia law will advise a House of Commons inquiry.</p> <p>In recommendations to the home affairs select committee, Elham Manea, associate professor in Middle East studies at Zurich University, will also argue for mandatory civil marriages alongside religious ceremonies, and say imams who violate the rules should be given harsh sanctions.</p> <p>Manea, who spent four years researching the UK\u2019s sharia councils and recently published a book on her findings, says the measures would render \u201cinherently discriminatory\u201d sharia councils redundant because they are mainly used by women seeking an Islamic divorce. </p> <p>Under sharia law, men can divorce their wives unilaterally by pronouncing <em tabindex=\"-1\">talaq</em> (divorce) three times, but women must get a judicial decree on specific grounds or give up financial rights to obtain a divorce from a religious judge, a process that costs up to \u00a3400. </p> <p>The thinktank Civitas estimates there are 85 sharia councils in Britain, from organised groups attached to mosques to more informal setups including \u201can imam in the living room\u201d. The councils have no legal oversight or powers of enforcement but for those who use them their decisions are culturally and religiously binding.</p> <p>In written evidence to the Commons inquiry, Manea says the vast majority of women attending sharia councils have not formalised their religious marriage under British law and are often forced into conceding their civil rights in order to secure an Islamic divorce. </p> <p>Others complain of being coerced into mediation and reconciliation even if they have suffered abuse at the hands of their husband. </p> <p>Amra Bone is the UK\u2019s first female sharia judge and sits on a panel at the Birmingham central mosque. Last week, she told BBC Radio 4 that sharia councils were \u201ca necessity for people who do not have a recourse to civil courts because their marriages are not recognised\u201d and that vulnerable women would be left \u201cin limbo\u201d without them.</p> <p>But Manea, along with a number of women\u2019s rights groups, insists the councils should be abolished if Muslim women are to stand any chance of equality. She told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s true women will be stuck if you don\u2019t provide a solution but that solution is not a parallel legal system.</p> <p>\u201cInterpretation in many Islamic countries including Tunisia and Morocco means a religious divorce automatically follows a civil one. It should be the same in Britain and a bureau within the courts should provide this service.\u201d</p> <p>She is calling for a national campaign to register all Islamic marriages, a move she says will reveal many polygamous unions. Manea, who is Muslim and a women\u2019s rights campaigner, is concerned about the way in which polygamy is being mainstreamed in the UK.</p> <p>Evidence to the inquiry claims the ideology behind many of Britain\u2019s sharia councils condones wife beating, marital rape and child marriage. Nus Ghani, who sits on the home affairs select committee and initially pushed for the inquiry, said: \u201cUnder sharia, men are in charge and women are treated as their property. That does not sit well under British law and cannot go unchallenged.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have a system where we are championing equality for women on one hand and but on the other overlooking a whole section of society \u2013 vulnerable women who happen to be Muslim.\u201d</p> <p>Ghani, the Tory MP for Wealdon, said she would support a campaign to register all Islamic marriages. \u201cWe need to make sure any imam that oversees a <em tabindex=\"-1\">nikah</em> should also register that marriage,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt may be we have a nationwide survey to make sure everyone who has an Islamic marriage is told to register under civil law so if they need a civil divorce they will also get the <em tabindex=\"-1\">talaq</em>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/27/mps-launch-inquiry-sharia-law-courts-uk\">MPs launch inquiry into sharia courts in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Muslim Law (Sharia) Council UK in Wembley says it has always encouraged the civil registration of Islamic marriages in the UK. Its executive secretary, Moulana Raza, said: \u201cWe strongly believe this is the only way of securing financial and legal rights of married Muslim women in the UK. We would welcome any action in this respect by the government.\u201d</p> <p>He explained: \u201cCouncils are thriving because there is no other authentic and credible mechanism for Muslim women to obtain an Islamic divorce. If the government offered an alternative, 90% of the work of sharia councils would end.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the sharia councils are an additional burden on the shoulders of the Muslim community. In our opinion there are some councils which are geographically located in the UK but, ideologically, they are not in Britain.\u201d</p> <p>It will examine how they operate, the extent to which they discriminate against women, how they are funded and their relationship with the British legal system. </p> <p>A number of women\u2019s rights groups and campaigners have boycotted a separate inquiry into Britain\u2019s sharia councils that was set up by Theresa May when she was home secretary.

  "<p>I grew up in a Kolkata flat across the road from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2016/sep/04/hundreds-of-thousands-gather-to-witness-mother-teresa-declared-saint-video\">Mother Teresa\u2019s</a> convent. This was in the 1960s, before she was famous. I was one of many Catholic children who volunteered at <a href=\"http://www.motherteresa.org/07_family/volunteering/v_cal.html\">Shishu Bhavan</a>, her orphanage for abandoned children, feeding and bathing babies during the school holidays. It upset everyone greatly that the nuns were forbidden even a chilled juice on a sweltering summer\u2019s day. Absolutely nothing happened without Mother Teresa\u2019s permission. Young sisters walked miles in the scorching sun, often barefoot, on burning hot pavements, because Mother Teresa decreed it had to be done. A precocious 12-year-old, I hated this unfair, petty autocrat.</p> <p>Indian children were taught to respect their elders and revere the religious. In my teens, however, I met Marxist teachers who forced us to think critically about society and religion. So by the time I reached university I was in iconoclastic mode. I shunned the hypocrisy of many \u201cpillars\u201d of the church. Mother Teresa definitely helped the poor but her sisters were allowed to write home only twice a year, their personal letters scrutinised, sometimes by Mother Teresa herself. What a control freak, I raged.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At 19, filled with youthful arrogance and self-righteous indignation, I questioned Mother Teresa's ethics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mother Teresa didn\u2019t deserve <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html\">Christopher Hitchen\u2019s unadulterated, poisonous vitriol</a>.

But she could. She did. And the world lapped it up. She once comforted a sufferer, with the line: \u201cYou are suffering, that means Jesus is kissing you.\u201d The infuriated man screamed, \u201cThen tell your Jesus to stop kissing me.\u201d As a Christian in a Hindu majority country, such Teresa-isms often left me squirming with embarrassment.</p> <p>At 19, filled with youthful arrogance and self-righteous indignation, I questioned how she could ethically take money from the world\u2019s most obnoxious dictators.

Oh, you mean I\u2019d been abused?\u2019 And I thought it was sex.\u201d It was the first of several turning points: meeting her husband, <a href=\" http://gb.imdb.com/name/nm0662530/\" title=\"\">film-maker Ol Parker</a>, whom she married at 25; seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/31/saturday-interview-eve-ensler-vagina-monologues\" title=\"\">Eve Ensler\u2019s The Vagina Monologues</a>; motherhood; and activism (she is on the board of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/blog/2013/feb/14/what-is-one-billion-rising-founder-eve-ensler-explains\" title=\"\">Ensler\u2019s V-Day campaign</a>).</p> <p>However, I suspect the timeline is wonkier than those milestones suggest. Ten years ago, Newton was <a href=\" http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/film/article233628.ece\" title=\"\">still maintaining in interviews that she had never experienced racism in Britain</a>. It was only after discussing Cornwall with her mother that she realised her parents had tried to soak up the racism around her, and she had believed, or colluded in, the pretence that it wasn\u2019t happening. So now there was the additional shame of having failed to confront or claim that experience. The film industry compounded all that childhood alienation with another kind of silencing: a publicist tried to stop Newton talking about the abuse. To have experienced it, to have confided, and then be urged to secrecy seems doubly cruel. She couldn\u2019t win.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I can win!\u201d she shoots back angrily, voice rising above the clatter in Ostuni, a local restaurant for her in north-west London. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. I am so grateful for all that: \u2018Zip it, Thandie! Zip it! Zip it!\u2019 Because it made me more angry, made me want to talk more.\u201d</p> <p>Has she considered taking legal action against Mr Hideous? Or the director, now in his 80s, who played her audition video at parties?</p> <p>\u201cI could take him to court, darling, if I wanted to. And you know, maybe that will happen. But he\u2019s one person. I\u2019m out for the whole fucking industry. I go for big. I\u2019m not small. I\u2019m vast.\u201d</p> <p>How will she get them?</p> <p>\u201cBy speaking it.\u201d</p> <p>It baffles her why no one spoke for her: why the female casting director who witnessed the camera-between-the-legs incident didn\u2019t intercede, why friends disapproved of Mr Hideous only afterwards. \u201cYou have to say it,\u201d she says. She mentions Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s <a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/03/sinead-o-connor-open-letter-miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">\u201cbeautiful\u201d open letter to Miley Cyrus</a>, which Newton has kept and intends to frame: \u201cI must remember to do that.\u201d (She loves O\u2019Connor, \u201ceven though I pretty much know if we sat together for two minutes she\u2019d be calling me a cunt\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hollywood's another organisation that is concealing an industry of sexual abuse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She routinely calls out abuse. \u201cDarling! I do it all the time!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAnd sometimes it pisses people off and they disinvite me from their lives. But I would rather lose friends for that one seed of doubt that might be in their minds.\u201d She has lost work, too. \u201cI do understand why actors\u2019 reputations start to follow them round as being difficult,\u201d she says. The offer of Westworld took her by surprise, \u201cbecause I kind of gave up on being given gifts from the industry. I just thought I was going to have to be a rebel, fighting for ever.\u201d</p> <p>But she sees no sign of improvement in Hollywood\u2019s approach to sexual abuse. \u201cThe number of people who want to distance themselves from me because of how much I\u2019m willing to say is an example of how much it\u2019s occurring.\u201d She mentions <a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/28/spotlight-review-catholic-church-called-to-account-over-child-abuse\" title=\"\">the film Spotlight</a>, about paedophilia in Boston\u2019s Catholic church. As with the movie business, it\u2019s \u201canother organisation that is concealing an industry of sexual abuse, where there\u2019s more infrastructure to cover up than there is to protect\u201d. Her own experience has taught her that \u201cit was part of the grooming \u2013 to be made to feel that this is all part of what it means to be in showbusiness, the kind of thing you have to tolerate in this industry\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b8674528cadab99aba504976b2dd6622de0df8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b8674528cadab99aba504976b2dd6622de0df8/0_0_2256_3000/752.jpg\" alt=\"Newton with her husband Ol Parker and daughters Ripley and Nico Parker, 2016.\" width=\"752\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newton with her husband Ol Parker and daughters Ripley and Nico Parker, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reviewers and interviewers often describe Newton as \u201crefined\u201d or \u201cdelicate\u201d. In her customary pose for photographs, her lips balance on the edge of a smile. Dimples suggest a reserved and private mirth. But her mouth is always shut. This seems inappropriate, given the way she talks. Her sentences run at speed, often rerouting halfway through, salted with profanities and pleasantries to the waiter, and winding up with \u201cand that\u2019s why \u2026\u201d Each pause is a leap.</p> <p>She jumps from her experience to rape victims in Congo. The <a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/30/sayhername-why-kimberle-crenshaw-is-fighting-for-forgotten-women\" title=\"\">activist Kimberle Crenshaw</a> is a \u201cdear friend\u201d and Newton liberally uses her term \u201cintersectionality\u201d to dredge the overlapping interests of conflict mining, mobile phone companies, gang rape and patriarchy. \u201cRape of women, rape of the environment \u2026 it\u2019s the destruction of the female. And the endgame is suicide. It\u2019s species suicide!\u201d That she considers her own body implicated in this tangle becomes clear when she says that she breastfed partly to prevent multinationals such as Nestl\u00e9 from extending their grip on the developing world. She can be hard to follow because she deploys the words that usually join thoughts to introduce new ones. Each time she says \u201cbecause\u201d, I want to grip my seat. Her thoughts go so fast.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re mine, and they happen all the time.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m wondering which is her natural state \u2013 the placid composure of photographs, or the frantic, gesticulating, conscientious producer of this verbal torrent. \u201cOh, oh well,\u201d she says. \u201cMy natural state is the waaaah, all over the place. Because there is so much to think about.\u201d</p> <p>In passing she mentions that she recently had endometriosis. \u201cAnd I really do think it was [down to] fury.\u201d</p> <p>Was she furious then? She looks surprised. \u201cI\u2019m always angry. I wake up angry. There is a lot to be angry about. Anger,\u201d she says calmly, \u201cis a positive energy.\u201d</p> <p>Another flashpoint is the dearth of black faces on the cover of Vogue. She has never been asked, even after winning a Bafta for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/aug/12/1\" title=\"\">Crash</a> in 2006, although Vogue\u2019s editor, Alexandra Shulman, is a fellow anthropologist who lives down the road. \u201cI like her a lot. We hang out. She uses my gardener. I nick rosemary from her garden.\u201d Newton kept asking herself what she was doing wrong. \u201cOK, so why have I not got the cover? And I resisted race. Because I don\u2019t even use the term \u2018race\u2019. I resisted it, I resisted it, I resisted it \u2026 And then I had to accept it.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t ask Shulman outright: \u201cToo gauche.\u201d Instead she devised a plan to get sponsorship for a documentary about a Thandie Newton Vogue cover, in which the sponsorship covered any losses that arose from featuring a black face. \u201cThen I was like, wow, that\u2019s a lot of work. That\u2019s a lot of fucking work. And then I realised \u2026 I don\u2019t care any more.\u201d</p> <p>About being on the cover? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d I say, to cheer her up; she still sounds a bit sad.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I care!\u201d she cries. \u201cBecause I was a little girl a long time ago, and that little girl knew Vogue was everything. It\u2019s about ideas. Vogue is the ultimate. The ultimate. And I want little girls to see that. My little girls had seen me receiving a Bafta. And not just my little girls \u2013 every other little girl with brown skin had seen that. Oh my God! I know how much it matters because I remember being that little girl.\u201d The next time she speaks, her voice is small and wistful and distant. \u201cI remember,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eed45fa4a4f6e10d408aa9b8e449e3188e9fcf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eed45fa4a4f6e10d408aa9b8e449e3188e9fcf1/0_175_2001_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Newton with her Bafta for Crash, 2006.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newton with her Bafta for Crash, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newton has been married to Parker, a scriptwriter and director, for 18 years. Presumably, he\u2019s pretty calm. \u201cSoooo calm,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we laugh, because I take the piss out of him. You know: shoulder-shrugging: \u2018It\u2019s OK, babe.\u2019 And he takes the piss out of my \u2026 What would you describe it as? Highly emotional. As I\u2019m thinking, the words will come. I don\u2019t stop and think.\u201d Her voice deepens and she says, mock-grandly: \u201cNever been my way! That\u2019s what it\u2019s like in our house. A lot of music as well.\u201d</p> <p>Along with Booker, now two, she and Parker have daughters Nico, 11, and Ripley, who last week turned 16, the age Newton\u2019s at times traumatic relationship with the film industry began. \u201cOf course. Any 16-year-old, I look at and think: \u2018My God, my God.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere she goes again!\u201d she blurts \u2013 that\u2019s how her daughters tease her. But to prepare them, and to protect them, Newton pointedly names abuse. \u201cIt freaks my husband out, bless him! He\u2019ll look at me like: \u2018You\u2019re really talking about this?\u2019\u201d But it\u2019s a compulsion, a commitment, and a chance, perhaps, to parent the child she was, as well as the ones she has. \u201cTo go through shame and feel self-love afterwards, there\u2019s nothing like it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then to pour that into your beautiful girls ... When I look at my girls \u2013 who they are \u2013 partly as a result of what I\u2019ve told them ... \u201d</p> <p>They go to a progressive school. \u201cNo uniform, you use the teachers\u2019 first names, so you don\u2019t create this fear and mindless ... what\u2019s the word?\u201d Deference? \u201cTo authority. We\u2019re big on \u2018No\u2019. [The teachers] have to earn your respect. In the same way that me as a parent, I have to earn your respect, every day you wake up on this planet.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m imagining the impact of this approach to childcare in my own home. Don\u2019t they give her huge amounts of grief? \u201cYeah, they do. But I love it. When they give me shit, that\u2019s their power. I\u2019m like: \u2018Give it to me! Give it to me!\u2019 It really annoys them. When they get fucked off with me, I just smile, I go glazed. Because I\u2019m thinking: \u2018You\u2019re awesome, and this is precisely what you\u2019re going to need in life. Give it to me!\u2019 Because if you don\u2019t let them do it to you, they question their power.\u201d</p> <p>Ripley likes sculpting with modelling clay \u2013 \u201chundreds of tiny figures\u201d. Nico dances. What would Newton do if either met a much older man, as she did in her teens, and called him boyfriend? \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d she says quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d There is a silence. \u201cHow we have influenced the kids is across everything, you know, from questioning authority to where did that palm oil come from in that chocolate?

Even a cursory glance over his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/derekblasberg/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> feed shows him snuggly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and cuddly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/mar/23/matt-lever-behind-the-runway-fashion-shows-karlie-kloss-cara-delevingne\">Karlie Kloss</a>, cosy with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/09/jessica-chastain-myth-women-dont-get-along-jennifer-lawrence-fight\">Jessica Chastain</a> and matey with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung\">Alexa Chung</a>, sandwiched between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dolce-and-gabbana\">Dolce and Gabbana</a> and touchy-feely with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/picture/2014/jan/22/keira-knightley-proenza-schouler-jack-ryan-premiere\">Proenza Schouler</a>, moody with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a> and all smiles with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/nov/05/pressandpublishing.popandrock\">David Geffen</a>, at the theatre with <em>Girls</em>\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/30/-sp-allison-williams-girls-nbc-peter-pan\">Allison Williams</a> and at the Met Ball with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/katy-perry\">Katy Perry</a>, lip-synching to Prince. For a \u201cnobody\u201d, he sure knows a lot of somebodys.</p> <p>Blasberg studied dramatic literature at university and seems to have a liking for Tennessee Williams; and it\u2019s lines from <em>The Glass Menagerie</em> that spring to mind when I watch him in action. Whether he\u2019s in the plush apartment of Carine Roitfeld, or at the aforementioned party at Santo Domingo\u2019s Paris mansion, at which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/naomi-campbell\">Naomi Campbell </a>will turn up, Blasberg seems to \u201cmove in a continual spotlight\u201d. Always running or bounding, never just walking. Always seeming to be at the point of defeating gravity.</p> <p>And given what Blasberg\u2019s achieved, I wouldn\u2019t bet on gravity to win that bout. So what, you might not unreasonably ask, has he achieved?</p> <p>It\u2019s true that journalism \u2013 especially Blasberg\u2019s fashiony, styley, arty stuff\u2013 isn\u2019t exactly akin to splitting the atom. Nor has his journey from Missouri to glossy New York and beyond been like climbing Everest backwards and blindfolded. And yet, Blasberg\u2019s ascent is to be admired, because, partly, it\u2019s the American Dream: a smalltown boy with big ambitions goes to the even bigger city where he makes those ambitions a reality \u2013 a job at <em>Vanity Fair</em>! A job at the <a href=\"http://www.gagosian.com/\">Gagosian Gallery</a>! A job on CNN! \u2013 through hard work, charm and an extraordinary gift for networking. Blasberg has managed to turn what essentially could have been an endless, vacuous and soul-destroying whirl of cocktail parties, magazine launches and exhibition openings into the foundation for a powerbase.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His greatest skill remains his social climbing. And many people are very envious</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Blasberg has power, influence, connections. They may, for now, be largely confined to the fashion industry and its associated social bubbles but when that industry is estimated to be worth $3 trillion annually, power in that sphere translates into money. Blasberg is the living embodiment of the old adage that it\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know. He says he doesn\u2019t have a work-life endgame but I\u2019m not sure I believe him. He\u2019s been playing pretty good game up until now.</p> <p>When I asked Ellana Lee, senior vice president and managing editor at CNN International, why she chose Blasberg to front the resurrected <em>CNN Style</em>, she said, \u201cWe wanted to find a host who could connect with our audiences in different ways, and Derek offers that \u2013 knowledge of the industry, huge charisma, and an impressive, sizeable social media presence.\u201d Which, when you boil it down, means: a fusty \u201cold media\u201d brand like CNN needs someone modern and connected. Lee\u2019s calculation certainly paid off: it was Blasberg who landed them a <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/fashion/2016/05/13/exp-cnn-style-naomi-campbell-vogue.cnn\">Naomi Campbell interview</a>, Blasberg who landed them <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/fashion/2016/07/12/carine-roitfeld-french-style.cnn\">Roitfeld</a>, and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/fashion/2016/07/08/karl-lagerfeld-chanel-haute-couture-style-tv.cnn\">Karl Lagerfeld</a>, who, Blasberg tells me, will only use fax to organise anything. \u201cDo you know how difficult it is to find a fax machine in Switzerland?\u201d he faux-grimaces. \u201cEmail, Karl! Email!\u201d</p> <p>So how does a boy from Missouri \u2013 who spent his Halloweens dressed, variously, as Tutankhamun, a vampire and the first George Bush \u2013 transform himself into the fashion world\u2019s BFF, dressed today in a double-breasted Vuitton suit, Berlutti shoes and a Gucci belt? Because, put simply, Blasberg is something of a phenomenon. A digital Capote, a Gatsby of the Instagram age.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:37.5% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BCkW5v7jnHo/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">The King and I @karllagerfeld \ud83d\ude0e</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Derek Blasberg (@derekblasberg) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-03-05T10:31:49+00:00\">Mar 5, 2016 at 2:31am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I was growing up I wasn\u2019t aware of fashion as an industry,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no <em>America\u2019s Next Top Model</em>, no <em>Project Runway</em>. You didn\u2019t know what a stylist was or what an art director was. There was a photographer and a model and everything else was a mystery.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, it was through his interests in photography and in art that Blasberg alighted on fashion as the sphere in which to carve a career. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I decorated all four walls of my room, and eventually my ceiling, with collages I had made of pictures I liked: of the Kennedys, of Marilyn Monroe, of Kate Moss\u2026 I also liked Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. I liked old-school glamour at a young age. Have you heard of The Secret? That you visualise stuff until it happens? I never did The Secret but that\u2019s sorta what I was doing, I guess. I wanted to be where the action was.\u201d</p> <p>And the action was in New York, where Blasberg\u2019s ascent began in earnest. After graduating from university where, by all accounts, he was popular and where his skill as a \u201cpeople person\u201d was honed, he landed a job as an assistant at American <em>Vogue</em>. \u201cI was a pretty terrible assistant,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was there about a year. I wasn\u2019t very organised. Ten per cent was writing but 90% was updating contracts, Excel spreadsheets and taking meticulous notes.

She\u2019s an animal\u201d \u2013 Blasberg got organised and threw himself into work, toiling for the likes of <em>Harper\u2019s Bazaar</em>, <em>Interview</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. Along the way, he fattened up his contacts book in the way that a farmer might stuff a goose for the production of foie gras. But he has had a sideline that\u2019s aided his progress. He\u2019s made himself useful as a walker, the latest in a tradition popularised in the 1980s by Nancy Reagan among others, whereby a single, usually gay man would chaperone unaccompanied women to events. Blasberg\u2019s choices of companion \u2013 Roman Abramovich\u2019s wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dasha-zhukova\">Dasha Zhukova</a>, for example \u2013 show impeccable taste and judgment. And his role \u2013 \u201ca flirt but never a threat\u201d (as Stephen Sondheim calls Bobby in <em>Company</em>) \u2013 has served him well in cementing his position as the must-have accessory, making it difficult to find anyone with anything bad to say about Blasberg.</p> <p>Difficult, but not impossible. \u201cDerek\u2019s greatest achievement remains his social climbing \u2013 and that he\u2019s been so extraordinarily good at it means that many in the fashion industry are very envious of his \u2018achievement\u2019,\u201d said one person I spoke to. They asked not to be named, lest the froideur of Blasberg be directed towards them. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen,\u201d said this fashion insider, \u201cand it ain\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true what they say: fashion is a bitchy business, and while its denizens don\u2019t eat much, they gorge on sour grapes. But where many fresh-faced wannabes from flyover states find themselves chewed up and spat out, Blasberg has thrived. Why? It comes down to two key things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e16aff1c0728498b8598b0edaa4e71184612b1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e16aff1c0728498b8598b0edaa4e71184612b1b/336_124_1395_1811/770.jpg\" alt=\"Vera Wang and Derek Blasberg, arm in arm, posing for the camera\" width=\"770\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man of the moment: with Vera Wang in Miami Beach, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Dom Perignon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, Blasberg is charismatic. You may have someone like Blasberg in your life. Someone who makes you feel like you\u2019re the only person in the room. A bit taller, more interesting, wittier. I can confirm this first-hand: Blasberg\u2019s attention is blissful, moreish and almost disarming.</p> <p>Second, Blasberg is, or at least does a damned good job of appearing to be, happy \u2013 or, perhaps, confident. There is not a hint of a secret sadness or insecurity about him. Or as he puts it breezily, \u201cI\u2019m not damaged, sorry!\u201d And he\u2019s not damaged, I imagine, because of his upbringing. As he explains, \u201cBecause my parents provided me with a traditional and solid foundation, I like to think that I\u2019m fairly well-equipped for the follies, fabulousness and frivolities of an industry like this. Some of the most successful people are hard-working and smart and good to be around.\u201d</p> <p>And here\u2019s the nub of Blasberg\u2019s appeal within an industry populated by brittle, neurotic, unhappy and damaged-to-the-point-of-deranged people. Like Santa at an orphanage, he comes bearing the most precious gifts of all: acceptance and the (brief) respite from the wretched feeling of being less-than, a feeling on which the fashion industry was founded and a feeling that it fuels in others in order to make its billions. As Amanda Wingfield says in <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, \u201cHe smiled \u2013 the world was enchanted!\u201d And so it is.</p> <p>So does Blasberg feel important? \u201cEr, no,\u201d he bristles. \u201cWhat douchebag would say they did? No. I feel more so than ever that I am part of this industry but the shows are still going to happen if I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p> <p>Does he feel popular then? \u201cThere\u2019s is a difference between popular and important, isn\u2019t there? I don\u2019t think everyone who\u2019s popular is important. I will not say I\u2019m popular nor will I say I\u2019m important \u2013 because that\u2019s a really assholey thing to say. You can feel free to say it though\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Given his otherwise breezy demeanour, Blasberg\u2019s guardedness can turn the atmosphere a little chilly. When he doesn\u2019t like a question, he either answers a different question or pirouettes to avoid it. For example, when I ask him what it\u2019s like being an American abroad at the moment \u2013 the moment being defined by the rise and rise of Trump \u2013 his defences go up and I get a glimpse of the colder side of this erstwhile Mr Sunshine. \u201cIt\u2019s better than being a Brit abroad, with your Brexit,\u201d he retorts. \u201cIt\u2019s neither here nor there. It\u2019s fine.\u201d But then, to be fair, he\u2019s thoughtful. \u201cAmerica is having an interesting time. New York is staunchly and fiercely Democrat, and so is LA and when you get to the middle\u2026 When I go home [to Missouri], there are Trump signs in the neighbourhood.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aef2c096f42de18c16f6c747c22906be74669420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aef2c096f42de18c16f6c747c22906be74669420/271_42_2923_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ladies\u2019 man: in Brooklyn, New York, with Lauren Santo Domingo, Harley Viera-Newton, Sienna Miller, Alexa Chung, Jos\u00e9phine de la Baume and Poppy Delevingne. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ladies\u2019 man: in Brooklyn, New York, with Lauren Santo Domingo, Harley Viera-Newton, Sienna Miller, Alexa Chung, Jos\u00e9phine de la Baume and Poppy Delevingne. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pham/bfa.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And how does that make him feel? \u201cNot particularly excited,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m with her [meaning Hillary]. I\u2019m with anyone but him.\u201d</p> <p>But back to Blasberg himself. Given his Instagram following \u2013 which rises almost 30,000 in the month that I\u2019m in his orbit \u2013 does he accept that he has clout? \u201cFive hundred thousand is a nice number but it\u2019s not big numbers. You follow <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/selenagomez/?hl=en\">Selena Gomez</a>? She\u2019s got 96 million.\u201d</p> <p>When I point out that comparing himself to Selena Gomez is ridiculous, he becomes suddenly serious: \u201cI\u2019m 34 years old. I\u2019ve worked hard to get clout, be that in social media or in the industry or with the people I work with. You\u2019re taking for granted that popularity is on the tip of my brain when I\u2019m working and it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>So what is? \u201cIf I get a lot of Instagram Likes, that makes me feel good that I\u2019ve been informing and amusing. Probably more the latter than the former. But that\u2019s why I do what I do. Likewise, if something doesn\u2019t get a lot of Likes, I feel as if I\u2019ve underinformed or underamused. Life, for better or for worse, is now about the Likes.\u201d</p> <p><em>Derek Blasberg presents </em>CNN Style <em>on CNN International, Sunday 11 September at 1930 BST and Wednesday 14 September at 1730 BST <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/style\">www.cnn.com/style</a></em></p>",

I quickly scroll away from those photos now, but there\u2019s no denying that they stir my cravings, that little itch that just turns into a bigger itch when you scratch it. Then it turns into a spark and the spark turns into a bonfire that no amount of intoxicating substances will smother.</p> <p>That\u2019s what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re an alcoholic and drug addict. There\u2019s no such thing as one drink or one cigarette or one Valium pill.

At first she was surprised to be singled out for her looks given her modest height, but when she started watching the contests on television, she was seized by the pageants\u2019 vision of beauty. \u201cI remember walking up and down the living room and copying their poses,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI always had the image of the ideal woman in my mind, and part of what helped me reach for that was my pageant education and acting like a lady.\u201d</p> <p>Soon she was competing in pageants every year and, with the help of coaches, a careful diet, and a rigorous exercise routine, she could feel herself beginning to resemble the \u201clady\u201d she envisioned. In a few years, she would be winning pageant titles, including Miss Pennsylvania, in 2012, at the age of 26. But it was competing in Trump\u2019s Miss USA pageant the same year in Las Vegas that would alter the course of her young adult life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb292225c862d7f6318b5c0ecbc1510c474c3c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb292225c862d7f6318b5c0ecbc1510c474c3c9/0_74_1973_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheena Monnin competing in the 2012 Miss USA competition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheena Monnin competing in the 2012 Miss USA competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isaac Brekken/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During that competition, according to Monnin, another contestant, Karina Brez of Florida, insisted to several women backstage mid-pageant that she already knew who the top five final contestants would be, and specifically, that she had seen the names of the pre-selected women listed in a notebook at the back of the stage. </p> <p>Though Monnin never saw such a notebook herself, when contestants Brez had predicted were later selected, Monnin came to the conclusion that the pageant was rigged. <br></p> <p>The Trump Organization denied allegations of favoritism and Brez later said what she had seen was a \u201crehearsal list\u201d and that she was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/322220/miss-florida-to-giuliana-rancic-miss-penn-s-been-taking-pageant-rigging-claim-way-too-far\">joking</a>\u201d. Brez did not return the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment.</p> <p>But<strong> </strong>this year, Miss Universe judge Jeff Lee admitted in <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/mr-miss-universe-jeff-lee\">GQ</a> that Trump \u2013 who from 1996 to 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/univision-donald-trump-miss-universe-mexican-immigrants\">owned or co-owned</a> both Miss Universe and Miss USA \u2013 frequently had a say in which women made the final round. According to the story\u2019s author, Burt Helm: \u201cLee will tell you that from 2005 until Donald Trump sold the Miss Universe pageant last year, the billionaire quietly handpicked as many as six semifinalists \u2013 \u2018Trump cards\u2019, they were called.\u201d Helm said that lower-level beauty pageant picks were so often subject to \u201cmassaging\u201d that this was considered an \u201copen secret\u201d among former contestants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-plaza-bankruptcy\">Trump and Atlantic City: the lessons behind the demise of his casino empire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If so, this \u201copen secret\u201d had not been shared with Monnin, and she resigned her Miss Pennsylvania crown in protest. </p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t until she wrote a post on Facebook about the situation that things started getting out of hand.</p> <p>Monnin\u2019s post was strongly worded and to the point. </p> <p>She wrote: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have decided to resign my position as Miss Pennsylvania USA 2012. Effective immediately I have voluntarily, completely, and utterly removed myself from the Miss Universe Organization. In good conscience I can no longer be affiliated in any way with an organization I consider to be fraudulent, lacking in morals, inconsistent, and in many ways trashy. </p> <p>I do not support this system in any way. In my heart I believe in honesty, fair play, a fair opportunity, and high moral integrity, none of which in my opinion are part of this pageant system any longer. </p> <p>Thank you all for your support and understanding as I walk a road I never dreamed I\u2019d need to walk, as I take a stand I never dreamed I\u2019d need to take. After 10 years of competing in a pageant system I once believed in, I now completely and irrevocably separate myself in every way and on every level from the Miss Universe Organization. I remove my support completely and have turned in the title of Miss Pennsylvania USA 2012.</p> </blockquote> <p>(In a separate letter of resignation to the pageant organizers, Monnin also cited the inclusion of transgender women in the contest that year as a reason for her returning her title. She told the Guardian that she had no problem with the inclusion of transgender contestants in pageants generally, but that she was upset that the rules had been changed in 2012 without notice. \u201cThe point I was trying to make \u2013 and I don\u2019t think I made it well \u2013 is that they changed the contract and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\u201d)</p> <p>Monnin\u2019s aim in writing the Facebook post, she told the Guardian, was simply to explain her decision to friends. Back then her page was mostly set to private, she added, and she had just a few hundred Facebook friends.</p> <p>But Trump, having seen the post, did what he often does in the face of petty insults \u2013 he escalated the conflict exponentially. Specifically, he used his platform as a person in the public eye to cast aspersions on Monnin and impugn her reputation on national TV. Speaking on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America the next day, Trump called Monnin\u2019s claims \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d and her character worse.<br></p> <p>\u201cShe suffers from a thing called \u2018loser\u2019s remorse\u2019,\u201d <a href=\"https://gma.yahoo.com/organization-denies-miss-pennsylvania-sheena-monnins-claim-pageant-074006712--abc-news-topstories.html\">he said</a>. \u201cShe lost, and if you looked at her compared to people who were in the top 15, you would understand why she was not in the top 15.\u201d </p> <p>Trump said his organization would be bringing a lawsuit against her, detailing his intentions <a href=\"http://www.today.com/id/47702741/ns/today-today_style/t/trump-were-suing-miss-pennsylvania-over-claims/#.V8ATaZMrKV4\">in a second appearance</a> on NBC\u2019s Today. And when Monnin <a href=\"http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/06/former-miss-pennsylvania-claims-miss-universe-pageant-rigged-today-show/\">appeared on the same show</a> days later to defend herself, Trump sued her for $10m for defamation.</p> <p>Trump has never been one to let an insult go. A decade ago, when a biographer estimated his net worth was much lower than he claimed, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/25/books.usa\">Trump sued</a> the author, a New York Times business reporter, for $5bn. This election cycle, he has made the disproportionate deployment of force a point of pride, maybe even a credo, saying: \u201cAnybody who hits me, we\u2019re going to hit them 10 times harder.\u201d There at least, Trump has been as good as his word \u2013 his sharp tongue typically starts the fights, but it is his lawyers who finish them.</p> <p>In 2012, Monnin was completely blindsided by the lawsuit. \u201cThere was no way I could have afforded to pay that off and frankly, he had to have known that,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s $10m suit. \u201cI was just a normal person.\u201d At 27, she had no legal experience or connections, and had never seen anything approaching that kind of money. She was still paying off her degree from the online university she attended, and making strides to grow a small business.</p> <p>Unlike Trump, she did not come from privilege. Her family had to move every few years for her father\u2019s business, work which took them to Florida, Texas, New York, Kentucky and the Carolinas before she was grown. Sometimes her parents would take in foster kids in the cities where they lived, but they never stayed anywhere long.</p> <p>The three years she spent battling Trump and his lawyers she recalls as the most traumatic period of her life. Family helped keep her feeling grounded and protected, she said, but there were still mornings when she didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. \u201cMy focus was getting through each day and getting through what was going on around me and understanding my options,\u201d she said of that period. \u201cEvery day seemed to bring a new legal document that I didn\u2019t understand, that I had to seek legal counsel on.\u201d</p> <p>As recently as last year, Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen bragged to the Daily Beast about the time he \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/31/trump-lawyer-bragged-i-destroyed-a-beauty-queen-s-life.html\">destroy[ed</a>]\u201d Monnin\u2019s life. Attempting to intimidate a Beast reporter, Cohen said: \u201cDo you want to destroy your life? It\u2019s going to be my privilege to serve it to you on a silver platter like I did that idiot from Pennsylvania in Miss USA.\u201d Monnin rebuffs the notion her life was destroyed, but concedes Trump succeeded in the short term and not just with regard to making her feel small and afraid. \u201cThere was this message being sent out to all the contestants: you better not say anything bad about us. And that\u2019s how the other young ladies felt.\u201d It may have worked: not one of the women whom Monnin said sent supportive messages after Trump attacked her came forward to defend her in public, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/06/13/exclusive-second-miss-usa-contestant-says-overheard-list-top-5-finalists-before.html\">though one did anonymously defend her story to Fox News</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s no secret that Trump is incredibly litigious. A recent <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/\">investigation by USA Today</a> tallied 3,500 lawsuits involving Trump. He gets sued quite a bit, but mostly he does the suing, filing 1,900 suits, including many \u2013 like the one against Monnin \u2013 for defamation. He has sued biographers, journalists, business partners, even an ex-wife and a Native American tribe, but he has threatened to sue even more. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is a former schoolyard bully who was sent away to military school to learn proper behavior,\u201d says biographer Harry Hurt III, author of Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J Trump. \u201cThat schooling obviously failed. Trump has matured, if one can use that term, into a courthouse bully.\u201d</p> <p>Another biographer, Michael D\u2019Antonio, Pulitzer-winning author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Never-Enough-Donald-Pursuit-Success/dp/1250042380\">Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success</a>, chose the same metaphor in describing the difficulty in getting sources \u2013 even people with every reason to hate Trump \u2013 to go on the record speaking against him: \u201cIt\u2019s a strange bullying kind of process. Like how in the schoolyard, a lot of kids will go to the bully\u2019s side of the conflict because they\u2019re afraid of what might happen to them if they\u2019re not in his favor.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s an all too familiar narrative to Monnin. \u201cThat is not a sign of a good leader if that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to treat someone who you don\u2019t like,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Interestingly and tellingly, Trump himself seems on at least one occasion to have conflated the terms \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201cpresidential\u201d. When Fox News\u2019 Greta Van Susteren prompted him to elaborate on what he meant by being more \u201cpresidential\u201d, he began by saying, \u201cIt means maybe not be so aggressive, maybe not get so personal,\u201d but quickly reverted to his favorite formula for leadership: \u201cBut you know what happens? What happens is they hit me and I hit them back harder, and usually in all cases, they do it first. But they hit me and I hit them back harder and they disappear. That\u2019s what we want to lead the country.\u201d</p> <p>Monnin lost large swaths of her late 20s, from 27 on, doing legal battle with Trump, or more accurately, trying ineffectually to navigate the maze of legalese he threw in her way. The lawyer she hired was so inadequately prepared he failed to appear at the arbitration hearing in November 2012 at which the fate of the case with Trump was decided \u2013 nor did he even tell her it was happening. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c135273dab21a8cc25e1e81e6f1cab9a57b82da4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c135273dab21a8cc25e1e81e6f1cab9a57b82da4/0_99_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump, left, and Erin Brady pose onstage after Brady won the 2013 Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump, left, and Erin Brady pose onstage after Brady won the 2013 Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Bottari/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Monnin only realized she had missed the chance to defend herself against the mogul the following month, when she received correspondence from her lawyer notifying her that the arbitration had gone forward without anyone present on her behalf. But by then it was too late for Monnin to mount her case. In December 2012, arbitrator Theodore Katz ordered Monnin pay the Trump organization $5m for defamation.</p> <p>Trump issued a self-congratulatory press release: \u201cWe cannot allow a disgruntled contestant to make false and reckless statements which are damaging to the many people who have devoted their hearts and souls to the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageant systems,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I feel very badly for Sheena, she did the wrong thing. She was really nasty, and we had no choice. It is an expensive lesson for her.\u201d </p> <p>Monnin <a href=\"#ixzz2GY0ySz2V\">resolved to \u201cfight\u201d</a> the ruling,  but she no longer trusted her lawyer to do the job.</p> <p>In January 2013, her father, Philip Monnin, wrote a letter on her behalf to J Paul Oetken, the Manhattan federal judge who\u2019d been asked to sign off on the arbitrator\u2019s ruling, arguing that the hefty fee for damages was not \u201cjust\u201d. But it did little good. In July 2013, Oetken upheld the arbitration decision. \u201cThe court does not take lightly that Monnin is compelled to pay what is a devastating monetary award,\u201d Oetken wrote in his decision. \u201cMoreover, Monnin undeniably is suffering from her poor choice of counsel ... [But] sympathy, or apparent inequity, may play no role in a court\u2019s legal analysis, and here, the law is clear.\u201d </p> <p>In his ruling, the judge even went so far as to acknowledge that her lawyer did not appear to be acting in her best interests. \u201cBlindly, but perhaps understandably, Monnin put her trust in her attorney, believing that he would represent her interests,\u201d Oetken wrote, adding, \u201cUnfortunately, [he] chose to ignore the responsibilities owed to his client, along with the ethical duties governing his profession.\u201d</p> <p>In fall 2013, Monnin hired a new lawyer and filed a suit against her former lawyer for malpractice. The details of the settlement of this suit are protected, but Monnin has said that the upshot meant she never had to pay Trump a dollar out of her own pocket. </p> <p>Now, at the age of 31, Monnin says she is able to see some silver linings in the experience. It\u2019s not the same set of ideals she had in mind as a teenager when she watched the pageant girls deliver their lines \u2013 though she cherishes all she learned in that realm. It\u2019s not even about the satisfaction of having spoken up about her convictions, despite real legal consequences, and pulled through. The experience taught her to empathize and connect with other victims of bullying, and crucially, to help them feel less alone.</p> <p>In June she published a self-help book, Hands on the Wheel: Getting Control of Your Life, which draws on her experience being bullied by Trump to help advise readers in dealing with bullies wherever they may find them. \u201cI cover almost every topic imaginable, because I want people, no matter what their controlling factor looks like, to know there are ways to stand your ground and not stoop down to the bully\u2019s level,\u201d she said. \u201cThe advice I give is it\u2019s not appropriate to cower down and give in to people who are using their strength in such a negative way.\u201d</p> <p>The book aims to transcend the political election cycle in favor of the universal; Monnin only delves into her experience with Trump in the foreword. But as an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton, she is only too happy to help interpret what Trump\u2019s shock-and-awe legal tactics could mean in an Oval Office setting: \u201cIf you have someone who goes after me, a normal person, when all I did was write something on Facebook that he disagreed with, then what would happen if you had a real grievance against him and you started speaking out?\u201d</p>",

Healy recommended a multi-pronged approach: aerial and ground sprays along with removal of the trash cans, bird feeders and other containers where water pools and mosquitos breed.</p> <p>Aerial sprays threaten other pollinators.

  "<p>Chicago is on pace to see as many as 650 or 700 murders this year, more than any year since the early 2000s, and likely more than the total murders in New York and Los Angeles combined. <br></p> <p>Through the end of the day Friday, Chicago had seen 475 murders \u2013 just six less than in all of last year, according to police department statistics. The city has already exceeded last year\u2019s total number of gun-related homicides, with 430. <br></p> <p>As violence rises, an increasing number of shootings and murders are going unsolved. Through 28 August, the police department had only made arrests in 73 of the nearly 2,000 non-fatal shooting incidents so far this year \u2013 or just under 4%, according to a department spokesman. </p> <p>The clearance rate for murders is not much better. Last Sunday, police swiftly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-nykea-aldridge-men-charged\">charged two brothers</a> in the murder of Nykea Aldridge, a 32-year-old mother of four, who was shot to death the Friday before while pushing a stroller on her way to register her kids for school. Her shooting had made national headlines because she was the cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade, who mourned <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DwyaneWade/status/769350076162383872\">her death publicly </a>as \u201cunreal\u201d and \u201canother act of senseless gun violence\u201d.</p> <p>But the quick charges in Aldridge\u2019s case are an exception. Police have only made arrests in about 16% of fatal shootings through 28 August this year, according to a department spokesperson. Through June, the clearance rate for all murders was 22.2%. That\u2019s lower than last year\u2019s rate of 30.4%, and dramatically lower than the national average of 64.5%, according to the most recent available national FBI data. </p> <p>Overall arrests in Chicago also have dropped 27% compared with last year, according to police statistics. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/chicago-guns-child-execution-tyshawn-lee-gang-violence\">Chicago gun epidemic, out of control: the execution of nine-year-old Tyshawn Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Illinois governor Bruce Rauner <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-bruce-rauner-chicago-violence-national-guard-met-20160831-story.html\">said on Wednesday</a> that he did not believe it was appropriate to call in the National Guard, a perennial political talking point in response to violence in Chicago. </p> <p>\u201cNo thoughtful leader thinks that\u2019s a good idea or would really provide a solution.

The blood was from Winters\u2019 face, where he had been shot twice by a man in a ski mask, and his chest, where the third bullet struck.

Independents are also crucial for understanding how Hillary Clinton\u2019s support might be overstated in current polls.</p> <p>Currently, Clinton is the most likely candidate to win the 2016 presidential election, according to analysts who rely on polls. At the time of writing, the New York Times projects that she has a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=upshot&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0\">86%</a> chance of winning in November, and FiveThirtyEight puts her chances at <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus\">69%</a>. </p> <p>But these probabilities don\u2019t take into account the fact that polls have become plagued by systemic issues, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">from low response rates to media biases</a>, that have made them sometimes unreliable. What\u2019s more, in polling (much like every other type of human interaction), it\u2019s hard to tell whether people mean what they say. Are Trump supporters reluctant to share their views when a stranger from Ipsos, Rasmussen or Gallup calls them up? If so, Clinton could be in trouble.</p> <p>Forecasting the political future means considering not one probability but many possibilities. Here are the three most likely outcomes in this election.</p> <h2>Hillary Clinton wins</h2> <p>Over the past 20 years, there are just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/ohio-swing-state-republican-national-convention-clinton-trump\">19 states</a> that have flipped between the two main parties at least once. Many of those states are also on the list of closely fought contests this year: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Iowa, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire. Clinton\u2019s hopes rest on voters choosing her and those who might vote Trump staying home.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s rhetoric in the coming months will be important for securing these victories. The former secretary of state needs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/sanders-supporters-clinton-vote-survey\">convince</a> former Bernie Sanders supporters that she shares the values that galvanized so many young voters. Similarly, Clinton needs to persuade voters that she is the only way Americans can keep Donald Trump out of the White House.</p> <h2>Donald Trump wins</h2> <p>Like Clinton, Trump needs to focus his energies on mobilizing supporters to actually go to the polls. Although demographics don\u2019t seem to work in his favor (his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/angry-white-men-love-donald-trump\">supporters</a> make up a relatively small fraction of the overall electorate) it is quite possible that Trump\u2019s support is understated in polls. Polling analysis appears to privilege left-of-centre ideas (and many of the journalists who interpret polls, including this journalist, may be viewing the numbers with a misplaced optimism) which helps explains why forecasts about the British EU referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/mar/18/israel-election-why-were-the-exit-polls-wrong\">the Israeli election</a> and the Scottish independence referendum were all off the mark. </p> <p>There\u2019s another factor in this election which may well work in Trump\u2019s favor: third party candidates. Between them, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein stand to pick up <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">11%</a> of the national vote. Votes for Johnson and Stein appear more likely to erode Clinton\u2019s vote share than Trump\u2019s.</p> <p>Those third-party candidates have a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/gary-johnson-presidential-debates-227654\">slim chance</a> of making it to the presidential debates (they need to be polling with at least <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">15%</a> of the national electorate\u2019s support to qualify), meaning Trump will want to sow what doubt and frustration he can in Democratic-leaning voters, in order to convince them to stay home or vote for a third party candidate.</p> <p>Sexism could also benefit Donald Trump. In a <a href=\"https://www.pershing.com/our-thinking/thought-leadership/americans-crave-a-new-kind-of-leader-and-women-are-ready-to-deliver\">survey</a> of more than 2,000 US adults in 2014, only 74% of women and 58% of men agreed that there are not enough women in positions of power.</p> <h2>Hillary Clinton wins by a landslide</h2> <p>The mere fact this is a possibility shows just how much uncertainty there is around this election. And it is a real possibility, even though more than 20 years have passed since anyone won by a double-digit margin. For a start, the distribution of US electoral college votes privileges the Democratic party. Together, Democratic \u201csafe\u201d states (those that have voted Democratic consistently in the past six presidential elections) yield <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2016/may/06/donald-trump-odds-winning-us-election-reality-check\">242</a> of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election.

  "<p>As a machine-tooled vehicle for Mel Gibson\u2019s directorial comeback, Hacksaw Ridge couldn\u2019t be more perfect. A study of a second world war conscientious objector who demonstrated extreme bravery under enemy fire (and won the Medal of Honor), the film allows Gibson to identify himself with a tough guy of considerable moral virtue, someone who has gone through through their own modern Calvary, taken the punishment, and come through the other side relatively unscathed. And the foundation for all this? An unswerving commitment to a little-understood corner of the Christian faith (in this case, Seventh Day Adventism), which triggers \u2013 in order \u2013 bafflement, ridicule, and finally respect.</p> <p>That, presumably, is how Gibson see his own journey, which began its descent after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/11/news.melgibson\">the volley of abuse</a> he aimed at cops in 2006 after being stopped for drink driving. That year saw the release of Apocalypto, his Mayan-language thriller; it\u2019s taken him a decade of public humiliation, frequent apologies, and occasional forays as an actor, to get to the position where he can release another film he\u2019s directed. And as repellent a figure as many may still find Gibson, I have to report he\u2019s absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"806b50df98bf9d1186d649b5e3707bdff1636a8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/806b50df98bf9d1186d649b5e3707bdff1636a8d/0_43_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mostly it\u2019s due to the film\u2019s extraordinary second half, in which the protagonist \u2013 US army medic Desmond Doss \u2013 takes part in the assault on Okinawa. the bloody battle in 1945 for the islands just south of Japan itself, when the war in the Pacific was entering its own dying frenzy. Gibson\u2019s gift as a director has always been the coruscating portrayal of violent combat, imparting the viscera-knotting energy of a slasher film to the conventional matrix of the sober war film. It\u2019s not possible to say if Hacksaw Ridge contains the most violent or gruesome combat scenes ever filmed, but let\u2019s just say it resembles Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Starship Troopers without any of the satire or audience-winking. </p> <p>Thus Doss (played with an unlined forehead and semi-vacant grin by Andrew Garfield) must scramble over piles of mutilated corpses, exploded skulls, and screaming wounded as he carries out his heroic deeds; though Gibson employs a battery of cinematic shock tactics and impact-maximising moves, there\u2019s no sense that he is going overboard, or straying into exploitation territory. Though the chaos, Gibson is also able to keep the action lucid and clear, even when men are going down like ninepins.</p> <p>Gibson takes the story back to Doss\u2019 childhood and teenage years in smalltown Virginia; this passage, which takes up the film\u2019s first half, is more obviously conventional, with Doss grappling with an angry father (Hugo Weaving), romancing his sweetheart (Teresa Palmer), and bonding with his camp mates as he undergoes basic training. (Vince Vaughn considerably enlivens proceedings as the unit\u2019s sergeant, his natural wit taking the edge off the by-now-traditional bunkhouse sadism.) It\u2019s during this first brush with the army that Doss\u2019s story \u2013 and Gibson\u2019s film \u2013 takes its distinctive turn: after harrassment and a court-martial due to his refusal to bear arms, Doss is allowed to return to his unit as a medic, and join the combat mission.</p> <p>Gibson, though, is smart enough to have his film play clearly to the US\u2019s powerful religious audience: Gibson has Doss ostentatiously into combat, and gives him a brief moment of rapture-style levitation as he is being winched to safety. (One can\u2019t help but wonder how the same audience will process Doss\u2019 anti-gun beliefs, and his use of the constitution to defend his refusal to fight.) </p> <p>Be that as it may, Gibson is a man looking for redemption, and in this redemptive vision he may just have found it.</p>",

It\u2019s a fictional story of six orphaned sisters in Turkey who are left under the guardianship of their uncle. He can\u2019t cope and in a bid to control them and marry them off he turns them into prisoners in their own home. But it\u2019s no Fritzl tale about the insane actions of a perverted individual; it\u2019s about a culture of oppression that still exists on the outskirts of an otherwise very modern society. It is a roar of young female power and sexuality and the terrified, controlling patriarchs that try and suffocate and silence it. There is something so raw about the story and the performances, it just ripped through me. I cried so much it was sort of embarrassing. Stories about siblings always tug at my heart as I am so close to my own. There is also some incredible hair.</p> <h2>2 | Gig </h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/22/libertines-review-hydro-glasgow-pete-doherty-carl-barat\"><strong>The Libertines</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4e97221773be7cf219084e3a51ffe9ed896d2a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4e97221773be7cf219084e3a51ffe9ed896d2a1/0_2334_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Libertines, (l-r): John Hassall, Carl Bar\u00e2t, Pete Doherty and Gary Powell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Libertines, (l-r): John Hassall, Carl Bar\u00e2t, Pete Doherty and Gary Powell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Linkin, Coalition group</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My brother-in-law is obsessed, to an almost romantic degree, with Pete Doherty. For his birthday, my husband and I took him to the Libertines\u2019 gig at Alexandra Palace. Admittedly, I\u2019d never properly focused on them as a band. I heard more stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/27/the-libertines-it-was-a-row-that-took-10-years-to-get-over-also-i-stopped-taking-heroin-all-day-every-day\">their rock\u2019n\u2019roll history</a> than I had their music, so wasn\u2019t sure what to expect but they were utterly electrifying. Pete and his love/hate partner, Carl Bar\u00e2t, are simply godlike on stage. Their lyrics are poetry and the chemistry between them is like nothing I\u2019ve seen before. I\u2019m hooked. Everyone was going mental and the energy was so unique. It was especially cathartic for my brother-in-law, since his Pete-crush was more than validated.</p> <h2>3 | Book </h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/06/the-versions-of-us-laura-barnett-review\"><strong>The Versions of Us by Laura Barnett</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49880aacb02e87096167563947c489c20b839fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49880aacb02e87096167563947c489c20b839fcb/0_2723_3992_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Barnett, author of The Versions of Us.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Barnett, author of The Versions of Us.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite my nose for dark humour and twisted tales, every now and again I just want a damn good love story. A proper one. I can\u2019t bear sentimental smush, I want the real deal. Two people against the world, living and ideally dying for each other. I dissolved into this book, I loved it so much. Two people meet and fall in love, but in three different ways, over an entire lifetime. This is a real story of what it is to live a whole life, carrying all your decisions about it along with you; it\u2019s about choice and love and how profoundly the two things affect a human life. There is a passage at the end about finding love again later in life that slayed me.</p> <h2>4 | Documentary</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/28/going-clear-scientology-observer-review\"><strong>Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief by Alex Gibney</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f92a143230c5abd378740c31b04539fef848964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f92a143230c5abd378740c31b04539fef848964/71_0_1774_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Church of Scientology building in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Church of Scientology building in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Everett/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This documentary is like someone dripping ice water down your spine for 90 thrilling minutes. It\u2019s a beautifully told insider\u2019s explanation of the Church of Scientology through the people who got out. I\u2019m fascinated with the cult of personality, people\u2019s need to have a leader and, especially, extraordinary stories of when maniacs rise to that challenge. There is so much cynicism around the \u201creligion\u201d of Scientology, yet it appealed to the most intelligent people. It\u2019s a riveting conversation about need and belonging. The church originally advertised itself as a self-help regime that could cheer up the world but became a cult in which people got beaten up and relieved of all their money. Fascinating and terrifying.</p> <h2>5 | Standup</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-ck\"><strong>Louis CK</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0da6ac076d8eaa9d04ff5bf343471f1c8c9e545d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0da6ac076d8eaa9d04ff5bf343471f1c8c9e545d/0_109_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louis CK performing at the Funny Or Die Oddball Comedy Festival, Austin, Texas, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louis CK performing at the Funny Or Die Oddball Comedy Festival, Austin, Texas, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Miller/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I saw Louis CK\u2019s most recent gig at Wembley Arena. Standup gigs to me have always been intimate affairs in small rooms with spilt beers, but this was extraordinary. Thousands of people stood before him, baying for his words, his ideas, his take on life. He is a true artist; he uses comedy to philosophise, challenge, attack, reassure and poke his audience. His FX show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/louie-louis-ck-season-five-premiere\"><em>Louie</em></a> and his self-funded epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/07/week-in-tv-camila-kids-company-inside-story-keeping-up-with-the-khans-horace-and-pete\"><em>Horace and Pete</em></a> are some of the best TV I\u2019ve ever seen.

  "<h2>GOALKEEPERS</h2> <p>\u2022 United are clearly ahead in this department, having managed to retain the services of arguably the most reliable goalkeeper in the country. Although this time last year the club were resigned to losing David de Gea to Real Madrid, the transfer never happened and De Gea appears relaxed about his new manager and ready for another derby.</p> <p>\u2022 Having been firm in showing Joe Hart the door, Pep Guardiola now faces a follow-up decision. He cannot really continue with Willy Caballero, as that would indicate a lack of confidence in his \u00a317m buy Claudio Bravo. The Chilean is therefore lined up to make his debut in the Manchester derby, which is bold but not ideal.</p> <h2>DEFENCE</h2> <p>\u2022 Eric Bailly and Daley Blind have been getting the nod so far, despite Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s supposed misgivings over the latter as a central defender, and with United unbeaten Chris Smalling is finding it hard to win back his place. Luke Shaw is a certain starter at left-back as long as he returns from England duty without mishap, though the right-back position is a little more complicated. Antonio Valencia has been playing well enough to hold on to a place, though he only returns from Ecuador duty the day before the game. Mourinho is likely to have doubts about that, so there may be an opportunity for Tim Fosu-Mensah or Phil Jones.</p> <p>\u2022 City are in a somewhat similar position to their rivals, with summer signing John Stones is already the kingpin of City\u2019s central defence but doubts surrounding his supporting cast. Vincent Kompany is on his way back to fitness but unlikely to be risked, leaving a choice between Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Aleksandar Kolarov. The latter, normally a left-back, has been quite impressive as emergency centre-half, which is just as well considering City have just sent a couple of real centre-halves out on loan. Otamendi has not always convinced, either, but if he plays in the middle Kolarov or Ga\u00ebl Clichy will be left-back, with Bacary Sagna perhaps favourite instead of Pablo Zabaleta on the right.</p> <h2>MIDFIELD</h2> <p>\u2022 Paul Pogba has been waiting some time for his first Manchester derby and this will be his big day, even if reports that Barcelona passed up the chance to sign him in the summer are true. United supporters are expecting great things from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">their \u00a390m signing</a> and, given the price tag, the France midfielder is bound to command most attention in this early-season derby. It might seem odd that such a Rolls Royce of a player could find himself alongside the Mad Max vehicle that is Marouane Fellaini, but the way United have been playing the possibility exists. Other options include Michael Carrick, Ander Herrera and Morgan Schneiderlin, the last prevented from joining Spurs in the summer by Mourinho\u2019s intervention.</p> <p>\u2022 Guardiola has changed City\u2019s shape and in doing so dispensed with the somewhat cautious three-man midfield, with two of them defensive, that Manuel Pellegrini favoured. The Chilean normally used at least two defensive midfielders in a line of three, which tended to hold City back. Nowadays City are now moving towards a more adventurous 4-1-4-1 system, at least until Ilkay G\u00fcndogan joins the party, with Fernandinho doing the defensive screening and wide players Raheem Sterling and Nolito asked to track back when necessary. Not only does that make City are a much more attacking proposition, it means and Guardiola can employ both Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva in advanced positions, though United will look to exploit the space at the back.</p> <h2>ATTACK</h2> <p>\u2022 United have so many options Marcus Rashford has lost his starting place and \u00a327m Henrikh Mkhitaryan has found opportunities extremely limited. For the time being Mourinho\u2019s front two are set in stone, Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the main striker with Wayne Rooney just behind him. Anthony Martial has been quite successful on of the left, and rather more surprisingly Juan Mata has been getting a run of games instead of Mkhitaryan on the right. The Armenian has just been injured on international duty so United will need to check his fitness, and though his direct running could be an asset against City, Mata\u2019s cleverness has proved useful in the past.</p> <p>\u2022 Sergio Ag\u00fcero scored six goals in his first three games this season, so there is no doubt losing him to suspension represents a blow for City. When fully fit and on form there is no more lethal finisher in England, and in view of his age, pace and power, he can probably run rings round both Rooney and Ibrahomovic. In his absence Guardiola could promote Nolito to centre-forward and bring in Jes\u00fas Navas on the left, though he his more likely to keep the overall shape and give Kelechi Iheanacho a chance to shine up front. The young Nigerian did not let anyone down when called upon last season and Guardiola appears to have seen enough first hand to appreciate his potential.</p>",

  "<p>When I read that a group of Eton schoolboys had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/vladimir-putin-eton-boys-private-audience-kremlin\" title=\"\">organised their own trip to meet President Putin</a> and exchange portentous remarks in a big, posh Russian room, I could sense an expression crossing my face that I\u2019m glad no one had to see. It must have been a kind of frowning, closed-eyed, open-mouthed, nauseated sneer.</p> <p>I could feel my jowls attempt to detach themselves from my head. My nostrils seemed to be trying to put some distance between one another, while my eyebrows were huddling together for comfort. Of the words that escaped the weird-shaped hole my mouth had become, \u201coh\u201d and \u201cthose\u201d were the only ones this newspaper hasn\u2019t recently resolved not to print without indisputable editorial justification.</p> <p>I did not rejoice in the young people\u2019s adventure. The pictures of&#xa0;them smartly greeting Russia\u2019s puffy little tyrant, and lounging across&#xa0;the floor of an anteroom making wacky hand gestures, didn\u2019t make me think, \u201cGood on them!\u201d Instead I was filled with loathing, which isn\u2019t very nice of me because they\u2019re basically children and they haven\u2019t really done any harm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Public schoolboys are endlessly encouraged to show this sort of vacuous initiative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say they did any good. Putin will feel his regime came out of it well. One of the boys was reportedly quoted in a pro-Putin newspaper (how accurately, we can\u2019t know) saying: \u201cPersonally, I think that Putin is right to continue defending Assad in his role as president.\u201d Meanwhile, on Facebook, Trenton Bricken, a member of the group, described Russia\u2019s leader as \u201csmall in person but&#xa0;not in presence\u201d and David Wei, who seems to have been the jaunt\u2019s chief organiser, wrote: \u201cGuys, we truly gave Putin a deep impression of us and he responded by showing us his human face.\u201d So rumours the president carries the severed face of a rival are true, then.</p> <p>They obviously think he\u2019s great. But that\u2019s hardly surprising: they\u2019re teenagers and he\u2019s the president of Russia and he was nice to them. They\u2019re not in the business of speaking truth to power, but getting amazing selfies. I\u2019d be the same at their age \u2013 I\u2019d probably be the same now. I refuse to think more of them for all this but I\u2019m going to really try not to think less, particularly as public schoolboys are endlessly encouraged to show this sort of vacuous initiative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbe209d9d7d03c1e98055473c654e4cd42890033\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbe209d9d7d03c1e98055473c654e4cd42890033/0_107_853_1066/800.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of Eton schoolboy with a Union Jack face\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which is why Eton college\u2019s response is suspect. \u201cThis was a private visit by a small group of boys organised entirely at their own initiative and independently of the college,\u201d it said. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a lie \u2013 I\u2019m sure the school didn\u2019t set up the trip \u2013 but Eton has a tradition of encouraging pupils to organise societies and events, and this must be exactly the kind of stunt it dreams of its charges getting up to.</p> <p>\u201cWow! They met the PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA!? How the hell did they do that?!\u201d would be a more natural response. Instead, the college\u2019s line is so dry and dignified as to be a parody of dry dignity. \u201cWe can\u2019t be expected to keep track of <em>every single time</em> our boys meet up with the leader of a superpower,\u201d is the tone and it\u2019s disingenuous. It\u2019s all a bit \u201cFog in channel, continent isolated.\u201d Stiff upper-lipped establishment reserve masking feverish excitement at its own coolness.</p> <p>And it suits Eton very well for people to think that this trip is the kind of dynamic thing that Etonians just do. It subtly reinforces the notion that Eton\u2019s pupils are made of more enterprising stuff than normal schoolchildren \u2013 that there\u2019s something special about them apart from their parents\u2019 money and connections, and their own consequent sense of entitlement. The college couldn\u2019t possibly assert this view openly \u2013 it would be met with ridicule and offence in equal measure \u2013 but its over-understated response to the boys\u2019 headline-grabbing antics is a clear invitation for us to infer it.</p> <p>I used to like Eton. As a pupil at a minor public school, I admired it as the independent sector\u2019s market leader. I didn\u2019t think private education was evil \u2013 I still don\u2019t \u2013 and Eton\u2019s continued prominence felt picturesque and reassuring.</p> <p>Then suddenly, a couple of years ago, I noticed my feelings had changed. My wife and I were driving through the town of Eton \u2013 just sightseeing, we\u2019d spent the morning wandering round Windsor \u2013 and, as I looked at the beautiful buildings, the inextricability of town and school, the royal castle in the background, the heady mixture of history, wealth and confidence, my face started imitating the gargoyles.</p> <p>As my sneer of envy, disdain and rage subsided, I realised there\u2019d been&#xa0;a much more significant alteration in&#xa0;my outlook than losing&#xa0;my taste for&#xa0;one public school. It had crept up on me over the previous decade. It struck me that, when I was growing up, when I looked fondly on institutions like Eton, it was on the basis that they were ultimately doomed. They were&#xa0;relics of a more spacious age, an aesthetically attractive one, also an unjust one, but crucially, one that&#xa0;was&#xa0;over. For better or worse, and&#xa0;largely for better, history was leaving them behind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/05/dont-purge-posh-invite-them-to-join-us\">Don\u2019t purge the posh, invite them to join us | Carole Cadwalladr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was brought up with the general postwar assumption that Britain was getting fairer. It was taken for granted \u2013 by parents and teachers alike. There might be a nuclear war, oil might run out but, failing that, moral progress was assured. In the old days, the elderly didn\u2019t have pensions, now they did; women didn\u2019t have careers, now they did; poor people didn\u2019t have access to healthcare, now they did. Etc, etc, etc. Change might be happening too slowly but it was happening inexorably and exclusively in the right direction.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t notice the moment when I&#xa0;lost that assumption \u2013 it was probably between the Iraq war and the credit crunch \u2013 but when we were&#xa0;driving through Eton, it hit me hard. I remembered the complacent feeling of advancing justice with which I\u2019d once looked fondly on the crumbling beauty of institutions like Eton, and I felt tricked.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/25/backwards-to-the-future-how-britains-nostalgia-industry-is-thriving\" title=\"\">The British are a nostalgic people:</a> we love costume drama, ancient buildings, stories of kings, tradition.&#xa0;But I realised in Eton that there was&#xa0;a&#xa0; context for these fond backward glances and that context was progress.

  "<p>The Syrian city of Aleppo crumbles into rubble, assailed by Russian bombs, government artillery and chemical weapons. In the heat of battle, Turkish troops and Kurdish fighters turn on one another, fighting their age-old war, though both are supposed to be fighting a common enemy, Islamic State (Isis), advancing on the battered, tortured civilians of Aleppo and other Syrian and Kurdish communities in a murderous pincer movement.</p> <p>So the Middle East continues to implode \u2013 but amid the chaos emerges a further force, perhaps incredibly, a poetic and literary one. It comes in defiant journalism, like the story televised last week of a gardener in Aleppo who was killed by bombs while tending his roses and his son, who helped him, orphaned.</p> <p>And it comes in the verses of two female poets, part of an emergent school of verse, much of it written by women: Bejan Matur and Maram al-Masri \u2013 Kurdish and Syrian respectively. Matur and Masri are the two most illustrious and cogent of this new generation of female poets; their verse combines to create a devastating but richly composed verbal landscape that it is at once epic and intensely human. Raw and lyrical, of the moment but seeped in the memories of their people, immediate and for ever.</p> <p>The two women write very differently. Masri\u2019s poetry vividly encapsulates the frailty of our human condition in a brutal society. It can flay you at first reading. It is fair to see Masri as a love poet whose verse spares no truth of love\u2019s joys and mercilessness, to whose work war then came, as it tore her native Syria apart, and overwhelmed it, and her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m Kurdish, and you learn early that others do not regard or accept the land in which you are born as your own</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Matur\u2019s verse is more mystical: it sublimates the political and politicises the sublime; it locates her people\u2019s wandering within a philosophical meditation on both the meaning and emptiness of being. While Masri\u2019s verse is modern, and modern war poetry of the cruellest order, Matur\u2019s evokes the Romantics, Coleridge and Emily Bront\u00eb. Both record, with power and sentient humanity, the vortex of war in our world today, and the millions these wars scatter and shatter across it, not least to Europe\u2019s shores.</p> <p>\u2018For me, only through writing poetry can I reach my own horizons,\u201d says Matur. We\u2019re talking in a cafe by the river Lee in Cork, after a discussion of her work in the city library. During the discussion, she had confronted the fact that all her poetry until now was written in Turkish, rather than her native Kurdish, the banned, therefore private language of home and family.</p> <p>But in the library, she had read aloud her first Kurdish poems. \u201cMy mother corrected me,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cShe pointed out, for instance, the different Kurdish words for \u2018to turn around\u2019 and \u2018to return\u2019 \u2013 I had used the wrong one. So there was my mother, who cannot read, becoming my editor!\u201d</p> <p>Now Matur reflects on these origins. \u201cWe lived a happy life, but it was always confined; even as a child I was aware of this. I\u2019m Kurdish, and you learn early that others do not regard or accept the land in which you are born as your own.\u201d</p> <p>Now, repression in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/erdogan-reprisals-turkey-attempted-military-coup\">failed coup against Turkey\u2019s President Erdo\u011fan</a> moves against all Alevi Kurds, like Matur\u2019s family \u2013 seen not only as enemies of the state, but also as heretics by its aggressive Islamicisation. \u201cNo one feels safe,\u201d she says, as pro-regime mobs stage incursions into Kurdish communities.</p> <p>Matur was born in 1968, in the ancient Hittite city of Mara\u015f, in Turkey\u2019s south-eastern corner, Iraq to the south, Iran to the east. \u201cI was a bookish little girl,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her student days in the late 1980s were dominated by Saddam Hussein\u2019s persecution and gassing of Matur\u2019s fellow Kurds across the border in Iraq, and Turkey\u2019s less dramatic but unrelenting persecution of Kurdishness, let alone its political expression. \u201cAnd so my idea, my notion, of being Kurdish became more fundamental to me.\u201d As a law student in Ankara \u201cKurdish students were suspected, and arrested for their activities, and I was one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Matur, arrested and jailed for 12 months in 1988-9, explains how she began writing poems in prison. She recently went to a family wedding in Switzerland, at which she met her parents and relatives and friends she had not seen since childhood, such is diaspora life. \u201cAt the wedding, my father and I were trying to calculate how long I had been held in solitary confinement during my detention,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it was for 18 days; my father corrected me \u2013 it had been 28. And that was very strange for me, because there was no way of knowing. I was held in total darkness, alone \u2013 a place in which there was no time. It was up to those outside, my father, to count the days.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"948d1e3ed1e59a31411e198673516bf32f46aa33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/948d1e3ed1e59a31411e198673516bf32f46aa33/0_158_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman inspects the damage after an airstrike in the Bab al-Nairab neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman inspects the damage after an airstrike in the Bab al-Nairab neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdalrhman Ismail/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was \u201cin that dark cell that the interrogations began. That\u2019s how your world is taken from you, in pure, total darkness. And when the interrogations stopped, I thought: \u2018I can\u2019t just try to count time in this timeless dark, I have to find another way to feel my being\u2019. That\u2019s how I started writing poetry. In my head. To bring back to life an existence they were trying to obliterate. My poems are about the reconstruction of a shattered being.</p> <p>\u201cI started to focus on this way of survival. Words \u2013 and with them the reality of being \u2013 became visible to me. I had a pen and paper in my head, and was speaking the words silently to myself. As in our oral tradition, the words had rhythm, a kind of music \u2013 in jail, you cannot feel the energy to sing, but the words gave me balance in the darkness. I was not theirs any more.\u201d</p> <p>Matur and her fellow students had been arrested for suspected membership of the insurgent Kurdish political movement, \u201cbut they couldn\u2019t find anything \u2013 being Kurdish was enough to get arrested\u201d. After being held for eight months, she was cleared by a court hearing \u2013 \u201cbut when I got to the prison gates, my father waiting for me, the police arrested me again, for nothing. They even burned all the poetry I had written while in prison after solitary confinement. When I was finally released by the police, I ended up back to jail for another four months, depressed, collapsed, broken \u2013 I wanted to die.\u201d</p> <p>But in the aftermath of this nightmare, Matur spoke at an Amnesty International conference, and for the first time \u201cfound the energy to share my story\u201d. She wrote what became a defiant bestseller in Turkey, <em>Looking Behind the Mountain</em>, a collection of Kurdish voices, simply but intelligently \u2013 therefore explosively \u2013 collated. It begins with an essay, in which Matur says: \u201cWe need a person like Mahatma Gandhi\u201d.</p> <p>Matur has been writing poetry for many years \u2013 her first book was published in 1996, winning many literary prizes, and there have been more awards since. The critic John Berger writes of her work: \u201cIts aim is to outwit nonsense by outflanking it. It does so, it succeeds. Once everything was and so nothing existed. This nothing then broke into fragments, into shards which were real. And on these existent shards were written obscure phrases, which she, the poet, today transcribes. The reader does not follow word by word, but hand in hand, to touch and recognise piece after piece in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>A first volume of her poetry, <em>In the Temple of a Patient God</em>, was published in English in 2003. \u201cTo read Bejan Matur\u201d, writes Maureen Freely in the introduction, \u201cis to walk in a windswept desert strewn with bones and broken bodies and stones stained red by absent gods \u2026 It is a haunted, desolate and fragmented landscape.\u201d</p> <p>Both Freely and translator Ruth Christie invoke <em>Wuthering Heights </em>in Matur\u2019s references to \u201cmansions howling with winds\u201d. As with Beckett, whom Matur admires, \u201cI understood /time passes./Going is not going/staying is not staying\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Poetry should be an anti-weapon, a means of abating the weapons</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, inescapably, there is war. \u201cThese are not autobiographical works,\u201d writes Freely. \u201cMatur is writing about a people, not a person.\u201d Matur writes of a refugee people, like those who haunt our nightly news bulletins now: \u201cBirds hovered between earth and sky./Now the tribe cannot possibly survive/they said and flew away./We believed the birds/in their flurry,/that the tribe would not survive./With the tremulous souls/of all migrant peoples/we peered about us./First at the mountains/then the plain.\u201d</p> <p>Matur speaks with a curious combination of passionate engagement and ethereal quality. As befits her poetry: the rock of ages, the sources of rivers, the counsel of ancestors are as much a part of the cast as she is.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t use a political language, but my poetry is very political. Poetry is about the meaning beyond, about why we exist, what is the meaning of our being? At some level, these inevitably become political questions too.</p> <p>\u201cI have travelled like a nomad,\u201d she says. \u201cbut when I return to my village and sit with my mother, I am back among my people. I want to say: we are not invisible, as Turkey says we are. We have a culture, we have a language, and we want to be seen. What I try to understand is the meaning of our existence, and if you do that, you take a political position, you state an act of resistance.\u201d</p> <p>After her ordeal at the hands of the Turkish regime, and now renewed threats to her friends and colleagues, Matur seeks to establish herself in the UK, where she has family. Some months after our meeting in Ireland, walking in Kenwood, London, she says: \u201cThe moment you fight against the terrible order of things on its own terms, you join it. You have to find another way, and poetry is about finding another way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bdd9a49334616fb3db78457be64630c4412af72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bdd9a49334616fb3db78457be64630c4412af72/215_915_5799_3480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bejan Matur: \u2018Poetry is about finding another way.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bejan Matur: \u2018Poetry is about finding another way.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maram al-Masri remains at the table outside a cafe in Paris while I go in to pay the bill; when I return, her eyes have filled, and she licks a tear from the corner of her mouth. \u201cLook at him,\u201d she says, of a handsome, smiling face on her phone. \u201cHe\u2019s just been killed.

And all the other people, every day.\u201d It is only later that Masri informs me that her own son, whom she has not seen for 13 years, was among the rebels when the demonstrations started. \u201cI asked him: did you join the revolution? And he said yes, and I was so happy \u2013 I would have felt bad if he\u2019d said no.\u201d</p> <p>With the noose tightening around Aleppo, Masri says: \u201cAleppo is the final revenge against the city that was the cradle of the peaceful revolution - a genocide against everyone that does not flee all they have, and the graves of their families. I follow every moment.</p> <p>\u201cThey say poetry is a weapon, but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhy should poems be weapons? If they are, they simply take us back to the war. Poetry should be an anti-weapon, a means of abating the weapons.\u201d The implosion of her country tears at her every waking hour \u201cand my sleep too. I dream about the war.

There is a poem about how \u201cWe are the exiles/we live on the pills of sedation/\u2026 We sleep embracing our mobile phones/To the light from our screens.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Masri picks at dinner: \u201cI can feel the thirst, the hunger, as though I\u2019m living with them, even though I\u2019m here.\u201d She occupies a tiny room in Montparnasse, \u201cwith hardly any daylight \u2013 but I like this neighbourhood. Half of me is here, half of me is there. It\u2019s a kind of double way of living.\u201d</p> <p>Masri was born in the Mediterranean coastal city of Latakia, where she grew up in what she describes as a crossroads between Arab roots \u201cand nurturing ourselves with Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Leonard Cohen\u201d.

Masri began publishing poetry in magazines across the Arab world during the 1970s; during the 1980s, she moved to France, living between her native and adoptive countries. In 1987, she published a first volume, followed 10 years later by a singular book called <em>A Red Cherry on a White-tiled Floor</em>.</p> <p>These are love poems with a difference, which helped Masri claim the Adonis prize, named after the world\u2019s most famous living poet in Arabic.</p> <p>The book deals not with broken hearts, nor even bruised lust, but with passion \u2013 never ambivalent, but often taking ambivalent, even perilous, directions.

Only Masri\u2019s account of love is so painfully as well as sensually layered, they are not opposites at all.</p> <p>The book consists mainly of portraits of women and thereby womanhood, each short poem representing the voice of an individual. We are taken into the worlds of her cast, starting with a droll, poignant poem that recalls the Beatles ballad Eleanor Rigby \u2013 about Betty the retired schoolmistress and her cat, Katheline, which is \u201cdetested by everyone/except Betty/who loves nobody/except Katheline\u201d.</p> <p>Then the poetry transgresses boldly into the taboo of doctrinaire Islamic customs that would become a part of Syria\u2019s nightmare, and latterly that in France: Fatima, aged 12, is \u201cconfined to a corner/to make her understand that from now on/she is/eligible for marriage and childbearing\u201d. She ends up finding her man, but abandoned and \u201cselling her gold bracelet\u201d in order to \u201cpurchase a new virginity. But her childhood/that/she can never buy back.\u201d</p> <p>In another, Atife asks whether her love of life and a sense of her womanhood are crimes: to \u201ctouch the essence of earth\u201d, \u201clet my hair float free\u201d, \u201cput colour on my lips/to say that I have a mouth.\u201d The poem reads like a celebration of existence itself, until that existence is abruptly ended in the final stanza: \u201cIs it a crime to live in a country/where freedom/is hanged by the neck?\u201d The country is Iran; the story is true; the girl was hanged for her feminine <em>joie de vivre</em>.</p> <p>Masri tackles the barbarism of female genital mutilation: Aminata from Senegal has \u201ca living sorrow/that bleeds\u201d between her legs. \u201cThey cut it away/morsel by morsel \u2026 They said proudly: \u2018We have cut off the head of Satan.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/14/very-quiet-foreign-girls-poetry-foyle-young-poets-kate-clanchy\">The Very Quiet Foreign Girls poetry group  | Kate Clanchy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But now comes the war: now the shells start falling, the chemicals burn, the sieges begin and continue in Aleppo, Homs and Masri\u2019s home town. Her friends and family are caught in another, real-life void, in what began as the Syrian spring, became the Syrian revolution and is now a fight to the bitter end for survival.</p> <p>\u201cThen came the war, and now that world of my heart has become vast,\u201d says Masri. \u201cIt started with the revolution \u2013 I felt it every morning, I felt myself change and long to be there.\u201d I ask about a particular poem, whether it is for her son. \u201cIt is for all the mothers who have children in the revolution.\u201d</p> <p>Now Masri has but one love, her country and its suffering people, dying by the hour, like Khaled and for all she knows her own child \u2013 or else fleeing to face the deathly depths of the Aegean, the part-embrace of Germany and refugee camps across Turkey and Lebanon that Masri tours, reading from her book of war poetry, the astonishing <em>Liberty Walks Naked</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go to these camps,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all I can do. I can\u2019t go into Syria \u2013 I\u2019d be put straight into prison, or else killed. There\u2019s nowhere to hide \u2013 this is not really war, there\u2019s no real battle between equal soldiers, there\u2019s only massacre.\u201d</p> <p>Reading to the refugees, Masri says: \u201cI met a woman who had been raped by six men; all I could do was hold her. Some of the raped women are killed by their own families \u2013 they\u2019re said to have brought shame on them. One woman in Turkey told me she had lost her three boys, lost everything \u2013 home, children. There was so much suffering in her eyes \u2013 how can I help such a person ? You can give money, I can read them what words I have. I\u2019m not a heroine, nor could I be one. But they listen carefully; often they cry when I read, and talk to me about what has befallen them.

Masri has won eight poetry prizes, including the Dante Alighieri award in 2015; there are moves in Paris to nominate her for the Nobel. \u201cI get sad too when I see the soldiers dying,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are just Syrian boys too \u2013 there is no victory for anyone.

Scenes that play out in my head. If only so that there is some monument in words, some memory \u2013 it\u2019s important to Assad that there be nothing afterwards, and there has to be.\u201d Finally, in the last poem, there is Liberty: \u201cMy name is Freedom./ She walks naked \u2026 / She crosses the land / Her children, clinging to her arms \u2026 / They slit her throat / But still she sings\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>In a noisy brasserie in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier leans in and wonders whether to ask for menus or await the server. \u201cI have no charisma, so people never come over to me,\u201d she says. As an experiment she recently walked home through the neighbourhood with her \u201cchakras open\u201d, attempting to engage strangers. \u201cI thought I should try to be awake and make loads of eye contact,\u201d she says, splaying her fingers either side of her eyes. \u201cIt worked!\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it was the chakras, but if your country\u2019s biggest pop star was eyeballing you in the street, you\u2019d probably smile back. Letissier, 28, is Christine and the Queens, the alter ego that transformed her from a depressed hermit into (whatever she says) a one-woman charisma machine. She broke through in France two years ago with debut album <em>Chaleur Humaine</em> (human warmth) \u2013 intimate, groove-heavy synth-pop that suggests Bj\u00f6rk producing peak Michael Jackson. This March a semi-translated version scored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/03/christine-and-the-queens-chaleur-humaine\">stellar reviews</a> in the UK. And since then, her live performances have won thousands of fans.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7YZdAr3lMg\">Glastonbury in June</a>, undeterred by a downpour and post-Brexit misery, Letissier flexed her muscles at the sky, and challenged the weather: \u201cYou want to fight, rain?\u201d She won the battle, seamlessly intertwining excerpts from crowdpleasers Pump Up the Jam and Uptown Funk with her original material, while performing her own slippery choreography (a kind of avant-garde mash-up of pop, hip-hop and contemporary dance) with her four-strong troupe of male dancers. She accidentally dropped the mic after her last song but she could have done it on purpose \u2013 critics crowned her the act of the festival.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm so at ease on stage that the rest doesn't taste of anything. I'm always searching for intensity now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Towards the end of Letissier\u2019s shows she extracts two stems from a bunch of flowers, introducing the first as Beyonc\u00e9, the second Rihanna. (\u201cI wish I could eat Rihanna!\u201d she told Glastonbury.) At Latitude the following month, overcome by a mid-set ovation, she got carried away and bit into the large orange lily doubling as RiRi. \u201cI will <em>actually</em> speak to Rihanna later,\u201d she announced after spitting it out. \u201cThis was a terrible idea to eat a flower onstage.\u201d) She then extracts a broken twig, representing herself. \u201cBut you know what\u2019s good, guys? I get to be in the same bouquet! There\u2019s no way to be perfect with me \u2013 just be yourself, come as you are.\u201d</p> <p>This could all be a bit faux-modest, but Letissier pulls it off because she\u2019s such a brilliant performer, and so different to pop\u2019s reigning warlords. She adopted the Christine persona after a lifesaving encounter with some drag queens, and her bilingual lyrics confront the shame she\u2019s felt as a young queer woman. In an age of gender-fluidity and social-media-induced anxiety, she feels like the pop star we\u2019ve been waiting for: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RBzsjga73s\">Tilted</a>, a song about embracing awkwardness, stealthily ascended to Radio 1\u2019s A list, and the album spent weeks in the top five.</p> <p>Back from requesting the menu, Letissier explains how being Christine onstage has overhauled her existence. She has noticed herself walking differently, though says she anguishes over social interactions \u2013 not that you\u2019d notice. In a loose shirt and big round glasses, she\u2019s funny and focused, all clownish gestures and quick intelligence. There\u2019s just one problem. \u201cIt made my life a bit more difficult because I\u2019m so at ease on stage that the rest doesn\u2019t taste of anything. I\u2019m always searching for intensity now because it was like that on tour.\u201d To fill the gap, she\u2019s \u201ctrying to fall in love! Not succeeding! And then writing great songs\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RBzsjga73s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9RBzsjga73s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Tilted video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The day after we meet, she is due to leave for another intensity hit in Oslo, before wrapping two-years of <em>Chaleur Humaine</em> gigs in the UK in November. Her <a href=\"http://www.christineandthequeens.com/us/tourdates/\">tour</a> should have ended ages ago, and Letissier recently turned down dates in Japan to stop her schedule from snowballing out of control. \u201cThe clock is ticking inside,\u201d she says, grabbing her chest. \u201cIt feels cheesy to say, it makes me feel like a diva \u2013 I need to make it really genuine and honest, and somehow I feel like I would stop being like that on stage.\u201d</p> <p>Music seized Letissier early. At four, she pounded on the dinner table and demanded piano and ballet lessons. \u201cI think it says something about discipline, and I always liked discipline.\u201d She raises her fork and pulls an impish face. \u201cI love saying that, it\u2019s so creepy. I love trying to match a really hard expectation.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents weren\u2019t stagey, and educated themselves out of working-class families \u2013 her father is an English professor, and her mother teaches French and Latin. She recently bought a place nearby, and invited them up from Nantes, her hometown. \u201cThey were shrinking,\u201d she says, hugging herself, \u201clooking around like, \u2018You can\u2019t afford that\u2019, and I was like, \u2018Yes, I can!\u2019\u201d Literature was the only thing they pushed on her. <em>Jane Eyre</em> ruined high school. \u201cI was basically searching for Rochester. Writing letters, wanting connections through the mind. The dudes were searching for boobs, nice girls.\u201d She wails. \u201cI was like, no! Let\u2019s be connected to death!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The worst thing that could happen to me \u2013 if I don't write I am going to choke, like a fish</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her father introduced her at 13 to the author Sarah Waters \u2013 she thinks for the strong female characters, although it proved handy when her first girlfriend arrived three years later. \u201cMy introduction to gay sex was with Sarah Waters. I knew what was done thanks to her. Like, \u2018Oh! The whole fist?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Letissier\u2019s sexuality was never an issue for her parents, although she says she battled some internalised shame. She can trace her queerness back to the age of four while watching Michael Jackson\u2019s <em>Captain EO</em> at EuroDisney. \u201cI remember being excited for the first time, sexually excited. At some point he\u2019s dancing, and he\u2019s opening his jacket, and there is a rainbow shining out of his chest, and I was like, oh!\u201d She laughs. \u201cI know, it\u2019s so queer! My whole life is queer.\u201d</p> <p>In her teens, convinced she needed plastic surgery, she obsessed over a video of his face morphing. She lacquered on makeup to look like Marie Antoinette, so her father gave her Judith Butler\u2019s book <em>Gender Trouble</em>, which describes gender as a performance. She listened to her parents\u2019 Klaus Nomi records and wrote gory novels. Her classmates weren\u2019t always kind.</p> <p>Rather than go to a traditional state university as most French kids do, she enrolled in an intensive two-year course that prepares students to attend an elite \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, and in 2008 started theatre studies in Lyon, hoping to be a director. Freaked out by the lack of structure, she defected to a nearby university, which proved worse \u2013 incredibly, only boys were allowed to direct. \u201cWhen I asked for explanations, they were like, \u2018Because it\u2019s like that,\u2019\u201d she recalls tartly. Letissier rebelled, and staged a play without permission. In February 2010, the faculty heard she was planning a repeat, and expelled her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c9ae0a854ed39dda71078eacdd0cdea9d1a6131e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9ae0a854ed39dda71078eacdd0cdea9d1a6131e/139_145_2844_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine and the Queens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On stage in Boston in May, with her four-man dance troupe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burak Cingi/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was her first encounter with misogyny. She barricaded herself in her flat, stopped eating, and wrote plays about her anger, personified as a furious spectre named Christine who let her period blood run freely. Meanwhile, her latest girlfriend started transitioning, and dumped her. \u201cIt was not a good relationship, quite a destructive one,\u201d Letissier says tentatively. \u201cShe \u2013 he \u2013 was not really loving me. Because we broke up then, it was like I was a reminder of something he used to be and he didn\u2019t want to be any more? You get to feel like you\u2019re \u2013 not a waste, but you\u2019re someone in the past.\u201d</p> <p>Rejection left her \u201cblank\u201d, unable to read or write. \u201cThe worst thing that could happen to me. I think I can miss a leg but if I don\u2019t write, I am going to choke, like a fish.\u201d She watched Tarzan on repeat in the dark. \u201cAt some point I thought: I have to get out, otherwise I\u2019m going to lie down here \u2026 Then London came quite naturally.\u201d</p> <p>Letissier\u2019s next chapter is already entering pop mythology. In 2010 she took herself to London. In Soho, she stumbled into gay club Madame Jojo\u2019s (since shut down) and watched a shambolic drag act. The three queens adopted this agonised waif, teaching her that theatre could be anything at all; to bend rules, rather then fulfil them. They encouraged her to adopt a persona and write songs, and dismissed her self-pity. \u201cIt killed the drama, actually. They\u2019re like, \u2018So, you got dumped \u2026 and?\u2019 I was escaping the <em>Jane Eyre</em>: \u2018There is no Rochester!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Christine was properly born, named in tribute to her drag mentors. Letissier once said she might not be alive without Christine. She grits her teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about it because it becomes immediately what I don\u2019t like being \u2013 drama-queeny \u2013 but suicide for me is a real question all the time. I\u2019m interested in this concept of choosing at some point to end things. I was really considering suicide for real. I\u2019m way too much of a coward to do it, even if I wanted to. But it was purely unbearable, and I had nothing to sustain me, so Christine was me having a new writing technique, and so then a new way to be.\u201d</p> <p>A French journalist painted her as a hysteric after she mentioned suicide. \u201cThis is why I was like, let\u2019s not think about me as a female singer. Let\u2019s think about me as a voice, because I was trying to escape rules.\u201d</p> <p>Letissier moved to Paris and got two tattoos: \u201cOne of us\u201d on her left wrist, \u201cWe accept you\u201d on the right, from Tod Browning\u2019s 1932 film <em>Freaks</em>, about deformed carnival performers. She started writing on GarageBand and posting Cocteau-ish videos to YouTube, wearing suits and antlers. Her first three songs were iT, Be Freaky and Kiss My Crass, the latter a celebration of smelliness as defiance. Her flatmates convinced her to enter culture magazine <em>Les Inrockuptibles\u2019</em> talent contest. Two months later she made the final. \u201cShe was so far ahead of everybody that we thought it would be silly to give her the prize because she obviously didn\u2019t need it,\u201d says founding editor JD Beauvallet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6c5a40aa52c603fb0ef9782584c08164556057f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c5a40aa52c603fb0ef9782584c08164556057f/0_69_2384_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine and the Queens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine and the Queens performing on the Other stage at Glastonbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Isaac/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>French/Finnish duo <a href=\"http://thedomusic.com\">the D\u00f8</a> saw Letissier at the finalists\u2019 gig, and offered her an opening slot. When her computer kept crashing, she talked freely to the audience. Hecklers yelled \u201cget naked!\u201d, and Letissier shouted that she was naked already. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t try to make people want me,\u201d she says. She brought scissors onstage, \u201cin case I wanted to <em>emasculate anyone</em>!\u201d she trills. \u201cSo I was playing with them, looking at dudes, and you can tell the dudes are fearing for the penis. It was not punk, because I am not punk, but I think French people were, like,<em> chanson fran\u00e7aise</em> \u2013 ready for a Lolita singing songs, and there I was with my scissors.\u201d</p> <p>Her reputation spread, until every French label wanted to sign her \u2013 and turn her into a French Lady Gaga. She crosses her eyes. \u201cThese other dudes were like, \u2018We see this Lana Del Rey potential\u2019.\u201d She gesticulates at her boyish body. \u201cI was like, \u2018Where do you see that?!\u2019\u201d Eventually, in 2012, she signed with Because (Metronomy, Charlotte Gainsbourg), who didn\u2019t want to change anything. Letissier sidelined the antlers, recognising mainstream pop\u2019s potential as a Trojan horse for weirdness. There was the odd misfire: Tilted was originally called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st4mP9C5CY8\">Cripple</a>, the chorus, \u201cI actually enjoy being a cripple.\u201d She didn\u2019t realise the implications until she played Brighton in May 2013, \u201cand there was a huge embarrassed silence. I thought it was really ambiguous! But it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>In February 2014 she was nominated as breakthrough live act at Les Victoires de la Musique (France\u2019s Grammys), and invited to perform. Under a spotlight, she danced like a minimalist Michael Jackson and threw glitter from her gold suit pocket. In rehearsals, the 70-year-old producer had yelled in her face, \u201cDo you think people are going to be interested in that?\u201d But it made her an instant sensation. \u201cI\u2019m kind of resistant to being told no, not being wanted,\u201d she says, grinning. \u201cIt fills me with energy. When I\u2019m headlining, sometimes I feel less comfortable than when I\u2019m not expected, because people love me already, and what am I going to do with that \u2013 disappoint them?\u201d</p> <p><em>Chaleur Humaine</em> was released in France that June. On playful opener iT, she declares, \u201cI\u2019m a man now.\u201d Half-Ladies was dedicated to women who don\u2019t fit feminine ideals, and Safe and Holy celebrates dance as \u201ca way to shut down intrusive gazes, a way to reclaim my body as my own\u201d. Letissier accepts that most people listen to the tunes rather than her progressive lyrics about queerness \u2013 she identifies as pansexual, falling in love with personalities rather than genders. She finds the general attention \u201cflattering, in a way. But it\u2019s interesting, I don\u2019t know if I did that unconsciously to be sure that I could be introduced, because I\u2019m always thinking in terms of a whole career: if people get to know me first, then let\u2019s dig the dirt for the second record.\u201d</p> <p>Surprised by how melancholic <em>Chaleur Humaine</em> turned out, Letissier wants to bring her live energy into a sweaty, carnal second album. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m more a grownup now, with a horny perspective on life that\u2019s shaped my songs differently,\u201d she says, raising her eyebrows. \u201cA huge taboo now is still a woman\u2019s desire. We are forgotten \u2013 it\u2019s like we are supposed to sustain other people\u2019s desire because we are desirable objects. What if we desire ourselves? So I feel like what could be shocking is not even me being naked, but me wanting to fuck someone and talking about it really simply \u2013 \u2018I just want to fuck your bones.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"39e3f997de90fd13974eb7a24e70d102563fe6c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39e3f997de90fd13974eb7a24e70d102563fe6c6/87_416_3486_4358/800.jpg\" alt=\"H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She thinks the simplicity will also help her lack of a \u201ccoherent\u201d self. \u201cI\u2019m kind of trapped in my contradictions with my sexual desires. Because I\u2019m experimenting so much with gender-bending and listening to everything that happens to me in terms of genderless energies, I have a hard time finding partners that can match me. They still want me in the end to be a girl or a queer woman, and I don\u2019t want that. I want to shatter everything and experiment because I want gaps, uncertainty \u2013 I\u2019m really attracted to that.\u201d</p> <p>Christine\u2019s suits were originally conceived to deflect the male gaze. Now Letissier is comfortable to be seen as a sexual object. Her attitude is: \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be commented upon for my physique, let\u2019s show them something new to comment upon.\u201d She points out her gym across the road, where she\u2019s working towards resembling 90s Madonna, her body ideal. \u201cI\u2019m fully becoming what I want to become, thanks to Christine, so I\u2019m going to head towards the macho and the tougher side. When I\u2019m doing photoshoots, I still have this stupid idea that I want to be pretty, and I don\u2019t want to think about it any more.\u201d</p> <p>Letissier criticised French <em>Elle</em> after they photoshopped her February 2015 cover beyond recognition, yet she still wants to feature in women\u2019s magazines. \u201cI should not desert those spaces because I hate them \u2013 I should try to bend them because I can.\u201d</p> <p>It could be her mission statement: one of her dancers previously quit a major pop tour after being asked to wear heels \u201cbecause he was not a \u2018faggot\u2019\u201d, she quotes.

After November\u2019s terrorist attacks on the Bataclan in Paris, she ran a pop-up radio station, interviewing diverse artists to widen the definition of French identity as opportunist politicians promoted exclusion. She\u2019s been retweeting France\u2019s nascent Black Lives Matter movement following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/violent-clashes-break-out-in-paris-suburbs-over-death-of-man-in-custody\">24-year-old Adama Traore\u2019s death in police custody</a> in July. In the UK, we crave smart, political musicians, but in France, Letissier says, \u201cit\u2019s not really well seen when an artist takes a position, because we are supposed to be like clueless singing puppets\u201d.</p> <p>This sounds strange, given that France makes intellectuals into celebrities. \u201cBut France is really different now, I think. Because of the terrorist attacks, we are not in reflection, we are in reaction, and I think maybe it\u2019s the same for [post-Brexit Britain]. It\u2019s all short-term thought about being elected, and it\u2019s terrible because politics is not a place where you can think about what togetherness means any more. And I have a responsibility like any citizen \u2013 more so, because I have more reach.\u201d</p> <p>Letissier worries that questioning her identity promotes this individualism. But her lyrics are the antithesis of narcissistic pop, and she wants to be contagious, not admired. She concedes a little. \u201cLyrics of really huge pop bangers right now make me think about advertising \u2013 sentences that could thrill you but are empty in the end. And for that, I don\u2019t really feel like I do belong in the pop realm.\u201d Kendrick Lamar is more her bag. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in Compton, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s really talking about, but because it\u2019s personal \u2013 money and love \u2013 it strikes universal terms.

You get to have many realities going on at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>The brasserie has emptied, and Letissier is late for a blood test \u2013 she confesses she\u2019s a hypochondriac. Caffeine is her only vice, and she bailed on a recent date to smoke her first joint \u201cbecause I\u2019m an introvert,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cI want to try to write under a substance to see if, like people say, it\u2019s better or not. I don\u2019t really believe it\u2019s better because I think for me, writing is so much being in that state already.\u201d</p> <p>It transpires there is a limit to how far she\u2019s willing to push boundaries. \u201cBut then again, losing control \u2013 I\u2019m not a fan of that.\u201d</p> <p><em>Chaleur Humaine is out now (Because Music).

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s visit to a black church in Detroit met with disgust among protesters and activists on Saturday, but won praise from parishioners who attended the service at the <a href=\"http://www.greatfaith.org/\">Great Faith Ministries</a> church on the city\u2019s west side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/trump-black-vote-detroit-speech-obama\">Black Americans on 'what they have to lose' if Trump becomes president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A sea of protesters and a heavy police presence surrounded the church, as local residents along Grand River Avenue looked on. Chants of \u201cNo Trump, go home Trump\u201d were raised by about 75 people in a march organized by local pastors and activists.</p> <p>The visit by the Republican presidential nominee came just two weeks after a speech to business tycoons in downtown Detroit was nearly derailed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">activists who continually interrupted him</a>. </p> <p>Tony Minetee, who grew up near the church, called the scene on Saturday a \u201ccircus\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is an idiot, and he\u2019s pandering,\u201d said Minetee, 48. After months of harsh campaign rhetoric from the former reality TV star, Minetee said his effort to court the African American vote was almost incredible. \u201cYou can\u2019t just talk to people like that and think it\u2019s going to just smooth over,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rick McGowan, 62, carried a sign with a caricature of Trump that deemed him \u201cunstable in all his ways\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree with Donald Trump on everything that he says,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Trump campaign would not allow the Guardian inside the church, as different aides said it was a \u201cclosed event\u201d or said no press would be permitted at all. Events inside the church were, however, broadcast on television. As the service began, shortly after 11am, Trump shook hands with members of the congregation, then took a seat in the church\u2019s front row, swaying back and forth to music. </p> <p>To mild applause, Bishop Wayne T Jackson noted that the Republican nominee was in the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cThis is his first African American church he\u2019s been in, y\u2019all,\u201d said Jackson, laughing and noting that the service would be a \u201clittle different\u201d to those of the Presbyterian church to which Trump is accustomed.</p> <p>After Jackson spoke about the need for love and called on parishioners to hug and love each other, Trump could be seen hugging and greeting churchgoers himself. He posed for selfies and held up a baby.</p> <p>Trump had not been expected to address the congregation, having sat beforehand for a privately taped interview with Jackson that was due to be edited and published later on Saturday. In the event, he said he would read some remarks he had written several days earlier.</p> <p>Trump is not known for his strong Christianity: asked last year at an evangelical event in Iowa <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sWzJZMTNd4\">if he had ever sought God\u2019s forgiveness</a>, he said that he had not. Accordingly, he has struggled among white evangelical voters. In Detroit, his speech was heavily focused on faith and the importance of black churches through US history.</p> <p>Reading from a script and adopting a milder tone than that familiar from campaign rallies and debates, the billionaire businessman said: \u201cWe\u2019re all brothers and sisters and we\u2019re all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we\u2019re in this all together.</p> <p>\u201cI fully understand that the African American community is suffering from discrimination and there are many wrongs that must still be made right. They will be made right. I want to make them right.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s from the pews and pulpits [and] Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the civil rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. </p> <p>\u201cThere is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the black churches and churchgoers.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also noted that the Republican party was the party of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president, who defeated the slave-owning Confederacy in the civil war and signed the emancipation proclamation.</p> <p>\u201cBecoming the nominee of the party of Abe Lincoln has been the greatest honor of my life,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the party, but more importantly the future of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not focus on crime and law and order, as he has done when speaking to white audiences, or touch on police violence against the black community, gun violence or mass incarceration \u2013 major African American issues that the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, has discussed on the campaign trail. Instead, he focused on jobs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here today to learn so that we can together remedy injustice in any form and so that we can remedy economics so that the African American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and many different ways,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>\u2018Detroit\u2019s only gone through bankruptcy once\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"833be2b2535bf79a6b20fa26e302310bd5044ef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/833be2b2535bf79a6b20fa26e302310bd5044ef5/0_73_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detroit Trump protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march outside the church.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Cook/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">Trump's new hire David Bossie has decades-long history attacking Clintons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Outside, protests continued. A group of clergy from across metropolitan Detroit denounced Trump\u2019s visit. The Rev Lawrence Glass said Trump\u2019s message to the black community and minorities \u2013 asking \u201cwhat do you have to lose\u201d through a vote for the Republican \u2013 was not genuine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do we have to lose?\u201d Glass said. \u201cHow about voting rights, civil rights, human rights?\u201d </p> <p>The mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, also criticised Trump\u2019s decision to speak in his city and attacked the businessman on economic lines. At a press conference, in a restatement of remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July, Duggan said: \u201cThe difference between Donald Trump and Detroit is Detroit\u2019s only gone through bankruptcy once.\u201d </p> <p>The city is attempting to leave behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/18/detroit-formally-files-bankruptcy\">the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history</a>. In his speech to the Detroit Economic Club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/donald-trump-economic-speech-detroit-michigan-locals-angry\">last month</a>, Trump sought to use the city as an illustration of Democratic party policies that he said produced \u201csilenced victims\u201d. Duggan noted key improvements, particularly falling rates of homicide and unemployment. </p> <p>Detroit\u2019s police chief, James Craig, told reporters at the church he had spoken to Trump for about 30 seconds, and said the Republican nominee told him: \u201cThanks for making us safe.\u201d As of 11.45am no arrests had been made, Craig said. Activists claimed a woman\u2019s shoulder was broken by a police officer during a brief confrontation prior to the service.<br></p> <p>When events inside the church were over, attendees said Trump had received a warm welcome. Frank Bailey, 69, had driven in from Farmington Hills, a suburb about 20 miles north-west of the city. He said he enjoyed the service, having been concerned about how Trump would be received, due to his low polling among African Americans.</p> <p>\u201cI think at the beginning [of the service] it was slow, but the more he talks and the more he said and the more genuine he seemed to become, I guess, I felt that they really warmed up to him,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Jacquelyn Rhodes, a pastor at New Light Christian Ministries in Detroit, said Trump offered substantive remarks. A lifelong independent, Rhodes said the visit had bolstered her support for the Republican. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody had any animosity toward him because we\u2019re all Christians</p> <footer> <cite>Cynthia Price</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t my first choice during the primaries,\u201d Rhodes said, \u201cbut I do support Donald Trump.

The service was publicized as open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis, but upon arrival some parishioners found that tickets were needed. On Wednesday, the New York Times obtained <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters-wayne-jackson.html?_r=0\">a copy of scripted answers</a> for Trump\u2019s taped interview Bishop Jackson, prompting Jackson to say he would change his questions. </p> <p>Duggan, a Democrat, said Trump\u2019s decision to use scripted answers contrasted with his customary portrayal of himself as a maverick. The mayor highlighted one question Jackson intended to ask \u2013 \u201cAre you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?\u201d \u2013 and said: \u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t answer that question to a minister without going through scriptwriters and consultants.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most phony major party candidate I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>After Trump\u2019s address, Jackson presented him with a Jewish Heritage Study Bible, a prayer shawl and a pin. Wrapping Trump in the shawl, Jackson said it was from Israel and added that he had prayed and fasted over it.</p> <p>Thanking the presidential candidate for his speech, Jackson declared that he had another title for Trump: \u201cPreacher.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Wall Street drew two conclusions from the news that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/02/markets-await-crucial-us-jobs-report-business-live\" title=\"\">US jobs engine shifted down into a lower gear last month</a>. The first \u2013 that a September increase in interest rates is now a non-starter \u2013 was almost certainly right.</p> <p>Putting up the cost of borrowing so close to the presidential election in early November always looked like an outside bet. It would have taken thunderously good figures for job creation to have persuaded the more dove-ish policymakers at the Federal Reserve to move, and the ones released on Friday were average at best.</p> <p>To be sure, the August non-farm payrolls have come in worse than expected for the past decade, suggesting that there might be some problem with the way the raw data is seasonally adjusted. What\u2019s more, the two previous months \u2013 June and July \u2013 saw strong increases in demand for labour, so the three-month average for non-farm payrolls is running at a healthy 200,000. That could persuade some of the hawks at the Fed to move, but they will not be able to muster a majority.</p> <p>The second conclusion drawn by Wall Street is more questionable. That is the assumption that the rate rise some analysts had pencilled in for September has now simply been put back to a later date. Some economists believe the Fed won\u2019t waste any time once US voters have chosen who will be Barack Obama\u2019s successor at the White House; some think the central bank will wait until March next year.</p> <p>There is, though, a different way of looking at the numbers. For most of this year, the strength of the US labour market has been at odds with data showing the economy growing only slowly. Sooner or later, the theory went, growth would accelerate and come into line with employment numbers, so justifying higher interest rates.</p> <p>But what if Wall Street has got things back to front? Is it possible that it is the labour market that has been giving off false signals and that eventually job creation will decelerate and come into line with a growth rate that averaged just 1% in the first half of 2016?</p> <p>There is enough evidence to make this a plausible hypothesis. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" title=\"\">Take the details of the most recent jobs report</a>, for example. The annual growth rate in average hourly earnings fell to 2.4%, its lowest in six months, while average weekly hours worked declined to 34.3, the lowest in two and a half years.</p> <p>Hours worked by production and non-supervisory staff \u2013 who account for five out of six workers in the US \u2013 rose by 1.1% over the past year, the slowest rate of increase since 2010. None of this suggests the labour market is humming, nor that the recent pick-up in consumer spending \u2013 the economy\u2019s only real source of growth in the first half of the year \u2013 can be sustained.</p> <p>With investment weak and exports affected by low global demand and the lagged effects of the dollar\u2019s previous strength, it is not immediately obvious why the Fed would raise interest rates any time soon. Over the past couple of years, the US has succeeded in creating millions of jobs, but most of them are relatively unskilled and attract low pay. There is no obvious inflationary threat.</p> <p>Rather, the Fed should be focused on the risk that the economy might stall altogether. Corporate profits have come under pressure and this is leading to cuts in business investment. Historically, this is a good leading indicator that the US economy is heading into recession.</p> <p>The softness of the US economy is a concern to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet Yellen, who has rightly adopted an ultra-cautious approach to raising rates. It will also be a concern for Hillary Clinton. The state of the economy does her no favours in her battle with Donald Trump.</p> <h2>Now bosses actually have to ask not to get bonuses</h2> <p>News that David Brown, chief executive of Go-Ahead Group, has asked not to be considered for a bonus this year prompts an obvious question: why did he think he might get one?</p> <p>Go-Ahead is the main company behind the chaotic Southern rail franchise that delivers daily misery to London commuters. If Brown\u2019s \u00a3558,000 bonus from a year ago had been repeated, riots might have broken out on station platforms.</p> <p>Not all Southern\u2019s woes can be laid at the operator\u2019s door, it should be said. The company doesn\u2019t control the tracks, which is where some of the problems have arisen as Network Rail gives London Bridge a major upgrade.</p> <p>But those difficulties have been compounded by Southern\u2019s bitter battle with the RMT union over plans to hand responsibility for closing train doors from conductors to drivers. Whatever the rights and wrong of the dispute, Southern\u2019s handling of the fallout has been appalling. Time and again, Brown has found himself apologising to customers for the sub-standard service. A bonus would have been another PR disaster.</p> <p>In practice, however, the bonus question arises because the rest of Go-Ahead is doing OK. The bus operations and other parts of the rail business are up to scratch. Despite losses at GTR \u2013 the unit that includes Southern \u2013 Go-Ahead\u2019s pre-tax profits rose 27% to \u00a399.8m. So Brown might have expected a juicy personal reward.</p> <p>But such a notion merely underlines the perversity of the modern bonus. No longer is it a reward for exceptional performance; instead, executives get them merely for delivering targets. In Go-Ahead\u2019s case, meeting the target \u2013 in other words, doing your job \u2013 is worth an extra 75% of salary in normal circumstances; at other companies, the ratio can be higher.</p> <p>This is a nonsense. Pay committees have become wedded to formulas that pay out even when disaster has struck in part of the empire. Boards should get a grip and apply common sense, which they are allowed to do. It should not have been a case of Brown doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d. His chairman should have said no bonuses would be paid because Go-Ahead was failing its customers.</p> <h2>The best way to stop Hinkley is to agree to it</h2> <p>What should Theresa May say to her Chinese G20 hosts about Hinkley Point? Nothing. The PM only ordered a review of the \u00a318bn project, which Beijing wants to part-fund, at the end of July. Hard conclusions probably haven\u2019t been reached. Don\u2019t risk a diplomatic quarrel on the other side\u2019s turf.</p> <p>A decision will have to be reached soon but an elegant solution seems to be emerging from Downing Street: tell the Chinese Hinkley is cleared for take-off but proposed nuclear plant Bradwell, in Essex, which the Chinese hope to build under their own steam, requires an in-depth security review.</p> <p>The Chinese, we are led to believe, would take offence and abandon Hinkley. Good. The plant would be hideously expensive for bill-payers and developer EDF\u2019s other two Hinkley-style developments outside the UK are years behind schedule. If Beijing packs its bags, the UK would have a choice: part-fund Hinkley; or let the plans collapse. Option B is best.</p>",

At the grave of Chateaubriand, Heinz lingers by the lonely sea view while his family scamper ahead, warning of an incoming tide. It\u2019s a sunny family scene, but it has a gently portentous air, a sense that, to quote Nathalie\u2019s infuriating publisher, \u201cthe future is compromised\u201d. Jumping ahead several years, we meet Nathalie again in Paris where protests are preventing her students from attending class, to the annoyance of the one-time communist (\u201cjust for three years, like most intellectuals\u201d). When Heinz taunts her about her shifting politics, Nathalie scornfully replies that he hasn\u2019t changed since he was 18, when Kant\u2019s <a href=\"http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/companions/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139001144&amp;cid=CBO9781139001144A004\">\u201cstarry sky above me and moral law within me\u201d</a> became his immutable credo. Yet Heinz has a secret that will prove that love is even less certain than politics or philosophy. \u201cI thought you\u2019d love me forever,\u201d says Nathalie, ruefully. \u201cWhat an idiot.\u201d</p> <p>While there may be superficial similarities between Nathalie\u2019s predicament and Huppert\u2019s heroine in Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s 2009 <em>Villa Amalia</em>, the two films could not be more different. Here, Hansen-L\u00f8ve serves up unapologetic discussions of Rousseau, radicalism and revolution in a world in which the Unabomber\u2019s manifesto sits side by side with the classics and clerics declare that \u201cdoubt and questioning are inextricably bound up with faith\u201d. It sounds unbearably heavy, but there is such life in the character of Nathalie (partly inspired by Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s mother) that this weight often turns to levity and laughter. Crucially, Nathalie\u2019s profession is central to her existence, unfashionably so for modern cinema. Beyond her marital problems, Nathalie\u2019s primary relationship is with her books, a bond that cannot be broken. Indeed, the film\u2019s most harrowing spectacle shows her once tightly packed bookshelves riddled with gaping holes after a domestic cull leaves her beloved books lying on their sides.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/30/mia-hansen-love-things-to-come-autumn-arts-preview-2016\">Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve: 'Oh no, please don't touch the cat!'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Background noise is provided by the constant cries for help of Nathalie\u2019s mother, with Edith Scob superbly querulous as the former model whose ambitions and anxieties have been bequeathed to her daughter, along with her overweight cat, Pandora. As both a daughter and a mother, Nathalie fulfils a dual role that is threatened at the very moment that her husband proves inconstant. Yet rather than looking for a trite romantic \u201csolution\u201d to her isolation (there\u2019s a frisson of attraction with her protege, Fabien, seductively played by Roman Kolinka), Hansen-L\u00f8ve keeps Nathalie purposefully in flux and on the move, Denis Lenoir\u2019s camera constantly catching her striding hither and yon, proceeding as briskly as the film itself.</p> <p>After the rave-beats of 2014\u2019s <em>Eden</em>, <em>Things to Come</em> makes significant use of silence, broken by sparse, specific songs, from Woody Guthrie\u2019s Ship in the Sky to the Fleetwoods\u2019 close-harmony rendition of Unchained Melody. \u201cWe listened to the same records for 20 years,\u201d Nathalie tells Fabien. \u201cI was sick of it.\u201d For all its disruptiveness, Nathalie\u2019s situation provides an opportunity to change the record, the future waiting to be written upon the endlessly expressive face of Isabelle Huppert.</p>",

Indeed, the performance can\u2019t be sustained unless we support it with our credulity, like a tentful of rubes gaping at the tricks of a carnival magician, even offering ourselves up as subjects.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We wanted heat. We wanted him to call liars liars, idiots idiots. We wanted him to bully the bullies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The wishful thinking that is the source of this credulity is, of course, a prelude to disappointment if our candidate actually gets elected. Take the case of candidate Barack Obama. He was going to get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and close Guant\u00e1namo. He would save our failing economy, mend our broken healthcare system, and enact sensible gun control legislation. He would overhaul our immigration system, address climate change with meaningful policies, and change the bilious tone of our political discourse. We weren\u2019t a nation of red states and blue states, he reminded us: we were the United States. Despite my years, I believed \u2013 believed not only that he meant what he said, but that he could get it done.</p> <p>My wife and I gathered several friends on a November night in 2008, and watched with joy and disbelief as this young, literary, ironical man with a Kenyan father was elected to the presidency. Some of us had tears in our eyes. I was one. But as time went on those tears began to burn. He wasn\u2019t getting it done, or so it seemed to me. Guant\u00e1namo was still in business. The planet kept heating up, and the wars dragged on, though increasingly waged by special forces. As before, just about anybody was free to walk into a gun store and come out armed, and each year some 30,000 Americans continued to pay for that freedom with their lives.</p> <p>And the tone of political life had become even more toxic than before the election. During President Obama\u2019s first State of the Union address, a congressman from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/10/you-lie-joe-wilson-obama-speech\" title=\"\">South Carolina shouted: \u201cYou lie!\u201d</a> and became a Republican hero, even as the leaders of that party dedicated themselves to obstructing President Obama\u2019s legislative initiatives and judicial appointments, effectively disabling the government in order, as the senate majority leader shamelessly admitted, to make Obama a one-term president. The birthers continued to question his legitimacy, and, further, to imply that he was a secret Muslim and supporter of Isis. He was Hitler. He was Lenin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9/0_137_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obamacare supporters react to the US Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama\u2019s health care law, 28 June, 2012, Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obamacare supporters react to the US Supreme Court decision to uphold President Obama\u2019s health care law, 28 June, 2012, Washington, DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of this of this was Obama\u2019s fault. Indeed, he reacted to the unrelenting stream of slander and congressional malfeasance with unflappable calm and an air of faintly amused detachment. And for that I did blame him. The coolness I had admired during his campaign became an irritant. In fact, it drove me sort of crazy. Why didn\u2019t he fight back? Show some rage at what was truly outrageous, the obstruction, the name-calling, the attacks on Michelle Obama for encouraging schools to serve healthy food, even for occasionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/04/fashion-michelleobama\" title=\"\">wearing dresses that showed her arms</a>? Call these liars and bullies out, damn it! Politics is mud wrestling, did he not understand that? And if he really didn\u2019t feel anger, then why not take some acting lessons, and fake it?</p> <p>Well, I was wrong. As Barack Obama prepares to leave office, I think about what he managed to do in the face of implacable resistance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/24/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-republicans\" title=\"\">No, he didn\u2019t close Guant\u00e1namo</a>; the Republican congress wouldn\u2019t let him, nor would they let him bring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/05/what-obama-said-on-gun-control-doesnt-matter-republicans-oppose-it\" title=\"\">sanity to our gun laws</a>, or to our immigration policies. But as most economists agree, his financial initiatives, narrowly approved, did save us from a profound recession, possibly even a depression. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/06/auto-industry-obama-bailout\" title=\"\">successful auto industry bailout</a>, fiercely contested at the time, saved countless jobs at virtually no expense to the taxpayer. If Obama couldn\u2019t entirely extricate us from the wars he inherited, he has refrained from entangling us in new wars, despite being constantly urged to do so by congressmen and senators who otherwise refuse to spend tax dollars \u2013 on, say, education, or roads, or environmental safeguards.</p> <p>Finally, 20 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/28/obama-healthcare-reform-key-provisions\" title=\"\">Americans who&#xa0;did not have health insurance</a> when Barack Obama took office have it now; and in spite of dire Republican predictions, and umpteen votes for repeal, it has actually lowered the healthcare cost inflation rate. No one in this country, however poor, or sick, need be without insurance. This achievement eluded Theodore Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, among others.</p> <p>So why has Obama not been celebrated for what he\u2019s done? Why did so many of us so often feel a sense of impatience, even disappointment? I believe it comes down to immaturity \u2013 in us, not him. At least part of the reason for our failure to recognise and praise what he\u2019s accomplished has to do with his style \u2013 that coolness. He doesn\u2019t brag, or gloat. He doesn\u2019t call attention to himself, or proclaim his deeds in the thoroughfares, or ridicule those who oppose him. But we wanted him to. We wanted heat. We wanted anger, slashing rhetoric, mockery. We wanted him to call liars liars, idiots idiots. We wanted him to bully the bullies. We wanted him to wage war, and crow over his fallen enemies. And because we did not get the melodrama we demanded, we lost the plot.</p> <p>But now we have a candidate who will give us all the sound and fury we could ask for, or imagine. Let\u2019s see how we like it.

I have an acquaintance who was Obama\u2019s boss when Obama had just gotten out of college. My acquaintance, a white man, was deeply irritated that Obama had become president and that he himself had not. I can certainly claim to my share of irrationality but when I heard this, it seemed to me a new level of bizarreness. Before the Obama presidency, if I had heard something so stupid I would have just laughed.

I was sleeping in a little cabin right by the field where slaves used to cut sugar cane. One night a storm was coming and you could hear the leaves rustling against each other, and it sounded to me like voices. I remember talking to whatever spirits were out there and telling them: \u201cYour labour was not in vain.

But I had a hope that we were about to move past the worst of our racial history. Right now, America is at a crossroads. The Obama presidency can move us forward, or we can backslide into racial intolerance and violence for good. One of the effects of Obama being elected is that there is a level of racism in America that can no longer be ignored. If a man like Barack Obama, so well-educated, so graceful, so intelligent, so charming, can be so reviled and denigrated on a daily basis in some parts of the country and in Congress (to the point that he can hardly do his job), you can no longer as a normal American ignore the profound problem of race in this country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f4c73953412b135a39a7e8521615a3dc8e4eca6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f4c73953412b135a39a7e8521615a3dc8e4eca6/39_90_1261_723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"573\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack and Michelle Obama: \u2018We\u2019re just beginning to see what this man and his wife together are going to do for the country. \u2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are a lot of well-meaning white folks who for years could not see the breadth of racism in America, so I feel that one of the gifts of Obama\u2019s presidency \u2013 a perverse gift \u2013 is the fact it allowed a sickness to bubble up to the surface, like a boil on the skin. You can\u2019t treat what you can\u2019t see. And now that we see it, maybe there\u2019s a chance to treat this racial sickness for good.</p> <p>As for my feelings about Obama, the man himself, I think he\u2019s done a lot of positive things. He got dumped with an economy in freefall in 2009 but he\u2019s managed to turn it around. And his healthcare reforms were humongous, as big to me as stuff that Lyndon Johnson did back in the 60s, like creating Medicare. Of course he\u2019s done things that I do not agree with. I have a problem with the failure to close Guant\u00e1namo, I have a problem with drone strikes around the world. But you\u2019re never going to like everything that any president does. What I\u2019m not going to do is hold Obama to a higher standard, where he has to be a magical negro who is perfect. He\u2019s allowed to make missteps.</p> <p>I think we\u2019re just beginning to see what this man and his wife together are going to do for the country.

Whoever wins the presidency in November, the first spouse will command a fraction of the respect that Michelle Obama enjoys.

He allowed \u201cred lines\u201d to be crossed without sanction. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/20/americas-drone-policy-all-exceptions-no-rules-yemen\" title=\"\">The drone war</a>, considered in many parts of the world as the administration\u2019s signal moral disaster, has carried on with little serious domestic opposition. The failure to close Guant\u00e1namo is, in the scheme of things, the least of these failures. Only time will tell whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/18/obama-iran-deal-weekly-address-world-safer-republican-opposition\" title=\"\">vaunted Iran deal</a> produces a harvest of peace and stability.</p> <p>And yet Obama will be missed. Sometimes, out of his extensive rhetorical tool kit, the president pulls a weird folksy tone, a subliminal suggestion of Merle Haggard, designed, no doubt, to soothe the terror induced by his blackness. Desperate as it is to go on a psychic vacation in the magical kingdom of the \u201cpost-racial\u201d, America will discover that it was lucky to have had a figure capable of such virtuosic code-switching, a man who demonstrated that it was possible to communicate across the lines.</p> <h2>Jayne Anne Phillips: \u2018Just by being who he is&#xa0;he has made an enormous impact\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1c80c3cc95be6b3bc15f1b54451ae4e13636f83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1c80c3cc95be6b3bc15f1b54451ae4e13636f83/0_759_2912_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Jayne Anne Phillips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jayne Anne Phillips: \u2018Obama has been a stealth president.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon &amp; Sc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Guggenheim fellow </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/11/fiction.familyandrelationships\" title=\"\"><em>Jayne Anne Phillips</em></a><em> won the 1980 Sue Kaufman prize for first fiction when she was only 26, for her debut book of stories, Black Tickets.

People forget that when he assumed the presidency in 2009, he was handed a financial disaster in the making and his response to it really saved the country, and possibly the world, from financial collapse. But he\u2019s done so much more. In the two years in which he had a Democratic Congress, he passed the Affordable Care Act and oversaw a $36bn dollar expansion in Pell Grants, which very much affects students at Rutgers University-Newark, where I direct the MFA programme.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama\u2019s presidency marks an honourable few years in American history.

He has worked hard to fight climate change. Solar energy production has increased 30-fold since he became president. Jobs in the solar industry have grown exponentially, and he\u2019s leading the effort to phase out damaging hydrofluorocarbons used in air conditioning. His presidency has accomplished so much of which citizens are not aware. He has embraced executive actions, unwilling&#xa0;to accept the stasis Congress embodies.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the whole leadership case. He can\u2019t end racism and sexism in America, but just by being who he is, he\u2019s made an enormous impact. I think he is truly a visionary who is uniquely qualified to serve. He\u2019s a biracial African American man who grew up in a white household. He came from a background of law and community organising. He\u2019s an absolutely wonderful orator: funny, elegant and humane.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ad69ce5baec1a9a9bd71995842c92cbccd32e5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ad69ce5baec1a9a9bd71995842c92cbccd32e5b/0_0_4200_2799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Same-sex marriage supporters in front of the supreme court in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Same-sex marriage supporters in front of the supreme court in Washington, DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I suppose it\u2019s clear that I\u2019m a big Obama fan and that this election year&#xa0;has been a psychedelic nightmare. It\u2019s like going from the sublime to \u2013 if Trump is actually elected \u2013 the ridiculously dangerous. It\u2019s a very strange time in this country and we can only hope that Trump will&#xa0;continue to implode. Hillary Clinton is exceptionally qualified and I think she\u2019d be a good president; American sexism plays a huge part in her supposed \u201cunlikability\u201d. She might not be as inspiring as Obama, she\u2019s not cool or chic, but she is such a policy wonk, so prepared and careful. And constant. Her priorities \u2013 children, families, justice \u2013 are the same after 30 years. Yet she is suspected because she has breached the establishment. I\u2019m just praying she\u2019ll win. If Trump wins, there\u2019ll be a lot of people in America trying to marry Canadians.</p> <p>Obama has been a inspiring and provocative leader. The fact that this is more or less the consensus around the world really matters, because it means he\u2019s not vulnerable to the sniping and griping, to the ridiculous \u201cgo low, no, go lower\u201d tone that Trump has set in this election. I don\u2019t think anything will change the fact that Obama\u2019s presidency marks an honourable few years in American history. He is Trump\u2019s polar opposite. What a country this is, to nurture and succour two such opposite cultural/political beings. The best and the worst have moved further and further apart; we are a completely divided nation. Those paradise moments \u2013 the very surprising 2008 Obama election, the crowds, the alliances, the decency, charm and intelligence of it all \u2013 exist alongside all that we now endure. It\u2019s a world that only a 24-hour news cycle could love. What will Trump do or say next? Like everything Trump touches, it\u2019s all about him. But I digress.</p> <p>Desperation and chaos are distracting. How dark will it get? Regardless, Obama is not going away.&#xa0;The America that elected him twice is not going away either. Like Elvis, that America has left the building. Hopefully it will reappear on election day.</p>",
  "<p>Mathieu Amalric\u2019s latest film as director and star is <em>The Blue Room</em>, based on a Georges Simenon novel. Best known internationally as the villain in Bond film <em>Quantum of Solace</em>, the French actor has also worked with Steven Spielberg, David Cronenberg and Julian Schnabel, while his French films include work with Roman Polanski, Alain Resnais, Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9 and Arnaud Desplechin.</p> <p><strong>Simenon\u2019s 1964 novel, about an extra-marital affair and the trial that follows, is very sexual, right from page one. What made you want to adapt it?</strong><br>Everyone has their favourite Simenon book that they\u2019ve found by chance somewhere, at their grandmother\u2019s or on a shelf. The producer Paolo Branco told me I had three weeks to make a film, so I chose a very short book. You open it at the first page and it just grabs you. It\u2019s one of the rare Simenon novels that\u2019s told in reverse \u2013 the man is arrested, we don\u2019t know why, we don\u2019t know who\u2019s dead, and we work our way backwards.</p> <p>Simenon wrote about the thing that drives all of us, but that\u2019s so difficult to put into words. In this story, the judge wants words, because that\u2019s what justice is, the act of naming something. The story is about naming what we all have in common \u2013 and that\u2019s sexual attraction.</p> <p><strong>Your co-star and co-writer is a new face on screen, St\u00e9phanie Cl\u00e9au, who was your partner when you made the film.</strong><br>St\u00e9phanie comes from the theatre, she\u2019s a dramaturge and stage director. It was like a game: \u201cWhat if you played my mistress and I played your lover?\u201d The way Simenon describes her character, she\u2019s taller than [her lover], she\u2019s like a statue, she\u2019s \u201cunreadable\u201d, that\u2019s the word he uses, and that\u2019s what I get from St\u00e9phanie. I thought it would be good for the mistress to be a face people don\u2019t know \u2013 she embodies the menace of the unknown. It\u2019s like when you see criminals on TV news stories \u2013 you see their face and you think they\u2019re capable of the worst thoughts, the worst crimes.</p> <p><strong>Critics worry when film-makers don\u2019t show obvious continuity in their work, but yours is particularly unpredictable. You\u2019ve directed films about family, politics, burlesque (<em>On Tour</em>), a Corneille adaptation\u2026</strong><br>I like accepting commissions \u2013 I discover a lot of new things I didn\u2019t know about. But yes, it worries me too.</p> <p><strong>Directors often seem to ask you to play versions of themselves. You were Arnaud Desplechin\u2019s alter ego in <em>My Sex Life</em>\u2026 and his recent <em>My Golden Days</em>, and you seemed to be a version of Roman Polanski in his <em>Venus in Furs</em> \u2013 you certainly look a lot like him.</strong><br>I have Polish roots, that must be why. I think directors like to borrow my body to tell their own stories \u2013 maybe because they know I direct, so they feel something in common with me.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/179475649\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/179475649\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/179475649\">Watch the trailer for The Blue Room.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>A few years ago, you said you wanted to direct more and act less, but according to IMDb, you have eight acting credits in 2016 alone.</strong><br>No, come on\u2026 Sometimes I just turn up on set for one day because I like the director. I\u2019ve been filming [musician] John Zorn; I also did a commission for the Op\u00e9ra de Paris about the Canadian singer Barbara Hannigan \u2013 you can find it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C_RG5XTQI\">free online</a>, just type in \u201cAmalric\u201d and \u201copera\u201d. It\u2019s 15 minutes long, about a singer trying to find her voice. I decided I had to make it entirely singlehandedly, image, sound, everything. The result is so intimate it\u2019s almost sexual. And in October I start shooting a film with [ex-wife] Jeanne Balibar, about another singer called Barbara, but a French singer, just Barbara. She\u2019s a singer from the 1960s, not really known in Britain but a legend in France.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve worked with some major American directors - Julian Schnabel (</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/10/philipfrench.theobserver\"><strong><em>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</em></strong></a><strong>), Steven Spielberg (</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/munich\"><strong><em>Munich</em></strong></a><strong>), Wes Anderson (</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/09/the-grand-budapest-hotel-review-wes-anderson\"><strong><em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em></strong></a><strong>), not to mention appearing in a Bond film. Are those experiences very different to the more intimate French art films that made your reputation?</strong><br>All those films were made in Europe \u2013 Schnabel wanted to make a French film with French actors, Spielberg\u2019s is a European story shot in Budapest\u2026 They\u2019re real auteurs. Spielberg likes to do his own shooting and rewrites his script all the time on set. And the Bond film was British, there wasn\u2019t a single American technician on set. You enter into this thing and it\u2019s the scale that\u2019s scary, that\u2019s all.

When a stunt performer jumps from one crane to another, he really does it. Those guys are not joking, they\u2019re in a relationship to death that is really close to philosophy. I spent three months working with them, trying to invent the way my character would fight \u2013 and fight badly, because he doesn\u2019t really know how to.</p> <p><strong>Before you became an actor, you worked behind the camera, starting out as third assistant director to Louis Malle. Of all the film-makers you\u2019ve worked with, was there anyone in particular who gave you a special insight?</strong><br>It\u2019s a sort of patchwork. If I\u2019m writing a scene, I might suddenly think of Alain Resnais, or Alain Tanner, who took me on as his assistant, or Louis Malle, who loved documentary and fiction \u2013 he was curious about everything. The most precious thing I learned is how to be in the soul of a film. The film itself decides how it needs to be made \u2013 you\u2019re trying to guess its soul, because it doesn\u2019t exist yet. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in a dark room, projecting the film in your head \u2013 that\u2019s what Alain Resnais used to say.</p> <p><strong><em>The Blue Room</em> is being released in the UK by MUBI, first theatrically, then online. How do you feel about cinema becoming an online phenomenon?</strong><br>People keep saying that cinema\u2019s about to die, but it has a way of transforming itself all the time. I never feel like saying: \u201cIt was better before.\u201d OK, watching a film in a cinema is something different, but now people can use new tools, watch in different ways \u2013 they\u2019re even able to watch three screens at once. That\u2019s changing the grammar of cinema, it becomes like a mash-up or something. You have to take an interest \u2013 you have to use it all.</p> <p><em>The Blue Room is in cinemas from 9 September and on </em><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/the-blue-room\"><em>MUBI</em></a><em> from 25 September</em></p>",
  "<p>With every Jamie Treays album, the same feelings: I\u2019ve heard something like this before; this one\u2019s a bit overwhelming; I have no idea what he\u2019s on about; what is that weird sound?; why can\u2019t he sing properly?; did he really just say that?; I don\u2019t mind the singing on this one; I quite like that weird sound; this bit is pretty good; I\u2019ve never heard anything like that before.</p> <p>With each release, though, the singer-rapper-guitarist-producer-songwriter grows more impressive. His last, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/28/jamie-t-carry-on-grudge-review-motormouth-quiet-zone\" title=\"\"><em>Carry on the Grudge</em></a>, had some good songs but was a touch tidy and conventional, a step away from the junkyard rap-pop pioneered on his first two albums. <em>Trick</em> takes a little from all three and re-establishes Jamie T as a one-man genre, even when he\u2019s paying loud homage to influences such as the Clash and Blur.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trick feels more celebratory than melancholy, mostly because of the bruising passion Treays loads into every bar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some will mourn the disappearance of London as a backdrop, and there are fewer slang-stuffed tales of after-hours drinking and drugging. But Treays\u2019s demotic-poetic rap verses resurface, all allusion, alliteration and internal rhyming, pulling language into unpredictable shapes. As always, he has song-title characters, now more mythic and historical than previously. No more Sheila, Peter, Ike and Tina; instead we get Joan of Arc, Robin Hood and 17th-century Cassandra of London Solomon Eagle, as Treays aims for ambitious, state-of-the-nation themes with the usual dose of self-laceration.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t always work \u2013 he\u2019s said he constructs verses in couplets rather than structure the entire lyric, which hobbles some songs. The best tune, Power Over Men, is a beautifully jaunty crooner slightly betrayed by its words. If you\u2019re feeling generous, it\u2019s a lovelorn lament, but it runs the risk of sourly reducing a woman to her attractiveness to men, then suggests that this \u201cgift\u201d is cursed anyway as \u201cshe can never really kiss/ \u2019cause there\u2019s never a risk\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQXJQn8LZg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dEQXJQn8LZg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/dEQXJQn8LZg\">Watch Jamie T\u2019s video for Power Over Men.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s quite a trick that the album doesn\u2019t feel as oppressive as it should. There are several references to suicide, with one chorus warning: \u201cIf I had a gun, I would blow my brains out.\u201d Lead single, the urgent, brooding <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TElBPcFIk0E\" title=\"\">Tinfoil Boy</a>, uses broad but brutal strokes to suggest a drug user slowly sliding from view, and arena-friendly new-wave chugger Tescoland is a mildly satirical celebration of parochialism. Police Tapes ends with Treays viciously spitting: \u201cI never felt so low\u201d repeatedly over a meaty hunk of PiL-ish metallic dub-rock.</p> <p>Yet <em>Trick</em> feels more celebratory than melancholy, mostly because of the bruising passion and commitment Treays loads into every syllable, every bar. It\u2019s only the closing song, Self Esteem, where the confidence runs dry and he opens up a vein of vulnerability. It\u2019s desperately sad and beautiful, a little bloom finally poking through the concrete.</p>",

A record already hailed in early reviews (\u201c[it] brims with a staunchly good-hearted, quietly emotional desire to communicate something true,\u201d says <em>Uncut</em>), it comes after 27 years of them being considered British rock\u2019s unluckiest nearly-men \u2013 the friends of Nirvana who had <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/hot-band-19920514\">huge critical acclaim in America in the early 90s</a> but missed out on mainstream success; the makers of some of the best records of the Britpop era with only a handful of significant chart positions (1995\u2019s <em>Grand Prix</em> made No 7, 1997\u2019s <em>Songs from Northern Britain</em>, No 3).</p> <p><em>Here</em>\u2019s title is plain-speaking and wistful, and also suggests a sense of permanence about place. But the band hasn\u2019t had anything like that for years. It was named by a Canadian (Norman Blake\u2019s wife of 20 years, Krista, with whom he has lived in Ontario since 2009), begun in rural Provence, mixed in Hamburg, and finished in Glasgow, where the band\u2019s story began nearly three decades ago.</p> <p><em>Here</em> doesn\u2019t divert from TFC\u2019s long-established style, but what style it is: mid-paced guitar-pop taken somewhere divine. It has wide-eyed, wonder-seeking melodies, lyrics that roll in bliss or bruise with their tenderness, and pitch-perfect, west coast-influenced harmonies from its three singer-songwriters, Norman Blake, Gerry Love and Raymond McGinley.</p> <p>The trio play today alongside drummer Francis Macdonald and keyboardist Dave McGowan, but they have shared writing duties equally since their highest-charting album, 1997\u2019s <em>Songs from Northern Britain</em> (this is the fifth record in a row where each of them has four songs apiece). But while they have always hovered around melancholy, <em>Here</em>\u2019s lyrics appear darker and sadder, seemingly about the gnawing desire to escape, about desperation in life\u2019s toughest moments. It is about TFC getting on and growing older, and trying to make sense of that in song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"caffa2806decd82853ca62a4ec4a2434df5efcca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caffa2806decd82853ca62a4ec4a2434df5efcca/0_0_1960_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teenage Fanclub in 1997 (l-r): Norman Blake, Raymond McGinley, Gerry Love and former drummer Paul Quinn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"981\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teenage Fanclub in 1997 (l-r): Norman Blake, Raymond McGinley, Gerry Love and former drummer Paul Quinn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Double/Camera Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Glasgow\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.transeuropecafe.co.uk/\">Trans Europe Caf\u00e9</a>, August 2016.

They never looked to fit in with any general scene: in their sound as well as their attitude, they\u2019ve always been a band looking out, not looking in. \u201cGlasgow transcends Scotland, really,\u201d explains McGinley, a chicken panini, salad and crisps arriving in front of him. \u201cGood cities always do \u2013 they\u2019re not about nationalism. They\u2019re about becoming a little centre of the universe.\u201d</p> <p>McGinley was born in Maryhill, north Glasgow, in 1964, and has lived in Pollokshields to the south since 1992. His father did many jobs, he explains \u2013 demolition worker, bus driver, cigarette-machine fixer \u2013 while his mother was a school cleaner, made redundant in 1990 when the service was privatised. Her redundancy money played a vital part in TFC history, though, as it helped fund a trip to America that same year, when they were just breaking through. (She\u2019s 78 now, and loyally attends homecoming gigs.)</p> <p>McGinley was also the band\u2019s de facto manager from day one, negotiating early deals with British label Paperhouse and Matador in the US, before bigger guns \u2013 Alan McGee\u2019s Creation in the UK, and Geffen in the US \u2013 came on board for 1991\u2019s career-defining <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/07608-teenage-fanclub-bandwagonesque\"><em>Bandwagonesque</em></a>, their third LP. The yellow moneybag on its cover, on an acid-pink background, says a lot about their sly humour. \u201cI remember still living in the council flat with my mum and dad at that time,\u201d McGinley remembers. \u201cFour floors up, talking to our New York lawyer on the phone, him wanting to send me a fax, and me saying we didn\u2019t have a fax, him expecting me to go out and buy one.\u201d He laughs, gently. \u201cHe didn\u2019t realise we didn\u2019t have any money.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scottishness might be a part of the sadness - all those ballads and laments and airs</p> <footer> <cite>Norman Blake</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McGinley is the band\u2019s introvert, famously restrained up on stage, but when he talks about the music that shaped his childhood, he can\u2019t stop \u2013 and the roots of the romance of Teenage Fanclub bud here. There was the friend of his father who lent him records by Doris Day and Tommy Steele when he was eight (\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe his headphones! I\u2019d be sitting in the corner of the room listening again and again while my family watched television\u201d) and the towerblock landing where a friend\u2019s brother would sell him albums as a teenager (\u201cwe wouldn\u2019t go in, though \u2013 that felt too intrusive\u201d). Everyone liked Pink Floyd back then, he says, but not the Syd Barrett era, which McGinley found odd. \u201cI never got that there was music you shouldn\u2019t like. The Syd records made me feel something, so I kept listening to him.\u201d</p> <p>Music\u2019s ability to stir up feelings inspired his songwriting later, McGinley admits \u2013 and this lies at the heart of Teenage Fanclub\u2019s power as a whole band. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you should write for other people \u2013 you really shouldn\u2019t, you should write for yourself \u2013 but you are definitely trying to affect something in other people when you write.\u201d</p> <p>From their first single, 1990\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/14/teenage-fanclub-everything-flows\">Everything Flows</a>, TFC were dealing in the shared emotional acknowledgement of the passing of time (\u201cYou get older every year/ But you don\u2019t change/ Or I don\u2019t notice you\u2019re changing\u201d). By their breakthrough single, 1991\u2019s The Concept, they were creating fully-formed relatable characters (\u201cShe wears denim wherever she goes\u2026\u201d) that we love, then we lose (\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you\u2026 oh yeah\u201d). Decades later, that song was used prominently in Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody\u2019s 2011 indie film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/05/young-adult-review-philip-french\"><em>Young Adult</em></a>, Charlize Theron singing along to it as she drives out into the world, into sunshine, and into her history in the opening credits. TFC\u2019s songs are full of the emotional resonance of that journey between adolescence and adulthood \u2013 and then its memory, still sparkling on some distant horizon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3584668b9097a4897958f23218e8191b7fd8183c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3584668b9097a4897958f23218e8191b7fd8183c/0_560_3660_4572/801.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Blake on stage, 1992.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Blake on stage, 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s an extra element of underdog emotion in the Teenage Fanclub narrative, that idea that they\u2019ve <a href=\"link: http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/27146/teenage-fanclub\">never had the mainstream success</a> many believe they deserve. (\u201cAlthough as a bit of received wisdom, it\u2019s not a bad one to have,\u201d McGinley smiles.)</p> <p>The details of this are impressive. <em>Bandwagonesque</em> beat REM\u2019s <em>Out of Time</em> and My Bloody Valentine\u2019s <em>Loveless</em> to become Spin Magazine\u2019s No 1 album of 1991 (they still play in the US off the back of that 25-year-old record, McGinley says, although it only had minimal commercial success over there).</p> <p>They were Alan McGee\u2019s favourite band on Creation when Oasis were huge, with even Liam Gallagher proclaiming that they were the world\u2019s second-best band behind, oh, wait, yes, his own. Their album <em>Grand Prix</em> (1995) still plays like a collection of huge, radio-polished singles as well, although it only poked its nose into the top 10 for a week.</p> <p>In a 1991 <em>NME</em> interview, McGinley enthused about TFC playing huge gigs (\u201cwe quite fancy playing stadiums\u201d), but that comment wasn\u2019t about being famous, he stresses today. \u201cA gig is something of substance \u2013 that\u2019s 2,000 people enjoying your music. When people say, \u2018Oh, stadium gigs are terrible\u2026\u2019\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThey\u2019re the dream. It\u2019s all the other bullshit that\u2019s rubbish \u2013 the videos, the campaign strategy.\u201d</p> <p>This is something Love agrees with when we meet him across town half an hour later. TFC\u2019s apparent failures were the making of them, he says, and the reason why they still succeed as a band.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIE9NmviSQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KLIE9NmviSQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIE9NmviSQ\">Watch Teenage Fanclub performing Star Sign in 1991.</a> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>December 1993, San Francisco. Tony Bennett is on stage, singing his signature song about leaving his heart in the city. People in the audience are welling up, weeping, sobbing.

He is a sweet soul, the pale blue eyes that made him TFC\u2019s closest thing to a heartthrob still piercingly pretty. \u201cThe day Tony Bennett supported us,\u201d McGinley sighs. \u201cHe was very gracious,\u201d Love adds. Both talk happily about their brushes with bigger stars. TFC were friends with Nirvana before the latter got huge; they would wash their smalls at Krist Novoselic\u2019s house when they played in Seattle, and both fondly remember hanging out with Novoselic and Dave Grohl one afternoon in Sweden: \u201cI remember Dave insisted we go to the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 to look at some Abba memorabilia,\u201d Love beams.</p> <p>Grohl also asked TFC to support the Foo Fighters in Manchester last summer, which they did \u2013 they were very touched. \u201cBut most of [the crowd] that night were staring at us, confused,\u201d says McGinley. \u201cThat brings you back down a bit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"84a5883369788407642ba35f597ed837e4a3513d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a5883369788407642ba35f597ed837e4a3513d/0_0_550_755/364.jpg\" alt=\"Teenage Fanclub on the cover of NME in 1992.\" width=\"364\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teenage Fanclub on the cover of NME in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NME</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>TFC settled into being a support band rather happily in the 90s, though, Love bounces back. They supported Radiohead in the US in 1997, when OK Computer was colossal; both bands hit it off, and got obsessed with playing golf, finding courses around every venue. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a support band, you can have a holiday,\u201d Love says delightedly.</p> <p>Music transported Love in other ways throughout his life. The third of eight children, his early memories include the family piano being taken away by the council, and the music of the Everly Brothers playing through his small house (\u201cthose harmonies still influence my songs\u201d). He was born the same year that the huge Ravenscraig steel plant opened in Motherwell, to Glasgow\u2019s south-east. He lived in its shadows, and you see images of it juxtaposed with sunny American beaches in the video to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdeqYx-9-AQ\">Ain\u2019t That Enough</a>, which became TFC\u2019s biggest hit to date in 1997. Ravenscraig had been closed down in 1992, and its huge cooling towers were blown up in 1996. \u201cHere is a sunrise,\u201d went the beautiful chorus, \u201cAin\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p> <p>Those towers would also appear on the cover of their 2003 greatest hits album, <em>Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds</em>, Blake, Love and McGinley standing on a wide, sandy beach looking at a picture of them. Love is warmly reflective about those times. \u201cWe don\u2019t travel as far as we think we do from the music we like as children, really, do we? I still like to keep in touch with the wee guy I was who wrote my first songs.\u201d</p> <p>Love\u2019s also had a solo project in recent years, under the name Lightships; 2012\u2019s Electric Cables was a beautiful, forever-young album. (McGinley and Blake have embarked on collaborations, the former playing with Glasgow folk-rock band Snowgoose, the latter forming a duo with US indie musician, Joe Pernice, The New Mendicants; still, they are not \u201cgetting back together as Teenage Fanclub to make money\u201d, McGinley insists. \u201cIf we did that, we\u2019d be meeting up every 18 months.\u201d)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/09/teenage-fanclub-10-of-the-best\">Teenage Fanclub \u2013 10 of the best</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, he\u2019s content to wander around Hyndland in Glasgow\u2019s West End, where he lives with his Spanish partner, and just get on with things, though. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to just go down to Morrison\u2019s and see what\u2019s on the fish counter. I am! I\u2019m nearly 50! That\u2019s my excitement these days.\u201d</p> <p>Teenage Fanclub\u2019s late-period albums have all had their sombre moments: songs that cut you to the quick such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5Oq0T_bqig\">If I Never See You Again</a> (from 2000\u2019s <em>Howdy)</em> \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019ve only got a lifetime\u201d, it sighs, Fallen Leaves (from 2005\u2019s lovely <em>Man-Made</em>), and Dark Clouds (<em>Shadows</em>, 2010). But <em>Here</em> feels even more plaintive and sad, and occasionally crackles with anger. When McGinley writes, \u201cI don\u2019t hear much fanfare for the common man these days,\u201d on one of his tracks, I Was Beautiful When I Was Alive, he\u2019s commenting on how seemingly liberal people easily deride those less lucky than them (\u201cwhen people call others \u2018neds\u2019\u2026 I just think, hey, that was me 30 years ago,\u201d he says). Blake\u2019s songs feel even blacker. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dark as a knife, out of luck, out of life,\u201d goes Live in the Moment. \u201cThere is pain in this world/ I can see it in your eyes/ And it\u2019s so hard to stay alive/ At the edge of the night,\u201d goes the otherwise chirpy I\u2019m in Love.</p> <p>Blake remains relentlessly chirpy in person, however, as he has always been in his band, speaking on the phone on a sweltering afternoon from Kitchener, Ontario. We go over territory discussed with his bandmates and he\u2019s soon gushing away: the son of two newsagents brought up in Belshill, south of Glasgow, he grew up happy because he could read comics, he says (\u201clike the <em>Dandy</em> and the <em>Beano</em> \u2013 and <em>Bunty</em>, of course \u2013 they were all free!\u201d). He also remembers key people from the 80s Scottish indie scene with obvious tenderness. \u201cI saw Bobby [Gillespie] on his bike in Primrose Hill a few years back, and stopped him \u2013 it was brilliant. I still remember him really young, with his haircut, and his bag, in little record shops in town, like it was yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>He also remembers fondly Teenage Fanclub\u2019s high times in the 90s. He tells a story about being drunk backstage with Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood and Marilyn Manson: \u201cAnd I\u2019m all throwing my arm around old Marilyn: \u2018Haway there, big man! Haway, big fella!\u2019 Then he said to Jonny, \u2018What are you doing tomorrow? There\u2019s this great little place I know in the village for dinner.\u2019 I thought it was hilarious! A great little place for dinner! Marilyn Manson!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDOLKSp2AWU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDOLKSp2AWU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDOLKSp2AWU\">Watch the video for Teenage Fanclub\u2019s I\u2019m in Love.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He acknowledges that there is a sadder, darker strain to TFC now \u2013 but believes it\u2019s always been there. \u201cI think Scottishness might be a part of it \u2013 those ballads and laments and airs that were around when we were kids.\u201d Age also has its effects on their writing, he says. \u201cOur guitar tech\u2019s 65, and he keeps saying how invisible you become to younger people as you get older, and he\u2019s right. Plus you experience death more, and illness. And you just don\u2019t do things you did when you were a young rock\u2019n\u2019roller.\u201d</p> <p>He checks himself for a moment. \u201cI guess not if you\u2019re Mick Jagger, though. He\u2019s having a baby, isn\u2019t he? Bloody hell.\u201d Broad laughter. \u201cI guess because the Stones were famous at 20, they\u2019re still acting like they\u2019re 20. We were never famous, so we\u2019re still getting old.\u201d</p> <p>Fatherhood has also influenced Blake, as the only dad in the band; his daughter Rowan is 20 now, about to return to Glasgow to attend university. She likes the Velvet Underground, and he saw the band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/24/alvvays-alvvays-album-review\">Alvvays</a> with her recently, which he found fascinating. \u201cThe fact that bands of her age play music influenced by the early 1990s, and the times we were in\u2026\u201d He tails off. \u201cBut maybe it was the same for us, making music influenced by the mid-to-late 60s. Maybe that\u2019s when our stories start in our heads. Or we long for those times when we first connected to those feelings.\u201d</p> <p>When Teenage Fanclub get back together, it always feels good, Blake admits. In a typical first hour together, they\u2019ll talk for 40 minutes and play for 20, but then the music will take over. McGinley, Love and Blake will have brought songs ready in melody, but the lyrics will only become fully-formed when they are together, wherever they are. They\u2019re \u201cobviously influencing each other in that way, and needing each other in that way\u201d, Blake says, plainly, but wistfully. Those words land, join and communicate, and a 27-year-old story carries on.</p> <p>Teenage Fanclub are here, then, after all: in a certain breathtaking familiarity of feeling, in that moment between then and now. \u201cIt\u2019s a place we can\u2019t help coming back to,\u201d Blake says, with obvious joy. \u201cIt\u2019s the place we all know.\u201d</p> <p><em>Here is out on PeMa Records on Friday.

After one extended \u2013 plug is not the word here \u2013 extemporisation on anal sex, specifically the bizarre male predilection for same, Schumer turned to carefully catch the Playhouse\u2019s spotlight silhouetting her in a halo. She\u2019s not the Messiah, just a very naughty girl. Here\u2019s to very naughty, very clever girls.</p>",
  "<p>When the 1960s began, I was in the sixth form of a run-down private school on the Isle of Wight with no prospect of going to university and no thought that my future could be any less miserable and monotonous than my past. When they ended \u2013 literally, in December 1969 \u2013 I was on tour with Eric Clapton.</p> <p>In those days before interviewers were dogged by protective PRs, I travelled with Clapton and his band (soon to metamorphose into Derek and the Dominos), hung out with them between gigs and watched every show from the wings. At the back of the stage, unnoticed by their audience, stood a bearded extra guitarist in a buckskin jacket and Stetson hat. It was George Harrison, whom Clapton had invited on the tour to escape the trauma of the Beatles\u2019 breakup and get used to playing live again after years shut away in the recording studio. Sixties memories like that can still make me close my eyes and whistle through my teeth.</p> <p>Many more will be stirring this autumn \u2013 and not only thanks to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. This month sees the London premiere of <em>Eight Days a Week</em>, a documentary about the Beatles\u2019 touring years, 1963-66, directed by Ron Howard. Hard on its Cuban heels, two more books about the 1960s will join the pile to which I myself have contributed more than my share.

At regular intervals since the mid-80s, glossy magazines have announced that the 60s are back with fashion spreads of Paisley fabrics, Mary Quant-ish bobs, shorter-than-ever miniskirts and elastic-sided chelsea boots. Sixties pop music eternally dominates radio playlists while its most notorious band, the Rolling Stones, though now withered old-age pensioners, are still widely reckoned the coolest, most dangerous dudes on the planet.</p> <p>Much of the worship, of course, comes from the surviving participants, those one-time flower children who in some cases went on to be wealthy industrialists or media moguls and, in others, sad gits with grey ponytails. But the 60s\u2019 most fervent acolytes tend to be people who never experienced them first-hand, yet still yearn for them in a syndrome that psychologists call \u201cnostalgia without memory\u201d. (Tony Blair\u2019s concept of Cool Britannia in the 90s, for instance, pastiched the swinging London of 30 years earlier, right down to the union jack carrier bags.) In popular memory they live on as a rosy blur of psychedelic colour, sexual permissiveness and Beatles music, their complexity and manifold horrors (the Kennedy assassination, the Vietnam war, the Moors murders, the ever-present threat of global nuclear war, to name just a few) either unrealised or disregarded.</p> <p>I\u2019m thought of as an expert on the period, thanks to my books about the Beatles and the Stones, but actually I consider myself somewhat of an imposter. I didn\u2019t make it to swinging London until after the 60s\u2019 halfway point when, many sensed then and historians now say, its best was already over. Latecomer or not, my life was to be transformed beyond the wildest dreams I\u2019d never had.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddf450be6259701f19b76b41fd3e4116889becc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddf450be6259701f19b76b41fd3e4116889becc3/429_449_2138_1282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rolling Stones in 1967: once the most dangerous men on the planet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rolling Stones in 1967: once the most dangerous men on the planet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had left school and the Isle of Wight aged 18 to become an \u201ceditorial apprentice\u201d on a weekly newspaper on the fringes of East Anglia. I therefore missed out completely on London\u2019s first phase of totally unexpected fashionability, which was mainly about film and theatre and the first satire worthy of the name since the 18th century. On my second day at work, a vicar from whom I was soliciting news informed me kindly I had no chance of getting to Fleet Street without a university degree. I had already despaired of joining the stripe-shirted Oxbridge satirists currently flaying Harold Macmillan\u2019s clapped-out Tory government on BBC TV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/nov/26/that-was-the-week-that-was-review-1962\" title=\"\"><em>That Was the Week That Was</em></a>, at Peter Cook\u2019s Establishment club or in the newly founded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/11/private-eye-50\" title=\"\"><em>Private Eye</em></a>. An obvious vain hope on my measly two A-levels.</p> <p>Shackled to my boring round of funerals and whist drives, I watched from afar as the Beatles appeared on the Royal Variety Performance in 1963, sending entrenched class barriers tumbling, and then in 1964 as they left on their first trip to America, the point where the decade really exploded. I could only read in the new Sunday colour supplements about what seemed to follow in their wake; the sudden concerted burst of youthful creativity in fashion, art, photography and graphics. All the new mega-celebrities \u2013 David Bailey, Twiggy, Julie Christie, Rita Tushingham, Tom Courtenay, Terence Stamp \u2013 were my age or a little older and seemed to congregate in the same, unpublicised clubs and bistros; the most emblematic pop single, among so many, was Dobie Gray\u2019s The \u201cIn\u201d Crowd.</p> <p>In 1966, <em>Time</em> magazine dubbed London the style capital of Europe, bringing hordes of young Americans across the Atlantic intent on meeting the Beatles and, maybe, the Queen. From then on, the 60s became industrialised; the \u201cin\u201d crowd was everyone. Even the snack bar around the corner from my Newcastle upon Tyne bedsit put a sticker in its window saying JOIN THE SANDWICH SET. By then I was 22 and a reporter on a north-eastern daily paper but no aspirations beyond, if I was very lucky, the <em>Guardian\u2019s </em>Manchester office. Each weekend, I devoured the <em>Sunday Times</em> <em>Magazine</em> with its ads for Scandinavian furniture, stereo systems and white Kosset carpets that were part of the new \u201cswinging\u201d ethos, as were its recipes for exotic dishes like chicken kiev and beef stroganoff using quantities of butter and cream that in the very recent war and postwar years would have seemed downright immoral.</p> <p>Hugely wealthy from its advertising revenues, the magazine viewed itself as a stand-alone international title on the same level as <em>Life</em> or <em>Paris-Match</em>, employing a galaxy of top international photographers headed by the Queen\u2019s brother-in-law Lord Snowdon (classless or what?) and including Bailey, Don McCullin, Terry O\u2019Neill, Eve Arnold and Diane Arbus. From opulent sales pitches for After Eight mints or Smirnoff vodka, you\u2019d turn to running spreads of Glasgow slums or the Biafra famine or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/02/girl-vietnam-napalm-photo-peace\" title=\"\">Napalm-scalded child victims</a> of the Vietnam war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60de2235d86636cfc33377ecde7f5845764f71e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60de2235d86636cfc33377ecde7f5845764f71e5/0_235_5456_3274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Biba shop in Kensington in the 1960s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the Biba shop in Kensington in the 1960s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alain Le Garsmeur/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201cquality\u201d Sunday papers, above all, were known to recruit only from Oxbridge. But in 1966, in a quintessentially 60s moment, The <em>Sunday Times</em> magazine announced a talent contest for writers under 23. I just met the age qualification and sent in a 2,000-word profile of my wicked, irresistible old Grandma Norman, who used to sell seaside rock on Ryde Esplanade. I won the competition and was rewarded with a job as a staff writer at a stupefying \u00a330 per week.</p> <p>Thus I made my belated arrival in London in June 1966. The Beach Boys\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/31/three-albums-1966-beatles-revolver-bob-dylan-blonde-on-blonde-beach-boys-pet-sounds\" title=\"\"><em>Pet Sounds</em></a><em> </em>album had just been released and the Beatles\u2019 <em>Revolver</em> was soon to be. The weather was continuously glorious; Chelsea\u2019s King\u2019s Road thronged with boys in Victorian military tunics and \u201cdolly birds\u201d in wasp-striped minidresses and floppy hats; the new Post Office tower, which then had a revolving gourmet restaurant at its summit, glittered thrillingly on the skyline.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, England won the World Cup. I was outside the Royal Garden hotel in Kensington when the victorious team appeared on its balcony with the Labour prime minister Harold Wilson, taking a break from economic problems as bad as today\u2019s (another aspect of the 60s no one wants to know about). Later, I went to one of the parties held every night throughout South Ken\u2019s and Earls Court\u2019s bedsitter lands. You didn\u2019t have to be invited: you just walked in. Some people made a living out of stealing from the heaps of coats left on beds.</p> <p>During the evening, I heard one wasp-striped minidress ask another if she and her boyfriend would be going on to the Guys and Dolls coffee bar in Chelsea. \u201cNo,\u201d was the reply. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bed. Honestly, I\u2019m feeling so-o randy tonight.\u201d Quite a change from my late Newcastle girlfriend\u2019s stern injunction: \u201cGerroff, ya booger.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing better illustrates the 60s\u2019 phenomenal indulgence of youth than my career on the <em>Sunday Times </em>magazine. When I arrived, the newspaper was sponsoring Sir Francis Chichester\u2019s first solo circumnavigation of the world in his ketch, Gipsy Moth IV. My first assignment was to interview him before his departure. Coming from the Isle of Wight I was presumed to know about yachting, although throughout my childhood on Ryde pier I\u2019d never set foot in a sailboat. My maiden voyage was with Chichester as he tried out Gipsy Moth in the Solent, just off my former home. I next went to Oxford to talk to a former professor of Anglo-Saxon named JRR Tolkien, whose books about hobbits and elves had thus far sold mainly on American college campuses.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Under Godfrey, life was a constant round of champagne parties and dinners and lunches at his favourite restaurants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A year later, I was given a first-class Air France ticket and $1,000 of travellers\u2019 cheques and sent to America on a dream assignment: drive Route 66 in a Ford Mustang from Chicago to LA for a 5,000-word cover story, then write about Harlem\u2019s Apollo theatre, see James Brown on stage and meet Big Mama Thornton and Screaming Jay Hawkins. For my stay in New York, I was booked into the Algonquin hotel, famous haunt of James Thurber, Dorothy Parker and the <em>New Yorker</em> wits. As I sat in the lobby in my Take 6 suit, kipper tie and Anello &amp; Davide boots, a judge and his wife from Cincinnati, Ohio, told me that they\u2019d seen all my movies and would be honoured if I\u2019d have dinner with them. They were too nice to tell me who they thought I was; I didn\u2019t ask and we passed a pleasant evening that provided my first-ever taste of green pasta.</p> <p>Like William Boot in Evelyn Waugh\u2019s <em>Scoop</em>, I\u2019d pictured Fleet Street as a place where \u201cneurotic men in shirtsleeves and eyeshades \u2026 rushed from telephone to tape machine, insulting and betraying each other in surroundings of unredeemed squalor\u201d. That was not how things were on the <em>Sunday Times </em>magazine. Picture the Ghost of Christmas Present in Dickens\u2019s <em>A Christmas Carol </em>\u2013 that portly, guffawing figure, seated on a heap of turkeys, strings of sausages and crackers \u2013 and you have a fair idea of my new editor, Godfrey Smith. Under Godfrey, life was a constant round of champagne parties and lunches and dinners at his favourite restaurants, Chez Victor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/09/mario-cassandro-obituary\" title=\"\">Mario and Franco\u2019s La Terrazza</a> and the Gay Hussar. While it didn\u2019t teach me much about writing, it taught me to open champagne, smoke only Havana cigars and guiltlessly enjoy what Godfrey called \u201cNooners\u201d \u2013 lunch with a female companion, then the rest of the afternoon in bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a98965fe69bc04db23b3c760374db877f5064d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a98965fe69bc04db23b3c760374db877f5064d6/114_35_1218_1521/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Snowdon, portrait photographer to the stars of the decade.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Snowdon, portrait photographer to the stars of the decade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Myers/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the first week of December, work virtually stopped for a sequence of pre-Christmas treats including a trip to the Oxford&#xa0;v Cambridge varsity rugby match (when I rooted for Cambridge as fervently as if I\u2019d been there) and a lunch at which executives entertained their secretaries with the thinly disguised objective of Nooners to follow. Our office Christmas party was an occasion to which all London\u2019s in-crowd fought for invitations, and might well contain Lord Snowdon in one corner and the East End gangster Reggie Kray in another. We would push all the desks together, then dance on top of them, Godfrey leading the measure.</p> <p>When I tell young journalists about the expenses, they simply don\u2019t believe me. These you drew in advance with a pink slip which any magazine colleague could countersign; then you took it to a cashier\u2019s window from which old big, blue \u00a35 notes were unquestioningly shovelled out. From the (never challenged) accounts we submitted, the business manager Bill Cater once offered an \u201cExpenseman of the Year\u201d award. It was won by my office-mate James Fox \u2013 later author of <em>White Mischief</em>, and Keith Richards\u2019s ghostwriter \u2013 for an entry reading simply: \u201cTaxi, there. And back.\u201d</p> <p>The magazine\u2019s huge profits in fact subsidised the paper, which led to as much mutual dislike and suspicion as between old East and West Berlin. Our black-and-white colleagues thought us all drunkards and sexual perverts while we referred to them contemptuously as \u201cthe Steam Section\u201d. The paper\u2019s then proprietor, Lord Thomson, was the most benign ever known; so long as the ad revenues kept rolling in, even our worst editorial blunders and bungles received no word of censure. Far from dreading the sack, we had the job security of monks illuminating manuscripts in some medieval cloister.</p> <p>Godfrey was not answerable to the Steam Section\u2019s editor, the dynamic Harry Evans, but directly to Lord T through his chief executive, CD Hamilton (which explains why subsequent <em>ST</em> editors have wanted to make their mark on the magazine rather than the paper). We did whatever we pleased, without any regard to topicality, the PR machine or, indeed, our readers.</p> <p>In 1968, Godfrey decided to profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/23/elizabeth-taylor-obituary\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> for no other reason than she was the world\u2019s biggest celebrity and most beautiful woman. Such was the magazine\u2019s prestige that she was instantly at our disposal. Godfrey was to have written the 5,000-word cover piece himself, but when the research was all in, he decided he couldn\u2019t face it and handed the job over to me.</p> <p>I spent two days interviewing Taylor and her husband, Richard Burton, in the Austrian Alps, where Burton was filming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/06/geoff-dyer-where-eagles-dare\" title=\"\"><em>Where Eagles Dare </em></a>\u2013 as usual without a PR in sight. I rode with them in their limo, carried their pet Pekinese around, had dinner with them at their hotel, then sat up drinking brandy with Burton, who still wore his Nazi officer\u2019s uniform from the day\u2019s filming. A drunken American expat joined us uninvited and when Burton told him to fuck off, he pulled a handgun. The tense situation was alleviated when Elizabeth Taylor came downstairs in her nightdress (pink chiffon) to see what all the noise was about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96cf0243f19633b5019450bf760eb7d2cc57b639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96cf0243f19633b5019450bf760eb7d2cc57b639/0_72_2280_1368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Famous friends: Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Famous friends: Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I never took holidays because every day was like one. After work, if there was no champagne party in the office, I\u2019d go to a club: the UFO in Tottenham Court Road to see Pink Floyd or Soft Machine, the Speakeasy, off Regent Street, where you entered, Narnia-like, through a glass wardrobe door, or Revolution in Bruton Place where Christine Keeler, the woman who brought down the Macmillan government, danced alone every night.</p> <p>Swinging London\u2019s great charm was that three quarters of it wasn\u2019t swinging yet; exploitation of its youthful swingers was still at a minimum. Dinner for two in a bistro cost around \u00a33.50. At my friend Barbara Hulanicki\u2019s Biba boutique in Kensington Church Street, the stuff was so reasonable that the lowest-paid office worker could afford a new outfit every week, trying it on in the communal changing-room with the likes of Cilla Black, Julie Christie or Cher.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t partake of everything in the sensory smorgasbord. I seldom encountered pot (other than in the magazine\u2019s art department) and was never offered LSD. My first and only line of cocaine didn\u2019t come until the early 1980s, albeit through the good offices of a 60s icon, Marianne Faithfull.</p> <p>Nor did I get into eastern religion following the Beatles\u2019 example or join the hippies, who arrived post-1966. I would rather have swallowed hemlock than grown a beard, worn a kaftan, burned a joss stick or murmured \u201clove and peace\u201d in the peculiar, teeth-clenching flower-child accent whose last living practitioner seems to be Sir Richard Branson. But, naive and deluded though they may have been, the hippies\u2019 festivals, love-ins and \u201chappenings\u201d brought hundreds of thousands together without the slightest violence; there were moments when even a cynic like me wondered if they might really be a force for changing the world for the better.</p> <p>Normally, people are impatient to get out of an old decade and into a new one, but not those of us for whom the 60s had turned into a non-stop party. Their final year brought a series of epic open-air festivals \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2016/jul/11/woodstock-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Woodstock</a>, Bob Dylan at the Isle of Wight, the Stones\u2019 free concert in Hyde Park \u2013 as if to squeeze the very most from every second. The Beatles had clearly been falling apart for months but the finale couldn\u2019t come, one felt, so long as 1969 were kept alive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d13b0750e6a7410c9cfde49d06b3b7a9579f761\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d13b0750e6a7410c9cfde49d06b3b7a9579f761/0_133_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinging on to the 60s spirit: the Woodstock festival in 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clinging on to the 60s spirit: the Woodstock festival in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elliott Landy/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019d never considered writing anything substantial about the Beatles: too many people were already doing it and the magazine, for all its trendiness, had an odd blind spot about pop music. But now an American magazine asked me to look into their troubled business organisation, Apple Corps, and their new American manager, Allen Klein, who had apparently caused the fatal rift between John Lennon and Paul McCartney.</p> <p>Though on this occasion I was moonlighting for New York\u2019s <em>Show </em>magazine, my <em>Sunday Times </em>credentials opened every door as always. The Beatles\u2019 press officer Derek Taylor allowed me to hang around Apple\u2019s offices at 3 Savile Row for several weeks pretty much as I pleased. I spent a morning with Lennon and Yoko Ono in their office, sat in on a George Harrison photoshoot, chatted to Ringo as he ate egg and chips, even got to meet the terrifying Klein. With McCartney already in self-imposed exile in Scotland, it became clear that the band was disintegrating under my nose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/paul-mccartney-the-biography-philip-norman-linda-beatles-lennon-wings\">Paul McCartney: The Biography by Philip Norman \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1969 I also returned to America to interview Charles Atlas, the strong man, in Florida and 87-year-old PG Wodehouse at his home on Long Island.

I came home on the newly launched QE2, travelling first class, as I explained to Godfrey, \u201cso that I\u2019ll have time to think about what I\u2019m going to write\u201d. Wodehouse sent me a box of cigars as a \u201csailing gift\u201d and \u2013 sweet man! \u2013 a dust-jacket quote for my debut novel, which had just been accepted by the first publisher to which it was offered.</p> <p>Back in London, Lord Snowdon had been assigned to photograph Eric Clapton for my profile.

Music was very accessible for me. It was something that I picked up super-quick.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to resist it for a while. In his early teens, he \u201cstopped regarding music as such an adamant passion \u2013 skateboarding took over\u201d. But music soon reinstated itself, and at 15 he decided to throw all his energies into pursuing it as a career.</p> <p>Since then, Collins, who grew up in the city of Evanston, north of Chicago, has been honing his skills as a rapper and producer \u2013 and his debut album, Nat Love, which came out last April, suggests he made the right move. A confident, engaging record, it tips a cap to the local hip-hop scene but draws inspiration from all over \u2013 Tame Impala and Black Sabbath were influences as well as Kanye West and Chance the Rapper. Collins produced most of the album himself, and its <strong>hazy, </strong>soulful sound complements his delivery, which can shift from laidback introspection to complex wordplay in a beat.</p> <p>The title refers to a black folk hero from the old west; one track, Death of a Salesman, nods to both Arthur Miller and Edgar Allan Poe. Was Collins an attentive student? \u201cNo, I was really bad,\u201d he says, wincing. His mind was elsewhere. \u201cI can make all my music in my bedroom. Which is nice, but it\u2019s also really distracting and it took its toll [on school work]. Graduating was definitely a relief.\u201d</p> <p>Collins still lives at home in Evanston and seems perfectly happy there, but he\u2019ll probably move to Chicago soon to be closer to his record label (he signed to Closed Sessions in March 2015, just before graduating).

Born in Ripon, North Yorkshire, Marten was eight when her mother suggested she record some songs so they could send them to her grandparents in France via YouTube.</p> <p>Four years and numerous grandparents-only videos later, Marten was asked by popular YouTube channel <a href=\"http://www.ontsofa.com\">Ont\u2019 Sofa</a> to perform a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCkNyg2zgz0\">cover</a> of Lucy Rose\u2019s Middle of the Bed, which resulted in nearly half a million views. It was around this time that her mother asked if she\u2019d like to do music full-time. \u201cAt that point I realised I couldn\u2019t really do anything else,\u201d she told <em>Teen Vogue</em>. With her songwriting evolving at a startling pace, 2015\u2019s acclaimed EP, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeGJ23hXwuA\"><em>As Long As</em></a>, was written in-between studying for her GCSEs.</p> <p>Inspired by the lyrical dexterity of Nick Drake, Laura Marling and Loudon Wainwright, Marten\u2019s songs have delicacy and warmth. An air of melancholia underlies her bewitching vocal, and her guitar-playing is often augmented by distant strings or pitter-patter drums. Keen to let her music gently do the talking, Marten \u2013 who appeared on the BBC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5h9Skn0H7srr17xsq8N9RqY/billie-marten\">Sound of 2016</a> long-list \u2013 doesn\u2019t seem overly concerned with shouting about her brilliance. \u201cI\u2019ve always said to myself that I\u2019d like to be quietly happy,\u201d she says. <strong>Michael Cragg</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Key track: </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vmD-4j5UMo\"><strong><em>Lionhearted</em></strong></a></p> <h2>The Goon Sax</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"595b896b8c55996720c97ccbd4b826a2f950ff60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/595b896b8c55996720c97ccbd4b826a2f950ff60/18_112_1512_907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Goon Sax\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s tempting to ascribe the <a href=\"http://chaptermusic.com/artist/the-goon-sax/\">Goon Sax</a>\u2019s gentle indie melodies to the fact that frontman Louis is the son of Go-Betweens cofounder Robert Forster, but their fresh sound and playful lyrics stand on their own.

When we started, we didn\u2019t talk about how our music should sound. This is just what you get when you put the four of us in a room without any expectations.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 12, guitarist Vilhelm Strange was in a punk band called Psykisk H\u00e5rdt. It was a short-lived venture, but the energy lives on in Liss\u2019 pop confections, in the \u201cvery clear attitude and feeling\u201d, says Strange. \u201cI still aim to capture this when we\u2019re recording. It\u2019s important that you can hear the emotion.\u201d</p> <p>Liss rose swiftly: Holm started playing with drummer Tobias Laust in school, bonding over graffiti, Portishead and Massive Attack. One day they met Strange and bassist Villads Tyrrestrup in a rehearsal space and decided to merge bands.</p> <p>Jittery funk single Try was the first song they wrote together, and an instant online hit. XL Recordings signed them the day of their first London gig, and as a perk, took them to see Adele. (\u201cSo much to learn from her,\u201d says Holm.) Despite their inauspicious DIY beginnings, Liss are already breaching Adele\u2019s world, breaking into mainstream Danish radio. They definitely have common DNA with The 1975, and Sorry, the flickering vocoder-laden lead track from their debut XL release First, shares its name with Justin Bieber\u2019s massive 2015 hit. Whose is better? \u201cIt\u2019s hard to compare our music,\u201d says Holm. \u201cWe are saying sorry for different reasons though.\u201d <strong><em>Key track: </em></strong><a href=\"http://diymag.com/2016/05/20/liss-stream-all-killer-first-ep-in-full\"><strong><em>Good Enough</em></strong></a></p> <h2>Sam Gellaitry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"876f58e50f802cb45243dc50c724a94eb69bd22f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/876f58e50f802cb45243dc50c724a94eb69bd22f/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"am Gellaitry performs at Veld Music Festival at Downsview Park on July 30, 2016 in Toronto, Canada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sam Gellaitry is a hotly-tipped Scottish electronic producer who got hooked on music production software at 12, released very promising early work and is now, at 19, signed to a big independent label in London with a glittering future ahead. Sound familiar? Maybe it\u2019s because his story recalls two other Scottish pioneers of woozy, hip-hop-inflected electronica, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/14/hudson-mohawke-kanye-west-producer\">Hudson Mohawke</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/rustie-even-if-dont-believe-review-third-album\">Rustie</a>, who cut their teeth on the Glasgow scene as teenagers and started putting out music on Warp Records half a decade ago.</p> <p>Gellaitry hails from Stirling and has signed to XL, not Warp, but his sound owes a debt to his neighbours. Listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af-BdT-Y4B8\">Temple</a> from his February 2015 EP <em>Short Stories</em>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_m2besVZeU\">Long Distance</a> on the <em>Escapism</em> EP, which followed last November, and you\u2019ll hear menacing horns, a la Hudson Mohawke, and complex, skittering beats and weird effects that wouldn\u2019t seem out of place on a Rustie record. Yet Gellaitry is no mere imitator. He has deft control over his material, which can be intricate, with an exuberant globetrotting aesthetic, but rarely feels cluttered. His <em>Escapism</em> EP contains middle-eastern strings, pitch-shifted dancehall vocals, snake-charmer woodwind, harps and EDM drops. You\u2019d expect these to clash horribly on a 17-minute EP, but somehow they make complete sense. Gellaitry\u2019s new EP, <a href=\"http://hypetrak.com/2016/08/sam-gellaitry-escapism-ii-ep-stream/\"><em>Escapism 2</em></a>, was released last month. <strong>KF</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Key track: </em></strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/samgellaitry/the-gateway\"><strong><em>The Gateway</em></strong></a></p> <h2>Harsh Crowd</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93051e828e5deb1e98921ab628611e69a1a48f4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93051e828e5deb1e98921ab628611e69a1a48f4e/0_72_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harsh Crowd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Teenagers hate stupid questions, and New York punks <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HarshCrowd/\">Harsh Crowd</a> have experienced plenty.

They met at four, and have been inseparable since, writing songs in Hollingworth\u2019s attic (\u201cbecause it\u2019s quiet\u201d) and rehearsing in her bathroom.

One Soundcloud upload got them a record deal, and a first gig followed last year.</p> <p>The best rock can be divided into two categories: songs of attraction or repulsion. Some of the greatest songs encompass both opposing emotions. What\u2019s most important is feeling something, anything, and Pretty Vicious understand this visceral hunger for sensation better than any band of their generation. The music they\u2019ve released so far is reminiscent of Arctic Monkeys\u2019 teenage reportage, lacking their arched-eyebrow lyrical voyeurism, but unleashing a grungy fury that\u2019s breathtaking to behold. Brash lead riffs buzzsaw around twitchy guitar rhythms, the subterranean basslines are more menacing than a pool of fresh blood at a bus stop, and apocalyptic drums summon thunder to Griffith\u2019s curled-lip cawing.</p> <p>Some may gripe that the music is as subtle as a lobotomist\u2019s drill; it\u2019ll be interesting to see if they want, or are able, to get deeper on their upcoming debut album. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6uBrek6Kd4\">Cave Song</a>, their most recent single, is 140 seconds about drinking in a cave.

  "<p>He was \u201ca modest little man, with plenty to be modest about\u201d. So said Winston Churchill of the politician who was at his side throughout the war and then crushed him at the ballot box immediately afterwards.</p> <p>Clement Attlee is, as John Bew explains in his exemplary biography, Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference\" title=\"\">unlikeliest of heroes</a>. He was remarkably unremarkable. He hailed from the suburbs and returned to the suburbs; the young man from the minor public school was, like John Major, obsessive about cricket. His most memorable moment as a schoolboy was Queen Victoria\u2019s diamond jubilee, one of the great celebrations of empire. As he wrote towards the end of his life in 1960: \u201cMost of us boys at that time were imperialists with an immense pride in the achievements of our race.\u201d</p> <p>So how did a man who was the object of so much private derision by his peers come to preside over Labour\u2019s greatest (some might say only) radical government? Bew puts the question at the core of his story. He answers it convincingly by mixing arresting narrative with a thorough study of the people and policies of the Labour movement at a time of hardship interspersed by war and fierce ideological difference.</p> <p>Attlee was elected mayor of Stepney in 1919, a year to the day after the Armistice, having begun his intellectual inquiry into the problem of poverty in the East End working for the Haileybury Boys Club. He was the unthreatening figure who could get the job done. Throughout his career he was surrounded by larger personalities. His trick was to appear as the family solicitor \u201cadvising the old lady very sagely on her investments\u201d. Was this most unspun of political leaders really that guileless, or was it part of the game plan to rise without trace?</p> <p>It was Ramsay MacDonald, the great betrayer of the Labour party, who gave Attlee his big break. Oswald Mosley had resigned from the cabinet. MacDonald looked around him and chose \u201cthe most uninteresting, unimaginative but most reliable among his backbenchers to replace the fallen angel\u201d.</p> <p>MacDonald\u2019s decision to form a national government resulted in the closest thing modern Britain has produced to a one-party state. In the election that followed, Labour ended up with only 46 MPs. One of the few left was Attlee, who in 1935 took over as leader. The <em>Daily Mail</em> struggled to do a proper hatchet job on him, resorting to observing that he had a similar-shaped head to that of Lenin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"314c0826b4b3914cf256fe6054740ae8d5ed538b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/314c0826b4b3914cf256fe6054740ae8d5ed538b/0_1110_3375_2024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clement Attlee in the garden of 10 Downing Street, London, in August 1945\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clement Attlee in the garden of 10 Downing Street, London, in August 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When war came, Attlee threw in his lot with Churchill. While the prime minister focused on the military effort, his deputy made sure the country still functioned on the domestic front. Introducing the <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1940/may/22/emergency-powers-defence-bill\" title=\"\">emergency powers defence bill</a>, Attlee told the nation the government was assuming full control over all persons and property. Britain suddenly entered an era of state planning. William Beveridge\u2019s drily entitled report, <a href=\"http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/public-health-and-wellbeing/beveridge-report/\" title=\"\">Social Insurance and Allied Services</a>, may have been radical in content, but it was in keeping with the time. Bew includes the intriguing observation that a copy of the report was found in Hitler\u2019s bunker.</p> <p>For an exhausted electorate, Attlee\u2019s modesty at the 1945 election was a welcome contrast to Churchill\u2019s bombast. The six years of that government were remarkable not just for the huge social agenda \u2013 the formation of the NHS and welfare state \u2013 but also for foreign policy challenges that put the present Brexit fiasco into perspective. On any given day Attlee was dealing with demobilisation, the withdrawal of the US-provided <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease\" title=\"\">Lend-Lease</a> financing that almost bankrupted&#xa0;the UK, the withdrawal from India and Palestine, the increasing&#xa0;threat of Soviet Russia and the nuclear bomb.</p> <p>As the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> wrote: \u201cWe walk in the shadow of economic catastrophe and live month to month.\u201d Attlee exhorted the people to work harder, to keep those belts tightened. One of the many huge billboards around the country declared: \u201cAn all-out effort will increase our production by the 10% we need to turn the tide.\u201d This was 1948, the year George Orwell completed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/10/1984-george-orwell\" title=\"\"><em>1984</em></a>.</p> <p>And yet this was a government led by a man who shunned publicity, who enjoyed tending the garden and whose wife, Violet, would drive him around, frequently crashing the car. (Clem, she reported, was \u201calways an absolute dear\u201d about these scrapes.) The book is replete with amusing vignettes. In February 1933, Nye Bevan was due to debate Mosley at the Cambridge Union, but had to pull out at the last minute with the flu. Attlee volunteered to do it. He rushed off with Frank Owen, a former MP turned <em>Daily Express </em>journalist, braving ice-covered roads in their hats, scarves and goggles in Owen\u2019s open-top car. \u201cIn the course of the three-hour drive they twice came off the road and hit a ditch,\u201d writes Bew. The author also recounts how, when Bevan first outlined his vision for a national health service in October 1945, Attlee expressed delight that his minister had done well \u201con a pretty sticky wicket\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4c17efeebe474a22d02a1ae0e7ce5126aca794a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4c17efeebe474a22d02a1ae0e7ce5126aca794a/0_725_4878_2926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clement Attlee addresses a political rally in July 1938\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clement Attlee addresses a political rally in July 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Herald Archive/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How best to categorise Attlee? Bew describes him as a social patriot. His was a very British New Deal, a new contract between state and citizen. He was no revolutionary; he did not see it as his mission to purge the establishment. \u201cIt was not that their privileges were taken away; what was taken away was the ethos of hierarchy that made sense of those privileges,\u201d writes Bew.</p> <p>This book will become required reading for the present-day Labour party as it tears itself apart in a desperate attempt to redefine a credible socialism for the 21st century. Attlee has long since become lionised across the left and beyond. The contrast could not have been greater in his lifetime.</p> <p>Another sneering one-liner doing the rounds was: an empty taxi drove up to No 10 and Clement Attlee got out. It was attributed to Churchill, but in this case it wasn\u2019t him. It spoke for many, however.</p> <p><em>Citizen Clem is published by Quercus (\u00a330). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/citizen-clem.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a324</em></a></p>",

These included a jazz wardrobe, a jazz rubber ball and a jazz toilet seat decorated with flowers. Lee was wry and pointed (\u201cPresumably those are wardrobes which have an improvisatory attitude with the relationship of being a wardrobe\u201d), which you would expect. But as the programme progressed, Finch found his position shifting, from someone who felt he was protecting the \u201creal\u201d definition of jazz, as an experimental, revolutionary music, to a person who wasn\u2019t sure what jazz was exactly. And even if it was what he believed it to be, whether he should defend its name. This show promised entertainment but expanded your mind rather more than you expected.

This was unnerving, if somehow unsurprising. Morton was treated badly during his childhood and adolescence. He recounted how he would push jihadi ideas, by offering all the material of radicalism, without explicitly recommending it. Eventually he went too far, broke the law and was put in jail. While in there, the kindness of his captors, and the writings of Locke and Mill, helped him to change his attitude. He is no longer radicalised. This programme was interesting from start to finish, and, although I began by thinking it would have been better written down \u2013 as long, detailed journalism \u2013 I changed my mind.

  "<p>Grains for breakfast, vegetables for lunch, smoked salmon for dinner. No wheat, no dairy, no sugar; 45 minutes of exercise every day.

When she moved from her native Australia to Britain, her intention was to continue. And the agency in question liked her look \u2013 except for the fact that she was, they said, too big. Specifically her hips, which were around the 37- or 38-inch mark, but needed to shrink to 35.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/04/minimum-bmi-checks-uk-models-womens-equality-party\">Fashion industry told to end its quest for \u2018unattainable thinness\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I ask Nelson, now 24 and still modelling, what that moment felt like. \u201cYou get sucked into thinking that what they say is the only way to be,\u201d she replies. \u201cThey control your life. They\u2019re getting you your jobs, they\u2019re providing you with your income, and you become like a slave to it. The industry\u2019s so consuming that you forget about the real world. In the real world I\u2019m incredibly thin, but in the modelling world I\u2019m still too big. So when they asked me to lose weight, I accepted it.\u201d But worse was to come. Grains consumed, exercise taken, social life shunned, she slimmed her hips down to 35 inches and went back to the agency.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, just lose more weight \u2013 get down to the bone,\u201d remembers Nelson. \u201cThey pressed on my hips and I just sat there thinking, no, I can\u2019t.

In its aftermath, Nelson decided she couldn\u2019t return to her previous weight-loss programme, which she describes as \u201ca horrible routine of essentially killing myself\u201d.</p> <p>She started working with smaller agencies, where she was encouraged to remain at a healthy weight. At the same time she began to speak and write about her experiences, committed to raising awareness of the potentially destructive power the fashion industry wields. That\u2019s why, after a day\u2019s work, she has joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/04/womens-equality-party-leader-sophie-walker-its-complex-but-not-complicated\">Sophie Walker, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party (WEP)</a>, and Jada Sezer, a plus-size model on the verge of launching her own clothing range, to talk about WEP\u2019s forthcoming campaign, which will operate on social media under the hashtag<a href=\"http://www.bombbehavior.com/#!JOIN-THE-NOSIZEFITSALL-CAMPAIGN/\"> #NoSizeFitsAll</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f3a48dd4bb4114b741ea26b454509b5509d941f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f3a48dd4bb4114b741ea26b454509b5509d941f/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jada Sezer and Rosie Nelson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jada Sezer, pictured in 2013, was the face of London Fashion Week\u2019s first plus-size show. Right, Rosie Nelson in her ultra-thin days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Rio Romaine and courtesy Rosie Nelson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Walker, whose organisation has existed for a little over a year and is committed to change through cross-party collaboration, we are in the middle of a public health crisis that includes 1.6 million sufferers of eating disorders, 89% of them women and girls, and brings with it an economic cost of \u00a31.3bn a year in lost productivity and healthcare bills. WEP\u2019s campaign, which is backed by industry commentator and professor of diversity in fashion Caryn Franklin, will focus on what Walker believes is at the root of the problem: the sample sizes used by the fashion industry.</p> <p>These \u201ctiny, tiny little clothes\u201d, says Walker, \u201care such that normal-sized women have to starve themselves to fit into them. And we\u2019re not talking a three-day soup diet here, which would be bad enough; we\u2019re talking weeks and weeks and weeks of systematic malnutrition, for which young women are paid to fit into these tiny little sizes. And so the first part of this campaign is to say that we think that by this time next year, when London Fashion week kicks off, the British Fashion Council should have in place a system whereby the designers showing in London must show at least two sample sizes, one of which must be more than a UK size 12.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, WEP is calling for legislation that will require all models hired or rehired by agencies to have a minimum body mass index (BMI) of 18.5; any lower, and they will have to see a doctor from a list of accredited medical experts to be signed off as healthy. This, says Walker, would bring the UK into line with law in France, Spain and Italy. She deems it \u201cfrankly embarrassing that we haven\u2019t done this yet\u201d. Her party\u2019s campaign also calls on UK fashion magazines to feature at least one editorial piece per issue that includes plus-size models, and for body image to become a compulsory part of personal, social and health education at school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8845b6f01aefb12882617161d01858317f5b88aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8845b6f01aefb12882617161d01858317f5b88aa/0_466_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Walker, head of the Women\u2019s Equality party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Walker, head of the Women\u2019s Equality party, is leading the campaign against \u2018tiny, tiny little clothes\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How likely does Walker think a change in legislation really is? She points to the fact that her party is the only one to work across political divides to achieve change, and to what happened when she ran in the London mayoral race, suggesting that it led \u201cproud feminist\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/08/sadiq-khan-to-tackle-gender-issues-in-london-mayoral-bid\">Sadiq Khan to launch a gender pay audit in City Hall</a>. \u201cHe stole the policy because he was worried about losing the votes.\u201d Her party, she argues, can bring its thousands of members and registered supporters to the table \u2013 the campaign will mobilise them to write to the British Fashion Council in support.</p> <p>Does she worry that one plank of their demands \u2013 the insistence that models\u2019 BMIs be monitored \u2013 will seem to some as if women are once again being medicalised or placed under enforced scrutiny? \u201cYou think that\u2019s not already happening?\u201d says Walker. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is the first step towards liberating women from that scrutiny. We have all lived with that pressure all of our lives.</p> <p>\u201cI have been everything from a size eight to a size 18, and I can tell you at every point in my life which size I\u2019ve been and when. We live with this. And I am 45 years old. I have been living with it for 30 years and I\u2019m tired of it. I\u2019m seeing it happen to my children, I\u2019m seeing my daughters \u2013 my seven-year-old and my 14-year-old \u2013 under the same pressures.\u201d She adds that there are girls in her younger daughter\u2019s class who talk about their \u201cthigh gap\u201d \u2013 the crucial space that indicates one\u2019s legs are thin enough to be considered attractive. \u201cWhat we are doing here is about removing that scrutiny, not adding to it. We are creating a situation where women can be healthy and work, rather than being paid to be unhealthy and contribute to this awful public health issue.\u201d</p> <p>The images that bombard women and girls are nothing new. For as long as there has been mass media, idealised pictures of the human body (generally, thin women and muscled men) have permeated cinema, television, newspapers and magazines \u2013 sometimes attempting to sell consumers products, sometimes simply illustrating a story. But in the age of the internet, says Sezer, an additional layer of imagery has appeared \u2013 not courtesy of businesses advertising their wares, but produced instead by the individual, via such platforms as Instagram or YouTube. Often, she says, such images are Photoshopped, or highly selective \u2013 and yet they are presented as authentic everyday life. In that category one might put extreme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/16/prophets-of-modern-dieting-want-you-to-feel-guilty-about-food\">\u201cclean eating\u201d</a> and hardcore exercise regimes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a12a073f9c3df36666d4635a4168e60460b077b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a12a073f9c3df36666d4635a4168e60460b077b2/0_0_2599_3259/797.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Fast Catwalk show\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Fast Catwalk show at London fashion week in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Sezer also believes that social media has brought much that is positive, and can be utilised as a force for good. Now 27, she was doing a master\u2019s degree in child psychotherapy when she realised that she was drawn to finding out the root causes of people\u2019s lack of confidence and \u201cflipping it on its head and saying, you can do anything you want\u201d. The immense popularity<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jadasezer/?hl=en\"> of her own Instagram feed </a>led to her being signed to agency Models 1 and becoming the face of London Fashion week\u2019s first ever plus-size show.</p> <p>She stuck to modelling for the following two and a half years, including a stint in New York. It was there, she says, \u201cI became really flat, and stripped back of everything. I felt like I\u2019d hit a glass ceiling, and I felt like they weren\u2019t pushing the boundaries fast enough, they weren\u2019t seeing a gap could be broken into.\u201d She was also segregated, a plus-size model restricted to working with plus-size brands. \u201cI felt, surely that\u2019s not right? When I got into modelling, I didn\u2019t even know I was a plus-size model. I had no perception of what my body looked like.\u201d Returning to live in London, she began to develop other strings to her bow, working as an ambassador for the charity Young Minds, and designing her own range of clothes, Sezer, which will launch online this month.</p> <p>Both Sezer and Nelson are realistic about the fashion industry, and the paths they\u2019ve pursued. Sezer accepts that, in New York, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I could be as much of an activist. I didn\u2019t feel like I had much control. You\u2019re a model. You do as you\u2019re told... you\u2019re being hired to look beautiful on set, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Nelson acknowledges that the bigger agencies \u201care the ones that get you the greater jobs \u2013 the high fashion, the Top Shop, the H&amp;M\u201d. Does she feel that she\u2019s lost out? \u201cDefinitely. I definitely would have had better clients being with a bigger agency, because they have the contacts for it. So I have potentially ruined my career by not being a slave to the industry. But I chose my own health and happiness over my career, which is the best decision I could have made.\u201d</p> <p>Sezer ascribes the continuing power of such agencies to the ingrained idea that they can make would-be models\u2019 dreams come true. But, she says, it\u2019s a flawed idea, because the agencies themselves are always chopping and changing, telling their charges to alter their appearance according to their latest guess of what will appeal. And, as she points out, \u201cagents have a role to play, but they\u2019re the middle man between the designer and the model. If a designer is producing such a small size, then agents can only give them the models that fit into their sizes.\u201d</p> <p>Which brings the argument back to the issue of the sample size, which all agree trickles down into the wider fashion and retail culture. Given that women\u2019s bodies are so various, why has its dominance persisted for so long? Walker argues that we\u2019ve collectively bought into \u201cthe myth that creative integrity is dependent on the fantasy of a tiny woman. Which to me is like saying that the tobacco industries were presenting a myth of the wild west, and that actually it was nothing to do with them that we all got lung cancer\u201d.</p> <p>And, adds Sezer: \u201cIf you look back at the history of fashion, the majority [of designers] were men, and it was their ideal of what beauty was. And that seeped down into being these frail, almost boy-like figures.\u201d</p> <p>What does Walker hope will happen now? Her ambition is that the landscape will have changed by next year\u2019s London fashion week. She is soon to approach Sadiq Khan to ask that, if it doesn\u2019t, he should be withdrawing LFW funding. She\u2019s also writing to Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities select committee, to consider holding a public hearing \u201cwith those fashion designers to explore why they believe that their success is so intrinsically linked to an unattainable level of thinness in women\u201d.</p> <p>And underlying all this activity is her belief that the fashion industry, quite apart from its ethical responsibilities, has allowed itself to be constrained by its own rules, and is thereby marginalising a potentially huge market.</p> <p>She is determined that the campaign represent a step change, in which the onus is no longer on women and girls to resist the messages that surround them, but on the disappearance of the messages themselves.</p> <p>\u201cThe previous work that\u2019s been done to contest this has been a very gentle, softly-softly approach, and there was a lot that had to be done in terms of raising awareness,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of those campaigns are valid and important, but now we\u2019re at the point where we\u2019ve got to say, enough: this has got to stop.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Some debates are marked toxic from the start. Try the existence of our old chums fairness and balance in reporting Jeremy Corbyn, for instance. The <em>Times</em> clears its front page to announce that Jeremy\u2019s \u201con course to win a bigger mandate\u201d than he did first time round, according to YouGov. Perhaps that means the media campaign, real or perceived, against him isn\u2019t working: or perhaps it shows the BBC and other supposed culprits aren\u2019t hopelessly biased after all.</p> <p>But stir in 170 or so dissident MPs and some equally decisive opinion polls pointing in a precisely different direction \u2013 down and out \u2013 and objective truth sinks into the mists, leaving only one vital difference behind.</p> <p>Fairness and balance can be media mantras at general election time, or whenever they directly affect national decision-making. It\u2019s not so certain, though, that they apply as tightly to the choices that are made within the closed circuit of internal political-party voting. The decisions there are for paid-up members, not Joe and Joanna Public. How does the fairness principle work with people who mostly made up their minds when they put \u00a325 in an envelope?</p> <p>In fact, in many ways the most contentious current election reporting doesn\u2019t touch Labour at all. Last week, with only a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-hopefuls-golliwog-fan-putin-admirer-wrestler\" title=\"\">flicker of media interest</a>, Lisa Duffy, Bill Etheridge, Elizabeth Jones, Phillip Broughton and Diane James formally asked 39,000 Ukip members to choose one of them as successor to Nigel Farage.</p> <p>Oh, Ukip! you say. Who wants day-by-day coverage there, profiles, constant polling, open debates, in-depth reportage plus the full three-ring circus treatment? Didn\u2019t we see Nigel on the stump with Trump in Mississippi? Isn\u2019t that fair and balanced enough to keep the BBC Trust in chocolate biscuits?</p> <p>But consider \u2026 As a prescient Frank Field MP told the <em>Times</em>: \u201cWho gets elected leader of the Labour party obviously matters in determining its future. But the centre of gravity is shifting. Already Labour\u2019s future may depend less on who wins the contest between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith than who is elected Ukip\u2019s leader.\u201d</p> <p>Ukip scored 3,881,099 votes in the 2015 general election. More than the Lib Dems and SNP put together. Its current poll rating, even leaderless in the lee of Theresa, mostly hovers in the 14% region. Last June, at Brexit time, it was five or six points higher than that. Without Ukip, Remain would have won. Editorialists talked obsessively, post-referendum, about the disaffected white legions of the north and Midlands in revolt against London\u2019s elite. Yet where is that newfound extra-metropolitan fascination when Ukip makes its own top choices?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is that it\u2019s convenient to forget. Only the <em>Daily Express</em> \u2013 mindful of Richard Desmond\u2019s party donations \u2013 has made any consistent effort. The <em>Telegraph</em> and the <em>Mail</em>, like the<em> Mirror</em>, seem happy to push the competing quintet to the periphery. Of course there\u2019s some coverage: the <em>Guardian</em>, like the <em>Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/30/ukip-leadership-race-exposes-ideological-faultlines-in-party-that-has-achieved-its-goal\" title=\"\">keeps an eye on things from time to time</a>. But Frank Field\u2019s centre of gravity hasn\u2019t exactly shifted yet. No one bar the <em>Express</em> seems to acknowledge it has Ukip readers on board.</p> <p>Who cares? Labour supporters and mainstream Tories don\u2019t want nonentities to become entities by bringing them in from the periphery. BBC interviewers obviously fret when immigration interviews lurch out of control. Five is an unwieldy studio number. You can understand, and possibly applaud, all of this. Pragmatic convenience. But is it fair? Is it balanced? Do such things \u2013 issues of supposed principle \u2013 matter if \u2026 well, if it\u2019s just Ukip?</p>",
  "<p>I was just \u201ca wee scrap\u201d, as my father would say, when we left the north east coast of Scotland for the south coast of England. Dad is from London, but after six years living in Dundee he was pretty much bilingual.</p> <p>Then he joined the army and for the next decade my brother and I were shunted around various military bases, clocking up schools and fighting over bedrooms, but the one thing that grounded us was the fact that we came from Dundee.</p> <p>I learned how to be Dundonian by listening to my mother (Dundee born and bred), and from highly anticipated trips back. And I pored over <a href=\"https://www.dcthomson.co.uk/brands/the-broons/\"><em>The Broons</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.dcthomson.co.uk/brands/oor-wullie/\"><em>Oor Wullie</em></a>: iconic cartoon strips written in broad Scots that first appeared in <em>The Sunday Post</em> in 1936 and still come out as annuals every Christmas.

To my mind, Scotland\u2019s fourth largest city has always been a little pot of gold at the end of the A92: the place where I first tasted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/22/how-to-make-perfect-tablet-recipe\">tablet</a>, a proper fish supper, and Scotch pies \u2013 from Doig\u2019s, naturally. It was where my older cousin bought me my first record (\u201cJan-u-arry\u201d by Pilot, second-hand from <a href=\"http://www.grouchos.co.uk/\">Groucho\u2019s</a>), where I spotted my first red squirrel but never quite caught sight of the haggis that roamed the hills.</p> <p>I realise now that this impression of Dundee is not everyone\u2019s. Often the disclosure of my birthplace is met with snorts of derision. The worst critics seem to be Dundonians themselves. Poet and musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/don-paterson\">Don Paterson</a> describes the recent regeneration efforts as \u201cpost-apocalyptic\u201d. Chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeremy-lee\">Jeremy Lee</a>, who admits to having a soft spot for the city, talks about \u201ca black cloud of negativity hovering above and in many cases in it\u201d.</p> <p>But on a sunny day, with the wind behind it (so often the case), Dundee does a great long weekend \u2013 and its position just below the Cairngorms makes it a good stop-off for Highland trips. I was commissioned to make a public artwork there this summer, as part of the popular <a href=\"http://www.oorwulliebuckettrail.com/\">Oor Wullie Bucket Trail</a>, and was glad of the chance to reacquaint myself with this handsome, misunderstood city.</p> <p>How things have changed. Arriving by train means walking past the magnificent RRS Discovery, the tall ship in which Captain Scott travelled to the Antarctic, currently dwarfed by the adjacent building site that will, in two years\u2019 time, become the <a href=\"http://www.vandadundee.org/whatson\">V&amp;A Museum of Design</a>.</p> <p>Last time I was here I built a replica of The Broons\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/104014/but-n-ben-injects-some-broons-charm-at-mcmanus-galleries/\">but \u2019n\u2019 ben</a> (their highland cottage) at the <a href=\"http://www.themcmanus-dundee.gov.uk/\">McManus</a>, the fantastically gothic museum and art gallery.

And you can\u2019t miss the statue of Desperate Dan near the Caird Hall, testament to the enduring legacy of DC Thomson\u2019s comic heroes.<br></p> <p>Down at the Overgate, I nipped out to the shops, dodging the giant seagulls that divebomb passers-by for their sandwiches. Inside is the biggest branch of Greggs I\u2019ve ever seen. Maybe that explains the size of the birds. Weirdly, right next door to the shopping centre is the Howff, an atmospheric and ancient cemetery, which makes for a slightly jarring transition when stepping from one to the other: like a very dark episode of <em>Mr Benn</em>.</p> <p>My uncle Jim once told me that a one-eyed gangster named \u201cOch Aye\u2019\u2019 stalked Dundee\u2019s badlands, but I\u2019ve yet to spot him.

There is one potential gotcha, however. iMessage is an Apple-only feature that automatically routes text messages over the internet where possible. After you\u2019ve switched to Android, it\u2019s possible that incoming text messages to your phone number will continue being diverted to the iMessage network, meaning you won\u2019t receive them.</p> <p>To ensure your settings update, visit <a href=\"https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage\">Apple\u2019s help page</a> and remove yourself from iMessage manually.</p> <h2><strong>Will all my favourite apps be available? </strong></h2> <p>There are few big-name apps that don\u2019t support Android, from games and social apps to productivity tools, even if new releases sometimes still come earlier to iOS. Certain genres still suffer on Android in comparison to iOS. For example, music-makers should be warned there is still no real alternative to Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id682658836?mt=12&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">GarageBand</a> on Android or the many professional-grade audio tools that exist on iOS.</p> <p>There is also no direct equivalent to Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id408981434\">iMovie</a>, although there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/17/20-best-apps-making-videos\">a growing number of video-editing tools</a> on Android that handle parts of that app\u2019s features.</p> <h2><strong>Will I lose access to my music? </strong></h2> <p>Not at all. In the early days of iTunes, its downloads could only be played on Apple hardware. Anything you\u2019ve bought since 2009 will be in the unrestricted M4A format though, which can easily be converted into MP3s that will play on any Android phone. Streaming services such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deezer.com/\">Deezer</a> are available on Android, as is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple-music\">Apple Music</a>, so you can sign in on your new phone and access all your old playlists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"859300ef28d97a58f9f2444e41202617dcda3f93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/859300ef28d97a58f9f2444e41202617dcda3f93/0_0_2880_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Android Nougat allows you precise control over app notifications.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"889\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Android Nougat allows you precise control over app notifications.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Are Android phones worse for photography? </strong></h2> <p>Apple might think so, but there are Android phones with cameras as good as the iPhone\u2019s \u2013 or better. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 has a wider lens aperture than the iPhone 6 and 6S, for example, plus optical image stabilisation for steadier shots. If you\u2019re worried about losing the photos from your iPhone camera roll, you can export them on to your computer or install the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-photos/id962194608?mt=8\">Google Photos app</a> on iOS to upload them to your Google account.</p> <h2><strong>Will I be vulnerable to viruses and hacking attacks? </strong></h2> <p>Android gives app developers a lot of freedom, which means you can apply cool customisations that aren\u2019t possible on iOS, such as third-party widgets on the home screen. But yes, this means Android phones are more vulnerable to malware attacks. In theory, a malicious app could snoop on your banking details, lock up your data or run up huge bills by silently calling premium-rate numbers when you\u2019re not looking.</p> <p>Don\u2019t panic, though \u2013 such outbreaks are rare and a little common sense goes a long way. Don\u2019t install apps from unfamiliar sites \u2013 stick to the official <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store\">Google Play store</a> and, ideally, stick to established apps with plenty of positive user reviews.</p> <h2><strong>Will Android work properly with my Mac?</strong></h2> <p>If you prefer to use iTunes on your desktop, then switching will demand a certain adjustment of your habits \u2013 there\u2019s no comparable \u201ccentral control panel\u201d for Android. Your settings and content are managed from within the relevant apps and websites.</p> <p>However, if you want to drag and drop files manually from your desktop on to a connected Android phone, you can do it using Google\u2019s standalone <a href=\"https://android.com/filetransfer/\">Android File Transfer</a> tool for the Mac. It works the other way too, so you can keep copies of your on-device photos and music or take your pick from the many backup apps on Google Play, both free and paid-for.</p> <h2><strong>Will I have to get by without Touch ID and Night Shift? </strong></h2> <p>Apple\u2019s Touch ID sensor is a great piece of technology, but there are plenty of Android phones with similar thumbprint scanners, the Nexus 5X and 6P for example, which can be used in the same way to unlock the phone and authorise purchases from Google Play.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/23/android-7-nougat-tips-tricks-replies-settings-app-emoji\">Android 7.0 Nougat: 11 tips and tricks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for Night Shift, the feature in iOS 9.3 that tints the screen at night to help your brain wind down and sleep better, Google is working on something similar but it hasn\u2019t yet been officially baked into the operating system.</p> <p>Google Play offers a selection of apps that can do the same thing. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&amp;hl=en_GB\">Twilight</a> is one highly rated option that\u2019s free to download \u2013 so you don\u2019t need to lose sleep over switching.</p> <h2><strong>Will my accessories still work?</strong></h2> <p>Bluetooth accessories such as headphones and speakers should work perfectly well on Android, while health and fitness trackers tend to support both Android and iOS with their apps. Anything with a Lightning connector, however, is sadly a no-go: the plugs and sockets are patented, so you can\u2019t hook them up to a non-Apple device. It\u2019s a similar situation if you\u2019ve splashed out on an Apple Watch. Despite speculation that Apple might open the watch up to work with Android smartphones, it remains iOS-only for now. The good news is that if you can\u2019t live without a smartwatch, there\u2019s a good range of <a href=\"https://www.android.com/wear/\">Android Wear devices</a> out there for less than \u00a3100.</p> <h2><strong>What if I want to switch from Android to iPhone? </strong></h2> <p>Many of the reassurances above apply just as well the other way, from apps to music. Apple has also launched an Android app called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios\">Move to iOS</a> that migrates your photos, messages, contacts and bookmarks to an iPhone.</p>",
  "<p>With a stage name that evokes the sound of a spell, it\u2019s no surprise that Atlantan singer and producer Abra likens music to magic: \u201cI create what I speak,\u201d she affirms. She hasn\u2019t revealed her real name to the world \u2013 she sometimes calls herself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darkwaveduchess?lang=en\" title=\"\">The Darkwave Duchess</a> \u2013 but her DIY R&amp;B and anxious, passionate songs speak for themselves. To date, she\u2019s released two EPs, last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://darkwaveduchess.bandcamp.com/album/blq-velvet\" title=\"\">Blq Velvet</a> and July\u2019s Princess; and, in between, a debut album of singular assuredness, <a href=\"https://darkwaveduchess.bandcamp.com/album/rose\" title=\"\">Rose</a>, whose title she has explained with the succinct phrase: <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6598223/awful-records-abra-rose-album-premiere\" title=\"\">\u201cEverything dies\u201d</a>. Abra may have gothic leanings, but unlike the rote mopery of so much indie-R&amp;B of recent years, her music is notable for its ambiguity. She\u2019s not afraid of heavy bass, but her self-produced beats are also full of light, space and dappled piano, more reminiscent of 80s boogie or freestyle than trip-hoppy gloom. Songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI1g4dnDtao\" title=\"\">Fruit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I-POWtEJ8U\" title=\"\">Crybaby</a> shift and mutate in unexpected directions; meanwhile, Abra\u2019s laconic vocal delivery belies the yearning feeling of her words.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It can be emotionally heavy sonically or in the lyrics, but I can\u2019t be talking about sad shit and have it sound sad too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She describes herself both as someone who feels things deeply but is \u201ca little emotionally detached\u201d, the latter partly due to her religious upbringing. Her parents were missionaries whose calling brought them, for a period in Abra\u2019s childhood, to Tooting in south-west London. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get too attached to something, because I was raised in the mindset that I\u2019d be taken away from it or that I\u2019m not supposed to be into it, I\u2019m supposed to be in to God,\u201d Abra explains. An anthropology degree at Georgia State University \u201dmade me more compassionate, gave me a lot more empathy\u201d, and provided a route into a musical career: it\u2019s where she first met Father, the rapper who signed her to his Awful Records label.</p> <p>Abra describes Awful, which also includes rappers Stalin Majesty and Tommy Genesis and singer Alexandria, as a collective of artists who pool their resources: \u201cIf I have something someone else doesn\u2019t have, I share it with them, they share things with me.\u201d Abra says that she\u2019s been \u201cfiddling with music and technology\u201d for 10 years, and is entirely self-taught: \u201cI hate having to sit down and learn, I don\u2019t like working at other people\u2019s speeds. Being self-taught means you end up with a very specific style because you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-qcz47h9zo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1-qcz47h9zo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-qcz47h9zo\">Watch the video for Abra\u2019s Rose.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a process that took another twist on Princess, a project that began less with an EP in mind than with the intention of occupying Abra\u2019s time following the release of Rose by improving her production skills. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the intention of putting it out, so I was a lot more free with what I was saying, I didn\u2019t censor myself,\u201d she explains; it was also the first time Abra made her beats before her words rather than fitting music around pre-existing poetry, which was a perfect fit for her love of ambiguity. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to find what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she says with some satisfaction.She explains that a negative experience involving mushrooms and Radiohead (\u201cI was doing fine until my boyfriend put on really sad Radiohead, and my emotions just spiralled out of control into a really dark place\u201d) led to a desire to balance light and shade in her music. \u201cIt can be emotionally heavy sonically or in the lyrics, but I can\u2019t be talking about sad shit and have it sound sad too,\u201d she says. The result is music attuned sharply to human vulnerability \u2013 the \u201cgreatest common denominator\u201d, she says \u2013 and the vast range of feeling therein. Abra prefers not to pin it down: \u201cThe thing about art is that you don\u2019t have to have things that are 100% defined; after you put it out to the world it comes back and redefines itself to you.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><strong>Hantverk &amp; Found, 18 King Street, Margate CT9 1DA (01843 280 454). Meal for two including drinks and service: \u00a360-\u00a380</strong></p> <p>A bright Sunday morning in late summer and along King Street in Margate the pavements are stacked with tattered fragments of my late parents\u2019 lives. There are old suitcases, and the kind of wooden chairs I would have sat upon in a doctor\u2019s waiting room when I was six and had earache. There are transfer-printed tea sets, and walnut sideboards with sliding glass doors that make me shudder.</p> <p>They remind me of overheated afternoons in my grandmother\u2019s council flat in Paddington, heavy with wordless recrimination and the tang of overstewed tea. The older generation are meant to be adored simply for having not died, but my grandmother was a nasty piece of work, manipulative and bitter. Here, now, is what could be the contents of her living room, repurposed, depending on your point of view, as retro furnishing, vintage, kitsch or just plain overpriced junk.</p> <p>Excuse the jaundiced eye. Yes, there are objects in the cluttered junk shops along King Street that trouble me. But I also see glories from its kiss-me-quick seaside past: old neon lights and various bits of fairground gilding; pinball tables, beaten-out enamelled metal signage and faux ships\u2019 figureheads in garish colours which turn out to be not chipped plaster, but aged polystyrene. In the process of moving forward to the new, the old Margate is being sold off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a54b012058de411ab1bdd3e15714963908b6b89e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a54b012058de411ab1bdd3e15714963908b6b89e/733_302_2486_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salt Hake croquettes with half a lemon on a white plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Little dishies: salt Hake croquettes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I last reviewed here in 2005 when an unknown chef had put his name above the door of his ambitious restaurant and instituted a \u201cno jeans\u201d policy. The <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/\">Turner Contemporary</a>, a major art gallery, had announced it would be opening here, and the chef had attempted to get in early on the opportunity. But the Turner didn\u2019t open until 2011, by which time he had long gone. Now, though, the opportunity, like the money, has properly arrived. Buildings are being bought up by people priced out of London who want to furnish their renovated Georgian villas with those garish offcuts from the crumbling promenade, for reasons of irony or bad taste, or both.</p> <p>It was inevitable. Hardcore naysayers will sneer at gentrification of this sort. They will argue that the impact is patchy and, of course, they\u2019re right; go three streets back from the front and the old, crumbling Margate with its endemic problems of social exclusion is still there. (The marvellous jazz singer, <a href=\"http://www.lianecarroll.co.uk/\">Liane Carroll</a>, describes her forever up-and-coming home town of Hastings as still being \u201ca big drug town with a small fishing problem\u201d.) But good things come with gentrification, too, including a literary festival: the brilliantly named <a href=\"http://margatebookie.com/\">Margate Bookie</a>, now in its second year, with a distinct community focus. This year it gave away 700 children\u2019s books. If gentrification means books being given to kids who wouldn\u2019t otherwise get them, only the professionally angry could sneer.</p> <p>It also means the arrival of places such as Hantverk &amp; Found, a tiny cupboard of a fish restaurant, half tiled in the sea green of a Victorian public convenience. Here, you are encouraged to sit elbow to elbow, or nose to armpit. There are 10 seats up front, plus a few in the garden, and a couple of people in the kitchen knocking out idiosyncratic fish dishes, most of which hit the mark. Hantverk is Swedish for homemade. \u201cFound\u201d, I\u2019m told, references the taking of fish from the waters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24aa68f4cf128abbc2144e080f6e8ae47c6e4636\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24aa68f4cf128abbc2144e080f6e8ae47c6e4636/0_400_4247_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plate of queenie scallops\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worth shelling out for: queenie scallops, \u00a38.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a literal title, and also does a good job of framing the place and its quiet ambition. Yes, you can have rock oysters plainly served. But they also come dressed, with the crunch and kick of jalape\u00f1o and pickled cucumber, or with yuzu and wakame, which makes them taste even more of themselves. Plates of local crab, dressed and piled on a scallop shell, pass us by, as does the red and silver of tomatoes heaped with torn basil leaves and boquerones, looking like a pen-and-wash illustration from a cook book. That kitchen cares how these dishes look.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d518d7729b41ba36227cdbef244089b2920200b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d518d7729b41ba36227cdbef244089b2920200b4/555_120_3375_3374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A multi-coloured plate of oysters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rock oysters: \u2018dressed with yuzu and yakame, they taste even more of themselves\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have a generous serving of queenie scallops for \u00a38, deep fried in a pleasingly golden panko crumb and served with a salty-sweet bowl of soy, eased by a good splash of mirin. That dipping sauce comes in handy with the dish of the meal, a salad of cool, slippery black rice noodles, piled with crab and chilli. If there is a general fault here, it is a light hand on the seasoning. A dribble of the dipping sauce poured across the noodles makes the whole plateful sing.<br></p> <p>Croquettes of house-salted hake are warm balls of flaky fish that crumble apart obligingly, ready for a dredge through the saffron mayonnaise that stays the right side of soapy. The more complex dishes stumble slightly. Borlotti beans in a tomato broth with glistening puddles of basil oil is all the flavours you want on a summer\u2019s day, and the giant clams lend a deep burst of surf and iodine and beach breeze to the liquor. But there\u2019s no point pretending. The meat in those clams bounces and springs like a ball of postmen\u2019s elastic bands. They slip down my gullet with all the grace of a teenager going off to tidy their room. The flavours in a stew of braised squid with the kick of harissa demand the bread it comes with. The squid itself should have stayed in there a little longer to soften up. The deep-fried knot of tentacles on the top is better.</p> <p>But I forgive Hantverk &amp; Found these small errors, mostly for the sunny, good natured take-us-as-you-find-us feel of the place. The meringue with raspberries and a dollop of thick whipped cream flavoured with rose water is not an exemplar of the art; it\u2019s too crisp and solid all the way to the core. But it\u2019s a surprisingly well-balanced dessert and when all three elements are taken together, the rose becomes a fragrance, rather than the nightmarish smell of my grandmother\u2019s dressing table.

  "<p>The idea of a \u201cdigital detox\u201d makes my eyes roll so far back I see memories from a past life as concubine number 6. When will we come to terms with our own desires and, rather than banning something we fear altogether, try to understand it? Whether booze or sugar or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/big-brother\"><em>Celebrity Big Brother</em></a>, there is a more adult way of dealing with something we feel has a hold over us than writing it off completely.</p> <p>You see the fear most clearly in the eyes of a parent scrolling through their child\u2019s Instagram. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/aug/23/edinburghfilmfestival.festivals\"><em>Blair Witch Project</em> </a>had nothing on this, the sight of 17 comments under Grace\u2019s selfie, all variations on the emoji for \u201chot\u201d. The typical reaction? Burn it. Burn the phone, burn the internet, run now and run far. Pacing, Googling while chewing nicotine gum, \u201cDo they have Snapchat in Devon?\u201d Backspace, \u201cSeoul?\u201d</p> <p>Which seems to be the general reaction to a new <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4649\">study</a> confirming a rise in mental health problems among teenagers in the UK. It\u2019s bad; it\u2019s what we knew. The Department of Education spoke to 30,000 14- and 15-year-olds and found things are getting worse for girls. Out of those surveyed, 37% had three or more symptoms of psychological distress (for example, feeling worthless) compared to 15% of boys. More than one in three teen girls suffers from anxiety or depression. This rise of 10% in 10 years has led experts to call it a \u201cslow-growing epidemic\u201d. The news itself is depressing and distressing; the snap response has been to blame social media.</p> <p>Once, young people ran around in fields, barefoot, laughing at the dying sun. Unhappiness was invented with Myspace in 2003, a belated millennium bug, and ever since adults have been staring suspiciously at screens, waiting for the next explosion. Except the problem is not the screen \u2013 like all shiny things, they simply show reflections.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like all shiny things, screens simply show reflections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a memorable <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/573/status-update\">podcast</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/07/ira-glass-i-feel-like-im-actually-sort-of-scared-all-the-time\">Ira Glass</a> talked to a group of girls about their lives online, unpicking the machinations of their Instagram feeds as they watched the comments under their selfies roll in. What he concluded was that the only difference between what these 14-year-olds are doing and what humans everywhere have always done, is that their statuses are transparent, and noisy, and constantly updating. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m a brand,\u201d said 13-year-old Julia, both its director and product. \u201cTo stay relevant\u2026\u201d Her friend Jane finishes her sentence \u201c\u2026you have to work hard.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the study, Nick Harrop, campaigns manager of <a href=\"http://www.youngminds.org.uk/?gclid=CPLo6Oyv384CFReeGwodg7oMyA\">YoungMinds</a> charity, said social media \u201cputs pressure on girls to live their lives in the public domain, to present a personal \u2018brand\u2019 from a young age, and to seek reassurance in the form of likes and shares.\u201d But that pressure, for a person to be a brand, doesn\u2019t come from social media. It comes from believing that your image is the only thing you can control and that, when careers and security feel like fairytales, individualism is the only way to succeed. These problems don\u2019t disappear when you sign out of Instagram.</p> <p>Being offline doesn\u2019t keep you safe, or protect you from anxiety, or make you a better person. If you have a mind that tends to spiral, and the internet enables that unrest, then while long walks without a phone will help, the phone itself is not to blame. As guilty adults we move quickly to hide the things that scare us, never more so than when they relate to children. But to blame social media for this \u201cepidemic\u201d is both to conveniently ignore the more difficult solutions \u2013 a fight for an education system that recognises the importance of non-academic subjects, an effort to improve our relationship with food and bodies so they don\u2019t infect others, a campaign for a country that offers even a teaspoon of hope \u2013 and to place the pressure back on the young people. To say social media is to blame for young people\u2019s anxiety issues is to suggest that the responsibility to get better is theirs. That if they simply remove themselves from social media they will be cured.</p> <p>There are ways to navigate and change the businesses that provide platforms on which many of us live, without condemning them forever.

  "<p>For much of human history, life was well described by <a href=\"http://yalebooksblog.co.uk/2013/04/05/thomas-hobbes-solitary-poor-nasty-brutish-and-short/\">Thomas Hobbes as \u201cnasty, brutish and short\u201d</a>. However, continued scientific, economic and social progress over the centuries has raised living standards and life expectancy. While these benefits have not been spread equally across countries, or even within countries, in general, life is now less nasty, less brutish and certainly less short. The challenge now is to ensure that this progress continues in the face of growing longevity.</p> <p>Over the last 200 years, best practice life expectancy has increased at a near constant rate of more than two years every decade. If this trend continues, a child born in the UK today has more than a 50% chance of living to 105. On average, most of these extra years of life will be healthy ones. It is as if the arc of life has been extended.</p> <p>Our interest is in what this extending arc of life means for individuals and how government can best respond. Currently, the main focus is on dealing with ageing and end-of-life issues such as pensions and healthcare. But longevity is not just about ageing \u2013 it has crucial implications for all ages. Already, people are marrying and having children later, creating mid-career breaks, taking time out to explore, building their own businesses, going back to education. This is already leading to a redefinition of age \u2013 how many times have you heard that 70 is the new 60, or 40 the new 30?</p> <p>Those who live to 100 have around 100,000 extra productive hours than those who live to 70. Undoubtedly, work will take a significant portion of these hours. Historically low interest rates and growing longevity are destroying the inadequate provision societies have made for future pension support. Unless people are prepared to save more, then the inevitable consequence is that they will have to work longer. Already in the UK, one in 10 people over 70 is still in employment, double the figure of 20 years ago.</p> <p>Simple calculation suggests that, given the current level of household savings, those aged 20 today are likely to be working into their late 70s or even early 80s and those in their mid-40s into their early or mid 70s. We need to create a world where this is feasible and beneficial, a way that makes a longer life a blessing and not a curse.</p> <p>However, this is not just about working longer \u2013 the broader challenge is how to restructure social and working lives to make best use of these extra hours. The life structure that emerged in the 20th century \u2013 a three-stage life of education, work and then retirement \u2013 is unlikely to survive this elongation.</p> <p>How can you maintain and build productive assets when most education takes place in your 20s? How can what you have learned remain relevant over the next 60 years against a backdrop of technological upheaval and industrial transformation? There is also the question of vitality \u2013 while an unbroken, extended working life may solve the financial challenge, it will inevitability deplete other important assets of life, such as health and friendships.</p> <p>A way around this is a multi-stage life \u2013 with transitions and breaks in between. In one stage, the focus may be on accumulating financial assets, in another creating a better work-life balance. Sometimes, the switches will be driven by personal choice, at other times forced by technological obsolescence.</p> <p>These multi-stage lives require a proficiency in managing transitions and reflexivity \u2013 imagining possible selves, thinking about the future, reskilling and building new and diverse networks. At its best, it offers people an opportunity to explore who they are and arrive at a way of living that is nearer to their personal values. Might it be that this growing realisation of longevity is behind the oft-stated claims about how \u201cmillennials\u201d have different values and attitudes to previous generations?</p> <p>These new ways of living create opportunities and possibilities. Yet most public debate around longevity is deeply negative. It is dominated by concerns over the risks of ill health and senility and the painful realisation that retirement will not be achieved at the age many expected, nor at the level of financial security imagined. Our existing social institutions are proving inadequate to deal with this increased life expectancy and throwing up stresses and strains that require debate and a new policy agenda.</p> <p>Two pressing issues concern inequality \u2013 both across generations and across income groups. The intergenerational issues are the subject of a Resolution Foundation report <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/stagnation-generation-the-case-for-renewing-the-intergenerational-contract/\">Stagnation Generation: The Case for Renewing the Intergenerational Contract</a>. If long-term economic growth has declined, the current young will be the first for centuries facing the prospect of lower income than their parents. The situation is worsened if government taxes the young in order to make good past promises made to older generations.</p> <p>Longevity has increased over time and so affects each generation differently. Those near retirement want a guarantee about pension income, while those emerging into adulthood need support to make the most of a 100-year life and their multi-stage journey. That means that the intergenerational contract needs rewriting to reflect the fact that the working careers of the young will have very different needs to those of the recently retired.</p> <p>The other pressing inequality is around income. Life expectancy isn\u2019t increasing at the same rate for all, and for some it is declining, with the gap between rich and poor stretching to more than 10 years. Overcoming this gap is challenging. It is possible to redistribute income from the rich, but impossible to distribute years of life. The problem becomes even more acute when retirement ages are increased. If life expectancy isn\u2019t increasing for the poor, but the retirement age is, then there is a real risk of eliminating retirement for many, creating a life that is \u201cnasty, brutish and long\u201d.</p> <p>So what should governments do? There is already a growing focus on end-of-life issues, such as social care and pensions. For pensions, the main focus has been on changing the parameters of a three-stage life \u2013 eg changing retirement age, contribution rates and pension entitlement. These efforts need to be broadened to encompass a wider range of measures that help promote healthy and productive ageing and support a multi-stage life.</p> <p>Two types of policies are crucial. The first is enabling measures designed to set a positive tone for the debate. That people are living longer, healthy lives is not a negative \u2013 it is an opportunity that should be seized. That means shifting age-specific features of the tax and benefits system towards a lifetime approach. Legislation will also be needed to create greater support for those seeking greater flexibility. Take, for example, the length of the working week and provision of holiday time, which are currently standardised. As people realise they may work into their 70s and 80s, they will want to sustain their vitality and productivity by taking sabbaticals and working flexibly. Each will create their way of working and living and legislation will be needed to support this diversity as corporations may be slow to respond, and then for a favoured few. With a longer life, education ceases to be a one-shot game early on, so providing lifetime support, including tax allowances, for further spells of education will be crucial.</p> <p>The other set of policies is supportive \u2013 ensuring that the benefits of a good, long life are spread to the many. Tackling inequality in life expectancy has to be a priority and needs to go beyond the usual platitudes of public education and health expenditure to get a deeper understanding of its causes. Moreover, given the divergence in life expectancy, it seems inevitable that a single retirement age and a uniform state pension cannot be sustainable. Inevitably, this suggests a multi-tiered pension system, with different options of retirement age and pension benefits linked to life expectancy and income.</p> <p>More radically, if differences in investment are what drives inequality, then over a longer life, inequality will increase. During the 20th century, there was significant state investment in free education and infant care \u2013 the key periods of investment for a three-stage life. As increasing life expectancy produces a multi-stage life, there will be plenty of other periods when similar investments are required. The changes required to adapt to a 100-year life are already under way, but governments and businesses lag substantially behind the actions of individuals.</p> <p>This is an agenda for the decades ahead and balancing the very different needs of different groups will be challenging. The danger is that the baby boomers will focus government attention on retirement and healthcare, while the opinions of the young go unheeded about the likes of lifetime education, skill development, flexible working and transitions.</p> <p>The increase in longevity has occurred slowly, but has reached a level that requires a fundamental redefinition of the social and financial institutions that support it. We can each look forward and do our best to prepare ourselves and our families for these longer lives. But the political and policy debate is only just beginning.</p> <p><strong>Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott, professors at London Business School, are the authors of <a href=\"https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/general-books/business-management/The-100-Year-Life-Lynda-Gratton-and-Andrew-Scott-9781472936240\">The 100 Year Life : Living and Working in an Age of Longevity</a>.<em> </em>To assess how prepared you are for a longer life visit http://www.100yearlife.com/diagnostic.

  "<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/03/some-blunt-truths-and-a-ray-of-hope-for-the-refugee-justice-movement\">Sydney Opera House\u2019s Festival of Dangerous Ideas</a> nears the end of its first day, a well-heeled middle-aged couple are browsing the pop-up bookshop selling works by the festival\u2019s headliners. The woman taps her husband on the shoulder and holds up a copy of Andrew Bolt\u2019s new book, Worth Fighting For.</p> <p>\u201cDarl, why don\u2019t we get this for your dad?\u201d she asks teasingly, a grin on her face.</p> <p>Her husband, dressed impeccably in a tweed suit jacket and trilby hat, visibly recoils at the suggestion, looking her up and down as though a spell has suddenly fallen from his eyes and he\u2019s discovered he\u2019s been tricked into marrying a snake.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Janet, no! What are you thinking?\u201d</p> <p>Needless to say, the festival is not Bolt\u2019s usual crowd. The yearly talkfest has a reputation for attracting well-moneyed progressives of the pre-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull variety, which made Bolt\u2019s appearance as the guest of choice for the regular \u201cHow Many Dangerous Ideas Can One Person Have?\u201d fixture something of an odd fit.</p> <p>Bolt and the festival hardly have the most cordial of histories. In 2014, he railed against <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/honor-killing-speech-cancelled-critics-blamed/news-story/0db8d6142c7c687e88d78bdeae294ea1\">the programmed appearance</a> of writer Uthman Badar, who was to speak on the ethics of \u201chonour killings\u201d, and contributed to the event\u2019s swift cancellation. Two years later, the announcement that Bolt himself was being given a prime spot on the lineup likewise prompted outrage, with the Indigenous actor <a href=\"https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/arts-and-culture/nakkiah-lui-leads-charge-of-people-wanting-andrew-/34e14d21-778a-4e79-9eaf-16e402282b92.htm\">Nakkiah Lui leading a petition</a> to have him dropped from the event on the grounds that giving him a platform amounted to \u201clegitimising his hate speech and closing your doors to those he vilifies\u201d.</p> <p>The Opera House, which said little throughout the kerfuffle, defended the decision to invite Bolt: \u201cThe FODI session is a rare opportunity to interrogate the views and ideas that Mr Bolt will present\u201d. </p> <p>Such an opportunity doesn\u2019t come often. While he hardly needs additional platforms from which to sell himself, Bolt exercises strict control over almost every iteration of his public profile. His columns go to print in newspapers that share his ideological leanings. The guests on his TV show, The Bolt Report, are usually either his fellow travellers or someone he wants to give a talking to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/03/some-blunt-truths-and-a-ray-of-hope-for-the-refugee-justice-movement\">Some blunt truths and a ray of hope for the refugee justice movement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So there was a genuine reason for someone not of Bolt\u2019s political persuasion to go along: how would this very prolific, powerful influence on our political landscape do in an arena not of his choosing? Against a live, unpredictable and probably hostile audience willing to challenge him? </p> <p>The answer, unfortunately, was not forthcoming; the long-awaited Great Clash of Ideas in the hopefully named Drama Theatre never materialised. What transpired instead was an hour-long fizzer: half puff-piece interview, half talking points regurgitation. </p> <p>Besides his standard denunciations of the ABC, the Racial Discrimination Act, climate change \u201cwarmism\u201d \u2013 \u201cIn what other field of human endeavour do you hear \u2018the science is settled\u2019? What kind of moron says that?\u201d \u2013 Bolt happily used the furore around his appearance to play the martyr card when it suited. \u201cThe security you\u2019ve had to arrange for this event, it\u2019s not to save you!\u201d he joked to the audience early on, putting forward an argument that his dangerous ideas place himself in more danger than anybody else.</p> <p>FODI cofounder Simon Longstaff, who MCed the event and interviewed Bolt for close to an hour, was less of a foil than he was a wet napkin. Strange gaps in Bolt\u2019s free speech-at-all-costs mantra went unchallenged \u2013 like when he wondered out loud why \u201cpeople can protest wherever they like\u201d and why protesters feel the need to \u201ccreate a great nuisance to other people\u201d. (Presumably Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, who headlined her own event two hours later, would have a thing or two to say about that.) </p> <p>Nor did Bolt\u2019s own campaign to remove Badar from the lineup in 2014 come up. At the end, Longstaff thanked the crowd for facilitating \u201ca celebration of reason, rather than righteous indignation\u201d, adding that he \u201ccan\u2019t stand the yelling that goes on\u201d.</p> <p>The hour might have benefited from a bit of yelling, if only to liven things up a bit. The fifteen minutes for questions at the end didn\u2019t bring the robust debate and interrogation the Opera House hoped would justify Bolt\u2019s appearance, with proceedings quickly devolving into a weird, slightly unsettling love-in.</p> <p>\u201cThank you so much, you\u2019re brave, you\u2019re courageous, we love you,\u201d gushed one young questioner. Another, who began his question with the phrase \u201cas a libertarian\u201d, spent the next five minutes talking about what we can learn from the French Revolution. The single audience member who asked a mildly challenging question, inquiring if his position on human-induced climate change was softening given new evidence, was yelled at to \u201cget out\u201d by someone in the crowd and scoffed at by Bolt himself. </p> <p>For a festival that prides itself on being \u201cdangerous\u201d, arguably the biggest sin FODI committed in pencilling Bolt in was that of being boring. People who agree with Bolt showed up to cheer him on, people who don\u2019t went to watch race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane instead and security ensured no one too suspicious-looking did any event hijacking. After all that fuss, no one in the audience came away with anything different to what they carried in.</p>",
  "<p>I have been trying \u2013 so far, I confess, without success \u2013 to discover who minted the phrase \u201cpolitical honeymoon\u201d. It is a strange expression: marriage is rarely an appropriate metaphor for a country\u2019s relationship with its leader. It describes an odd quirk of electorates. The public tell pollsters that they are most enthusiastically in favour of a leader in his or her opening period in office, precisely the time when voters know least about the person who has just taken charge.</p> <p>Theresa May is benefiting from this irrational phenomenon and enjoying much higher approval ratings than those of David Cameron during his final chapter at Number 10. The British are often held to be a cynical bunch, but this country usually awards some sort of honeymoon to a new prime minister. John Major had one when he succeeded Margaret Thatcher and pulled off the clever trick of making the country think that they\u2019d got a new government as well as a new leader. Tony Blair had a long and even intense one after he won his first election in 1997. Hard though it may be to recall now, Labour didn\u2019t lose a seat at a byelection in his first six years at Number 10. At one point, his pollsters were telling him that Mr Blair had an approval rating of above 90%, the sort of numbers you would usually only expect for the leader of North Korea.</p> <p>Gordon Brown had such a hot romance with the electorate when he first moved into Number 10 that he was tempted to call a snap general election. Then he got cold feet and that was the end of his honeymoon. David Cameron had a relatively long period of grace with the electorate after 2010, partly because a lot of the flak for unpopular decisions in the early years of the coalition was deflected on to the Lib Dems.</p> <p>The honeymoon being enjoyed by Mrs May has some features specific to her personality and circumstances. Since she arrived at Number 10, she has combined the novelty of change with the reassurance of the familiar. She was a well-known, if not that well-understood, figure after a long stretch as home secretary. She looks the part as prime minister. After all the turbulence around the Brexit referendum and its aftermath, she has come across as a stabilising presence. At the same time, she is also something different, the first female prime minister in more than a quarter of a century and only the second woman at Number 10 in our history. The media, as is usually the case with a new prime minister, are being reasonably well-disposed towards her. In her honeymoon period, she can get a positive headline out of the admission that she doesn\u2019t like the shape of her nose. The Tory press like her, at least for now. They never really warmed to her predecessor; the rightwing tabloids hated Mr Cameron for the Leveson inquiry and they then went to war against him over Europe. The leftish media are still calibrating their gunsights or too preoccupied with the self-immolation of the Labour party to be concentrating on Mrs May.</p> <p>Defining yourself against your predecessor, even when they were of the same party, is one of the oldest tricks played by new prime ministers. John Major extracted a lot of mileage out of not being Margaret Thatcher. Gordon Brown did well for a short while by not being Tony Blair. Mrs May has scored some quick, easy hits by striking contrasts with Mr Cameron. She has \u2013 at least in words, we will see about the reality \u2013 junked the austerity agenda. She has talked some one-nation language about social reform. Many of her statements since she moved into Number 10 have been implicit, and sometimes explicit, rebukes of the Cameron government for being too posh, too privileged, too metropolitan and too obsessed with what she likes to disparage as \u201cpolitical games\u201d. Her people often refer to the Cameron cabinet as \u201cthe previous regime\u201d as if it was a government of a different party and conveniently forgetting that Mrs May sat in that cabinet for six years.</p> <p>Nick Clegg\u2019s forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/nick-clegg-did-not-cater-tories-brazen-ruthlessness\" title=\"\">memoir </a>is not friendly \u2013 he accuses her of misrepresenting immigration statistics \u2013 but the more wounding revelations are probably those at the expense of David Cameron and George Osborne. The former deputy prime minister gives an example of their games-playing when he reports that they weren\u2019t interested in building more social housing on the grounds that it \u201cjust creates Labour voters\u201d. Mrs May has also been helped because the vote to leave the European Union has not had the immediately traumatic economic consequences that some forecast. This doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the long-term impact, but it has been a short-term fillip for the government. The bounce on the stock market has been accompanied by a rally in the Tory party\u2019s poll rating, which currently hovers around the 40 point mark, an improvement on their vote share in the 2015 election. Then there is the competition \u2013 or lack of it. Having achieved what it existed to get, Ukip is trying to work out its continuing, post-Farage point. The Lib Dems struggle to get their voice heard. Labour is going through its own special kind of existential hell. No wonder some of Mrs May\u2019s senior colleagues are bewildered that she has ruled out an early election to capitalise on all these advantages while she still has them.</p> <p>For when parliament returns this week it will be a reminder that her structural position is weak. The Conservatives have a working majority of just 17, which is smaller than the number of people she sacked from the government when she culled the Camborne circle. If there was a common denominator to her purge, it was that the sacked were allies of the previous prime minister or friends of the former chancellor. The dispossessed may have lost their ministries, but they are still MPs. They will bide their time and nurture their wrath, waiting to unleash it when Mrs May starts to trip and fumble.</p> <p>She has so far defined herself more in words than deeds. Mrs May is a relatively blank canvas on which Tories of different persuasions can paint their hopes, their dreams and their fantasies. Trouble will start when she starts to put flesh on Mayism. We have had a couple of harbingers. One was the negative reaction to the decision to water down the government\u2019s anti-obesity strategy. Another was the recent revelation that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/lunch-with-theresa-may-thatll-will-be-3150\" title=\"\">\u00a33,150 will buy you into a \u201cbusiness day\u201d</a> at the Tory conference, Mrs May\u2019s presence included in the price of the ticket. People make the point, no less potent for being obvious, that offering companies the chance to purchase access to the prime minister sits badly with her rhetorical flourishes about being on the side of the many, not \u201cthe privileged few\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s travails are a mixed blessing for the Conservatives. A weak opposition encourages two dangerous traits of the Tory beast: arrogance and ill-discipline. When I recently suggested to one of Mrs May\u2019s cabinet that the implosion of the Labour party was not good news for the Tories over the longer term because it would foment their own divisions, he replied: \u201cI regret to say that I think you are completely accurate.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs May has a thing about discipline. As home secretary, she was not famous for being either a delegator or a sharer of information with colleagues. This style is clearly being imported into her Number 10. She has told civil servants that she wants a more formal style of decision-making. Unlike her predecessor, she will not make the first announcement of a parliamentary vote on a military intervention via Twitter. Number 10 has issued an edict around Whitehall that all media bids for interviews with ministers, and on whatever topic, however significant or inconsequential, must now be cleared through Downing Street.</p> <p>This will frustrate the broadcasters, who have all those hours of airtime to fill, and is already generating consternation, annoyance and resistance in departments. One minister, speaking to us without clearance from Number 10, describes this control order as \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d. Mrs May is not the first prime minister to try this and I suspect that, like others before her, she will discover that it is just not achievable for Number 10 to try to impose this level of domination. Some will put it down to control-freakery. Others will see it as an angry reaction to the cabinet leaks and spats about Brexit over August. A third explanation is nerves. Mrs May and the new team at Number 10 sit atop a government with a slender majority, a cabinet with some extremely combustible egos and a party with deep divisions that cannot be long disguised by the meaningless mantra of \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Mrs May has had just over 50 days in Number 10, during which she has done a deft job of obscuring her vulnerabilities by projecting herself as a fresh yet solid leader serenely stepping in to take charge. But she, more than anyone else, will understand how shaky is the ground beneath her feet, how uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. She\u2019s also been around long enough to know that the one certain thing about honeymoons is that they come to an end.</p>",
  "<p>He laughed like his mother, a dry cackle that went on until they both ran out of breath. That\u2019s what lawyer Anna Copeland noticed when she listened to the last phone calls Jayden Bennell made before his death in a West Australian prison in 2013.</p> <p>One of the tapes was a call between Bennell and his mother, Maxine. A single word would crack them both up, chewing through the minutes of his phone allowance.</p> <p>\u201cHe knew me really well, like in my voice, in my demeanour, everything,\u201d Maxine Bennell said. \u201cAnd I knew him just as well. He was a wicked kid, man.\u201d</p> <p>Bennell died when he was 20-years-old. He was a Bibbulmun Noongar man, one of 400 Indigenous Australians to die in custody in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/15/aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-25-years-on-the-vicious-cycle-remains\">the 25 years since</a> the landmark royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody and the first to die while serving a sentence under WA\u2019s three-strikes mandatory sentencing burglary laws, which have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/11/un-call-to-abolish-mandatory-sentencing-rejected-by-wa-and-nt\">condemned by the United Nations</a>.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/indigenous-man-jayden-bennell-missing-four-hours-found-dead-wa-prison-cupboard\">four-day inquest in Perth last week</a> heard he was found hanged in an unlocked cleaning storage room at Casuarina maximum security prison at 3.45pm on 6 March 2013, in what police, coronial and internal prisons investigators deemed to be a suicide. </p> <p>But the inquest did not hear exactly when he had died, where he was hanging, or why he remained undiscovered for more than two hours when there were<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/guards-asked-repeatedly-to-find-jayden-bennell-inquest-told\"> apparent attempts by Indigenous drug and alcohol workers to find him</a>.</p> <p>It took 23 months for the police officer working in the coronial investigation unit to file his report. Thirty-one months for Maxine\u2019s lawyers, including Copeland, the supervising solicitor at Southern Communities Advocacy Legal Education Services, and Melbourne-based legal firm Shine, to get access to the coronial brief. Three-and-a-half years to get to inquest. That\u2019s a long time for questions to remain unanswered.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can still feel the coldness coming off my son\u2019s body</p> <footer> <cite>Maxine Bennell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Asked how she remained focused, Maxine held her hand far above her head. \u201cI\u2019m out here,\u201d she said, in an interview with Guardian Australia this week. \u201cI\u2019m representing him, not myself. He had a lot of respect so I got to remember I\u2019m representing him.\u201d</p> <p>Jayden Stafford Bennell was born on 13 May 1992. His twin brother, Keegan, was stillborn.</p> <p>He was a talker, Maxine said, a \u201ctrue Bennell\u201d like his grandfather, the poet and playwright Eddie Bennell. </p> <p>They moved about when he was younger, when Maxine was fleeing a violent partner, but returned to Perth for primary school when he was six. When he reached high school, he and Dillion, the first of six younger brothers, would enter skating competitions (Jayden on a scooter, Dillion on rollerblades) and he won so frequently the judges had to pull him aside. </p> <p>\u201cThey told him they he can do all the competitions but they can\u2019t keep saying that he\u2019s the winner because no one else is winning,\u201d Maxine said. \u201cHe was cruel talented, cruel talented at a lot of things.\u201d </p> <p>He was a funny kid, she said. A smart kid. Respectful, for all his trouble with the law.</p> <p>\u201cAny short amount of time what he wasn\u2019t in jail for, he hurt life,\u201d Maxine said. \u201cHe had the best time. And he enjoyed every single bit of it. You know, whenever he could.\u201d</p> <p>Bennell\u2019s first run-in with police was at Tammin, a wheatbelt town about 180km east of Perth. It\u2019s a very boring place for a child, Maxine said; Bennell and his cousins broke into the school to steal balloons and lollies. She yelled until he confessed to police and was let off with a warning. A few years later, aged 12, he stole a marker pen from a shop in Rockingham. He was charged, bailed, bailed again through numerous court dates when his lawyer didn\u2019t turn up to court and eventually breached bail and was remanded in custody at Rangeview detention centre when he was 14.</p> <p>It was a pattern that continued throughout his teenage years. He was in and out of detention for burglaries and minor theft, forgetting court dates, breaching bail. It built up his security rating until he was placed in a maximum security prison as an adult: not for a violent crime but for a litany of procedural offences. </p> <p>Even some of the burglary offences, Maxine said, were of his own making: she had always told him to fess up to police so he rode shotgun in the patrol car, pointing out houses he\u2019d broken into. It upset an older detective, who pulled Maxine and Bennell aside during one of his stints at Banksia Hill detention centre: \u201cHe said, \u2018my officers are taking advantage \u2026 I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t like how they\u2019re questioning you, you don\u2019t have to answer\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Bennell was remanded in custody for the last time on 30 April 2012, just 24 days after being released following a nine-month sentence. </p> <p>Maxine said Bennell was bitterly disappointed with himself and told her not to change his room. The next time he got out, he said, he would stay out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80d2af6e98a2b9ee9d5ef616dbf9f2d5e6dff415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80d2af6e98a2b9ee9d5ef616dbf9f2d5e6dff415/0_0_4003_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A march against Aboriginal deaths in custody\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A march against Aboriginal deaths in custody.

And that\u2019s twice I\u2019ve felt that now. I never thought \u2013 which is stupid \u2013 I never thought my son would die in jail.\u201d </p> <p>Maxine has been investigating what happened to her son, both alone and with the help of her lawyers, since his death, digging up the prison\u2019s policies on hanging points and CCTV cameras and looking up photos of ligature marks on the internet. A steady stream of folded yellow notes went from her hand to her counsel, Steven Castan, demanding more specific answers from witnesses.</p> <p>Bennell was supposed to attend a drug and alcohol program called Pathways on the afternoon that he died. The session ran from 1.30pm to 3.30pm. The last record of Bennell alive was a phone call he attempted to place to his cousin at 1.26pm. He was officially reported missing at the 3.15pm muster and located, in a room that was routinely left unlocked from 7.30am to 6.30pm so prisoners could access cleaning equipment to tidy their cells, on the third recount at 3.45pm.</p> <p>The Pathways program was facilitated by two Indigenous men, Benjamin Moodie and Russell Butler. Moodie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/guards-asked-repeatedly-to-find-jayden-bennell-inquest-told\">told the inquest</a> he had asked a prison guard in the education control booth to put in a call to find Bennell three times, about 1.35pm, 2pm and 2.30pm.</p> <p>Andrew Hall, a prison guard who was rostered in the education control booth that day but was not asked to give a statement to the coroner until last month, said that he could not recall being asked to find Bennell but that if he was only asked once he would probably not remember: it had, after all, been three-and-a-half years.</p> <p>He also said it was possible that he was out of the control booth at various points and only took one of the calls, but Moodie maintained he spoke to the same guard every time. </p> <p>Moodie and Butler were also not asked to provide a statement to the inquest until this year, Moodie in February and Butler in August. But, unlike Hall, both said they remembered that day well, despite the department later questioning, based on a note scribbled on a roster, whether it had been Butler in attendance or another Indigenous man.</p> <p>Moodie and Butler both said they had known and liked Bennell. Both cried on the stand.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that Mr Moodie and Mr Butler would be wrong in the sense that it is something that would be significant to them in a way that it\u2019s not significant to the other prison officers,\u201d coroner Sarah Linton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/guards-asked-repeatedly-to-find-jayden-bennell-inquest-told\">said</a>.</p> <p>The evidence that people had been looking for Bennell was only acquired through Maxine\u2019s persistence, Castan told the court. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every single bit of that information has been hard-fought and that\u2019s been frustrating</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Copeland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEvery single bit of that information has been hard-fought and that\u2019s been frustrating too because you think if we had of got that information first up we could have spent our energies on questions that are more systemic \u2026 on what is wrong with this system that young black men keep dying,\u201d Copeland told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>The corrections department\u2019s death in custody review attributed Bennell\u2019s death to his poor mental health and also found that his mental health treatment at Casuarina had been adequate despite him neither seeing a psychiatrist nor taking his prescribed antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs for the five months he was there before his death.</p> <p>Richard Mudford, who conducted the review, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/no-urgency-and-no-risk-in-jayden-bennell-being-unaccounted-for\">told the inquest</a> he did not seek to speak to Moodie or Butler and did not assess the risk posed by the cleaning storage room, which he said in evidence was \u201criddled\u201d with hanging points. He conceded his review was \u201cinformative but was not thorough.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Daniels, the head of the prison\u2019s ligature minimisation program, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/guards-asked-repeatedly-to-find-jayden-bennell-inquest-told\">said</a> he also didn\u2019t consider the risk posed by the room because his program was confined to minimising hanging points in cells only. Besides, he said, it was too full of pipes and ducting: the only way to minimise the risk was to lock the door.</p> <p>\u201cJust how easy it is to lock that door?\u201d Maxine said. \u201cMy son be still alive, hey. It didn\u2019t cost no money ... it took someone saying alright, from now on, we\u2019ll lock that door. What\u2019s that, two sentences? My son be still alive.</p> <p>\u201cMy whole point is, if my son kill himself by his own hand \u2026 I\u2019ve already dealt with this, I\u2019ve got to deal with this.</p> <p>\u201cBut before I even contemplate dealing with that, I\u2019m going to make sure you bastards answer \u2013 why didn\u2019t you look after my son?\u201d</p> <p>Access to the room was restricted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/room-prisoner-jayden-bennell-died-in-left-unlocked-until-last-week-inquest-told\">a week before the inquest</a> started in case media reports sparked copycat incidents.

Such rights were a valuable part of the prison\u2019s commitment to self-determination, Southgate said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47f267754f535ad43d839f051a86bd2f6cd01452\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47f267754f535ad43d839f051a86bd2f6cd01452/633_288_4459_2678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators at a protest to draw attention to deaths of Indigenous Australians while in custody\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators at a protest to draw attention to deaths of Indigenous Australians while in custody.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Hunt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And besides, he said, most of the deaths by apparent self-harm at Casuarina \u2013 there have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/13/indigenous-prisoner-who-killed-himself-wasnt-in-a-safe-cell-despite-being-at-risk\">four reported hangings of Indigenous men at that prison</a> since Bennell\u2019s death \u2013 occurred in the prisoner\u2019s cell.</p> <p>Incidentally, Daniels said, Bennell\u2019s cell was full of hanging points. At least 20, by his rough count. It was in an older wing that had not been subject to the ligature minimisation program.</p> <p>Removing ligature points was a recommendation of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody but Daniels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/guards-asked-repeatedly-to-find-jayden-bennell-inquest-told\">said he was not aware of the commission\u2019s findings</a>. He was not alone: neither the prison guards, nor detective sergeants Keith Williams and Alex West, who investigated Bennell\u2019s death for the major crime and coronial investigations units respectively, said they were aware of specific recommendations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alrm.org.au/information/General%20Information/Royal%20Commission%20into%20Aboriginal%20Deaths%20in%20Custody.pdf\">Recommendation 35</a> states that all deaths in custody be investigated as a homicide and that suicide should never be presumed, based on a string of case studies from the 1980s, which were miss-labelled suicide.</p> <p>Bennell had previously been treated for general psychotic symptoms. Dr Mark Hall, his psychiatrist from 2010 to 2012, said Bennell experienced visual flashes and paranoia but was never diagnosed. He was tried on a range of medications, some of which he stopped taking and some of which stopped working even when he was taking them consistently. </p> <p>Dr Hall said Bennell only spoke of suicide once, in their first session, but that being off medication for five months, as he was in Casuarina, without a psychiatric review to figure out why he\u2019d stopped taking him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/31/indigenous-prisoner-jayden-bennell-showed-suicide-risk-inquest-told\">would have heightened his risk</a>.</p> <p>According to the evidence before the inquest the only person who noticed any increased risk of suicide \u2013 though he didn\u2019t recognise it as such \u2013 was Bennell\u2019s cellmate, Craig Scortaoili, a Noongar man two years his senior who had known him on the outside, when they used to graffiti buildings in Rockingham.</p> <p>Scortaoili told the inquest Bennell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/cellmate-of-jayden-bennell-who-died-in-custody-says-suicide-note-wasnt-genuine\">had a vision of himself hanging</a> a few weeks before his death, while high on solvent fumes, and had appeared distressed by his crimes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/no-urgency-and-no-risk-in-jayden-bennell-being-unaccounted-for\">'No urgency and no risk' in Jayden Bennell being unaccounted for</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also told the inquest Bennell had become obsessed with a song he wanted played at his funeral, playing it on a loop, and said that song was playing when he returned to their cell about 1.50pm on March 6, when Bennell, the inquest heard, was most likely already in the cleaning store cupboard.</p> <p>It was Scortaoili who found what\u2019s alleged to be a suicide note, written on the first page of an exercise book left on top of the stereo. </p> <p>\u201cI grabbed the book and opened it and on the first page there was a letter to his mum,\u201d he told the inquest via video link from Acacia prison. \u201cI read the first line and then I stopped ...
