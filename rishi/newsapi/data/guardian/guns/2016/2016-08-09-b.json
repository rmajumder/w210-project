  "<p>The Baltimore police department regularly conducted unlawful stops and used excessive force on residents of the city, federal officials found in a civil rights probe.</p> <p>The damning <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/09/us/document-Baltimore-P-D-Findings-Report-FINAL.html\">findings</a> by the US justice department (DoJ), set to be officially announced on Wednesday, identify a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of unconstitutional conduct in the city. </p> <p>The justice department launched its investigation into the city\u2019s policing a month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/freddie-gray\">Freddie Gray\u2019s death</a> last year. Gray, a 25-year-old African American man, died a week after he was arrested from a spinal injury sustained while he was held in the back of a police van. The city erupted in weeks of unrest, including numerous mass demonstrations against police brutality and a day of rioting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-decision-black-lives-matter\">The Freddie Gray decision signals black people are to blame for their own deaths | Brittany Packnett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report found a vast racial disparity in enforcement, especially in stops, searches, and discretionary misdemeanor arrests. African Americans, for instance, account for 91% of \u201cfailure to obey\u201d and trespassing charges, and over 80% of charges such as making a false statement to an officer or disorderly conduct, even though they account for roughly 60% of the population. African Americans were arrested for the possession of drugs more than five times as frequently as their white counterparts, although drug use, the report notes, is roughly the same.</p> <p>Justice department officials found that residents believe there are \u201ctwo Baltimores\u201d, including \u201cone wealthy and largely white, the second impoverished and predominantly black\u201d, the report reads. \u201cCommunity members living in the City\u2019s wealthier and largely white neighborhoods told us that officers tend to be respectful and responsive to their needs, while many individuals living in the City\u2019s largely African-American communities informed us that officers tend to be disrespectful and do not respond promptly to their calls for service. Members of these largely African-American communities often felt they were subjected to unjustified stops, searches, and arrests, as well as excessive force.\u201d</p> <p>The report documented extensive evidence of these perceived racial disparities. It found that over a five-year period, African Americans accounted for 95% of people stopped by police more than 10 times. One African American man, according to the report, was stopped 30 times in less than four years. \u201cDespite these repeated intrusions, none of the 30 stops resulted in a citation or criminal charge,\u201d the report states.</p> <p>This finding falls into a nationwide debate about unfair traffic stops of African Americans after the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/sandra-bland\">Sandra Bland</a> in Texas last year and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a> in a Minnesota traffic stop last month. Although Castile had been stopped 46 times, only six of those were for offenses that an officer could have seen before stopping the car. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebfe13a46182500bf66c29fce29b870d3126be40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebfe13a46182500bf66c29fce29b870d3126be40/0_213_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A gathering to remember Freddie Gray, and all victims of police violence, during a rally outside city hall in Baltimore, Maryland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A gathering to remember Freddie Gray, and all victims of police violence, during a rally outside city hall in Baltimore, Maryland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Woolston/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report \u201creveals a widespread pattern of BPD officers stopping and detaining people on Baltimore streets without reasonable suspicion that they are involved in criminal activity. This conduct violates the fourth amendment.\u201d </p> <p>In one case, while DoJ officials shadowed officers on patrol, a supervisor advised a patrol officer to \u201cmake something up\u201d in order to justify a stop.</p> <p>The report shows that training and supervision within the department are so lacking that often officers\u2019 own reports fail to provide a justifiable reason for stopping a citizen, frequently relying on judgment of a \u201chigh crime\u201d area or fear for \u201cofficer safety\u201d.</p> <p>In one example, officers stopped an African American man for wearing a hoodie and putting his hands in his pockets on a cold January evening. \u201cAlthough there was no basis to detain the man, two officers attempted to handcuff and shackle him, while one officer struck him \u2018in the face, ribs, and back\u2019 with fists,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe man continued to resist being shackled as additional officers arrived, one of whom tased the man twice to prevent him from \u2018escap[ing] the scene\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Ultimately, the man was not charged and although the supervisor noted that the man had been beaten and shocked with a Taser, \u201cthe sergeant\u2019s report of the incident concluded that the \u2018officers showed great restraint and professionalism\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>In one of the most overt examples of racial bias, a supervisor sent a sample report for trespassing arrests to a sergeant and patrol officer with many blanks to be filled in, \u201cincluding the arrest data and location and the suspect\u2019s name and address, but does not include a prompt to fill in the race or gender of the arrestee. Rather, the words \u2018black male\u2019 are automatically included in the description of the arrest. The supervisor\u2019s template thus presumes that individuals arrested for trespassing will be African American.\u201d </p> <p>The report traced these police practices back to the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies of the late 1990s, which \u201cled to repeated violations of the constitutional and statutory rights, further eroding the community\u2019s trust in the police\u201d.</p> <p>Although the report notes that the police department has made progress, it is clear that the \u201clegacy of zero tolerance enforcement continues to drive its policing in certain Baltimore neighborhoods and leads to unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests\u201d.</p> <p>The report concludes that \u201cBPD\u2019s systemic constitutional and statutory violations are rooted in structural failures\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ede38d02ab714b1641a28e28c90cd16862d482a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ede38d02ab714b1641a28e28c90cd16862d482a/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018African-American communities often felt they were subjected to unjustified stops, searches, and arrests, as well as excessive force,\u2019 reads the report.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018African-American communities often felt they were subjected to unjustified stops, searches, and arrests, as well as excessive force,\u2019 reads the report.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Taggart/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In finding that the department violated rights guaranteed by the constitution, the DoJ\u2019s conclusions were similar to those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/04/ferguson-police-racial-persecution-federal-report\">in its report</a> on the Ferguson, Missouri, police department, which began following the death of Michael Brown. That investigation resulted in a consent decree agreement between the Department of Justice and the city of Ferguson that laid out a series of mandated reforms.</p> <p>In Baltimore, the DoJ says it is already working with the city to \u201cforge a court-enforceable agreement to develop enduring remedies to the constitutional and statutory violations we found\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/police-officer-related-deaths-department-of-justice\">Police will be required to report officer-involved deaths under new US system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked for the justice department review last year in the wake of Gray\u2019s death. After a series of violent months in the city and a scathing \u201cafter action\u201d report that condemned police handling of the riots that followed Gray\u2019s death, Rawlings-Blake fired the then police commissioner, Anthony Batts, and replaced him with Kevin Davis.</p> <p>Six officers were also charged in Gray\u2019s death. But after a mistrial and three acquittals, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-police-officers-charges-dropped\">dropped the remaining charges</a>.</p> <p>At a press conference on the report, Rawlings-Blake said there was no connection between the trials of the officers in the Freddie Gray case and the DoJ report. But state\u2019s attorney Marilyn Mosby saw a direct link between the reforms that the department has already undertaken \u2013 such as a new use of force policy that favors de-escalation and cameras in the back of police vans \u2013 to the trials of the officers. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the vast majority of Baltimore city police officers are good officers, we also know that there are bad officers and that the department has routinely failed to oversee, train, or hold bad actors accountable,\u201d Mosby said. \u201cSince the death of Freddie Gray, a number of reforms have been put in place as a result of the prosecution of the six police officers.\u201d </p> <p>Police commissioner Kevin Davis said that action had already been taken to remove officers involved in the most egregious incidents, noting that he has fired six officers so far in 2016. But he identified with citizen outrage over the findings. </p> <p>\u201cWe know that our citizens are outraged at some of the details included in this report. And they should be. Citizens can\u2019t be expected to respect an agency if the trust of that agency is breached,\u201d said Davis at the press conference. \u201cThis report is not an indictment of every man and woman who has the privilege of wearing this uniform, this patch, and this badge. This report is however an indictment of those bad behaviors by a relatively small number of police officers over many, many years. There are officers right now that are just as offended to see the details that are laid out in this report.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56595f5587f89c94f337f338c9694f89e9fe65c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56595f5587f89c94f337f338c9694f89e9fe65c6/0_33_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (center), police commissioner Kevin Davis (left) and deputy assistant attorney general Vanita Gupta (right) speak at the press conference on the DoJ report.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (center), police commissioner Kevin Davis (left) and deputy assistant attorney general Vanita Gupta (right) speak at the press conference on the DoJ report.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Local activist group Baltimore Bloc says that the report is a \u201cverification of our daily life in Baltimore\u201d and an indictment of the city\u2019s failed leadership. The report strongly condemns the department for violating \u201cthe First Amendment by retaliating against individuals engaged in constitutionally protected activities\u201d. <br><br>\u201cIt troubles me to read how frequently the Baltimore City Police Department has engaged in various disturbing patterns or practices, including excessive use of force and unjustified and severe disparities in the rates of stops, searches, and arrests of African Americans,\u201d congressman Elijah Cummings said in a statement. \u201cThe statistics are simply astounding, and the unconstitutional violations of our citizens\u2019 rights are unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Sherrilyn Ifill of the NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund, called the findings \u201cdevastating\u201d, adding that: \u201cthe city\u2019s residents will need a few days to absorb the findings in this unsparing report. But then it will be critical to begin the hard work of ensuring that this federal investigatory process yields real and lasting change in Baltimore.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The judge in the Stanford sexual assault trial is facing renewed calls for his removal over his decision to sentence a man to less than a week in jail for possessing child abuse images, an offense that typically results in much harsher consequences, records show.</p> <p>Judge Aaron Persky ordered Robert James Chain, a 48-year-old northern California man who pleaded guilty to possessing child abuse images, to serve a four-day sentence in 2015. Police reports reveal that officers who searched Chain\u2019s house found dozens of disturbing videos and images of minors, including one depicting the sexual assault of an infant.</p> <p>The sentence \u2013 which resulted in Chain ultimately spending only one night in county jail \u2013 provides a sharp contrast to more than a dozen similar cases in the same county in which other judges ordered six months behind bars for defendants convicted of the same felony charge of possessing child abuse images.</p> <p>According to opponents of the judge \u2013 who are running a high-profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/stanford-sexual-assault-judge-recall\">recall campaign against him</a> and have done extensive research on the Chain charges and parallel local cases \u2013 the relatively light sentencing echoes Persky\u2019s questionable punishment of former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner.</p> <p>Persky sentenced Turner to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/stanford-swimmer-sexual-assault-brock-allen-turner-palo-alto\">six months in county jail</a> for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on the university\u2019s Palo Alto campus in 2015. That sentence, which was much lighter than the minimum two years in state prison prescribed by law, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/10/usa-swimming-bans-brock-turner-stanford-sexual-assault-case\">sparked international outrage</a> and prompted accusations that Persky is unfairly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/stanford-sexual-assault-judge-aaron-persky-de-anza-college\">lenient</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/27/stanford-sexual-assault-trial-judge-persky\">privileged men</a> convicted of serious and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/01/sexual-assault-case-brock-turner-judge-aaron-persky\">violent crimes</a>. </p> <p>Chain \u2013 a father of two who lives in Sunnyvale, nine miles south-east of Stanford \u2013 was arrested in May 2014 as part of an investigation by the <a href=\"http://www.svicac.org/\">Silicon Valley Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"274de94286e1f63d4fddfa62f3ba0bf2b753f035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/274de94286e1f63d4fddfa62f3ba0bf2b753f035/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Persky recall campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists from UltraViolet, a national women\u2019s advocacy organization, call for the removal of Judge Aaron Persky from the bench, in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Police found roughly 21 images, including one in which an adult was penetrating a naked infant girl, according to records. Officers also found 188 \u201cchild erotica images and possible child pornography images\u201d along with child abuse videos, investigators wrote. In his initial interview with police, Chain admitted to searching for porn, but declined to say whether children were featured.</p> <p>Chain\u2019s wife allegedly told police that she was aware that her husband \u201clooks at underage images\u201d, an officer wrote. The man was ultimately charged with possessing images, \u201cknowing that the matter depicts a person under the age of 18 years personally engaging in or personally simulating sexual conduct\u201d.</p> <p>The felony charge carried a maximum sentence of three years in state prison. In March 2015, Chain pleaded guilty as part of an arrangement with the court which requires him to register as a sex offender. </p> <p>Persky sentenced him to four days and three years of probation, and because he had already received credit for spending a night behind bars, Chain did not have to return to jail.</p> <p>Chain\u2019s attorney also requested that Persky reduce the felony to a misdemeanor charge, and when he finalized the plea deal, the judge said that he \u201cwould be receptive\u201d to this downgrade after one year of Chain successfully complying with the terms of probation. A hearing on that request is scheduled for 25 August.</p> <p>The district attorney\u2019s office plans to oppose the reduction. </p> <p>Brian Madden, Chain\u2019s lawyer, declined to comment, and Chain could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>The Persky recall campaign\u2019s research on sentencing trends in Santa Clara County from 2012 to 2016 suggests this outcome is unique. Using media coverage on the Silicon Valley task force\u2019s \u201csweeps\u201d, the campaign found 14 other offenders who were charged with the same possession crime and pleaded guilty or no contest.</p> <p>They all had similar amounts and types of child abuse images and, like Chain, were first-time offenders with no significant criminal records.</p> <p>All 14 of the other defendants, however, were sentenced to six months in county jail.</p> <p>Although the researchers said the court\u2019s records system prevented them from reviewing every case during that period, they could not find a single instance in which a defendant convicted of this felony offense received a lighter sentence than six months \u2013 except the Chain case.</p> <p> The 14 cases with six-month sentences were overseen by 11 other judges.</p> <p>\u201cThis is truly disturbing material just like all the others,\u201d said Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law professor leading the recall campaign. \u201cThe only variable that seems different between this case and other cases is that this defendant had Judge Persky.\u201d</p> <p>Dauber, who is a family friend of the victim in the Stanford case, added, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear from our perspective, we have a judge who is not taking the harms of sexual violence and sexual crimes seriously enough.\u201d </p> <p>Joseph Macaluso,<strong> </strong>spokesman for the court, initially referred the Guardian to the local district attorney\u2019s office, suggesting that prosecutors comment on Chain\u2019s plea. But records show the agreement was an \u201copen plea\u201d between the court and the defense attorney \u2013 not a deal with the district attorney\u2019s office. </p> <p>After publication of this article, Macaluso said in an email that \u201cthe defense, district attorney and judge discussed this matter before a sentence was imposed. Should the DA or defense felt it was inappropriate, they would have said so at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Terry Lynn Harman, assistant district attorney in Santa Clara County, said in a statement that the sentence for a first-time possession offense is \u201cgenerally\u201d six months, but that prosecutors didn\u2019t object to the judge\u2019s offer \u201cbecause we were satisfied with the felony plea and sex registration in light of the defendant\u2019s remorse and admission of guilt\u201d.</p> <p>Persky\u2019s defenders have argued that the recall campaign is misguided and will encourage judges to issue harsher sentences across the board, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/stanford-sexual-assault-bill-mandatory-prison-brock-turner\">perpetuates mass incarceration</a> and primarily impacts <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/06/16/could-removing-brock-turner-s-judge-hurt-poor-and-minority-defendants?ref=hp-1-122#.FgQn0zqCu\">low-income people of color</a>. </p> <p>Local public defenders have been particularly vocal in supporting the judge, noting that Persky has been <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a01788e9c0374cf19a942625fde93174/judge-stanford-rape-case-often-follows-sentencing-reports\">consistent and fair</a> to their clients. </p> <p>But even some public defenders said the four-day sentence in this case appeared to be unique. </p> <p>Sajid Khan, a deputy public defender in Santa Clara County who published a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/california-commission-on-judicial-performance-a-letter-in-support-of-judge-aaron-persky-and-judicial-discretion\">petition</a> in support of Persky, said six months was the typical punishment for this offense and that Chain\u2019s outcome seemed \u201cunusual\u201d. </p> <p>Asked about the four-day deal, Andy Gutierrez, another deputy public defender who has expressed support for Persky, said: \u201cThat would be a little bit eye-raising.\u201d</p> <p>This kind of a light sentence is more common for offenses such as disturbing the peace or being intoxicated in public, he added. \u201cPossession of child pornography is a step up from that.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has long held that Hillary Clinton is stealing the election. But on Tuesday <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">he suggested</a> something even darker and more sinister: that his supporters resolve the issue with guns.</p> <p>Specifically, he suggested that using the constitutional right to bear arms may be the only way to stop Clinton from appointing supreme court justices should she win in November. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cAlthough the second amendment people \u2013 maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Whether Trump was suggesting his supporters use their weaponry against Clinton herself or any liberal judges she might go on to appoint is somewhat open to interpretation. Most people are reading it as the former, but either way it\u2019s unacceptable and a violation of what it means to live in a free democracy.</p> <p>This is a new low even for Trump, who\u2019s been accused of inciting general violence and has verbally attacked individuals from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/smear-today-gone-tomorrow-khan-controversy-goes-over-trump-fans-hats\">Khizr Khan</a> to Rosie O\u2019Donnell. But he\u2019s never seemed to incite it against individuals \u2013 until now.</p> <p>Gabby Giffords drove home that point and the pernicious effect those words could have on the unstable, in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cWe must draw a bright red line between political speech and suggestions of violence,\u201d she said. \u201cResponsible, stable individuals won\u2019t take Trump\u2019s rhetoric to its literal end, but his words may provide a magnet for those seeking infamy. They may provide inspiration or permission for those bent on bloodshed.\u201d Those words have special meaning coming from Giffords, whose time in political office was cut short by an assassination attempt that left six dead; she survived but with a critical gunshot wound to the head.</p> <p>Now Trump is pulling the tricks he always does when he says something beyond the pale politically. He\u2019s blaming the media for getting it wrong.</p> <p>Before when he\u2019s implicitly encouraged or used the language of violence \u2013 at rallies when he\u2019s told supporters if they punch a protester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/mar/14/donald-trump-legal-fees-protester-punched-video\">he\u2019ll pay the legal bills</a>, or at campaign stops when <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/266809-trump-i-could-shoot-people-in-streets-and-not-lose-support\">he\u2019s boasted</a> murder wouldn\u2019t drive his supporters away \u2013 he\u2019s walked it back as just another quirky part of his humor. \u201cObviously it was a joke,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3418283/Donald-Trump-says-joking-said-shoot-somebody-win.html\">he later said</a> of the murder brag.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s already spinning this newest threat, saying he meant that second amendment supporters could still stop Clinton\u2019s election \u2013 by voting, sillies!</p> <p>But that line, like much of his campaign rhetoric, is pure bullshit. While there\u2019s some wiggle room in other parts of his statement what\u2019s not up for debate is that he was talking about Clinton\u2019s powers after the election, if she wins \u2013 \u201cif she gets to pick her judges\u201d.</p> <p>You can\u2019t stop someone from winning democratically if they\u2019ve already won a democratic election \u2013 you have to do it criminally, and specifically, according to the rest of Trump\u2019s quote, using \u201cthe second amendment\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019ve no doubt that it\u2019s an unequivocal call for the use of gun violence to upend democracy and one for which Trump should not be given the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>Even more stunning than any of Trump\u2019s stunningly unpresidential behavior is that not every Republican has run straight for the hills. He even had backup from that Republican mainstay organization known as the National Rifle Association, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763110521889402880\">tweeted its support</a> for his initial statement even as it altered its meaning by claiming Trump said if Clinton gets to pick supreme court judges, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p> <p>This is not party politics as usual. This goes beyond mere polarization or the other ills of Washington. It\u2019s an attack on democracy that\u2019s as personal as it is politically vile.</p> <p>Trump was talking in thinly veiled terms about the most personal kind of attack there is \u2013 an attack on the body and specifically, an attack on the body of the first female president. </p> <p>The gendered element of it isn\u2019t lost on party leaders. Elizabeth Warren didn\u2019t mince words on Twitter this evening, saying Donald Trump\u201cmakes death threats because he\u2019s a pathetic coward who can\u2019t handle the fact that he\u2019s losing to a girl.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca Traister <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/08/donald-trump-fraud-claims.html\">has written brilliantly</a> on the long history of powerful men like Trump who would delegitimize the ascent of women and minorities. But this \u2013 to have the nominee of a major party appear to encourage his supporters to assassinate his opponent \u2013 is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, quite likely for the simple reason that we\u2019ve never had a woman this close to the White House steps.</p> <p>Just as the birther movement that Trump helped lead was thinly veiled racism rooted in the belief that a black man couldn\u2019t possibly legitimately be the president, Trump\u2019s insistence that \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d has \u201cstolen\u201d the election thrives among those who are angry that power could be taken from them by a woman, and specifically this one.</p> <p>It\u2019s vulgar, un-American and undemocratic. And it was only a matter of time.</p>",

Trump has repeatedly campaigned on banning all Muslim immigration to the US, called for shutting down mosques in America and most recently picked a fight with the Muslim parents of a fallen Iraq War hero.</p> <p>But years ago, Simmons said Trump accompanied him to a meeting with Muslim leaders at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York, the city\u2019s largest mosque, and was amenable to engaging with the community.</p> <p>\u201cHe was very kind and that was the end of it,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cBut years later, this fire has come up.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s fuelled a lot of hate and a lot of people are ignorant, and he\u2019s helped to promote that ignorance.\u201d </p> <p>Simmons recently launched a campaign, Muslims Speaking Out, which aims to counter Islamophobia in the US by drawing a distinction between terrorists and the greater Muslim community. Simmons formed the initiative through The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, a not-for-profit organization he chairs that seeks to improve relations between ethnic and religious communities. </p> <p>In the Politics for Humans podcast, which examines the Black Lives Matter movement and social justice, Simmons also reflected on his experience as a black male and encounters with law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cAs a young person, I was always afraid of the police, and I have had experiences of being mistreated and yelled at and talked down to,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been afraid when I see them coming.\u201d</p> <p>Even in recent years, Simmons said, he has been pulled over for routine traffic stops and was verbally abused by one police officer who did not immediately recognize him. The cop changed his demeanor when he saw Simmons\u2019 license, but the producer noted that other people of color who are not public figures lack the means to push back against discrimination.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re powerless and you\u2019re black, you don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Simmons said.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, 60 or 70 kids [are] getting shot in Chicago this weekend, and if one little girl in Brooklyn is missing named Becky, they\u2019ll look for her for six months on TV.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo black lives don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s a reality.\u201d</p> <p>Listen to the podcast here: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/politics-for-humans-guardian-us/russell-simmons-talks-black-lives-matter-politics-for-humans-podcast\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F277413066&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Theresa May has held her first telephone call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the two leaders could meet face-to-face in China next month, Downing Street has confirmed.</p> <p>Relations with Russia have been fraught in recent years, with the UK instrumental in pushing for economic sanctions against the Putin regime over its annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p> <p>A statement from the Kremlin hinted at the possibility of a thaw, however. \u201cWhile discussing topical issues in Russian-British relations, both sides expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of cooperation in the political, trade and economic spheres,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The leaders agreed to intensify \u201cjoint work on a number of fronts\u201d, including air transport safety, the Kremlin added.</p> <p>The statement also noted that May had confirmed the UK will take part in commemorations in Arkhangelsk this month marking the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the first Arctic convoys from the UK to the Soviet Union in the second world war.</p> <p>May is keen to demonstrate that the UK remains outward-looking and will continue to play a full role in global diplomacy, despite the public\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.</p> <p>In the run-up to the referendum, remain campaigners, including May\u2019s predecessor, David Cameron, suggested Putin would be pleased by a vote for Brexit because it would destabilise the EU.</p> <p>After the result was declared in June, Putin ridiculed that idea, condemning Cameron\u2019s claims as a \u201cflawed attempt to influence the public opinion in his own country\u201d that did not have the desired result.</p> <p>Both May and Putin are due to attend the G20 summit in China early next month, and Downing Street signalled that the UK would be open to the possibility of a private meeting between them on the sidelines of the meeting.</p> <p>Russia was one of the few countries to give an upbeat response to May\u2019s unexpected decision to appoint Boris Johnson as foreign secretary.</p> <p>Moscow\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zhakarova, said: \u201cThe book of Russo-British relations has long been awaiting someone to turn over to a better page in the history of bilateral cooperation. If Britain\u2019s Foreign Office, under its new leader, has a corresponding desire, we will support it.\u201d</p> <p>The Russian state news outlet Tass described Johnson, whose appointment provoked raised eyebrows in some capitals, as a \u201ccharismatic\u201d man, with a \u201creputation for wit, capable of destroying his opponent with a single word\u201d.</p> <p>As home secretary, May declined to pursue punitive measures against Moscow earlier this year over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/marina-litvinenko-to-meet-theresa-may-russia-sanctions\" draggable=\"true\">the poisoning of former spy Alexander Litvinenko in London</a> a decade ago, despite a public inquiry suggesting the Russian state had ordered the killing. </p> <p>In January, May told the House of Commons the case amounted to a \u201cblatant and unacceptable\u201d breach of international law, and said she had asked Interpol to issue arrest warrants for the two suspects. But she stressed the importance of maintaining engagement with Russia over issues including the Syrian conflict.</p>",

  "<p>Manchester United are hoping Paul Pogba\u2019s acquisition for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">a world-record \u00a389.3m</a> represents the beginnings of a power shift whereby they no longer have to accept that the world\u2019s top footballers consider the Spanish giants a more attractive proposition.</p> <p>As Pogba clocked into Old Trafford for his first day as the most expensive footballer in the world, the club\u2019s hierarchy are heralding his arrival as hard evidence that the Glazer family, for all the criticism and hostility they still attract, have re-established United at the front of the transfer market, capable of showing the same kind of financial muscle as Real Madrid and Barcelona and willing to take them on in a way that did not always happen in previous years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-paul-pogba-rivals\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: United\u2019s jealous rivals could never have done Paul Pogba deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decision-makers at Old Trafford hope it will change the dynamic between Europe\u2019s superpowers given that Pogba\u2019s signing has been described as a watershed moment, being the first time in the modern era that one of the world\u2019s more coveted players has preferred Manchester when an alternative offer was proposed by Madrid, a club who famously tend to get their own way when there is a player they want at the Bernab\u00e9u.</p> <p>Pogba was offered the choice of either club and United know from past experience that La Liga\u2019s top clubs are generally considered more attractive than those in the Premier League given the number of players such as Ronaldinho, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale who have turned them down in the past to move to Spain, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s determination to wear Madrid\u2019s colours when he was part of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s team.</p> <p>Madrid have spent several months trying to persuade Pogba to do the same and the fact that the Champions League winners had Zinedine Zidane, one of the legends of French football, attempting to win over a current France international has merely heightened United\u2019s satisfaction after a drawn-out process that involves three years of background work from Ed Woodward, the club\u2019s executive vice-chairman.</p> <p>Woodward set out early in his reign, having taken the role in 2013, to develop a strong working relationship with Mino Raiola, Pogba\u2019s notoriously difficult adviser, and there is little doubt he has used that to good effect during an extensive period of negotiations that has brought two of the agent\u2019s other clients, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, to Old Trafford this summer.</p> <p>Raiola, to use Ibrahimovic\u2019s description, is \u201ccompletely fearless and prepared to pull any number of tricks\u201d, and his involvement goes a long way towards explaining why it has taken so long for United to negotiate a way through the various complexities of Pogba\u2019s five-year contract, including a separate image-rights agreement plus all the various tax issues and the agent\u2019s multi-million-pound fees, widely understood to have set a record within his own profession. Raiola and his lawyer, Rafaela Pimenta, have been formidable opponents like no others United have encountered in recent years.</p> <p>In comparison the negotiations between United and Juventus have been relatively straightforward. The structure of the deal was argued out in the course of two meetings between Woodward and Andrea Agnelli, the Juventus president, both of which were strategically held away from Turin and Manchester to avoid more publicity. The two clubs get on well and United were led to believe from an early stage that Juventus were willing to do business as long as the price was right.</p> <p>David de Gea\u2019s decision to remain in Manchester, heavily influenced by Louis van Gaal\u2019s departure and the arrival of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, has further strengthened United\u2019s position bearing in mind Madrid\u2019s long-standing desire to recruit the Spain international goalkeeper. The defender Eric Bailly\u2019s arrival from Villarreal means United have signed all four of their transfer targets before the season starts, in stark contrast to some of their more disappointing summers since Ferguson\u2019s retirement, and the fact that has happened when the club cannot offer prospective new signings Champions League football is being seen within Old Trafford as a significant victory. That does not lessen any embarrassment about the fact they let Pogba leave as a free agent four years ago \u2013 his grievances at the time relating to his lack of first-team opportunities and the relatively low pay on offer \u2013 and some awkward questions clearly remain now new information has emerged about United\u2019s scouts encouraging the club to re-sign him within 12 months of his move to Juventus.</p> <p>However, the decision not to offer Pogba better pay in 2012 was taken by a different regime, with David Gill as chief executive and Ferguson the manager, and the player clearly does not hold a grudge. On the contrary it is said not to have featured at all in any of the discussions. United have seen it as an advantage that Pogba still has friends at the club as well as in the city.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/stormzy-and-laundry-ladies-the-new-face-of-transfer-announcements\">Stormzy and laundry ladies: the new face of transfer announcements</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What United have been able to offer is a stable environment, a serial trophy-getter as their manager and a newly assembled side that will begin the season as genuine candidates for the Premier League title.</p> <p>While Madrid have a formidable pull of their own, as the 11-time European Cup winners, the feeling at Old Trafford is that several factors made this a rare defeat for the Spaniards. First there is the fact that Pogba would have been joining a club who are facing the probability of a one-year transfer ban. The presidential elections tend to create more instability at the Bernab\u00e9u and Pogba, as Mourinho has alluded to, would inevitably have been in Ronaldo\u2019s shadow. It also helped United\u2019s cause that the player is fond of Manchester, knowing better than to be put off by the traditional lines about damp weather and the lack of a beach.</p> <p>For United that means a happy ending to a chase that might never have been necessary had Pogba\u2019s first spell with the club not unravelled so acrimoniously.</p> <p>Ferguson once claimed the Frenchman had left Old Trafford \u201cnot showing us any respect at all\u201d and the lingering bad feeling certainly counted against Pogba when David Moyes was in charge.</p> <p>Pogba was available for \u00a365m at the time but Ferguson\u2019s successor was led to believe the player might always have a restless streak. What did it say for his personality, Moyes wondered, that he wanted to leave Old Trafford at the age of 19 and had spent much of his time at Juventus apparently contemplating another transfer?</p> <p>Van Gaal was another admirer but decided the money would be better spent elsewhere whereas the difference is that Mourinho, having tried unsuccessfully to sign Pogba for Chelsea last summer, was absolutely adamant that this was the player he wanted more than anybody else.</p> <p>\u201cHe looks like a kid who is back to his old school finding people he cares about and who love him a lot,\u201d Mourinho said of his new player. \u201cAfter a couple of days he will feel like he never left the club.\u201d</p>",

The Kiwis went back in front thanks to tries from Scott Curry and Akira Ioane but suffered another serious-looking injury to Joe Webber at the worst possible moment. As they desperately tried to steady the ship, Japan attacked purposefully once more and, with less than two minutes left, levelled the scores when Kameli Soejima surged over. Katsuyuki Sakai landed a fine angled drop-goal conversion and, despite a late lineout turnover which offered New Zealand one last opportunity, that was that. Japan subsequently lost 21-19 to Great Britain but they have already given this event a serious shake-up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d458e70612260aeaacab4f2e5b28c45574d68a2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d458e70612260aeaacab4f2e5b28c45574d68a2f/0_0_3129_1878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Later in the day, Great Britain made it two victories in two by defeating Japan.

The Japan players, in contrast, could scarcely believe their luck. \u201cWe thought that, if we keep on moving the ball around, the big guys will tire somewhere and eventually they did,\u201d said one of their ecstatic squad members, Lomano Lemeki. \u201cWe had a game plan ... play at our pace and they would get frustrated. It is unbelievable.You never see a minnow beat a team which is supposed to be a gold medal contender. I am still shocked, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>Amid New Zealand\u2019s understandable shock \u2013 they are now down to 11 players having been permitted by the regulations to replace only one of their injured men \u2013 the positive impact on the rest of the world is potentially priceless. This was always meant to be rugby\u2019s moment of maximum opportunity: their version of T20 cricket and the springboard to new countries and markets who are only dimly aware who plays at Twickenham. Anyone with even a passing appreciation of sport would have been wooed by the enchanting brilliance of Australia\u2019s outstanding Charlotte Caslick; floating voters will fall in love with rugby afresh when they watch the Fijian men over the coming couple of days.</p> <p>Fiji\u2019s widely respected English coach, Ben Ryan, is leaving little to chance, even confiscating his players\u2019 mobile phones to encourage them to sleep better. Craftily he has done likewise with Fiji\u2019s women\u2019s squad \u201cbecause I know the boys would use their phones instead\u201d. He is also closely watching their food intake. \u201cI check their plates. Sometimes I take the odd sausage off but generally they\u2019ve been really good. Hand on heart, I really don\u2019t care if we don\u2019t win this tournament if we play to our best and show everybody how Fiji can play. We just want to put in performances that get people off their seats.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/australia-rugby-sevens-olympic-gold-great-britain-bronze\">Australia seal gold as Great Britain miss podium in women\u2019s rugby sevens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With even the Fijian prime minister in the stands \u2013 where are you, Theresa May? \u2013 the whole country is behind the squad. \u201cSevens is front- and backpage news in Fiji. It\u2019s all anyone cares about,\u201d says Chris Cracknell, the former England international who coaches Fiji\u2019s women and helps Ryan with the men\u2019s squad. \u201cThe boys are hotel bell boys, office clerks or work in the police, army and fire departments. It\u2019s very much the people\u2019s team. It\u2019s 4am in Fiji now but everyone will still be watching.\u201d</p> <p>Interest elsewhere is also mushrooming. Thousands have flocked to Caslick\u2019s Instagram account, which had a 10-fold increase in followers in 24 hours, and early TV audience figures are encouraging. Germany are showing interest and even Iceland play their first women\u2019s sevens tournament this weekend. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of goodwill towards rugby,\u201d confirmed World Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Brett Gosper. A decision is due next year as to whether sevens will remain on the Olympic roster to 2024 and beyond. All the signs would suggest it is here to stay. \u201cThis game is expanding at a phenomenal rate,\u201d said Ryan.</p> <p>The prospect of a wide-open, gripping finale to the men\u2019s tournament will help further; Australia were undone in the day\u2019s opening game by France while Argentina needed a last-gasp score to avoid defeat by the United States. Team GB, meanwhile, opened their campaign with a comfortable 31-7 victory over Kenya, with Dan Bibby and Tom Mitchell impressing alongside the Scotland centre Mark Bennett and Welshman James Davies, younger brother of the British Lion Jonathan.</p> <p>The nail-biting Japan outcome, clinched by a missed last-gasp conversion, was also encouraging, given this is the first time the 12-strong squad has started a tournament together. The ongoing club versus country politics of sevens means the Team GB men\u2019s squad is not as studded with world-class talent as it might have been. This week, though, Simon Amor, suspects several Premiership players will be watching the Games on TV and making a mental note to be in Tokyo in 2020. Everything in rugby suddenly seems to be turning Japanese.</p>",

Hillary Clinton paid a visit earlier to a health clinic in Miami, the epicenter of the Zika outbreak in the US, and appealed to Republican leaders to convene an emergency session of Congress to pass funding to combat the mosquito-borne virus, <em>reports <strong>Sabrina Siddiqui </strong>in Washington</em>.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee used the bully pulpit of the presidential campaign to voice her frustration with lawmakers in Washington, who left town last month for a summer recess without meeting the federal government\u2019s request for funds to fight the spread of the Zika virus.</p> <p>\u201cI am very disappointed that the Congress went on recess before actually agreeing on what they would do to put the resources into this fight,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I really am hoping that they will pay attention.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton delivered her remarks following a tour of the Borinquen Health Care Center, a community clinic in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, which has borne the brunt of Florida\u2019s Zika outbreak. The state of Florida, a key battleground in November\u2019s presidential race, has been the most severely hit by the virus, which poses the greatest threat to pregnant women due to its cause of birth defects such as microcephaly.</p> <p>Clinton said she first learned of Zika in December through her daughter Chelsea, who was pregnant at the time with her second child. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to wake up in a year and read so many more stories about babies like the little girl who just died in Houston,\u201d Clinton said, citing a fatal case of Zika-related microcephaly reported out of Texas on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cThat is just not something we should tolerate in our country.\u201d</p> <p>The Obama administration requested a $1.9bn spending package several months ago, basing its figure on the needs of public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p> <p>The request quickly devolved into partisan politics on Capitol Hill, as House Republicans instead passed a measure that included riders to overturn certain clean water regulations, restricted money for Planned Parenthood and undermined the health care law. Senate Democrats twice filibustered the House-passed proposal, which Barack Obama has also said he would veto.</p> <p>Republicans have in turn accused Democrats of blocking the necessary funding and on Tuesday took aim at Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator and Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, for voting against their Zika bill. Clinton urged lawmakers to put aside politics and advance a separate bipartisan agreement that cleared the Senate in June and would allocate $1.1bn in funding with no strings attached.</p> <p>She also took aim at Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has ignored the Zika virus all together and told a local television station in Florida he did not need to opine on the issue because the state\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, had it \u201cunder control\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree with those who say that Zika is an insignificant issue,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is something we need to take seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims, Scott, a Republican who has endorsed the nominee, has sounded repeated alarms over the Zika outbreak. He, too, implored US lawmakers to return to Washington and address the funding gap.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government must stop playing politics and Congress needs to immediately come back to session to resolve this,\u201d Scott said on Tuesday, as Florida\u2019s health department identified four more individuals who likely contracted Zika through a mosquito bite.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/zika-virus-could-be-linked-with-whole-spectrum-of-disorders\">Zika virus could be linked with 'whole spectrum' of disorders</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T17:45:41.031Z\">at 6.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aa43e0e4b03b51a99e18f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:58:24.267Z\">9.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Salman Rushdie, himself no stranger to threats of assassination, has delivered his verdict on the nature of Donald Trump\u2019s remarks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Of course the Trump flacks are now trying to confuse the issue, but Senator Murphy is clear about what Trump meant. <a href=\"https://t.co/7fDmDyCSjw\">https://t.co/7fDmDyCSjw</a></p>&mdash; Salman Rushdie (@SalmanRushdie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">August 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa41c6e4b0f5d064841f0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:49:25.772Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>US Secret Service, on Donald Trump\u2019s comments:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Secret Service is aware of the comment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa40e3e4b0f5d064841f07\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:49:03.610Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The NRA might have changed the channel a little early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763110521889402880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@RealDonaldTrump</a> is right.

So, in the interest of providing as much information as possible to American readers and voters, here are Trump\u2019s full comments regarding the Second Amendment today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hillary wants to abolish, essentially, the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dunno. But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day. If Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now we\u2019re tied. You see what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re tied \u2018cause Scalia, this was not supposed to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years, at least, and this is what happened. That was a horrible thing, So now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the second amendment.</p> <p>Now speaking to the NRA folks, who are great: when you, when you, and I tell you, so they endorsed me. They endorsed me very early. My sons are members. I\u2019m a member. If you, we can add, I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the justices, they almost go, in a certain way, hand and hand. Now the justices are going to do things that are so important. And we have such great justices.

So far the Australian government has found only one other country willing to take part in this state-sponsored \u201ccountry shopping\u201d: Cambodia. At a cost of more than $40m, it has managed to resettle one person. A single Rohingyan man.</p> <p>The first Nauru experiment began in 2001, after the Tampa crisis, when a Norwegian freighter that had rescued more than 400 mainly Afghan Hazara refugees from their sinking vessel in international waters 140km north of Christmas Island was refused entry into Australian waters, in defiance of international law. With boats carrying asylum seekers arriving consistently \u2013 as they have on and off since the mid-1970s \u2013 and with immigration proving a divisive, possibly critical issue in a federal election campaign, the MV Tampa provided the conservative Coalition government with a catalyst for action.

They set out every reportable \u201cincident\u201d on the island. Such events include attempts at self-harm, sexual assaults, child abuse, hunger strikes, assaults and injuries. While some of these cases have been reported by the Guardian and other news organisations, the logs set out in detail the totality of harm caused by prolonged detention in Australia\u2019s notorious offshore detention camps. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">The Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many other countries around the world, Australia has privatised its immigration detention centres. But Australia has gone a step beyond other countries: it has exported its detention centres offshore \u2013 to Nauru and to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Any asylum seeker who arrives by boat in Australia is immediately placed in one of these facilities and told they will never be resettled in Australia. The policy is a hardline deterrent established to \u201cstop the boats\u201d \u2013 a familiar slogan in Australian politics.</p> <h2>What information does the interactive contain?</h2> <p>The Guardian\u2019s interactive holds the detailed incident reports as well as a \u201csummary log\u201d of each report. All of these have been written by detention centre staff. The data has been grouped by month and year, by incident category and by risk rating. You can explore individual incidents, or search by type or timeframe. When you select an individual incident you can also share it across social networks.</p> <p>The summary logs that appear when you click on the coloured squares are the staff\u2019s truncated versions of the detailed incident reports. Click \u201cSee original report\u201d to view the incident reports themselves.</p> <h2>What is an incident report?</h2> <p>An incident report is a short summary of an event in the Nauru detention centre written by staff there. Some of the details in the files may distress some readers. They can range from an observation of a threat of self-harm, to abuse of a child, or a more mundane incident such as a child falling over when playing soccer. These reports form part of the contractual requirements set down by the Australian government in order to document and keep records of what is happening inside the detention system. </p> <h2>Who writes these reports?</h2> <p>Scores of staff from a number of private companies have written them. The Australian government has privatised its immigration detention system, outsourcing the services within it. Broadspectrum (formerly known as Transfield Services) manages the detention centre and subcontracts security services to Wilson Security. International Health and Medical Services provides medical care. Save the Children provided welfare and childcare services until the end of 2015.</p> <h2>When is an incident reportable and how are they rated and categorised?</h2> <p>Incidents are reportable when they fall into one of the categories that have been set out in Transfield Services\u2019 contract with Australia\u2019s immigration department. These reports are given a \u201crisk rating\u201d in three distinct categories: critical, major and minor.</p> <p>Critical incidents must be reported verbally within 30 minutes and in writing within three hours. Major incidents must be reported verbally within an hour and in writing within six hours. Minor incidents don\u2019t require a verbal report. A written report only needs to be filed within 24 hours. Timeframes for reporting incidents to the department are extremely important because failures to meet these deadlines can trigger financial penalties.</p> <p>There is also a fourth rating that appears frequently in the logs: information reports. These types of reports do not appear to have any basis in the contract with Australia\u2019s immigration department but they are extremely common.</p> <p>Separately from the risk rating, the reports are also broken down into classifications; for instance \u201cconcern for minor raised\u201d and \u201cself-harm threat\u201d are discrete incident categories.</p> <p>Transfield Services outlined how reports should be categorised in its <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/316586058/Transfield-Incident-Reporting-Guidelines\">incident management framework of June 2013</a>. <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/nu-files/pdfs/matrix.pdf\">An incident reporting matrix from 2014</a><strong> </strong>provides similar guidance.</p> <h2>How accurate are the incident reports and their categorisation?</h2> <p>The way incidents are categorised should be treated with some caution. The private companies that manage the detention centre have extremely poor data handling practices. Some incidents have also been deliberately downgraded in their seriousness. This means that the way incidents are categorised should be examined carefully. There are examples of severe incidents categorised as \u201cinformation\u201d. </p> <p>The risk ratings are applied inconsistently, if at all. Some of the ways the information has been categorised has changed over time, leading to further inconsistencies in counting the data.</p> <p>To present a useful summary of the incident database the Guardian has combined several similar categories, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">the original details also preserved in our database</a>. These categories have been clearly marked in our publication of the database. The original incident reports can also be viewed individually and disclose how the information was initially reported.</p> <h2>Has any of the data been changed?</h2> <p><br>The Guardian has redacted personal information in the files it has published. It has also sought to more clearly categorise some types of incident reports by grouping similar types of incidents when the reporting categories have changed over time. For instance, suicidal ideation has been grouped with threatened self-harm. All of the original incident reporting categories have been preserved in the files though, and this grouping has been clearly marked.</p> <h2>What information has been redacted?</h2> <p>The Nauru files contain a large amount of personal information about asylum seekers and detention centre staff. The Guardian has adopted a stringent approach to redacting the documents, including several layers of editorial and technical checks of the data. The general approach we have taken is to remove:<br>\u2022 The names of all asylum seekers and staff<br>\u2022 Personal identification numbers of asylum seekers (their six-digit \u201cboat arrival numbers\u201d)<br>\u2022 Ages of the asylum seekers named in reports<br>\u2022 Signatures of detention staff<br>\u2022 Nationalities with small population groups<br>\u2022 Residential tent numbers<br>\u2022 In some cases further identifying information has been removed</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/10/how-to-contact-the-nauru-files-reporters-securely-and-confidentially\">How to contact the Nauru files reporters securely and confidentially</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This approach to redacting the identities of asylum seekers and staff is consistent with the methodology taken by the former integrity commissioner Philip Moss in his review of sexual assault allegations at the centre.</p> <h2>What common terms and acronyms appear in the files?</h2> <p><strong>NRPC</strong> This acronym refers to the Nauru regional processing centre (the detention centre).</p> <p><strong>SCA</strong> Save the Children Australia, contracted by the Australian government to provide welfare services on the island.</p> <p><strong>IHMS</strong> International Health and Medical Services, contracted to provide health services to asylum seekers.</p> <p><strong>TSA</strong> Transfield Services Australia, contracted to manage the Nauru detention centre.</p> <p><strong>DIBP </strong>Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Australian government department responsible for overseeing the Nauru detention centre.</p> <p><strong>TIS</strong> Translating and Interpreting Service, a part of the immigration department that provides specialist translation services.</p> <p><strong>CPSW</strong> A Save the Children staff member who is a child protection and support worker</p> <p><strong>CW</strong> A Save the Children caseworker.</p> <p><strong>CM</strong> A Save the Children case manager.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>CSO</strong> Client services officer.

Normally on TV there is only bad news about our communities. But now Rafaela\u2019s success is our pride.\u201d said Tatiane Maerer, an administrator with the residents\u2019 association, who used to train with Rafaela when the latter was seven and she was nine years old. \u201cI used to beat her back then,\u201d Maerer smiled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c927e9bc299c83cc636b4e1ade6cbe62827d2fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c927e9bc299c83cc636b4e1ade6cbe62827d2fe/0_66_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti depicting a laughing man with a gun inside the Cidade de Deus favela.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti inside the Cidade de Deus.

  "<p>Jonn Elledge\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/dream-owning-your-own-home-over-renting\" title=\"\">Our home ownership dream is over. Let\u2019s improve renting</a>, 3 August) is mostly a realistic picture of the rental v ownership situation in the UK. The rate of home ownership here is low (63.9%) compared with other EU countries. Germany is invariably mentioned, as in this article, but it is an exception with the lowest proportion at 52%. The UK is 23rd out of the 28 EU countries; even France now has a higher percentage. (Even the much denigrated, capitalist US has a similar comparatively low rate as the UK at 65%). Ten EU countries have more than 80% home ownership (source: <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/european-union/home-ownership-rate\" title=\"\">European Home Ownership Rate 2007-2016</a>). So&#xa0;the aspiration to home ownership is evidently one of the vast majority of the population.</p> <p>However, the stigma of renting and the ambition to own one\u2019s home long predates Margaret Thatcher. In the 1960s there was a huge rise in affordable home ownership in the UK and the inevitable pressure to buy a home. From my own experience, when I emigrated to Canada in 1968, I remember the disparaging reaction from my English family and friends when my husband and I rented for several years because we could not afford to buy. <br><strong>Helen Rugman</strong><br><em>Moulsford, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonn Elledge implies that old people are topping up their pensions from rent and thus \u201clooting the young\u201d. This applies to very few of us. Traditionally, small business owners bought flats, as it was not possible to obtain satisfactory pension schemes and that is precisely what we did. So far, this has been sensible and in fact, I find myself in loco parentis to our tenants, who get free Wi-Fi and the rapid fixing of problems. However, many pensioners already face the type of problems that Elledge suggests will occur in the future, when most will have no equity to cash in, either because they never owned houses or because their parents consumed the equity in the house they had. This is yet another symptom of the rich stealing all the wealth and not paying their taxes.<br><strong>Ken Baldry</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonn Elledge is right to draw attention to the insecurity of tenure facing tenants in the private rented sector but this is not confined to that sector. Under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/22/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Housing and Planning Act</a> councils can only grant tenancies for up to five years, except where there are children under nine years of age. In addition, there are the \u201cpay to stay\u201d provisions under which rents are increased where family incomes exceed the not-so-princely sum of \u00a331,000 outside London, and \u00a340,000 in the capital. Coupled with the generous terms of right to buy, which have led to 35% of properties purchased now being in the hands of private landlords, this measure is designed to promote the demise of council housing.<br><strong>Jeremy Beecham</strong><br><em>Labour, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 There may well be no prospect of a Tory-dominated House of Commons improving tenants\u2019 rights any time soon. However, John Elledge seems to have overlooked the fact that in Scotland housing is a devolved matter. The Scottish parliament has recently enacted the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/92310.aspx\" title=\"\">Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016</a>, which will create a new form of tenancy applicable to all privately rented property. This should provide private sector tenants in Scotland with rather better protection than they have enjoyed hitherto, though the likely impact of the legislation on the letting market in Scotland is still unclear. <br><strong>Andrew Boyd</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 I would like to endorse John Gardner\u2019s call for a celebration of new towns (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/31/lets-celebrate-lewis-silkin-on-new-towns-day\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 1 August). Their greatest strength was the comprehensiveness of their masterplans. They defined the housing, social, economic and leisure needs for an area 30 to 50 years ahead, with the necessary infrastructure to accommodate significant expansion. They were not riddled with sexed-up key performance indicators, and political fantasies but practical how-to instructions. And have a look at the financial outcomes; between them they cost less than a current failed IT&#xa0;project!<br><strong>Ged Parker</strong><br><em>Washington new town, Tyne and Wear</em></p> <p>\u2022 New towns may be nice places to live, but so are many other places and their legacy includes a big downside. Built at ultra-low densities to reflect their garden city heritage, they squandered scarce building land and made their inhabitants fatally dependent on cars to get around. Their legacy thus includes destroying far more countryside than they needed and continuing high emissions of greenhouse gases. Their founders may not have cared about these things, but anyone considering replicating them should.<br><strong>Jon Reeds</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I share John Gardner\u2019s enthusiasm for new towns, and the role played by former Labour planning minister Lewis Silkin in developing them. It reminded me of the story, ably told in Stevenage museum, of the pranksters who went round the night before Lewis Silkin performed a ceremony in the town, and changed all the road signs to read \u201cSilkingrad\u201d. Perhaps we ought to make this change permanent to mark the anniversary\u2026<br><strong>Paul Steeples</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

  "<p>The world can cope with 7 or even 10 billion people. But only if we stop eating meat. Livestock farming is the most potent means by which we amplify our presence on the planet. It is the amount of land an animal-based diet needs that makes it so destructive.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/can-britain-feed-itself\">analysis by the farmer and scholar Simon Fairlie </a>suggests that Britain could easily feed itself within its own borders. But while a diet containing a moderate amount of meat, dairy and eggs would require the use of 11m hectares of land (4m of which would be arable), a vegan diet would demand a total of just 3m. Not only do humans need no pasture, but we use grains and pulses more efficiently when we eat them ourselves, rather than feed them to cows and chickens.</p> <p>This would enable 15m hectares of the land now used for farming in Britain to be set aside for nature. Alternatively, on a vegan planet, Britain could feed 200 million people. Extending this thought experiment to the rest of the world, it\u2019s not hard to see how gently we could tread if we stopped keeping animals. Rainforests, savannahs, wetlands, magnificent wildlife can live alongside us, but not alongside our current diet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We believe we can solve the ethical problems by switching to free-range meat and eggs.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Free-range farming is kinder to livestock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/22/festive-christmas-meal-long-haul-flight-meats-damaging-planet\">but crueller to the rest of the living world</a>.</p> <p>When people criticise farming, they usually preface it with the word intensive. But extensive farming, almost by definition, does greater harm to the planet: more land is needed to rear the same amount of food. Keeping cattle or sheep on ranches, whether in the Amazon, the US, Australia or the hills of Britain, is even more of a planet-busting indulgence than beef feed-lots and hog cities, cruel and hideous as these are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/how-much-britain-pay-protect-wildlife-stone-curlew-farmers-eu-funding-threat\">How much is Britain prepared to pay to protect its wildlife? | Patrick Barkham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over several years, as I became more aware of these inconvenient truths, I gradually dropped farmed meat from my diet. But I still consumed milk and eggs. I knew the dire environmental impacts of the crops <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sum.12068/abstract\">(such as maize and soya</a>) that dairy cows and chickens are fed. I knew about the waste, the climate change, the <a href=\"http://e.com/nature/journal/v525/n7569/full/nature15371.html\">air pollution</a>. But greed got the better of me. Cheese, yoghurt, butter, eggs \u2013 I loved them all.</p> <p>Then something happened that broke down the wall of denial. Last September I arranged to spend a day beside the River Culm in Devon, renowned for its wildlife and beauty. However, the stretch I intended to explore had been reduced to a stinking ditch, almost lifeless except for some sewage fungus. I traced the pollution back to a dairy farm. A local man told me the disaster had been developing for months. But his efforts to persuade the Environment Agency (the government regulator) to take action had been fruitless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dde9a6644d99d22e25273b408e098445688f269b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dde9a6644d99d22e25273b408e098445688f269b/0_310_4322_2594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farms and pastureland carve their way into tropical forestland in the Brazilian State of Rond\u00f4nia, one of the Amazon\u2019s most deforested regions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farms and pastureland carve their way into tropical forestland in the Brazilian state of Rond\u00f4nia, one of the Amazon\u2019s most deforested regions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/think-dairy-farming-is-benign-our-rivers-tell-a-different-story\">published the photos I had taken in the Guardian</a>, and they caused a stir. Yet the Environment Agency still refused to take action. Its excuses were so preposterous that I realised this was more than simple incompetence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2015/nov/12/toothless-environment-agency-is-allowing-the-living-world-to-be-wrecked-with-impunity\">After publishing another article about this farce</a>, I was contacted separately by two staff members at the agency. They told me they had been instructed to disregard all incidents of this kind. The cause, they believed, was political pressure from the government.</p> <p>That did it. Why, I reasoned, should I support an industry the government refuses to regulate? Since then, I have cut almost all animal products from my diet. I\u2019m not religious about it. If I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house I might revert to vegetarianism. If I\u2019m away from home, I will take a drop of milk in my tea. About once a fortnight I have an egg for my breakfast, perhaps once a month a fish I catch, or a herring or some anchovies (if you eat fish, take them from the bottom of the food chain). Perhaps three or four times a year, on special occasions, I will eat farmed meat: partly out of greed, partly because I don\u2019t want to be even more of a spectre at the feast than I am already. This slight adaptation, I feel, also reduces the chances of a relapse.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/27/why-i-ate-a-roadkill-squirrel\">I still eat roadkill </a>when I can find it, and animals killed as agricultural pests whose bodies might otherwise be dumped. At the moment, while pigeons, deer, rabbits and squirrels are so abundant in this country and are being killed for purposes other than meat production, eating the carcasses seems to be without ecological consequence. Perhaps you could call me a pestitarian.</p> <p>Even so, such meals are rare. My rough calculation suggests that 97% of my diet now consists of plants. I eat plenty of pulses, seeds and nuts and heaps of vegetables. That almost allows me to join the<a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/news/find-out-how-many-vegans-are-great-britain\"> 500,000 people in Britain who are full vegans</a> \u2013 but not quite. Of course, these choices also have impacts, but they are generally far lower than those of meat, dairy and eggs. Paradoxically, if you want to eat less soya, eat soya directly: eating animal products tends to mean consuming far more of this crop, albeit indirectly. Almost all the soya grown where rainforests once stood is used to feed animals. Replacing meat with soya reduces the clearance of natural vegetation, per kilogram of protein, by 96%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/parents-raising-vegan-babies\">Meet the parents raising vegan babies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After almost a year on this diet, I have dropped from 12 stone to 11. I feel better than I\u2019ve done for years, and my craving for fat has all but disappeared. Cheese is no more appealing to me now than a lump of lard. My asthma has almost gone. There are a number of possible explanations, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had something to do with cutting out milk. I have to think harder about what I cook, but that is no bad thing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/pressReleases/2012/May/JCR_1205_MeatMen.html\">Meat eating is strongly associated with conventional images of masculinity</a>, and some people appear to feel threatened by those who give up animal products.

Curiously, she failed to recommend the same sanction for rearing them on chips and sausages.</p> <p>By chance, at a festival this summer, I again met the man from Devon who had tried to persuade the Environment Agency to take action on the River Culm. He told me that nothing has changed. When there\u2019s a choice between protecting the living world and appeasing powerful lobby groups, most governments will take the second option. But we can withdraw our consent from this corruption. If you exercise that choice, I doubt you will regret it.</p>",
  "<p>Facebook is starting to bypass adblockers on its desktop website, in the company\u2019s first major foray into the war between advertisers and those who would see an internet without any advertising at all.</p> <p>Between them, Facebook and Google control <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-22/google-and-facebook-lead-digital-ad-industry-to-revenue-record\">an astonishing 64%</a> of the digital advertising market, but that doesn\u2019t mean the two companies are immune to the prevailing trend, which has seen usage of adblockers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/adblocking-uk-web-users\">double in just over two years</a>.</p> <p>But their approaches to the problem has been very different. Google has become the key member of the \u201cacceptable ads\u201d programme run by Adblock Plus, the leading desktop adblocker. That programme allows selected adverts through its mesh provided they are unintrusive and technically secure \u2013 and provided the advertiser (if they\u2019re above a certain size) pays Adblock Plus a cut of the revenue. That has seen the programme branded \u201cextortion\u201d by some, including German publishers Zeit Online GmbH and Handelsblatt GmbH, <a href=\"https://pagefair.com/blog/2015/german-court-clears-adblock-plus-of-extortion-charge/\">who lost a court case</a> on just that claim.</p> <p>In Britain, culture secretary John Whittingdale <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/02/adblocking-protection-racket-john-whittingdale\">described adblocking</a> as a \u201cmodern-day protection racket\u201d, widely interpreted as a reference to the Adblock Plus whitelist.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/08/a-new-way-to-control-the-ads-you-see-on-facebook-and-an-update-on-ad-blocking/\">its blogpost announcing the change</a>, Facebook also made a sideswipe at the acceptable ads programme. \u201cSome adblocking companies accept money in exchange for showing ads that they previously blocked \u2013 a practice that is at best confusing to people and that reduces the funding needed to support the journalism and other free services that we enjoy on the web,\u201d wrote Andrew Bosworth, the company\u2019s advertising head.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook is one of those free services, and ads support our mission of giving people the power to share and making the world more open and connected. Rather than paying adblocking companies to unblock the ads we show \u2013 as some of these companies have invited us to do in the past \u2013 we\u2019re putting control in people\u2019s hands with our updated ad preferences and our other advertising controls.\u201d</p> <p>The company will only be bypassing adblockers on the desktop version of its website for now, meaning users of mobile adblockers will continue to experience an ad-free version. But the vast majority of Facebook\u2019s mobile users use the company\u2019s apps, which are largely immune to adblockers.</p> <p>The new controls allow users to manually remove certain preferences from their Facebook profile, ensuring that, for instance, they can opt-out of adverts on cats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/08/cat-people-versus-dog-people-facebook-study\">even if the site has profiled them as being a cat lover</a>. Users can also now manually opt-out of certain customer lists, ensuring that \u201cliking\u201d a page doesn\u2019t saddle you with adverts from that firm forever.</p> <p>Facebook hopes that those new controls will sweeten the bitter pill for former adblocking users. But the company, which hasn\u2019t disclosed how it will be bypassing the adblockers\u2019 technology, is likely to find itself embroiled in an arms race with adblocking firms themselves.</p> <p>Adblock Plus <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/blog/oh-well-looks-like-facebook-just-got-all-anti-user\">suggested as much</a> in its response to the announcement, saying that Facebook\u2019s decision was \u201can unfortunate move, because it takes a dark path against user choice\u201d.</p> <p>The firm\u2019s founder, Till Faida, added that \u201ccircumvention of adblockers happens every day: since the invention of spam filters, spammers have always tried to work around them. So far I haven\u2019t seen anything that was hard to tackle.\u201d</p> <p>Adblock Plus also hit back at Facebook where it hurts: the company\u2019s bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Facebook or the brands that are being advertised on its site getting any sort of value for their ad dollar here: publishers (like Facebook) alienate their audience and advertisers (the brands) allow their cherished brand name to be shoved down people\u2019s throats.\u201d</p> <p>That assessment has come on a bad day for Facebook\u2019s own ad business, with Proctor and Gamble, the world\u2019s biggest advertiser, announcing plans to scale back Facebook adverts that target specific customers.</p> <p>\u201cWe targeted too much and we went too narrow,\u201d the company\u2019s head of marketing <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/p-g-to-scale-back-targeted-facebook-ads-1470760949\">told the Wall Street Journal</a>, \u201cand now we\u2019re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?\u201d</p> <p>P&amp;G won\u2019t yet scale back overall spending on Facebook, but will instead switch to the company\u2019s more traditional display adverts, and only use targeted adverts when it makes total sense \u2013 for instance, baby products for expecting mothers.</p>",

He studied art in London from 1979 to 1983, and again in 1989-90. His breakout on to the art scene came when he was awarded the John Moores Prize in 1993 and then shortlisted for the Turner Prize the following year. </p> <p>He denies he ever attended Lakehead University, according to the New York Times, and says he has never been near Thunder Bay Correctional Centre and has never been incarcerated.

Doige died in 2012, but his sister Marilyn Doige Bovard is expected to testify during the court case.

The promise to save the NHS, migration and trust in Boris Johnson.

I just think that some of the money we are putting into the EU for other things could be put back into our own NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley invites me to a community centre where she volunteers, which recently had its funding for youth services cut. The \u00a3350m a week could also help reopen them, she says.</p> <p>Fellow volunteer Peta McDowall, a remain voter, suggests to her the figure was a lie. Peta considers herself a product of Europe \u2013 her parents arrived during the Spanish civil war and she attended university in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was about politics. I think the people who are in Brexit are idiots. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean you, Shirley, I mean the head people. When I found out who was our minister for world affairs [Boris Johnson], it\u2019s a joke.\u201d Shirley seems genuinely worried that the \u00a3350m number might not be true. She resolves to charter a bus with Peta from the north-east to meet the new foreign secretary. \u201cI would go mad if this money doesn\u2019t go into the NHS, I will go mad.

They thought this is a chance for them to hear our voice,\u201d he says. His wife, Theresa, says that council cutbacks played a big part. John is a rare thing in this city \u2013 a Conservative. But on this occasion, his vote mattered.</p> <p>On the night, when the presumption had been that remain would win, Conservative cabinet ministers started to report a similar phenomenon. \u201cLabour\u201d wards in Tory safe seats, where no party would bother to visit during a general election, were seeing massive turnout. Overall, 2.8m more votes were cast on 23 June than at the general election last year. Turnout spiked particularly in strongly leave areas. In the north-east, Hartlepool (70% leave) saw turnout up by 9%, as did Sunderland. Middlesborough (66% leave) saw turnout up by 12%.</p> <p>Just under 20,000 of those new voters were in Sunderland. One of them, Melanie Jordison, a travel agent, was in the Colliery. \u201cIt was something very real. A choice to stay or leave \u2013 and both had impacts, whereas in general elections there is no impact, so I thought it a good opportunity to make Britain great again,\u201d she says. She is expecting cheaper food, gas and oil, and wants to close down the borders \u201ca little bit\u201d because \u201cfar too many immigrants [are] coming in taking our resources. We can\u2019t afford to feed our own.\u201d</p> <p>The main story on the leave side has been of a left-behind Britain of ignored white middle-class voters who wanted control over borders back and were inured to David Cameron\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d economic scaremongering. On the remain side, Sunderland became the symbol of a Labour heartland encouraged to shoot itself in the foot, with a gun handed to them by Conservative cabinet ministers and loaded with lies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jul/06/sunderland-echo-wrong-to-demand-an-apology-from-the-new-york-times\">Sunderland Echo wrong to demand an apology from the New York Times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Politics defies simple narratives most of the time, and spectacularly so right now. I meet leavers completely relaxed about immigration. Car workers who voted out. Fishing industry workers who voted remain.</p> <p>If politics was done solely by numbers, there should have been no contest in the north-east. The region is the most dependent on EU funding of any English region \u2013 from the new aquatics centre on the old colliery site, to the university near the old shipyards, and the very fish quay building from where the fisherman lament the EU. The leave campaign promised the funding will be maintained, saying it is merely rerouted UK taxpayer funds, but the dependence will move to Westminster to continue this funding.</p> <p>On the signature issue of the Leave campaign \u2013 immigration \u2013 the north-east is the region with the smallest proportion of non-British residents: 3%. Figures from 2014 estimated there to be 40,000 European Union migrants and 42,000 non-EU migrants in the region, out of a total population of 2.5 million.</p> <p>If you concentrate on a place such as Sunderland, the migration crisis is rather stark. At the last census, Sunderland had the fastest rate of depopulation of any UK city. Since the 1980s, 8% of its population has gone. The success of the university in attracting international students has helped stabilise the decline in recent years, but its business model is built on increasing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/uk-population-grew-half-million-net-migration-ons\">net migration numbers</a> that the government found so difficult to defend.</p> <p>At the very least, it is difficult to see how places such as Sunderland will be greatly affected by less EU migration, when the numbers are very small by the standards of a British city. On the other hand, any risk to the terms of trade between the UK and the remaining EU will hit the north-east first: in per-capita terms, it does more trade with the EU than any other English region. The north-east appears to be shouldering a disproportionate amount of the economic risk of a badly negotiated Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb5f9ad59614c6a05ead3c60aabef28b6fdd9605\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb5f9ad59614c6a05ead3c60aabef28b6fdd9605/0_154_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the production line at the Nissan plant in Sunderland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That Nissan plant is never, ever going to leave Sunderland,\u2019 says one Leave voter \u2013 but Nissan have said its future depends on how Brexit plays out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But politics is not done by numbers these days, still less by experts. For starters, there was little perception of any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/nissan-warns-sunderland-uk-car-plant-hinges-brexit-talks\">risk to the Nissan plant</a>. Back at the fishing quay, the trader buying all the crabs and lobsters, Alan McLaughlan, asserts: \u201cThat Nissan plant is never, ever going to leave Sunderland. They\u2019ll never, ever get a workforce like they\u2019ve got in Sunderland, never ever.\u201d But perhaps the best example of this are the workers in local supply chains for the industry who voted to leave. James Thoroughgood, a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, voted out despite job concerns, because the EU \u201cneeds to be transparent\u201d. Before the vote, David Cameron had told me directly that Brexit could cause job losses at Nissan and that it would be a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d.

She then went into battle for Nissan against French and Italian attempts to block tariff-free exports of the Sunderland-produced Nissan Bluebird.

His name was Mino Raiola.\u201d</p> <p>Raiola, the 48-year-old Italy-born, Monaco-based, Dutch national is now a don in the cut-throat world that he has inhabited for the past 25 years or so, having enjoyed a ludicrously bountiful summer. It has not only been Ibrahimovic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/30/zlatan-ibrahimovic-manchester-united-transfer-jose-mourinho\">whom he has moved to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s new project at Manchester United</a> but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/manchester-united-henrikh-mkhitaryan-signs\">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> and, most eye-catching of all, Paul Pogba \u2013 in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">world record \u00a393.2m deal from Juventus</a>.</p> <p>According to Forbes, Raiola\u2019s Maguire Tax &amp; Legal company, which he named in tribute to the fictitious movie agent Jerry \u201cShow me the Money\u201d Maguire, had taken commissions, as of September 2015, of $28.6m. His slice of the Pogba deal alone has netted him around \u00a320m.</p> <p>It is a staggering subplot to an extraordinary transfer that has ticked every box for Raiola, not least the one marked revenge. It is fair to say that not everybody likes this combative, direct and sometimes volatile character, and the former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, is prominent on his list of enemies.</p> <p>Pogba was a teenage reserve-team player at Old Trafford when Raiola spotted something in him and signed him as his client before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/04/manchester-united-paul-pogba-juventus\">taking him, at 19, from United to Juventus</a> in 2012. Ferguson was furious. \u201cThere are one or two football agents I simply do not like and Mino Raiola is one of them,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/22/alex-ferguson-david-moyes-mike-phelan-manchester-united\">he has said</a>. \u201cI distrusted him from the moment I met him.\u201d</p> <p>Pogba\u2019s return from Turin to Manchester as an A-list star has allowed Raiola to bask in a feeling of vindication \u2013 as well as the pay cheque of a lifetime. He has in effect proved to Ferguson that it was the right move to allow Pogba to develop at Juventus. </p> <p>Raiola\u2019s personal windfall has been triggered by the clause that he inserted into Pogba\u2019s contract at Juventus that entitled him to a 20% cut of any future sale \u2013 to be paid on top of the fee. Raiola has collected a further undisclosed figure for his specific work on the transfer. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is a staggering subplot to a transfer that has ticked every box for Raiola, not least one marked revenge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As an aside it is interesting that United have used Raiola this summer, rather than Mourinho\u2019s agent, Jorge Mendes. Mourinho has a long history of signing Mendes\u2019s clients.</p> <p>Those who know Raiola well, including Slegers, talk of a passionate, football-obsessed workaholic. \u201cHe is extremely loyal to the people who are in his inner circle and that means his players,\u201d Slegers said. \u201cTo him they are like family. And that\u2019s why he is the perfect negotiator because you always want to do the best for your family.</p> <p>\u201cHe has a good sense of humour and he likes to be provocative but in a way that is quite funny. Some people think he is cocky and, if you don\u2019t know him and maybe you just see his quotations, you can think he is crazy but he is not. He stands up for his players.\u201d</p> <p>The story about Ibrahimovic\u2019s first meeting with Raiola bears retelling. The Swedish striker was at Ajax and he had received an overture from Raiola via his team-mate Maxwell, a Brazilian left-back whom Raiola represented then and now.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic told Maxwell to inform Raiola that, if the agent had something specific to put on the table, he would meet him; otherwise, he was not interested. The message came back from Raiola. \u201cTell this Zlatan to go and fuck himself.\u201d Perversely, it struck a chord with Ibrahimovic, who had grown up around this kind of attitude.</p> <p>The meeting was set for the sushi restaurant at Amsterdam\u2019s swanky Okura hotel and Ibrahimovic wore Gucci and parked his Porsche outside. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what sort of person to expect, probably some sort of pinstriped fella with an even bigger gold watch,\u201d Ibrahimovic said. \u201cBut who the hell turned up? A bloke in jeans and a Nike T-shirt \u2013 and that belly, like one of the guys in The Sopranos.\u201d</p> <p>Raiola, in between stuffing himself with enough food to feed five people, according to Ibrahimovic, produced statistics that showed how far his lunch companion was lagging behind the leading strikers of the day. He told him to sell his car and his watches. Hard work, he added, would be everything. The material things would come on the back of playing success.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic listened. And he did as he was told. He and plenty of Raiola\u2019s other clients credit him with instilling focus in them and a winning mentality. Raiola is relentless and his motivational method is invariably the stick, rather than the carrot. It produces results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b63df5174608bc8d58bd79650691602f1da65367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b63df5174608bc8d58bd79650691602f1da65367/36_197_2357_1413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Pogba in action for Manchester United during Paul Scholes\u2019 testimonial match against New York Cosmos at Old Trafford in 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Pogba was a teenage reserve-team player at Manchester United when Mino Raiola spotted something in him and signed him as his client.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raiola has been able to tap into the psyche of his clients, possibly because he comes from a similar background to many of them, one in which he had to fight for everything he got. Born in Salerno, southern Italy, Raiola moved to the Dutch city of Haarlem with his family as a baby. They opened a pizzeria and, as a boy, he would clean, wash dishes and wait tables.</p> <p>Raiola had his finger in many pies as a young man. He began to look after the books at the pizzeria, he studied law, he became a director at the local football club and he learned languages. He can speak Italian, Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese.</p> <p>He wanted to be a football agent, though, and his break came when he was asked by Rob Jansen, one of the leading agents in the Netherlands, to help out as an interpreter on Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s transfer from Ajax to Internazionale in 1993. Raiola was given a job at Jansen\u2019s company only to walk out to set up on his own. Jansen is now another of his enemies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/08/manchester-united-paul-pogba-box-office\">Manchester United\u2019s signing of Paul Pogba proves they are still box office | Paul Doyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raiola wants to do everything on his own. Being a part of a large company is not for him; he endeavours to provide a personal service for his clients. His first big deal took Pavel Nedved from Sparta Prague to Lazio after Euro 96 and, thanks to pushy networking and the use of intermediaries, things have snowballed. Raiola\u2019s current talent roster also features Romelu Lukaku, Blaise Matuidi and Mario Balotelli.</p> <p>So many people have tales to tell about Raiola, both good and bad but always dramatic. Ibrahimovic is fond of the one about how Raiola burst into a VIP room at Monaco airport to negotiate his transfer from Ajax to Juventus in 2004 wearing Hawaiian shorts and a T-shirt. Luciano Moggi, the Juventus general manager, was nonplussed.</p> <p>Raiola did not care and he does not care. His preoccupation is simply to do the best he can for himself and his players. \u201cHe was completely fearless and prepared to pull any number of tricks, and that sounded good,\u201d Ibrahimovic said, at the time when he was considering whether to appoint Raiola. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have another nice boy. I wanted to be transferred and get a good contract.\u201d</p>",

During that time, interrogators placed him in a coffin-sized box for the equivalent of 11 days and two hours, and inside an even smaller box for a total of 29 hours.

There is fracturing within the party the likes I\u2019ve never seen in the 30 years I have worked in Republican politics. </p> <p>The wealthy country clubbers and traditional donor class divided themselves between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Social conservatives of the pro-life, pro-gun, pro-not-gay marriage variety eventually landed with Ted Cruz. Then there were the unexcitable moderate types who limped along quietly behind John Kasich to the bitter end, hoping for some sort of divine intervention in Cleveland that never happened. </p> <p>Last but not least, there was the remaining pissed off 30 to 40% of the GOP, the angry, white, middle-class Americans who wanted a narcissistic, sociopathic, Mexican-hating, baby-expelling, parents-of-a-dead-war-hero-offending, (I\u2019ll stop there even though there\u2019s so much more) reality TV star. </p> <p>Then after Trump won the Indiana primary, when every other candidate dropped out, GOP \u201cleaders\u201d decided that rather than stand on principle and forever lose the Trumpsters, who make up about a third of the party, they would throw their half-hearted, afraid-to-say-his-name-in-public support to \u201cthe nominee.\u201d </p> <p>They justify their support by saing things like, \u201cWe have to protect the supreme court from Hillary Clinton\u201d and citing a list of potential nominees that some junior Trump staffer lifted off the Heritage Foundation\u2019s website. They trust a guy who has proven his aversion to the truth, ranging from lying about receiving a letter from the NFL opposing the proposed debate schedule to the intimate, man-crushing love-fest he shared with Vladimir Putin in the green room when they both appeared on 60 minutes \u201c<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-putin-russia_us_5798e7b4e4b02d5d5ed3d2fc\">together</a>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/donald-trump-2016-election-loss-save-republican-party\">A Trump trainwreck is the only thing that will save the Republican Party | Katrina Jorgensen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, back to what\u2019s-his-name.

Likely they never will. The only effect I see his campaign having on the three-ring circus of an election we\u2019re experiencing is perhaps draining a small percentage of anti-Trump Republicans from Libertarian Gary Johnson, eventually putting him under the 15% threshold to make it into the debates. </p> <p>Which would actually help Trump.

  "<p>It\u2019s been almost 15 years since the US Congress passed the much-derided No Child Left Behind (NCLB) education reform bill in <a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html\">an effort</a> to improve American students\u2019 international competitiveness in reading and math, which had been falling for quite some time. </p> <p>On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of legislators from the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) declared in a new report that the reform efforts of states in the wake of NCLB had been unsuccessful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/24/obama-education-standardized-testing-limits\">Obama calls for cuts to schools' standardized testing regimens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAfter all of the national, state and district reform efforts during the decade following No Child Left Behind, the US was outperformed not only by a majority of the advanced industrial nations, but by a growing number of less-developed nations as well,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>The NCLB is most infamous for its stringent standardized testing requirements through which schools whose students failed to show progress over two years could face significant sanctions \u2013 including state takeovers or being made into private charter schools. It also included provisions requiring that all teachers have a bachelor\u2019s degree in the field they were teaching and a state certification.</p> <p>But though the law established a federal framework, the implementation of the federal education reform law was largely left to the states, many of whom experimented in different ways. And, though NCLB focused on using student assessments to determine and, hopefully, improve student achievement, the often unpopular testing regimens and <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1612/education.aspx\">continuing dissatisfaction</a> with the public education system led to other reforms in some states, many driven by political or ideological concerns.</p> <p>None of them, the group found, have worked on a national scale.</p> <p>\u201cIn retrospect, the NCSL study group concludes that states have tried to find individual \u2018silver bullets\u2019 without setting decisive goals and creating a thoughtful, systemic approach to building a coherent system with an appropriate timeline for implementation, as did the other high-performing countries,\u201d the authors stated.</p> <p>The authors include 22 state lawmakers, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. </p> <p>Robert Behning, an Indiana state representative who served on the study group, said the participants were able to set politics aside to agree that they needed to call out the failure of reforms.</p> <p>\u201cMost people would say that we need to do what we can to take politics out of education,\u201d said Behning, a Republican. \u201cWe need to move forward.\u201d</p> <p>The study\u2019s authors focus on four solutions to the problems: creating comprehensive plans in states to improve education rather than fixing problems one at a time; improving the technical education offerings for students who might not opt for college degrees; improving support for struggling students, particularly those with economic challenges that can affect their ability to learn, and early childhood education programs; and vastly improving the system of recruitment, training and professional development for teachers while increasing their autonomy in the classroom.</p> <p>The report focuses, at one point, on the American system of educational funding: in many states, driven by property taxes in individual districts, the system of school funding all but ensures that the children of the wealthy have more resources devoted to their educational achievements, while lower-income students who could significantly benefit from more spending end up in schools asked to do more \u2013 subsidized school lunches, remedial education, counselling \u2013 with less. </p> <p>And yet, in other countries where students outpace Americans, the opposite is true. \u201cProviding additional resources to schools serving disadvantaged, struggling students is a priority,\u201d the report says. \u201cThese countries demonstrate that, with added support, struggling students can meet high expectations.<br></p> <p>\u201cInversely, American students from the wealthiest communities are most likely to get the best teachers and the finest facilities because of the way we structure our finance systems.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to improving teachers, the report\u2019s authors did not find that a lack of teachers\u2019 unions or a reduction in tenure protections was key to improving student performance. Rather, they found that teachers in high-performing countries were once themselves among the nations\u2019 highest-performing students, recruited into subject-specific programs with a focus on those subjects most needed, expected to do more student-teaching than their American counterparts and then apprenticed to master teachers once assigned to a school. Those teachers also have lighter teaching loads, engage in more professional development and collaboration, counsel and train each other and participate in evaluations of one another\u2019s work based on classroom observation.</p> <p>\u201cWho can argue with improving education for teachers?\u201d asked Behning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/12/schools-standardized-testing-fail-students\">America's dumbest idea: creating a multiple-choice test generation | Erika L S\u00e1nchez</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The legislators were brought together in 2013, after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released the results of its Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which studies what 15-year-olds in 65 countries know about math, reading and science.

And he can thank the freak show that is Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party for restoring his stature as a unifying, national leader with a moderated and mature approach to a complex and unstable world.</p> <p>Eight years ago, Obama represented an existential threat to the Republican party, and not just because he was going to lead the Democratic party to win the White House and Congress by large margins.</p> <p>No, Obama\u2019s biggest threat was that he could realign American politics, shifting it fundamentally towards progressives for a generation. He and his campaign aides talked privately of being the Reagan of the left: a transformative figure who would leave an indelible legislative mark at home and restore America\u2019s position on the world stage.</p> <p>With his appeal to independents and moderate Republicans, Obama could break the Republican party as a national force. With his appeal to minority voters \u2013 a rapidly emerging majority across the country \u2013 he could lock in the fastest growing demographics that could turn red states blue.</p> <p>So the GOP leadership chose to make Obama unacceptable, unpalatable and un-American. On the night of his first inauguration, House Republican leaders met at a Washington steakhouse to plot their path back to power. They would not reform their policies or consider the root cause of their defeat. Instead, they would oppose Obama on everything, well before he tried to pass a giant stimulus bill or healthcare reform.</p> <p>They needed to deny him a reputation for bipartisanship and mainstream politics, and they succeeded. He wasn\u2019t reasonable; he was an ideologue. His vision of healthcare reform wasn\u2019t a free-market system based on Republican plans; it was a socialist takeover that would destroy the American way of life. He was inviting terrorist attacks on the homeland, not hunting down Osama bin Laden. He was acting in unconstitutional ways because he wasn\u2019t really American at all.</p> <p>The party of Sarah Palin, Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann and Roger Ailes had turned him into their own kind of freak.</p> <p>Before he finished his second year in office, Obama was such an object of Republican loathing that the Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell could say \u2013 with impunity \u2013 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d</p> <p>If your political priorities are the total defeat of a single politician \u2013 not the advancement of your own policies through debate or legislation \u2013 then you are already in pretty desperate shape. You render it impossible to compromise with your opponents, and you fan the flames of extremism that will burn anyone in the center.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/donald-trump-hand-size-hollywood-reporter-madame-tussauds\">It's a fact: Trump has tiny hands.

So don\u2019t look dazed and confused at Donald Trump when he runs your playbook more convincingly than your own team.

That\u2019s lower than when Reagan left office in 1988, and it\u2019s lower than when Bill Clinton won re-election in 1996.</p> <p>The rate stood at 8.3% in Obama\u2019s first full month in office, and not much below that when he won re-election. For a president with a job-killing economic plan, that\u2019s not a shabby performance.</p> <p>Sure enough, Obama\u2019s approval ratings (52%) are almost identical to Reagan\u2019s in August 1988 (53%) and a dramatic contrast to those of George W Bush (32%) in 2008. One of these Republican presidents was succeeded by his own vice-president; the other was succeeded by Barack Obama.</p> <p>This should lead to some serious soul-searching inside the Republican party. Not a post-mortem about how to reach out to Latino voters, but a dismantling of the politics of personal destruction, and the creation of a new, hopeful agenda that can appeal to the mainstream.</p> <p>Instead, the only point of unity inside the GOP is its gleeful hatred of Hillary Clinton, and its thinly veiled disdain for a nominee who has yet to find a politician he can\u2019t insult.</p> <p>The Republican party did not entirely fail to destroy Barack Obama. For a few years, aided by the great recession, they almost succeeded. But then they contrived to revive him by nominating a man who would destroy everything Obama stood for, along with much of the free world as we know it.<br></p> <p>The rise of Trump has led, perversely, to the revival of Obama. Republican candidates are saying they will not vote for their presidential nominee, and the party\u2019s national security officials are lining up to condemn Trump as a reckless danger to the Republic. How could the incumbent not look like a statesman compared to a man who apparently can\u2019t be trusted with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/31/politics/trump-elevator-rescue/\">the elevator button</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">never mind a nuclear one</a>?</p> <p>Inside the White House, Obama\u2019s aides talk about a president liberated from previous constraint. On the trail, and at the podium, he seems to love campaigning against his orange nemesis. His party\u2019s candidates can\u2019t get enough of him, and his potential successor \u2013 instead of putting distance between them \u2013 believes Obama doesn\u2019t get enough credit for his economic achievements.</p> <p>This one-term president is having an unusually successful end to his second term, and for that he can thank the Republicans who were so determined to destroy him.</p>",

  "<p>Well, it\u2019s finally here. After two years of beautiful trailers, ambiguous claims and lofty expectations, No Man\u2019s Sky has touched down and opened its blast doors. Judging by its opening hours at least, it is a big, bold and bewildering experience.</p> <p>In my first few minutes, I headed out across my starting planet to find the necessary materials to fix my crashed spaceship, saw my first animal and promptly scared it away when I destroyed the rock it was prancing around, fell down a big hole, was discovered by a sentinel drone, and died.</p> <p>I\u2019m really enjoying No Man\u2019s Sky, so much so that it was very difficult to drag myself away to write this, but my first few hours were a learning process. So here are some things you may want to know before you start your intergalactic journey. Note: I\u2019m playing the PS4 version, so any reference to controls will involve a PS4 controller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4b0997dc7cecc76aad501f216094f447fead085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4b0997dc7cecc76aad501f216094f447fead085/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Space is a dangerous place\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Space is a dangerous place</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1) Keep moving</h2> <p>Space is a dangerous place, and most planets in No Man\u2019s Sky are eventually lethal. Even if the world you\u2019re on has no wildlife, or at least none that\u2019s hostile, it probably has laser-equipped drones flying around it, and it almost definitely has a poisonous or radioactive atmosphere that\u2019s chipping away at your Exosuit defences. While you\u2019re actively playing, it\u2019s hard to forget the atmospheric dangers because of the computer voice that tells you every time the Hazard Protection on your suit loses a chunk of its charge. But it\u2019s all too easy to forget that it\u2019s often not safe just to put your controller down for a few minutes, or that the minerals you must collect to power-up your suit might be many minutes away. If you do want to sit back and admire the scenery, it\u2019s best to find a building or sit in your spaceship.<br></p> <h2>2) The environment is your supermarket</h2> <p>When you first start no Man\u2019s Sky, you need to gather the materials needed to repair and fuel your ship. Everything you see in the environment has some sort of redeemable mineral value \u2013 piles of rocks, plants, chunks of metal \u2013 the HUD will tell you what you\u2019ll get from any article. To collect the goods, just point your MultiTool and shoot \u2013 this will gradually mine the contents. Be careful not to let the mining laser overheat, as this slows you down. Also, be careful not to run out of isotopes \u2013 these are the fuel you need for the laser. If this happens you can actually use the melee button to physical batter ingredients out of rocks or vegetation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c798f013e65d27d57922c96ed6ca15f6ef931077\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c798f013e65d27d57922c96ed6ca15f6ef931077/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade your Multi-Tool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Upgrade your Multi-Tool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Run and gun</h2> <p>Sprint is mapped to R3 (click in the right stick), which isn\u2019t obvious when you begin \u2013 and it feels very unintuitive. Stamina depletes fast, so install the Stamina Enhancement technology as soon as you find it. Master the jet pack too \u2013 large drops will hit your health gauge so get a feel for how long you can stay airborne and make sure you hit the thrusters just before landing.<br></p> <p>Also in \u201ccontrols it took me far too long to figure out\u201d, once you\u2019ve upgraded your Multi-Tool to include a projectile-based Boltcaster (useful for destroying reinforced steel doors, and those bloody sentinel drones) you need to press triangle to switch back to the mining beam. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"488118c8f18c4e1b8e5f54c2e4356ff3d385bb74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/488118c8f18c4e1b8e5f54c2e4356ff3d385bb74/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trust your ship and ignore the red haze\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trust your ship and ignore the red haze.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Trust your ship</h2> <p>The first time I entered the atmosphere of a new planet I panicked, convinced that the red haze that appeared around the edges of the screen meant my ship was going to blow up \u2013 it\u2019s won\u2019t. In fact, your ship is intelligent enough to correct itself when it gets close to the surface, so you don\u2019t even have to pull up to avoid hitting the ground. Just press square when you get close enough and your ship will land itself.<br></p> <p>One thing you can\u2019t rely on your ship to do is avoid asteroids. Your shield will protect you from too much damage, and you\u2019ll even collect some Thamium, useful for charging your Pulse Engine, but it\u2019s best to fly around them or shoot them for the raw materials. Of course, you don\u2019t have to worry about obstacles when you\u2019re in a Pulse Jump. You don\u2019t even have to steer; just point your cursor at your target, press and hold L1 and R1, and your ship will do the rest, pulling you out of the jump once you get too close to a planet or space station. And if you want to exit Pulse Jump before that point you can: just press L2.<br></p> <h2>5) Upgrade your ship, suit, and tool</h2> <p>I\u2019m pretty attached to the little ship I started with, especially given all the trouble I went through to repair it. But one thing that will easily tempt me to switch is a bigger inventory. Your ship, suit, and Multi-Tool all have a limited number of slots, and each upgrade or item takes one up \u2013 so the more weapons you equip to protect you from pirates the less room you have for cargo.</p> <p>Sometimes you\u2019ll come across crashed ships on the planet surface that have a bigger inventory than yours, and if you\u2019re willing to fix them up they\u2019re an economical way of upgrading. Alternatively, you can sidle up to one of the much bigger ships parked in a space station and ask its owner if they\u2019ll sell, but bigger inventories cost a lot of units.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d6d612df04ad8699ac3f917e96c4800f2757691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d6d612df04ad8699ac3f917e96c4800f2757691/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Exosuit upgrade pod\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Exosuit upgrade pod.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only way I\u2019ve found to get a bigger Exosuit or Multi-Tool involves rummaging around in buildings on the planets themselves. You can find Exosuit upgrades in relatively small pointy pods that contain terminals where you exchange units for a single extra inventory slot. And if an alien asks to see your Multi-Tool, hand it over and they\u2019ll offer a better one (or at least, one with more room for upgrades) in return.</p> <h2>6) Don\u2019t enter a conversation empty-handed</h2> <p>While you have to keep your inventory relatively clear, it\u2019s important to hold on to a few raw materials a) to refuel your ship, and b) in case you need to feed a dying alien. I struck up a conversation with a Korvax only to discover it needed sustenance and I had nothing to offer, at which I was told that the creature had died and a new consciousness been downloaded into its body, and that I had gone down in the estimations of the entire Korvax race.</p> <p>Oh, and interact with every knowledge stone you come across, since they teach you words in alien tongues. Knowing the language helps you to guess what kind of item an alien might be looking for, as well as proving useful when you\u2019re rooting around in an abandoned manufacturing facility and the instructions for how to switch off the alarm are written in Gek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c761923f617efa4cbc85211ffea0f27b1ab50b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c761923f617efa4cbc85211ffea0f27b1ab50b6/62_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Knowing the language helps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Knowing the Gek language helps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7) Make a quick buck</h2> <p>First things first, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no actual use to the objects with green backgrounds (known as trade items), so just sell those. Inventories are too small for hoarders.</p> <p>Probably the best way to make money, however, especially at first when you\u2019re bound to spend a lot of time looking at all the weird and wonderful animals you come across, is to upload your discoveries. You discover star systems and planets simply by virtue of entering them, but for flora and fauna you have to tag them with the Analysis Visor on your Multi-Tool. Press L2 to bring up the visor, click in the right stick to zoom, and hold it over an object of interest to tag it. Once you\u2019ve discovered a new species, press Options to load up the Discoveries menu, and press square over each one to upload it, or triangle to give it a funny name first.</p> <p>Individual discoveries net you a few hundred or thousand units each, but our intrepid editor Keith Stuart has been working all day to demonstrate that filling in 100% of the empty records for a planet nets you a nice bonus in the hundreds of thousands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09c1b9ce459cf38457655c0aaf41c9272e7c5369\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c1b9ce459cf38457655c0aaf41c9272e7c5369/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Did you know you can feed the animals?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Did you know you can feed the animals?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8) Speaking of the weird and wonderful animals\u2026</strong></h2> <p>Did you know you can feed the animals? Different creatures eat different materials \u2013 oxides, carbon, what have you \u2013 but once you\u2019ve got the right food you just have to get close enough to press square next to a hungry beast and the next thing you know it\u2019ll have a little smiley face icon to show that it\u2019s your friend. I\u2019m not actually sure if this serves any practical purpose, but I fed something the size of an elephant and it started following me around, honking and running around in circles, so it\u2019s definitely worth it for that alone.</p>",
  "<p>The second season finale of UnREAL, Lifetime\u2019s dubiously capitalized drama about the behind-the-scenes antics of a Bachelor-esque reality show, had a fatal car crash. No, I\u2019m not talking about what happens to protagonist Rachel\u2019s boyfriend and former boss who drove off the road, I\u2019m talking about what happened to the show itself. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jul/14/could-dark-dating-show-satire-unreal-kill-reality-tv\">A surprise hit with critics and viewers last summer</a>, watching the final episode with its sloppy plotting, shoddy writing and dislikeable characters behaving inexplicably was like seeing a Mazda lying in the ditch about to catch fire, except that might have been compelling. <br></p> <p>Why does this type of decline always seem happens to good shows? Mr Robot is halfway through its second season and while it should be celebrating a host of Emmy nominations, it\u2019s <a href=\"http://decider.com/2016/08/04/mr-robot-sophomore-slump/\">fending off accusations</a> that it\u2019s on the fritz. Right now, the knottily plotted hacker drama seems to be more interested in the boring battle between Elliot and his inner demons than in showing us what happened after fsociety brought about the end of the world. The show was always darker than a piece of bread left in the toaster for a fortnight, but this time around it\u2019s just wallowing in bleakness \u2013 and it\u2019s dreary. </p> <p>The creators of both UnREAL and Mr Robot \u2013 Sarah Gertrude Shapiro and Sam Esmail, respectively \u2013 were granted increased control over their high-profile second seasons. To create UnREAL, Shapiro, a former Bachelor producer and first-time TV writer, teamed with Marti Noxon, a veteran of shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Mad Men and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/girlfriends-guide-divorce-end-season-917508\">Noxon left the show after the second episode of season two</a> to focus on her other program, <a href=\"http://www.bravotv.com/girlfriends-guide-to-divorce\">Girlfriends Guide to Divorce</a>, leaving Shapiro in charge of the show. Shapiro even appointed herself as director of one episode. </p> <p>Apparently the first season was not smooth sailing. In a <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/20/sarah-gertrude-shapiro-the-savagely-clever-feminist-behind-unreal\">New Yorker profile of Shapiro</a>, Noxon called their relationship a \u201ccontentious and fruitful collaboration\u201d. But perhaps having Noxon to balance out and sharpen Shapiro was for the best, since the second season seemed to lack discipline and, like the reality television that it tries to satirize, attempted to lure in viewers with crass stunts (like <a href=\"http://www.revelist.com/tv/unreal-season2-black-lives-matter/2986\">an ill-advised Black Lives Matter subplot in the episode Shapiro directed</a>).</p> <p>On Mr Robot, Esmail\u2019s dominance is even more obvious. Not only did he write each episode of the show\u2019s second season, he also directed all of them, shooting scenes out of order the way that a film would be made. Indeed, one of the criticisms leveled against its latest foray is that it seems like a long movie chopped into bits rather than distinct episodes that stand on their own. At least we have a good explanation for why that happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04fea388bb5d57de69aeedc53cc9d5cb8baa8ed6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04fea388bb5d57de69aeedc53cc9d5cb8baa8ed6/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vince Vaughn in True Detective\u2019s second season, which disappointed both critics and the public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vince Vaughn in True Detective\u2019s second season, which disappointed both critics and the public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lacey Terrell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, UnREAL has already been renewed for a third season, and Mr Robot looks likely to be, since both shows are favourites on their respective networks \u2013 unlike HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/11/in-praise-of-true-detective-season-two\">True Detective</a>, which seems unlikely to survive a second season which was both critically panned and saw a dramatic downturn in viewership. That sophomore season had seen writer Nic Pizzolatto take the reins, working with a rotating series directors after the first season\u2019s director, Cary Fukunaga, moved to an executive producer role and, he <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cary-fukunaga-true-detective-season-2-1201582339/\">suggested to Var</a><a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/cary-fukunaga-true-detective-season-2-1201582339/\">iety, had his creative input sidelined</a>. </p> <p>Most terrible second seasons are due to chaos behind the camera. The infamously slow second season of The Walking Dead was filmed after the zombie series\u2019s initial showrunner, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/walking-dead-creator-frank-darabonts-852491\">Frank Darabont, was fired</a> and the production plunged into turmoil. David Lynch had left Twin Peaks by the time its second meandering season was under way, and Washington\u2019s most famous small town seemed to lack purpose. </p> <p>While Twin Peaks was axed because it got so bad it bled viewers like Laura Palmer the night of her murder, there are plenty of shows that have course-corrected and pulled themselves out of a death spiral. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland\">Homeland</a> decided not to kill Nicholas Brody at the end of the first season, it made a grave error which led to two seasons of outlandish plots for him and CIA paramour Carrie Mathison. Finally, at the end of season three, they did what should have been done 24 episodes earlier and executed him, resetting the show as a spy drama starring Carrie alone and bringing it back to form. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/08/desperate-housewives-getting-desperate\">Desperate Housewives</a> was a megahit after its first season, but adopting a darker tone didn\u2019t work well for the widely panned follow-up. Marc Cherry smartened up and brought the show back with a third season that focused on the frothy plotting that made the show a success in the first place. </p> <p>Hopefully UnREAL and Mr Robot can steal a page from these shows\u2019 playbooks, focusing on the characters and storytelling that made them popular and trying to find some stability behind the camera. Sadly for these two show\u2019s creators, that stability might come at the cost of some of their autonomy. However, there are worse things to give up: the shows they worked so hard a building. If the quality continues to slacken and viewers are jumping off their sinking ships, they could be the captains that go down with them.</p>",

I\u2019ve put together a quick and easy template for your basic reporting needs (cribbed and adapted from a piece I wrote about coverage of female politicians in 2014, because you could basically have this conversation about any industry, and I do):</p> <p>NEWS REPORT: [Female Athlete] did [sports] today. [Describe sports.] THE END. Sportswriting accomplished!</p> <p><strong>DO</strong> write about female athletes the way you write about male athletes \u2013 ie without mentioning their gender except maybe in the name of the sport. Can you imagine if we brought up gender every time we wrote about men? \u201cPerky male point guard Isaiah Thomas, stepping out in a flattering terrycloth headwrap, proves that men really can play ball and look cool-summery-sexy doing it!\u201d See how unbearable that sounds? Chase that feeling.</p> <p><strong>DON\u2019T </strong>spend more time discussing female athletes\u2019 makeup, hairdos, very small shorts, hijabs, bitchy resting faces, voice pitch, thigh circumference, marital status and age than you spend analysing the incredible feats of strength and skill they have honed over a lifetime of superhuman discipline and restraint.</p> <p><strong>DON\u2019T</strong> refer to women in terms of men they know, are related to, work with or have sex with. Women are fully-formed, autonomous people who do things. We are not pets or gadgets or sex-baubles.</p> <p><strong>DO</strong> write about gender when it\u2019s relevant, such as when you\u2019re discussing gender discrimination \u2013 for instance, the pay gap in women\u2019s basketball and soccer, and the garbage way the media covers (or doesn\u2019t) women\u2019s sports.</p> <p><strong>DON\u2019T</strong> bring your sex feelings into it. And, yes, I am aware that there are more than several women on Twitter with passionate opinions about the shoulder-to-waist ratios of the piles of trapezoids on the men\u2019s swimming roster. But there is not currently a vacuum of serious, well-rounded coverage of men\u2019s sports. There is not a historic precedent of men\u2019s bodies eclipsing their accomplishments, and, in turn, undermining their credibility and hobbling their upward mobility in every major industry. It is OK to have sex feelings. Just watch where you\u2019re spraying them.</p> <p>Of course, there is plenty of smart, nuanced, neutral Olympics coverage out there too, and live TV is hard, and people make mistakes. But the way we talk about women \u2013 particularly women at the top of their fields, women whose power and prowess is undeniable \u2013 has a tangible impact on the way we treat female colleagues, female job interviewees and female presidents. This is not an accident. It is the system working as designed.</p> <p>Athletes are athletes. If you care about sports, write about sports. If you care about gender equality, write about sports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\" data-alt=\"RioRun\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\">RioRun</a> </figure>",
  "<p>Former Labour leader Ed Miliband is emailing all party members, urging them to back Owen Smith against Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership election.</p> <p>Miliband, the MP for Doncaster North, was among senior party figures calling for Corbyn to step down as leader after he lost the confidence of the majority of his MPs, and nominated Smith as leader.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjptaQC4pEM\">In a video</a>, he delivers a personal endorsement of Smith as the right person to lead Labour in the wake of June\u2019s Brexit vote. He says the new prime minister, Theresa May, has adopted the \u201clanguage of the left\u201d but could take Britain to the right.</p> <p>Corbyn is widely thought to be ahead in the race, and his backers swept the board in elections to the party\u2019s governing national executive committee, strengthening his control over Labour machinery.</p> <p>Ballot papers are due to be sent out in the coming days \u2013 though the timing of the contest has been thrown into doubt by Monday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">high court ruling that 130,000 new members must be given a vote</a>, which the NEC now plans to appeal.</p> <p>Miliband stepped aside after he led Labour to defeat at last year\u2019s general election. The changes he made to the system for electing Labour leaders \u2013 throwing the ballot open to party members and weakening the power of MPs and trades unions \u2013 helped Corbyn sweep to victory in last year\u2019s leadership race.</p> <p>Miliband said Labour needed a leader who could \u201cunite our party and make us a serious alternative government\u201d and praised \u201cthe vision of a more equal society shining through\u201d in Smith\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>Corbyn and Smith will face each other in a second public hustings on Thursday night in Gateshead, against the background of an increasingly bitter battle for the future of Labour which saw Corbyn\u2019s team hit back on Tuesday against claims by deputy leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson\">Tom Watson that \u201cTrotskyist entryists\u201d</a> were seeking to gain control of the party.</p>",
  "<p>Twenty four hours after the Guardian and some other newspapers, including the money class\u2019s own Financial Times, put the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/uks-top-bosses-earned-10-pay-rise-2015-average-salary-hit-55m\">10% pay rise for FTSE 100 chief executives</a> on Monday\u2019s front page, I went back to the pink \u2019un to check the fallout. Not much yet, except one encouraging straw in the wind. I\u2019ll come back to that.</p> <p>On this occasion the Daily Mail didn\u2019t have much room for the High Pay Centre\u2019s <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/pubs/10-pay-rise-thatll-do-nicely\">latest update</a>. It devoted more space (yet again) to the excessive scale of gongs and goodbye handshakes being paid to David Cameron\u2019s outgoing staff at No 10, but also to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3728547/Police-chief-s-64-days-year-officers-paid-PM-use-loophole-choose-holiday-moan-cuts-budgets.html\">its own expos\u00e9</a> of excessive pay, perks and long holidays of taxpayer-funded chief constables and their top teams. Roy Greenslade, tabloid editor turned professor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/aug/08/why-newspaper-editors-like-fat-cats-they-help-to-sell-newspapers\">explains why readers love it</a>.</p> <p>The Mail can be admirably tough on bankers\u2019 greed and firms that cheat their customers. But it reserves special venom for public sector excess, as it did only last winter <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3309596/The-shocking-scale-fat-cat-pay-public-sector-exposed-today-major-Daily-Mail-investigation.html\">when turning over NHS, council and other senior officials doing a bit too nicely</a> and \u2013 as with the coppers \u2013 trying to hide behind FoI walls. Quite right too, though it serves to remind us that indignation is often tribal and selective. Ripping off customers, shareholders and staff is a lesser crime. </p> <p>Brexit gives us all the chance to \u201ctake back control\u201d of all sorts of things, at least in theory. That goes for top people\u2019s pay packages, a sensitive issue long before the ratio over average pay rose from around 20:1 in the 60s \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise/\">here\u2019s some context</a> \u2013 to today\u2019s FTSE 100 index\u2019s ratio of 129:1 for CEOs, a figure closer to 250:1 in the US. </p> <p>With the naivety that characterised many of her dealings with capitalism, Margaret Thatcher cut higher tax rates (60% until 1988 even under her) and taxed perks in the belief that honest achievement could be more openly rewarded. Instead the bandwagon simply gathered pace, running over lots of jobs and shareholding pensioners in the process.</p> <p>No wonder voters everywhere feel angry, even though some older trade unionists may remember voting for Maggie in 1979 to restore their own pay \u201cdifferentials\u201d, eroded by Labour 1970s egalitarianism. No wonder some now reach out to chancers who offer simple remedies: Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, the Sun and Daily Mail, even to Jeremy Corbyn if he were more of a firebrand, less of a freezerbrand, more a populist than an unpopulist.</p> <p>As for the spurned EU, its efforts to use its collective muscle to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/15/banks-extra-payments-bonus-cap-regulator-bankers-eu\">curb bankers\u2019 bonuses</a> and other monopolistic corporate excess was one source of Brexiters\u2019 complaint. Alas, it\u2019s also true that the Brussels elite looked after itself and will expect post-Brexit Britain to help pay  its <a href=\"https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/brexit-triggers-row-over-british-eu-civil-servants-pensions\">generous pensions</a> for decades.</p> <p>What is to be done, as Lenin might have put it? The other day a pay consultancy expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) warned that shareholders and managers must do more to constrain excess or risk public resentment triggering a government clampdown, as promised in France and threatened \u2013 before and after her becoming PM \u2013 by Theresa May.</p> <p>She wants CEOs\u2019 pay to be subject to a mandatory shareholder vote \u2013 unlike the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal \">nonbinding (and ignored) vote</a> against BP\u2019s Bob Dudley and other self-satisfied rascals last spring \u2013 and a CEO/average employee ratio to be published in the annual report.</p> <p>That sounds right, yet PwC\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0636958e-4914-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c.html#axzz4Gj3OWYso\">Tom Gosling argues</a> (paywall) that May\u2019s plan might backfire by making shareholders even less inclined to challenge the board. They too are victims of the contemporary cult of the CEO, cherished in the face of repeated disaster and disappointment, much as overpaid England football managers are cherished until they crash. </p> <p>It\u2019s not just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/19/executive-pay-ceos-dont-need-cash\">Will Hutton saying this</a> \u2013 Google it. Firms with boards dominated by an over-mighty CEO \u2013 they\u2019re usually blokes, as the Guardian report states \u2013 are worse than those with more challenge and less testosterone. If you look at <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/sites/bank-ceo-compensation/2016/\">big international banks</a> (paywall)  there is a large variation in CEO pay, further proof that the \u201cmarket rate\u201d argument is a self-justifying racket too. Truly exceptional people <em>make</em> businesses, a different skill from climbing the corporate ladder.</p> <p>So May seems to be on the right track, though the scope for opacity and deceit is likely to remain considerable unless she really means to improve corporate governance. Thus Roger Ailes,  now leaving Fox News trailing a cloud of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">sexual harassment allegations</a>, was relieved of the burden of being a \u201cnamed executive officer\u201d in the annual report so his pay could be hidden. Wall St and City traders, who do so much damage and can earn more than the boss, often escape scrutiny or censure until they\u2019re fired or (rare) end up in court.</p> <p>Jailing some high flyers would be another improvement, one which May could help only indirectly (as is proper) by better funding  the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/sep/23/cps-chief-inspector-kevin-mcginty-cuts-can-leave-agencies-unable-to-function\">Crown Prosecution Service</a> (CPS), overstretched and demoralised as it often is.  If there\u2019s insufficient evidence for M\u2019Learned Friend, parliament could dish out more of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/sir-philip-green-told-do-right-thing-bhs-pension-deficit\">Frank Field treatment</a>. Even \u201cKing\u201d Phil Green didn\u2019t enjoy it.</p> <p>Every little helps, so while we\u2019re on the subject, why not require boards to address their staff\u2019s low pay as well as high pay? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-raise-tax-pay-rise-public-sector-labour\">Jeremy Corbyn has just come up with an idea</a> to raise corporation tax by 1% and the top income tax rate to 50p (again) to fund a public sector pay rise after years of freeze/cap. Always good to hear some specifics from him \u2013 let\u2019s see how it goes down.</p> <p>But business is pushing in the opposite direction: 16 trade groups wrote to Greg Clark, (a man who once said the Tories should listen more closely to Polly Toynbee), urging the new business secretary to backpedal on the 2020 goal of a \u00a39 per hour national minimum wage (NMW) because of \u201ceconomic uncertainties\u201d, as Brexit is sometimes called. </p> <p>It\u2019s also a test for May, one on which she should keep her nerve, as the TUC says. NMW rose from \u00a36.70 to \u00a37.20 in April, the sharpest rise for 10 years. But employers seem to be coping, just as they did when Blair and Brown successfully introduced a minimum wage after 1997 despite dire Tory warnings. </p> <p>And that\u2019s where the sliver of good news from Tuesday\u2019s FT comes in. Tuesday\u2019s editorial in the pink \u2019un, which is full of clever people and wary of free-market zealots, supports that position, just as the Guardian does. Even George (\u201cwho he?\u201d) Osborne eventually embraced the concept. Voters are still sizing up May: does she mean it in her unflashy way?</p> <p>Symbolism matters in politics, but so does cash in pockets. And, unlike fat cats who tuck much of their surplus \u201cearnings\u201d under their king-sized beds, poor people usually go straight out and spend what they have. </p> <p>It all helps to boost demand, so fairness and macroeconomics march in step.</p>",
  "<p>In Dave Eggers\u2019 brilliant book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/circle-6.html\">The Circle</a>, we are propelled into a utopian tech company which has amalgamated the functions of Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter into a single identity product called TruYou. This is a company that strives for a better future through the advent of shiny tech, which smugly insists it can cure the world through transparency and a benign digital universe.</p> <p>The relentless synthesis of technology and human rights idealism that drives the book results in the life of the protagonist Mae becoming fully transparent and accessible. She wears a camera around her neck at all times to document everything she does in the belief that privacy is theft. As you can predict, it all spirals horribly out of control in an Orwellian horror show which shows the pursuit of tech utopia as a dangerous, slippery slope.</p> <p>The Circle poses the salient question of when does tech stop becoming an enabler to a better life? When does it suddenly assert its pedantic attributes and throw us into a homogeneous society where perfectionism rules and creativity is stifled. And is it at odds with our romantic notions of the past, especially in the UK? As Brexit sadly shows, a lot of people yearn for a lost past, a harking back to fantastical golden days, or, as author Paul Gilroy poetically called it, a \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Postcolonial_Melancholia.html?id=BpYHonKn_vIC\">postcolonial melancholia</a>\u201d.</p> <p>So where has this obsession with nostalgic yearning and endless period dramas come from?</p> <p>After the second world war, the birth of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/mar/01/online-video-overtake-linear-tv-2020\">linear TV</a> in the 1950s accelerated pop culture and mass cultural icons. The legends of the past, such as David Bowie and Prince, achieved iconic significance not only because of their creative genius but because consumers\u2019 attention was limited to one medium. With the digital revolution came the fragmentation of media and content spilling over uncontrollably. These icons of the past, who broke societal boundaries and created new genres, will never be seen again. With the rise of click-bait content, it\u2019s easy to see why we often feel that the past was rich in creative potential and how the future of tech can sometimes seem overwhelming in its infinite complexity. </p> <p>In a future of virtual reality and artificial intelligence, do we immediately marry the past with creativity? At the most recent Cannes Lions international festival of creativity awards, Rob Schwartz, CEO of ad agency TBWA/Chiat/Day New York, said \u201cI\u2019ve been coming to Cannes for 15 years and this is the first year where no one, I mean no one, was talking about creative. VR? Yes. Ad blocking? Yes. Gwyneth Paltrow? Yes.\u201d</p> <p>This unknown new future is sometimes hard to stomach. That said, tech has democratised creativity, given us hundreds of open-source apps and tools and created a sharing economy that has upskilled hundreds of people. Genuine creativity gives us a new appetite for something we hadn\u2019t previously wanted or could articulate in the past. Netflix rewired our entertainment culture and ushered in the binge-watching phenomenon, Uber made us realise that we always needed cabs on demand and god forbid they were more than three minutes away. </p> <p>Whether this type of creativity takes the form we were once comfortable with is another question entirely. What is clear is that we must start embracing the future and stop romanticising the past, for the sake of culture and tech innovations; but, of course, stopping just short of the brave new world depicted in The Circle. </p> <p><em>Lara Enoch is a consumer account manager on Guardian Labs</em></p>",
  "<p>Paines Plough\u2019s pop-up <a href=\"http://www.painesplough.com/blog/category/roundabout/\">Roundabout</a> theatre can be an unforgiving space, exposing the slightest weakness in both writing and acting. But when an actor really commands it, as Amy McAllister does in Stacey Gregg\u2019s play, it can be a thrilling place of intimacy and confession.</p> <p>McAllister plays Kes who, as an eight year old, revelled in wearing \u201cdebonair\u201d waistcoats rather than dresses and tried \u2013 but failed \u2013 to pee standing up like her brothers. As Kes grows older, she identifies with the male characters in videogames and movies. Others might assume Kes would have a thing for Ryan Gosling but the truth is more complex: \u201cI want to be Ryan Gosling.\u201d When the teenage Kes meets Jules online, and the latter believes that Kes is a boy, the two start a relationship.</p> <p> Produced by the fine Northern Irish company <a href=\"http://www.primecutproductions.co.uk/\">Prime Cut</a>, Gregg\u2019s play is clearly inspired by the case of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2015/12/dark-truth-behind-convictions-gender-fraud\">Justine McNally</a>, who was convicted of \u201cgender fraud\u201d after starting a sexual relationship with a teenage girl who believed her to be a boy. The in-the-round space works beautifully as Kes sits before us and talks as if we are at a meeting of an LGBTQ group.

He imposed a penalty of 10,000 reais (\u00a32,300) for violations of his order.</p> <p>Rio 2016 is challenging the judgment, saying it contravenes the host nation agreement and Brazil\u2019s Olympic law, which bans \u201cflags for purposes other than the festive and friendly event.\u201d</p> <p>The judge disputes this, saying the law only specifically prohibits offensive, racist, xenophobic or discriminatory messages, and \u201cdoes not appear to ban peaceful demonstrations of a political nature through posters, use of T-shirts and other lawful means in official sites of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Rio 2016\u201d.</p> <p>The legal battle will touch on the thorny issue of whether the International Olympic Committee\u2019s conditions on host nations override sovereignty and basic rights. Olympic organisers are keen to keep Brazil\u2019s political upheaval outside the sporting arenas.</p> <p>The Rio 2016 director of communications Mario Andrada said: \u201cWe have the right to ask for a reconsideration from the judge, which we did. Meanwhile, we will fully respect the injunction. We just believe that sport venues are not the place for political, religious or racial protests or manifestations.\u201d</p> <p>The International Olympic Association\u2019s director of communications, Mark Adams, added: \u201cThe Games should not become a platform for political debate.\u201d</p> <p>The country is deeply divided over the ongoing impeachment of Workers\u2019 party president Dilma Rousseff, who is on trial in the Senate for alleged budget irregularities. Her supporters claim this is a \u201ccoup\u201d and have focused their anger on her replacement, the interim president Michel Temer.</p> <p>Protests on this \u2013 and other issues \u2013 disrupted the relay of the Olympic torch, which was extinguished by demonstrators on several occasions in the week before the Games.</p> <p>To minimise the political backlash, organisers did not announce Temer at the opening ceremony and kept his welcome speech to less than 10 seconds. Even so, he was roundly booed.</p> <p>Since then, ticket-holders have been ejected in several venues for displaying \u201c<em>Fora Temer</em>\u201d (Temer Out) placards and T-shirts. Video clips of people being thrown out by security guards have prompted outrage. To get around the ban, some have also made signs saying \u201c<em>Fora Vcs Sabe Quem</em>\u201d (You Know Who Out).</p> <p>The clampdown is consistent with previous Olympics. Part of the hosting agreement is a ban on political signs and commercial advertising other than those of the official sponsors.</p> <p>Rule 50 of the International Olympic Committee charter says: \u201cNo kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.\u201d Similar restrictions were imposed before the World Cup and went unchallenged.</p> <p>The influential sports columnist Juca Kfouri, wrote that the expulsions were an example of \u201crepressive stupidity\u201d and would only serve to encourage new protests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/dutch-gymnast-yuri-van-gelder-rio-olympics-expelled\">Gymnast Yuri van Gelder expelled from Olympics after night of drinking in Rio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suspended president Rousseff called the restrictions characteristic of a subtle tightening of critical debate. \u201cIt is strange that people cannot speak out in the Maracan\u00e3 and Deodoro,\u201d said the Workers\u2019 party leader, who was herself booed during the opening of the World Cup in 2014.</p> <p>Her removal from office is expected to move a step closer in the next two days, when the Senate will decide whether she should face a final vote, which could come as early as the end of this month.</p> <p>Global unease about Brazil\u2019s political situation was apparent in the low attendance by heads of state at this Olympics.

The irony is that the freeway was the location for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Revolution\" title=\"\">people power revolution that ousted the Marcos dictatorship</a> in 1986. Bodies bundled up with tape \u2013 and labelled \u201csnatcher\u201d, \u201cdealer\u201d, \u201cpusher\u201d or \u201cuser\u201d \u2013 suggest vigilantes are taking Duterte\u2019s wild promise to eradicate all crime seriously.

Drugs are an issue in the Philippines but only one of many, and Duterte has failed to display any understanding that drug crime is more a symptom of many social problems rather than the cause. Poverty and corruption were rightly on Duterte\u2019s manifesto, yet the drug obsession is blinding him and leading to carnage for a fundamentally flawed ideal.</p> <p>How <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/142234-rodrigo-duterte-drug-list-dead-judge\" title=\"\">these lists are created</a> is anyone\u2019s guess.

Police corruption is at the heart of the matter \u2013 in one breath Duterte denounces the police as corrupt, yet is allowing them to murder without due process, and compile lists of people to kill.

  "<p>Anyone paying even cursory attention to wildlife stories in recent years would have heard all about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/03/african-elephants-killed-faster-than-they-are-being-born\">Africa\u2019s elephant poaching crisis</a>. And with good reason.

But the killing goes on \u2013 fuelled by demand in Asia and increasingly driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/23/elephant-ivory-smuggling-kingpin-arrested-in-tanzania\">international organised crime</a>.</p> <p>So it is understandable that a raft of elephant and ivory trade proposals have been put forward for debate at this year\u2019s<a href=\"https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/countdown_begins_for_the_2016_world_wildlife_conference\"> global wildlife trade conference in South Africa</a>. </p> <p>Three of them have attracted a disproportionate amount of media coverage: the call by a group of African countries for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/african-wildlife-officials-appalled-as-eu-opposes-a-total-ban-on-ivory-trade\">formal global ban on ivory trade</a> by listing all elephant populations in Appendix I under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), and <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201606020196.html\">counter-proposals by Namibia and Zimbabwe</a> to allow them to resume ivory trading.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/african-wildlife-officials-appalled-as-eu-opposes-a-total-ban-on-ivory-trade\">African wildlife officials appalled as EU opposes a total ban on ivory trade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These proposals to trade or not to trade seem at first glance to go to the very heart of how to stop the poaching. But it is important to remember that a de facto international ivory trade ban already exists and moving all populations to Appendix I would not change this. And it is definitely not the time to contemplate even a partial resumption in the trade. </p> <p>In fact, the main impact of these three proposals will be to fuel a divisive debate and divert attention away from measures that are needed to deal with the fundamental issues behind the illegal ivory trade.</p> <p>It is critical that attention remains focussed on the Cites-led National Ivory Action Plan (NIAP) process, which is absolutely central to global efforts to stop the poaching and the trafficking, and reduce demand for ivory. At the last Cites conference in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/ivory-poaching-sanctions-cites\">19 African and Asian countries were required to take timebound action</a> to address gaps in their legislation and enforcement or face sanctions. </p> <p>This process is now beginning to yield results. But all these gains could be lost if Cites does not continue to prioritise this approach and strengthen the monitoring of these countries\u2019 implementation of their ivory action plans.</p> <p>Fighting over whether to further formalise the international ban or to partially end it might give the impression that countries were trying to do something to address the crisis. But none of the three pro- or anti-trade proposals will address what is really facilitating illicit ivory trafficking \u2013 corruption, inadequate laws and lack of enforcement in countries along the illegal trade chain, and rampant demand in Asia.</p> <p>Well aware of this, the European commission has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/african-wildlife-officials-appalled-as-eu-opposes-a-total-ban-on-ivory-trade\">decided to oppose all three proposals</a> and urged the EU, which is a critical voting bloc representing all 28 member states, to adopt this position at the Cites conference. </p> <p>It is a decision based firmly on sense and science, and one that is good for Africa\u2019s elephants. But it has led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/african-wildlife-officials-appalled-as-eu-opposes-a-total-ban-on-ivory-trade\">stampede of criticism</a> from members of the African Elephant Coalition, who have blamed the EU for undermining the chances of a global ivory ban and so placed elephants at even greater risk of extinction. An <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/global_ivory_ban_loc/?slideshow\">Avaaz petition</a> taking the EU to task also quickly gathered more than 1.5m signatures.</p> <p>But WWF believes the commission is right, and we encourage all member states to follow its lead and agree to oppose all three of these proposals, while supporting resolutions that will enhance the fight against wildlife crime in general, and ivory trafficking in particular. </p> <p>Indeed, the most powerful thing the EU can do for Africa\u2019s elephants is to make it clear that it will push for trade sanctions under Cites against countries that do not fulfil their commitments under the NIAP process.</p> <p>By making its opposition clear early on, the EU could signal that none of these proposals are likely to get the necessary two-thirds majority at the conference and so could encourage the proponents to withdraw all three of these controversial proposals ahead of the meeting. </p> <p>This would avoid unnecessary bitterness and prevent a divisive debate that would split Africa in two at a time when it desperately needs to come together to solve this crisis. It would also pave the way for constructive debate on issues that will help tackle poaching and illegal ivory trade, including stronger laws, measures to counter corruption, and more vigilance at key ports, such as Mombasa and Zanzibar, from which ivory continues to be smuggled out of Africa.</p> <p>It would also provide the space to build a broad coalition in support of another draft resolution to be considered at the Cites conference to strengthen efforts to change consumer behaviour. </p> <p>Like WWF, the commission backs this critical proposal, which could help to significantly reduce the demand that drives the illegal ivory trade.</p>",

They hope to address the problem of low participation in the arts among young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p>The aim is to get children hooked on art and culture at an early age, and to address the fact that UK arts audiences are overwhelmingly white and middle class. </p> <p>The schemes will begin in September in Liverpool, Blackpool, Birmingham and Barking and Dagenham, and will offer 600 young people access to cultural activities such as free visits to plays and behind-the-scenes access to museums and galleries.</p> <p>Bradley said culture was an integral part of British society that \u201cboosts tourism, improves our wellbeing and provides a source of local pride and identity\u201d. \u201cWe want to ensure that it is available to everyone, no matter what their background,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The white paper proposed a lottery-funded programme that would operate in 70 areas and reach 14,000 young people a year, of which these schemes are the pilots. </p> <p>Bradley said the programme would \u201copen doors for hundreds of young people across the country, so they can enjoy our fantastic arts and culture scene and gain the skills to build careers in this thriving sector\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/feb/17/arts-and-culture-systematically-removed-from-uk-education-system\">A report published by the Warwick commission last year</a> revealed that the wealthiest, best educated and least ethnically diverse 8% of society make up nearly half of live music audiences and one-third of theatregoers and gallery visitors.</p> <p>Providing art and culture for all was the main thrust of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/23/arts-organisations-must-reach-out-to-everyone-minister-ed-vaizey\">the white paper published by the former arts minister Ed Vaizey</a>, the first since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/feb/23/jennie-lee-policy-arts-white-paper-funding\">Jennie Lee\u2019s groundbreaking report in 1965</a>.

  "<p>It is with a mixture of intense frustration and sadness that I read the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/06/anger-over-legal-aid-bill-for-ellie-butlers-parents\" title=\"\">reports about the amount of legal aid</a> that Ben Butler, convicted of murdering his six-year-old daughter, and his partner Jennie Gray, guilty of child cruelty, received. The figure is quoted at approximately \u00a31.5m over a 15-year period, with \u00a31.2m in civil legal aid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/apr/23/legal-aid-cuts-defendants-unrepresented\">Legal aid cuts have led to surge in DIY defence, says charity </a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s frustrating for a number of reasons. Of the \u00a31.5m, approximately \u00a3300,000 went towards legal aid for criminal proceedings, and accounted for a month-long trial involving complex medical evidence for an original child cruelty and GBH trial, Gray\u2019s case involving perverting the course of justice, and Butler\u2019s murder trial. One would hope that in all of these cases, the legal aid lawyers were working to the best of their ability using the highest quality lawyers willing to conduct work at legal aid rates.</p> <p>What is also true, is that the lawyers involved will have undertaken an immense amount of work that they weren\u2019t paid for. Had they been privately funded, the fees would have been many multiples higher.</p> <p>As a criminal practitioner of more than 20 years, I know the workloads that are undertaken daily by legal aid lawyers. In London, the going yearly salary for a duty solicitor is about \u00a330,000 but may reach \u00a340,000 with experience. Barristers\u2019 chambers are paid \u00a350 for sending a barrister to a hearing. This covers travelling time, the two hours waiting to get into court and the actual time spent representing a client in court \u2013 and the barristers will only get a cut of that money.</p> <p>If you attend the police station, the firm is paid \u00a3150-\u00a3250 per case, which includes the initial attendance, plus any further bails to return to the station on other days \u2013 which might include ID parades or second or third interviews. Those who freelance at the police station are paid less than \u00a3100 per visit, which can mean a couple of hours travelling as well as up to 12 hours of waiting and advising. Police station advisers\u2019 fees therefore range from an hourly rate of \u00a330 down to \u00a37 \u2013 it doesn\u2019t vary with bank holidays or the fact that most of this advising occurs at ungodly hours of the night or weekends.</p> <p>Legal aid solicitors have similar qualification periods to doctors: after completing a first degree they undergo a year of practical qualifications, then two years of on-the-job training. The qualification for barristers is a year shorter \u2013 but the cost of this in London has been estimated by the <a href=\"http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Bar Council</a> as more than \u00a3120,000. Graduate salaries in legal aid firms are usually at the <a href=\"http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Law Society</a>\u2019s minimum of \u00a318,590 pa for London. Of the respondents surveyed by <a href=\"http://www.younglegalaidlawyers.org/\" title=\"\">Young Legal Aid Lawyers</a> (whose membership consists of those within 10 years of qualification), 50% had salaries under \u00a320,000 in 2013.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.pimlicoplumbers.com/charges-original\" title=\"\">well-known London plumbing firm</a> is delighted to share its call-out rates with the public \u2013 they are \u201c100% transparent charges and we have a clear, upfront, open and honest pricing system\u201d. These charges range from a weekday daytime rate of \u00a395 per hour at a minimum of one-hour call-out and 15 minute increments after this, to a 12am-7am rate of \u00a3200 per hour. Trust me \u2013 legal aid firms would kill for these rates.</p> <p>Legal aid is a national institution, like the NHS. We all hope that we will never need it, that we won\u2019t have unfounded rumours triggering a social services investigation or family proceedings; that we won\u2019t be falsely accused of a crime. Even if we have done something wrong, or criminal or stupid, we should still have someone who understands the law fighting on our behalf to put our side of the story and explain our circumstances. This is part of what has separated us as a \u201ccivilised society\u201d, these rights and freedoms and the privilege to be served by those who choose to sacrifice massive incomes to do relatively poorly paid legal aid work.</p> <p>The unfortunate thing is that it is the abnormal cases like this (which are often the only things that allow a legal aid practice to survive the otherwise dreadful legal aid rates), and the abnormal earnings of barristers with huge experience dealing with the most serious cases and working insane hours, that get reported. Legal aid is not a vote winner; it doesn\u2019t fall into the category of being tough on crime, and it always seems to be paid to people we like to blame \u2013 immigrants, good-for-nothings, so-called scroungers. It\u2019s just your money being spent on someone else.</p> <p>The difficulty comes when that someone else is you. Teacher, doctor, police officer, journalist, city trader, engineer, labourer, English, Scottish, white, black, depressed, addicted, sober: I have represented all of you, without judgment, to the best of my abilities, 24 hours a day for over 20 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/21/ellie-butler-grandad-devastation-complete-neal-gray\">Ellie Butler's grandfather: 'The devastation is complete and utter'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What makes me sad is this. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/21/ellie-butler-grandad-devastation-complete-neal-gray\" title=\"\">Ellie Butler\u2019s grandparents</a> were not entitled to legal aid.

At a personal level, I am peeved because I am one of those people who will be away and therefore cannot be there (and certainly would be otherwise).

Impress has been carefully crafted by its chief executive, Jonathan Heawood, and his board to secure recognition by attempting to meet the charter\u2019s 29 recognition criteria.</p> <p>There is a gulf of difference between the two organisations. Impress is currently regulating 33 small, independent news outlets while Ipso is regulating the overwhelming majority of the newspaper and magazine publishers of Britain.</p> <p>Impress is still holding consultations about drawing up a code of standards while Ipso has been dealing with complaints under the editors\u2019 code of practice for 18 months.</p> <p>So it could appear like something of a David versus Goliath clash. In fact, if Impress gets its charter recognition, then the Mail, in company with other Ipso publishers, fears that David\u2019s very existence could be a potent threat to Goliath. The Mail explains why:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cIf Impress is recognised, it could trigger implementation of a draconian law under which newspapers may have to pay the legal costs of people who sue them - even if the newspaper wins its case.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>At risk is the current principle of \u201closer pays\u201d, in which the unsuccessful party in a libel action has to cover the legal costs of both sides.</p> <p>Under the 2013 crime and courts act, that principle would not hold if the publisher facing a libel claim was not a member of an approved regulator. </p> <p>Since Ipso has decided it will not seek recognition, all of its members therefore fear the consequences of Impress gaining official charter approval (as, incidentally do those publishers of titles, such as the Guardian, the Independent, and Financial Times, that have not signed up to either Ipso or Impress). </p> <p>It is hard not to view the idea of publishers paying the costs of unsuccessful litigants as anything other than unjust. Inevitably, this whole matter is likely to end up with legal arguments, first in the Royal Courts of Justice and then in Strasbourg.</p> <p>So the outcome of 23 August PRP meeting could be crucial. It could have far-reaching implications for publishers, editors and all journalists. It will take place at The Buckingham Room, De Vere West One, 9-10 Portland Place, London, beginning at 10am.</p> <p>If you want to attend, you should email <a href=\"mailto:HPerry@pressrecognitionpanel.org.uk\">HPerry@pressrecognitionpanel.org.uk</a>.</p> <p><strong>Update, Friday 12 August: </strong>I have been reminded, rightly, that my reference to the crime and courts act mentioned, as far as publishers are concerned, only the stick and not the carrot.</p> <p>The point us that if publishers join a recognised regulator, then they will not be liable for a claimant\u2019s court costs... even if their publication should lose.</p> <p>If a newspaper does not join a recognised regulator, and does not offer low cost binding arbitration, and press victims (or those who claim to be) are forced to sue in the courts, then they are given costs protection.</p>",
  "<p>Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan held a clear-the-air summit in St Petersburg on Tuesday, the first time the pair have met since they fell out over the Russian fighter jet downed by the Turkish air force last November. After more than three hours of talks, the two leaders promised to return their economic relations to \u201cpre-crisis\u201d levels and attempt to put the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/putin-and-erdogan-to-have-first-meeting-since-jet-downing\">bad blood</a> of the past nine months behind them.</p> <p>The visit was also Erdo\u011fan\u2019s first trip abroad since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-coup-attempt-president-declares-his-government-remains-in-charge\">failed coup</a> attempt in Turkey last month, and in his opening remarks he thanked Putin for his support. \u201cYour call straight after the coup was very pleasing for me and our leadership and our people,\u201d said the Turkish president, who referred to Putin as \u201cmy dear friend\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is our principled position,\u201d Putin said, in regard to the coup attempt. \u201cWe are always categorically opposed to any attempts at anti-constitutional activity. I want to express the hope that under your leadership the Turkish people will deal with this, and justice and legality will prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Western leaders have criticised Turkey for the crackdown in the aftermath of the coup, and for suggestions by Erdo\u011fan that the death penalty could be reintroduced. Erdo\u011fan has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/the-west-is-supporting-terrorism-against-turkey-claims-erdogan\">strongly critical</a> of the EU and US response to the coup attempt, and there is a sense that Putin may have seen an opportunity to provide a supportive shoulder for the Turkish leader, despite the rancour of the past months.</p> <p>In November, Turkey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/turkey-shoots-down-jet-near-border-with-syria\">shot down</a> a Russian Su-24 fighter jet, after what it said were multiple warnings to leave Turkish airspace. Russia insisted the plane remained inside Syrian airspace, where it was flying missions in support of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. One of the pilots died, as well as a marine who was part of a rescue mission. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/24/russian-fighter-jet-shot-down-near-turkey-syria-border-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ef95\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2412509\"            data-video-name=\"Russian fighter jet shot down near Turkey-Syria border \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Anadolu Agency\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56542d23e4b0877f6541edc9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/24/151124TurkeySyria2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/24/russian-fighter-jet-shot-down-near-turkey-syria-border-video\">Russian fighter jet shot down near Turkey-Syria border</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the aftermath of the incident, Russia imposed economic sanctions on Turkey, a number of Turks were deported, and charter flights between the two countries stopped. Millions of Russians had been used to going on holiday to Turkey, and the frost in relations came as a huge blow to the country\u2019s tourist industry. <br></p> <p>Russia\u2019s minister for economic development, Alexey Ulyukayev, said bilateral trade could reach the same levels as before the sanctions \u201cwithin a year\u201d. Putin also promised the gradual easing of sanctions, the resumption of charter flights, and possibly the lifting of visas, imposed for Turkish citizens after the incident.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan and Putin, both strong leaders who have portrayed their rule as a time of national renaissance, previously had a very good personal relationship. While it is unlikely they will immediately return to business as usual, both appeared keen to put the plane incident behind them, after Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/kremlin-says-erdogan-apologises-russian-jet-turkish\">wrote a letter</a> to the Russian president in June in which he expressed regret for the incident.<br></p> <p>The plane was mentioned on Tuesday but kept in the background. Erdo\u011fan spoke of the \u201cwell-known incident last year\u201d, while Putin referred to \u201cthe tragic incident involving the death of our servicemen\u201d during his opening remarks, a far cry from his words in the immediate aftermath, when he called the downing \u201ca stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists\u201d.</p> <p>An aide to Erdo\u011fan told Turkey\u2019s H\u00fcrriyet newspaper that the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, and a Turkish businessman with major interests in Russia had played go-between roles to smooth over the bad feelings after the plane incident.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis visit seems to me a new milestone in bilateral relations, beginning with a clean slate, and I personally, with all my heart and on behalf of the Turkish nation salute Mr Putin and all Russians,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said in an interview with Russian state media on the eve of his visit.</p> <p>The rapprochement between Erdo\u011fan and Putin has jangled nerves in Brussels. MEPs recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/turkeys-long-road-to-eu-membership-just-got-longer\">warned about the Putinisation of Turkey</a>, amid concern over the sweeping crackdown on suspected coup plotters in the civil service and judiciary.<br></p> <p>But Turkey\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Selim Yenel, said he was \u201csurprised by the worry I see in many western countries\u201d over the St Petersburg visit. \u201cTurn back the clock one year, we had even stronger relations with Russia at that time,\u201d he told the Guardian. It was unrealistic to think Turkey would turn against western countries or Nato, he said.<br></p> <p>Erdo\u011fan has vowed Turkey will reject a key EU demand of rewriting its terrorism laws in return for visa-free travel to Europe \u2013 leaving the migration pact between the EU and Turkey hanging by a thread. Despite this warning, senior EU and Turkish officials have continued to search for agreement on visa-free travel, and the ambassador voiced optimism that pact would hold.<br></p>",
  "<p>So you\u2019ve moved to HQ. Congrats! You\u2019ve given up on the field and adventure to take a higher position in an office in the normal world.</p> <p>Sure, you had your reasons. Perhaps you were missing flush toilets and vegetables; maybe you were drawn by the allure of cheese and wine. Most likely it was the higher paycheck. Will others judge you? Absolutely, but they\u2019re probably just jealous of your all-access pass to regular people and winter sports. </p> <p>Along with all the other things you are planning to do (hello balcony garden!), you might be thinking of entering the scary world of dating.<br></p> <p>Going from a choice between ten people and thousands can be intimidating. There is also the fact that potential lovers might now expect you to be more committed. Exciting? Utterly terrifying? Gut wrenching? All the above?</p> <p>There are three basic types of people you are going to encounter in HQ: humanitarians, civilians and financiers. Let\u2019s break them down. </p> <h2>Humanitarians</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/02/secret-aid-worker-a-damaged-handsome-bundle-of-trouble-its-easy-to-fall-for-a-flaky-aid-boy\">Secret aid worker: flaky aid boys and other development love-life disasters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ahhhh, humanitarians, or possibly development people. Either way they will be able to relate to you at least somewhat. Shared stories of conflicts and donors will help you to form a strong bond with these men and women. They understand why you\u2019re scared of fireworks and why you are always looking for the exit in a room in case a riot breaks out. </p> <p>Caution is needed though, as flaky aid boys/girls are just as flaky at HQ as they were in the field. Often running off for field trips or even to experience a better party, they sometimes appear desperate to absorb the things that drove them to HQ in the first place. You may always feel like these humanitarians are looking over their shoulder \u2013 literally or figuratively. </p> <p>However, many of them have never really done fieldwork. They believe taking trips to the field (never exceeding a few days) count. They can get really testy if you point out it doesn\u2019t. </p> <p><strong>Overall</strong><strong>:</strong> Proceed with caution. You left the field for a reason, dating another humanitarian might be regression.</p> <h2>Civilians</h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They will listen with rapt attention to even the most mundane story from the field. Goats are often big hits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Civilians, normal people as some call them, or those who are not humanitarians. </p> <p>Civilians do not feel the need to rush off into danger, and are not well-versed in the latest attacks in Bangladesh or Juba. Their first instinct is not to check whether friends or loved ones are alive when a plane has crashed because their life is at HQ. They are stable and adoring. Be very, very careful as they will fall in love with you. <br></p> <p>On the one hand, while they may not understand your particular brand of madness, they will listen with rapt attention to even the most mundane story from the field. Goats or other unusual pets are often big hits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/27/secret-aid-worker-is-there-life-beyond-the-field\">Secret aid worker: Is there life beyond the field?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You\u2019ll have to ease them into the story about that near kidnapping or the time you were almost bombed, but, if properly conditioned, they should not freak out and run screaming. No guarantees of course. Try testing a few people on Tinder first, find out who reacts to the mention of how a really bad bout of giardia is acting up again or the name you gave your tapeworm. </p> <p><strong>Overall: </strong>Over time you\u2019ll find yourself having more in common with civilians, after you finally develop some of those hobbies you\u2019ve been meaning to pick up. </p> <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Civilians are less likely to be running around the world, so they could provide a stable base for eventually transitioning into consultancies and short-term contracts. </p> <h2>Financiers</h2> <p>Yes, financiers are civilians but they are an entirely different breed. They come with big warning labels. </p> <p>Whether HQ for you means Geneva, London or New York, you will inevitably encounter this variation. Well-dressed with an expensive haircut, they may make you feel a tad self-conscious of the fact that you\u2019re still sporting a hairdo supplied by that woman in a local hut. Not to mention the fact that much of your clothes are off-label or knock-offs. </p> <p>Do not worry though, for at least a short period of time your eccentricities will entice financiers. You are different from the others \u2013 more independent, less impressed by their flashy money and antics. You\u2019ll challenge them and, perhaps, they\u2019ll challenge you back. This could make for a fun battle. At the very least the bedroom stuff should be good. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/02/secret-aid-worker-projectitis-dfid-civil-society\">Secret aid worker: the UK NGO sector is facing a funding crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Overall: </strong>It may not end up being a love connection, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to get a nice vacation out of them before it ends. An expensive island destination is recommended. </p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>You\u2019re almost prepared to enter into the world of HQ dating. Yay! But one final note before you go on any dates with strangers \u2013 always remember the buddy system and check in with friends. Stay safe. You\u2019re no longer dating one of the five expats in the village. Anonymity is both a blessing and a concern. <br></p> <p><em>Do you have a secret aid worker story you\u2019d like to tell?

  "<h2>Doping controversy hits the pool in Rio</h2> <p>The question of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/lilly-king-ryan-murphy-swimming-gold-rio-2016\">sports doping</a> was pushed to the forefront of the women\u2019s 100m breaststroke final at the Rio Olympics on Monday night, when US swimmer Lilly King won gold and then called into question her team-mate Justin Gatlin\u2019s place at the Games. \u201cDo I think someone who has been caught for doping should be on the team? No, I don\u2019t,\u201d King said after the race. King beat her Russian rival, Yulia Efimova, who served a 16-month suspension for a pair of positive drug tests before being controversially reinstated, and said her win over the Russian was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/efimova-and-sun-on-podium-as-king-delivers-victory-for-clean-sport\">victory for clean sport</a>\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full?utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=GU+Today+main+NEW+H+categories&amp;utm_term=185218&amp;subid=18388944&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2_footer\">Here</a> is the medal table so far (USA has the early edge over China) and Team USA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/rio-viewing-guide-olympics-day-four-team-usa\">day four highlights</a>, while here DJ Gallo wonders if America will ever win a medal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/09/usa-olympic-badminton-medal\">table tennis, trampoline, handball, rhythmic gymnastics or badminton</a>.

Trump said his economic plan would reduce income tax brackets from seven levels to three \u2013 of 12%, 25% and 33% \u2013 and entirely eliminate income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. \u201cWe will make America grow again,\u201d Trump said.

  "<p>The first images of what appear to be British special forces operating on the ground in Syria have emerged, showing vehicles patrolling near the scene of an attack by Islamic State.</p> <p>The pictures were taken in June and were first <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37015915\">published by the BBC</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/battles-rage-across-aleppo-as-assad-regime-syria-fights-to-quash-rebels\">Battles rage across Aleppo as Assad regime fights to quell rebels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is believed to be the first time British forces have been photographed operating inside Syria, where they are engaged in relatively small numbers in wide-ranging roles that include surveillance, advisory and combat.</p> <p>The images depict British special forces sitting on Thalab long-range patrol vehicles as they move around the perimeter of a rebel base close to the Syria-Iraq border.</p> <p>The Thalab (Fox) vehicles are essentially modified, militarised and upgraded Toyota 4x4s used for long distance reconnaissance and surveillance missions, which were developed jointly in the middle of the last decade by a state-backed defence company in Jordan and the UK company Jankel.</p> <p>The vehicle, which has mounted weaponry and is often used for border patrols, has been primarily used by Jordanian special forces. </p> <p>Al-Tanf, where the vehicles were reportedly photographed, is a border crossing between Syria and Iraq that had been under Isis control, and is also not far from the Jordanian border. It is unclear how many Nato countries have deployed the modified trucks, though Belgium ordered a shipment of modified Fox vehicles earlier this year.</p> <p>The images seem to show British forces securing the perimeter of the rebel base following an attack by Isis, according to the BBC. The soldiers can be seen carrying anti-tank missiles, sniper rifles and other heavy artillery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sommervillebbc/status/762750689529520128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH Exclusive - Britain&#39;s secretive and lethal force in Syria <a href=\"https://t.co/WwxbBi6bAT\">https://t.co/WwxbBi6bAT</a></p>&mdash; Quentin Sommerville (@sommervillebbc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sommervillebbc/status/762750689529520128\">August 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The BBC reported the soldiers were working at the base in a defensive role and a spokesman for the New Syrian Army acknowledged that British special forces had provided training, weapons and other equipment.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence, as is standard with special forces, declined to comment on the photographs. But an independent source confirmed they were UK special forces, which are operating against Isis in Syria, Iraq and Libya.</p> <p>They prefer to operate in secrecy, at least until sufficient time has passed for the publication of memoirs. But, with cameras commonplace and the forces they operate alongside not feeling bound to respect that secrecy, it is becoming increasingly more difficult. </p> <p>The UK has about 300 conventional forces operating in Iraq mainly in and around Baghdad, restricted to training and advisory roles, operating from behind the relative safety of secure bases. Britain has also promised to provide between 800-1,200 troops to an Italian-led international force to support the Libyan government, though there is little sign of these being deployed.</p> <p>The special forces have a free-ranging role, operating in the border areas between the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and the towns and villages linking it to its northern Iraqi bastion, Mosul. The US special forces established a base in the Syrian desert between Raqqa and the Iraqi border aimed both at achieving this and in support of Syrian rebel forces trying to squeeze Raqqa.</p> <p>The UK parliament approved an air campaign against Isis in Syria but not ground troops. Special forces, though, have always been treated differently. The government mantra is that special forces can be deployed wherever there is judged to be a threat to the UK.</p> <p>The convention is that special forces are never mentioned on the floor of the British parliament but they are subject to oversight through the parliamentary intelligence committee.</p> <p>Defence ministers argue that it is illogical to expect special forces engaged against Isis to stop at the Iraqi border, given that the terror group does not recognise any border between Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>The New Syrian Army was established with American backing in 2015 as a moderate rebel force to primarily fight against Isis in Deir ez-Zor province, which is almost entirely under the control of the militants.</p> <p>The American training programmes for rebel forces have been widely seen as failures, primarily because few rebel fighters are willing to exclusively fight Isis while ignoring the regime of Bashar al-Assad. </p> <p>The US has had more success when it closely coordinated with fighters on the ground and backed them up with airstrikes, the modus operandi it has adopted with the mostly Kurdish fighters in northern Syria known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, who are on the verge of taking back the city of Manbij in northern Aleppo from Islamic State, and have conquered vast tracts of land over the past few months. The US also has special forces troops operating on the ground with the Kurds.</p> <p>The New Syrian Army has had a halting and uninspiring track record. Their most significant operation occurred in June this year, when the group launched an attack on Al-Bukamal, a town on the Iraqi border that has long been a crossing point for foreign jihadis during the American occupation, and which is now held by Isis. The attack failed, apparently due to the lack of sufficient air power backing by its western allies. </p> <p>One report in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/07/06/u-s-jets-abandoned-syrian-rebels-in-the-desert-then-they-lost-a-battle-to-isis/\">Washington Post</a> suggested American warplanes that were supposed to assist in the battle had to be diverted to Falluja, where they bombed a convoy of Isis vehicles fleeing the city.</p>",

What is so chilling is that what you did was calculated and deliberate. You did not know the deceased but you decided that you had a duty to kill him.\u201d</p> <p>It quickly emerged that Ahmed had singled Shah out because the shopkeeper, a father of three, was openly proselytising on social media and describing himself as a prophet.</p> <p>The belief that Muhammad is the final prophet is a central tenet of mainstream Islam; to believe otherwise is regarded as blasphemous. Sunni leaders in Pakistan and the UK, including several followed by Ahmed, have openly condemned Ahmadis for holding that other prophets have emerged since Muhammad.</p> <p>Ahmed had first called Shah by phone to challenge him, and then decided to travel to Glasgow to confront him. Ahmed had watched a video of Shah on his mobile phone en route, and was heard in a phone message stating: \u201cListen to this guy, something needs to be done, it needs nipped in the bud.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a41eca55b44b78c082a6ef68a98351a2b2d5e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a41eca55b44b78c082a6ef68a98351a2b2d5e8a/123_1_503_302/500.jpg\" alt=\"Asad Shah, the shopkeeper murdered in Glasgow\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asad Shah, the shopkeeper murdered in Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Social Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arriving at the shop on 24 March, he ordered Shah to stop describing himself as a prophet, warned he would kill him and began plunging a knife into Shah. As Shah\u2019s brother and a shop assistant struggled to prevent the attack, Ahmed dragged Shah outside onto the pavement, stabbing, punching and stamping on him, shattering bones in his face.</p> <p>In a statement released through his lawyer after a court appearance in early April, Ahmed had admitted the murder, claiming: \u201cThis all happened for one reason and no other issues and no other intentions. Asad Shah disrespected the messenger of Islam the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Mr Shah claimed to be a prophet.\u201d</p> <p>The Scottish government is to review the law covering religiously aggravated crimes in the wake of the case. <br></p> <p>The Crown Office decided the circumstances of the killing did not meet the \u201cstatutory test for an offence to be aggravated by religious prejudice\u201d but Scotland\u2019s chief law officer, James Wolffe QC, the lord advocate, has now written to the justice secretary as he believes the case highlighted a \u201cpotential gap\u201d in legislation. If charged with an offence aggravated by religious prejudice, Ahmed could have faced a longer minimum sentence. </p> <p>Shah\u2019s death led to an outpouring of grief among his customers and neighbours, and exposed significant levels of animosity and discrimination faced by the UK\u2019s Ahmadi minority from other Muslims, particularly Pakistani Sunnis. Supporters of the Shah family accuse Sunni Muslim leaders from Glasgow Central Mosque of failing to condemn the ideology behind Ahmed\u2019s stance, despite condemning the murder, and of being reluctant to support multi-faith vigils.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/09/shunned-for-saying-theyre-muslims-life-for-ahmadis-after-asad-shahs\">Shunned for saying they're Muslims: life for Ahmadis after Asad Shah's murder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Shahs are also said to be upset about what they perceive as the local Ahmadi leadership\u2019s use of the murder to highlight the broader conflicts with orthodox Muslim thinking. One source said they felt his death had been turned into a \u201cpolitical football\u201d.</p> <p>There is due to be an Ahmadi community press conference later on Tuesday in Glasgow but family sources say the Shahs were never consulted about the community leadership\u2019s statements.</p> <p>In a statement issued on behalf of Shah\u2019s family, their lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said many family members had either left or were preparing to leave Scotland, as a result of his murder and its impact on them. They had originally moved to Glasgow in 1990 to escape state-sanctioned religious persecution in Pakistan.</p> <p>\u201cAsad\u2019s family have lost a peaceful, kind and loving brother, son and uncle who can never be replaced. Most of his family have now left or are in the process of leaving Scotland, a country they came to seek safety in,\u201d Anwar said.</p> <p>\u201cThey are grateful to the lord advocate, Crown Office and Police Scotland for their hard work and compassion. For those who choose to speak on behalf of Asad, his family say they have no permission to do so and request their privacy is respected.\u201d</p> <p>An Ahmadi spokesman insisted they had not sought to speak for the family, but for the community in general. Describing his death as a \u201csacrifice\u201d, they said it was very disturbing that Shah had become the first Ahmadi killed in the UK because hatred of their beliefs had seeped over from Pakistan.</p> <p>Rafiq Hayat, the national president of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association UK, said the community had found security and peace in British cities such as Glasgow, which upheld their right to follow their beliefs.</p> <p>\u201cIn Glasgow, as in many parts of the world, we have witnessed the evil of a warped and poisonous ideology of hate, that is at war with the whole of humanity,\u201d Hayat said. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with Mr Shah and his family who have suffered immensely as a result of this brutal killing. No one should suffer or be murdered, least of all for their faith.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s chief law officer, James Wolffe QC, the lord advocate, said: \u201cAsad Shah was a well liked and respected member of the community who was savagely murdered by a total stranger,\u201d Wolffe added. \u201cThis was a brutal, unprovoked and relentless attack on an unsuspecting victim. It has left his family and friends devastated at the loss of a kind and peace-loving man.\u201d</p>",

I\u2019ve not really been in control of events in the last few weeks, and if I can\u2019t control events, I can\u2019t worry about them.\u201d</p> <p>He certainly did not predict them. Watson had no idea that Labour\u2019s leader would call for article 50 to be triggered at once, within hours of the referendum result. \u201cBut if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019d not focused a lot on the plan B in the planning meetings that I\u2019d had with him.\u201d</p> <p>Failing to anticipate the impact Corbyn\u2019s words would have on Labour MPs \u2013 \u201cAt that point I was so exhausted, I didn\u2019t take it in on the Friday\u201d \u2013 he made his way to Glastonbury.</p> <p>Watson was offline <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-enforcer-tom-watson-filmed-8284779\">in a silent disco</a> when Corbyn sacked Hilary Benn late that Saturday night, and remained blissfully unaware of the unfolding crisis until he awoke the next morning to a \u201cwhole load of missed calls and texts\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1/0_102_625_870/359.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at Glastonbury.\" width=\"359\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson at Glastonbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Watson/Snapchat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Laura_K_Hughes/status/746992729100541952?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">spent the day on the phone</a>, hurrying back to London, \u201ctrying to find out what was happening\u201d. Remarkably, he didn\u2019t speak to Corbyn. Did he even try? \u201cI can\u2019t remember, actually,\u201d he offers vaguely. I\u2019m not sure which would be more bizarre: Corbyn refusing to take his deputy\u2019s call, or Watson not even bothering to phone. When they met the next day, \u201cAs ever with Jeremy, it was business-like and friendly.\u201d Watson told him the resignations could have been prevented, had Corbyn only reached out to his shadow team and addressed their concerns. Corbyn disagreed, convinced it was a premeditated coup. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem angry. Just puzzled and sorrowful.\u201d</p> <p>When Watson heard that a no-confidence motion had been tabled, \u201cI didn\u2019t pay it much heed. I thought it wouldn\u2019t have legs.\u201d He won\u2019t say which way he voted, but the result came as a shock. Even then, it didn\u2019t occur to him that Corbyn would defy the PLP\u2019s indictment. \u201cI thought he would realise that to lose the confidence of 80% of your MPs means that you can\u2019t lead the Labour party.\u201d Watson tried to say so in private two days later, but was thwarted when two Corbyn aides made an unscheduled appearance in their car.</p> <p>\u201cI was told we would have the journey on our own, and they came. I did suggest that they didn\u2019t, and they said we\u2019re coming in the car. So it became very difficult to have the conversation.\u201d Was he angry? Watson looks conflicted. \u201cYou know, at any point in time I want to put my arms around him and hug him and say it\u2019s going to be all right, but also sort of shout and say, we need to talk about this. So I was actually feeling great sorrow for him.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until six days after the no-confidence vote that Watson met Corbyn privately. \u201cIt was very sad, really. But it was also, as ever, polite. I said, I don\u2019t think you can lead the Labour party if you\u2019ve lost 80% of your MPs, and he said, well, look, you\u2019ve said what you have to say, and thank you for saying it. I think he actually said, thank you for saying it in such a polite way. It was still friendly. I did my duty. I did what I could. What else can you do?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7dfe82e112bfe7bf46362122585fdb7ed0c8c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7dfe82e112bfe7bf46362122585fdb7ed0c8c9/0_138_4864_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson and Corbyn visit a Sikh temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson and Corbyn visit a Sikh temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He answers his own question minutes later, after protestations of reluctance that may or not be genuine. His plans \u201care at a nascent stage\u201d, he says several times, \u201cand I probably shouldn\u2019t even begin to talk to Decca Aitkenhead of the Guardian about them\u201d. But he does.</p> <p>Watson wants to reverse Ed Miliband\u2019s \u201cterrible error of judgment\u201d and reinstate the old electoral college system, which accorded one-third of the votes in a leadership election to the PLP and a third each to the unions and the members. He is also drawing up proposals for an agreement \u201cto have women holding some of the key offices of state. My personal view is if you don\u2019t give a proper gender representation on the frontbench you\u2019re in trouble, and either Owen or Jeremy will have to make sure that those big offices have women in them.\u201d</p> <p>Most significantly, Watson wants to reintroduce elections to the shadow cabinet. Is he sure that MPs who resigned, or refused to serve under Corbyn, would reconsider if elected by the PLP? \u201cI have no idea. But I think if Owen wins it\u2019s still important to do it, because a new leader has got to reshape and rebuild the PLP, and that means giving respect and dignity back to a lot of colleagues.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c968a6d4f88582edd2e30b5f3785c2061a71c3db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c968a6d4f88582edd2e30b5f3785c2061a71c3db/0_290_5672_3404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at the Labour party conference in Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson at the Labour party conference in Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How much time he will have to effect any of this is uncertain, if Watson is right about his next point. \u201cI think it\u2019s highly likely there\u2019ll be an early election. I mean, if you\u2019re Theresa May, with a majority of 12, with your Brexit fanatics already saying you\u2019re not going quickly enough to get us out of the European Union, with having sacked too many people from the frontbench who are just looking for the opportunity for her to stumble, and with a double-digit lead in the polls, then even though on day one you might not think you\u2019re going to have an early election, I think it\u2019s almost inevitable you\u2019ll get to a point where you have to. If you were Theresa May, why wouldn\u2019t you? Honestly, why wouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019d get your own mandate, you\u2019d have the easiest run at the election you could imagine, and in all likelihood you\u2019d come back with a bigger majority. Why wouldn\u2019t you do that?\u201d</p> <p>Could whoever wins the leadership election survive a defeat in a general election? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s highly unlikely, isn\u2019t it? Most leaders resign after losing an election.\u201d Most leaders, I point out, resign after losing the confidence of 80% of MPs. \u201cWell, yes. So it\u2019s still possible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Watson is conspicuously reluctant to apportion blame for the crisis facing Labour, but when pressed, he acknowledges, \u201cThere are Trots that have come back to the party, and they certainly don\u2019t have the best interests of the Labour party at heart. They see the Labour party as a vehicle for revolutionary socialism, and they\u2019re not remotely interested in winning elections, and that\u2019s a problem. But I don\u2019t think the vast majority of people that have joined the Labour party and have been mobilised by the people that are in Momentum are all Trots and Bolsheviks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0f73a2a0fc07a6ab0e9841cbf6061cffb0e9505\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f73a2a0fc07a6ab0e9841cbf6061cffb0e9505/0_25_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson gives the closing speech at the autumn conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson gives the closing speech at the autumn conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSome months ago, I described Momentum as \u2018a bit of a rabble\u2019, and although leading lights in Momentum privately acknowledged to me that they were a bit of a rabble, it caused great offence to everyone that had signed up to Momentum. Some of these people are deeply interested in political change, in building a more equal society, and are just on a journey in politics that they\u2019re new to, and I don\u2019t want them to feel that I\u2019m labelling them because I\u2019m not. But there are some old hands twisting young arms in this process, and I\u2019m under no illusions about what\u2019s going on. They are caucusing and factionalising and putting pressure where they can, and that\u2019s how Trotsky entryists operate. Sooner or later, that always end up in disaster.

Every single person I talk to on the left and right of the party thinks this is a bad idea. I\u2019ve not had anyone muse with me about it. I\u2019ve not had anyone gossip with me about it. I\u2019ve not heard anyone raising it as an issue.\u201d</p> <p>Watson remains in contact with Corbyn, though it sounds rather semi-detached. \u201cWe still send the odd text to each other.

  "<p>It is generally unwise to judge a footballer on the basis of a major international tournament, but Paul Pogba\u2019s underwhelming Euro 2016 raised questions about his tactical flexibility rather than his level of talent.

Pogba\u2019s best performances with Juventus came in that system, particularly in the midfield that featured Andrea Pirlo dictating play, giving Arturo Vidal and Pogba licence to bomb forward.</p> <p>It was an unusual midfield trio, with the playmaker in the deepest role, and the other two players given more ball-winning responsibility. But it suited Pogba perfectly: he could showcase his energy and tenacity when attempting to regain possession, plus his drive, trickery and long-range shooting ability when going forward. Broadly speaking, he is an all-rounder, a box-to-box midfielder who is outstanding technically and physically.</p> <p>Deschamps, however, switched to a 4-2-3-1 system midway through the tournament to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/02/france-antoine-griezmann-euro-2016\">accommodate Antoine Griezmann</a> in his favoured central position, forcing Pogba into a deeper role alongside Blaise Matuidi. That compromised his style considerably: neither he nor Matuidi is a natural defensive midfielder, with both defined more by their attacking power than their positional discipline. In that role Pogba looked highly uncomfortable, his limitations in possession exposed. He was unable to play penetrative passes from deep positions; with Juventus he had never had this responsibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907872361c71f24fe9354042d540ddfe04c3d20e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907872361c71f24fe9354042d540ddfe04c3d20e/27_0_707_424/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lineup\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How United could line up with Paul Pogba in the team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those performances may concern Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who had appeared set to use a 4-2-3-1 formation with Manchester United this season.

It would also suit Manchester United\u2019s first-choice holding midfielder Michael Carrick, now 35, who could play a slightly deeper role.</p> <p>Ander Herrera is another midfielder clearly suited to the shuttling role in 4-3-3, and the same is probably true of Marouane Fellaini and Morgan Schneiderlin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41b9ce3da6840a03ef6cc9911dabd6db6ed578cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41b9ce3da6840a03ef6cc9911dabd6db6ed578cd/0_107_3500_2235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Pirlo, Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of Paul Pogba\u2019s best performances for Juventus came in the midfield with Andrea Pirlo, left, and Arturo Vidal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Gentile/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In attack, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has spent the last few years in a 4-3-3 for Paris Saint-Germain, and Anthony Martial and Memphis Depay are wide forwards rather than wide midfielders, likely to appreciate playing 15 yards higher up the pitch.

Some people are seeing me as a strange woman because I want to join politics. They say politics is dirty, but so is society.

Choosing to end the fast on the same day has been interpreted by some as a sign of her disillusionment with India\u2019s democratic process.</p> <p>Sharmila started the hunger strike in November 2000 after the Malom massacre in a small village on the outskirts of Imphal, in which 10 people were reportedly killed by a government-controlled paramilitary force, the Assam Rifles.</p> <p>It is thought that the decision to end her strike now was influenced by a British-Indian boyfriend, Desmond Coutinho. Sharmila has been released from custody sporadically over the last decade and a half, but only a handful of people have been allowed to visit her in recent months. </p> <p>Her family members and closest aides were not aware of her decision to break the fast before she announced it. </p> <p>Television news crews, journalists and human rights activists have gathered en masse in the small town of Imphal to witness the end of the fast. </p> <p>\u201cI have got at least 60-70 calls from journalists today,\u201d said Irom Singhjit Singh, her brother. </p> <p>\u201cAll the news stations have been here. I\u2019ve told them all the same thing, I don\u2019t want to say anything until I talk to Sharmila first. I am a farmer, not a human rights activist.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother, 84, who has not seen her daughter since she started her strike said: \u201cI give her my blessing.\u201d </p> <p>Sharmila vowed not to set foot in her own home until the special powers act was lifted, and her mother too has said she won\u2019t see her daughter until her mission is achieved. She did not attend court on Tuesday. </p> <p>Sharmila\u2019s announcement that she will enter politics has already garnered interest from opposition parties in Imphal. Her fast has made her synonymous with the resistance movement in Manipur, and she could control huge swaths of votes throughout Manipur.</p> <p>Babloo Loitongbam, director of the campaign group Human Rights Alert, and former colleague of Sharmila\u2019s, said Aam Aadmi party and the Bhartiya Janata party had shown interest in her joining them. </p> <p>Meanwhile, one radical party, the Alliance for Social Unity, sent a note to local media urging Sharmila to continue her fast and marry a local man rather than Coutinho, whose Indian origin represents a threat to separatists. The note reminded her that \u201csome former revolutionary leaders were assassinated\u201d after leaving activism for politics. </p> <p>The village of Tulihal, from where five men died in the Malom massacre, is divided over her decision. </p> <p>Tokpam Somorendra, who lost his son Shantikumar, said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say her decision is wrong. I respect her next to God. She has sacrificed so much in the last 16 years and for that I cannot fault her. She has not fought for herself, or for some one she knows, but for all of us. She has fought our struggle. </p> <p>\u201cBut why has she suddenly changed her mind so quickly, without giving us any information? She has so many supporters but she didn\u2019t give us the chance to see her break the fast.\u201d</p> <p>In a nearby home, the family of Chandramani Sinan, the first victim of the massacre, were more supportive of her political ambitions. </p> <p>\u201cShe has not eaten for 16 years and yet she can\u2019t achieve her dream,\u201d said Sinan Chandrajni Devi, his mother. \u201cThis is her own strategy, and we must support her. If she runs for election, absolutely we will vote for her,\u201d she said.</p>",

I agree that the health of the media is at risk. Much of what I value was encapsulated by Malcolm X when he said that what African Americans needed was not training but education, and that the former was equivalent of teaching a dog a circus trick, while the latter taught people how to think.</p> <p>Thinking requires time. It is not consistent with a five-second attention span. If we have no ability to comprehend that truth ought to have priority over lies, then we are in deep trouble.</p> <p>If we fail to understand the difference between learning how to think for ourselves and obeying orders, between reading a considered piece of journalism and relying on the latest Facebook offering, will we be able to discern the difference between fact and fantasy?</p> <p>We do need expert and honest witnesses who speak truth to power without fear or favour. We also need thinking citizenry, not well-trained circus dogs. We need time to think. We need these things to be able to protect our democracies. We need them to be fully human.</p> <p>If we value democracy and the rights of citizens to have opinions and individual rights, and if we value the difference between fact and fiction, we must support our media so that it can continue to speak truth to power on our behalf, and do its best to keep us informed.<br><strong>Lavinia Moore</strong><br>Aldgate, South Australia</p> <h2><strong>Exploitation is the culprit</strong><br></h2> <p>No it is not globalisation that causes \u201cless affluent, less educated, mainly white people\u201d to feel themselves marginalised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-show-trial-republican-convention-built-on-anger\" title=\"\">(29 July)</a>. Poor whites feel marginalised because they are poor and marginalised, not by globalisation but by the exploitative economy that drives it at whatever human cost.</p> <p>The beggar-your-neighbour system that its friends and foes call capitalism enables those with wealth to buy up whatever human and other resources they can turn to profit, and drop them when they can\u2019t. Dead simple: buy cheap, sell dear, keep the difference and do the same again.</p> <p>Capitalism may be globalised but it\u2019s a very British disease. Fourteenth-century peasants revolted against serfdom, only to find themselves marginalised by sheep and enclosures. Luddites smashed the machines that made their manual skills redundant.

Use of the term project suggests a reasonable and achievable objective. The idea that a series of landmasses the size of New Zealand can be cleared of widespread populations of highly resilient species should be consigned to the realms of fantasy and myth. We New Zealanders indeed have a penchant for hobbits, trolls, <em>taniwha </em>(Maori mystical beings) and other such fantasies.</p> <p>However, the reality that a meaningful eradication attempt would take no less than martial law to override landowners\u2019 rights and poison every inch of the countryside, including sensitive areas such as organic farms and school grounds, despite huge safety concerns and organised opposition, puts the Pest Free NZ initiative firmly in the realms of fairytale.</p> <p>Considering the fact that the ecocidal poisons employed may kill some of the very species that they are being used to protect, we soon leave the realms of fantasy and have commenced a journey into horror. <br><strong>Tobi Muir</strong><br>Auckland, New Zealand</p> <p>\u2022 Will the New Zealand government\u2019s plans \u201cto exterminate all introduced predators\u201d include killing all the trout in its lakes and rivers?

Here it\u2019s more of a meritocracy.\u201d<br></p> <p>The cost of living can also be relatively low in European cities. \u201cI work part time on top of studying, and that gives me enough to get by,\u201d says Griffith. \u201cBack home you have to work a lot more. But here the work-life balance is tipped more towards life.\u201d<br></p> <h2>It\u2019s hard work and takes a long time</h2> <p>You might not have to pay huge fees, but you do have to work hard. Many master\u2019s degrees in Europe, though not all, are two years long. </p> <p>And if you think this will give you more time to socialise, be warned. \u201cThe reason it takes so long is that you have so much more work to do,\u201d says Griffith. \u201cThe papers are much longer.\u201d</p> <p>Jessica Abrahams, 27, studying a masters in international relations at the Barcelona Institute of International Studies, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s been more demanding in terms of the quantity of essays, debates and coursework we have. Alongside working, there\u2019s a lot to juggle.\u201d<br></p> <p>In fact, many students take three or four years to complete their master\u2019s degree in Germany. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/02/will-international-love-help-your-language-skills-blossom\">Will international love help your language skills blossom?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow long it takes is up to you, but very few people I know have finished in two years,\u201d says Griffith. \u201cI\u2019m looking at three, and some people have been here for four, so if you\u2019re very career-minded and worried about time, this might not be the option for you,\u201d he says. <br></p> <h2>You can set your own pace</h2> <p>Students are expected to take charge of their own schedules, and may be surprised to find a lack of strict deadlines. \u201cThis was a shock to me at first,\u201d says Annie Rutherford, 26, who studied a masters in comparative literature at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. </p> <p>\u201cIn the UK, if I handed in an essay an hour late, I got marks taken off, whereas in Germany I found it really laid back. Friends of mine felt that we were babied a bit more in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Examination methods can also be more flexible. \u201cWe\u2019ve sometimes been given a choice between being tested with a long essay or an exam,\u201d says Abrahams. \u201cRelationships with lecturers have also been more informal. At the end of the taught course, we went for drinks with our lecturers to say goodbye and it was really nice to get to know them in that way.\u201d<br></p> <h2>You make global connections</h2> <p>One of the most rewarding things about studying abroad is meeting people from all over the world. \u201cI\u2019ve made loads of friends from all across Europe,\u201d says Samuel Phillips, 24, who is studying for a master\u2019s in German law at Munster University. \u201cWhen I was studying in England, I only hung around with English people, whereas here there are a lot of international students.\u201d </p> <p>Watch out for the international student trap though, warns Rutherford. \u201cYou can go down the route of being an international student, or you can be really integrated with the locals. Both can be a bit of a bubble.\u201d<br></p> <p>Wagaye Johannes, project director at the <a href=\"http://www.iie.org/\">Institute of International Education (IIE)</a>, studied a master\u2019s in international relations at the University of Amsterdam. She says she now has contacts and friends across the continent. </p> <p>\u201cMy classmates are all over Europe, so if something happens globally I\u2019ve got those connections. Having international experience brings the world closer to you. </p> <p>\u201cAnd studying abroad at master\u2019s level can be particularly beneficial, because it\u2019s a long degree and you\u2019re a bit older, so you\u2019ve already started carving out professional contacts.\u201d<br></p> <h2>The social life is different</h2> <p>\u201cOne of the things I liked about Germany was that it didn\u2019t have the same binge drinking culture,\u201d Rutherford admits. \u201cGerman students start drinking earlier in the day than British students, but they stick with beer. When I was studying in the UK, many students started with vodka.\u201d</p> <p>Rutherford, Abrahams, Johannes and Griffith all found that fewer activities were organised through the student union. However, when you\u2019re in an international city, it doesn\u2019t matter because there\u2019s plenty to do, they say. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of great places you can study in the UK, but Berlin\u2019s one of the most exciting cities in Europe,\u201d says Griffith. \u201cIt attracts lots of interesting young people and I can\u2019t think of a city in the UK like it.\u201d Abrahams says she loves the international feel, and the sunshine, in Barcelona.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/30/i-wasnt-prepared-for-the-culture-shock-of-being-an-international-student\">I wasn't prepared for the culture shock of being an international student</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Studying abroad helps you develop a global mindset, adds Johannes.</p> <h2>It can be challenging</h2> <p>Navigating a foreign city without knowing the language can be tricky at first. \u201cI had to post a parcel and, being in a foreign country, I didn\u2019t know whether to go to a post office or news agent,\u201d says Abrahams. \u201cIn the beginning I only had basic Spanish, so small things like that took a bit of time to figure out, when they wouldn\u2019t even cross your mind in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>However, living abroad forces you to learn quickly, and you soon pick up the vocabulary you need.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been taking classes at a language school, and it\u2019s great to have the opportunity to speak it every day, with flatmates, or in shops and restaurants,\u201d says Abrahams. \u201cYou have motivation to learn, and it sticks in your mind more easily. When you get to the point where you can have conversations in Spanish, it\u2019s so fulfilling and satisfying.\u201d<br></p> <h2>The return home is hard</h2> <p>\u201cMy first few months back in Edinburgh were pretty miserable,\u201d says Rutherford. \u201cI returned in January, and the weather was horrible. I just thought to myself, \u2018the buses don\u2019t work here, the alcohol\u2019s expensive and I don\u2019t know anyone\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But since she\u2019s settled back in, she has learned to appreciate the benefits of her time abroad all over again. \u201cMy new boss likes that I have international experience and I\u2019ve been able to work on international projects I wouldn\u2019t have been given the chance to do otherwise. My advice to other students is: just go for it.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Fear is all around us at the moment. Every time you read or listen to the news it\u2019s another story of terror, one way or another. And it\u2019s not limited to the bigger stories of bombing, shooting or Donald Trump; we are learning to fear the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/09/dustin-johnson-withdrawal-olympics-zika\">Golfers fear Zika in Rio</a>, so decline invitations to play at the Olympics \u2013 then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/florida-zika-virus-outbreak-miami-mosquitos\">the virus turns up closer to home</a>. Black Americans fear those whose job it is supposed to be to protect them, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/28/tamir-rice-shooting-no-charges-cleveland-officer-timothy-loehmann\">the police fear toys</a> and telephones. </p> <p>It can feel at times like we\u2019re living through the hopeless hell of <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/45407\">James Thomson\u2019s City of Dreadful Night</a>, where fear permeates everything, even its half-hearted denial in the line \u201cNo hope could have no fear\u201d, a kind of desperate whistling in the dark. Thomson\u2019s poem is a foreshadowing of <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/47311\">The Waste Land\u2019s</a> ominous swarms of London pedestrians and Eliot\u2019s offer to show the reader \u201cfear in a handful of dust\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting to contrast this urban fear of each other, of the crowd, with <a href=\"http://www.poetry-archive.com/f/storm_fear.html\">Robert Frost\u2019s Storm Fear</a>, where the object of his terror is the power of nature, and where the best bulwark against it is in not being alone. It is the smallness of the family when pitched against the elemental power of the storm that creates the fear in the poet\u2019s mind.</p> <p>Not that fear of other people is a uniquely urban phenomenon. In <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/42593\">Bears at Raspberry Time</a>, Hayden Carruth deflects from the expected fear of the bears in the woods to those who would kill them, so that the actual source of fear is human. Behind that again lies the poet\u2019s fear of both writing and not being able to write, a fear of expectation. <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/427960\">WD Snodgrass\u2019s A Locked House</a> starts from a very ordinary fear, that your house may have burned or been broken into in your absence. Of course, the fear is usually groundless, but the destruction of the home comes about not through some external agency but through the actions of those who live in it.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poems/beachcomber\">Beachcomber</a>, the great Scottish poet George Mackay Brown shows how fear of the disapproval of the community we live in can inhibit us and keep us from our true calling in life, at expense to both ourselves and the very community that inhibits us. Because we allow fear to limit us, we become less than we should be.</p> <p>This idea that the self is what you should really fear is explored by <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=34578\">Sharon Olds in The Fear of Oneself</a>, where the speaker realises that her partner\u2019s estimation of her inner strength is not matched by her self-awareness as someone who comes \u201cfrom a / long line / of women / who put themselves / first.\u201d Her fear is not of some particular thing, but that she might fail those who depend on her most, her children.</p> <p>This internal fear takes a different form in <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=28347\">Robert Creeley\u2019s For Fear</a>. Why, the poem asks, will we return to painful situations even when we know they will not change? And the answer is fear of change, of the unknown, of abandonment. <a href=\"http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/porter-dorothy/3-0320019\">In a poem called 3</a>, Dorothy Porter writes of how we willingly take the road of fear, with little or no regard to our own wellbeing or happiness. These poems take Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is \u2026 fear itself\u201d and turn it on its head somewhat; the only thing we have to fear, they say, is what lies within ourselves.</p> <p></p> <p>And so, this month\u2019s Poster poems challenge is to confront your fears in verse. These may be induced by external factors or they might be entirely internal. One way or another, you are invited to share your poems of fear here.</p>",
  "<p>The formula used to be simple enough, the number of stock tableaux perhaps two. Your club\u2019s new signing would be announced, once upon a time in the morning\u2019s newspaper and latterly via its website or Twitter account, and accompanied by some standard images. One would conveniently capture the fresh arrival \u2013 pen in hand, beaming manager to one side and oak panels providing the backdrop \u2013 in the throes of signing his name in ink. Then all parties would decamp downstairs to the pitch, a scarf would be held aloft and the virtues of an institution loved since childhood would be dutifully extolled.</p> <p>Those were simpler times; these days you never quite know how a big deal will drop and Paul Pogba\u2019s arrival at Manchester United underlined the point. Perhaps it would have been a letdown if such a long-running saga had finished conventionally; fortunately the rapper Stormzy was at hand on Monday night to confirm what we already knew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MourinhoMindset/status/762746621809524736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Stormzy confirms Pogba is now a Manchester United player <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MUFC?src=hash\">#MUFC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/C5WyA580Zr\">pic.twitter.com/C5WyA580Zr</a></p>&mdash; Jos\u00e9 (@MourinhoMindset) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MourinhoMindset/status/762746621809524736\">August 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A video \u2013 produced by Adidas, which was never going to be far from the scene \u2013 appeared on the musician\u2019s Facebook page showing Stormzy and Pogba dancing alongside each other, the former wearing a United shirt with \u201cPogba\u201d on its back. It was swiftly removed \u2013 generally a pointless move given the alacrity with which social media gaffes are captured for posterity \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">the transfer was confirmed via official channels hours later</a> and the video, which Adidas subsequently tweeted, now takes pride of place on the club\u2019s website.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Stormzy1/status/762796696426479616\">An exclusive for Stormzy, then?</a> Not quite \u2013 it turned out he had been scooped by Manchester United\u2019s laundry team in what at least constituted a nod, however inadvertent, to the sport\u2019s old earthiness. A tweet posted at teatime showed Pogba reunited with the ladies who used to clean his kit, with a background of washing machines rather than boardroom finery. At the time it confirmed nothing \u2013 being in town for a medical hardly precluded a visit to see old colleagues \u2013 but it suggested a deal was effectively done.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGrimes00/status/762696215842680832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Someone I know, there mum with Pogba a few hours ago \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\u26bd\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc40 DONE DEAL <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MUFC?src=hash\">#MUFC</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pogba?src=hash\">#Pogba</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MUFCfamily?src=hash\">#MUFCfamily</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SalfordReds?src=hash\">#SalfordReds</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/cByPE1V4jr\">pic.twitter.com/cByPE1V4jr</a></p>&mdash; Chris Grimes (@ChrisGrimes00) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGrimes00/status/762696215842680832\">August 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The deal\u2019s official announcement, at 12.20am on Tuesday, was accompanied by the hashtag \u201c#POGBACK\u201d and presumably timed to coincide with day breaking in the Asian markets in which United set great stock.</p> <p>As this proves, early leaks are not always harmful. This one, of course, will have birthed a rush of extra Twitter mentions and \u201cbuzz\u201d without detracting from any hysteria surrounding the formal reveal and things like this rarely escape the marketing heads. It is a curiosity, though, that United\u2019s two biggest-name transfers of this summer have been announced by other parties. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BIIjsNLAgpf/?taken-by=iamzlatanibrahimovic\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic confirmed his own move to Old Trafford on Instagram</a> and there is certainly a sense that the increasingly complicated demands of sponsors and social media hold more and more sway over both the timing and \u2013 ever more elaborate \u2013 choreography of unveilings.</p> <p>Would any of this have happened under Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s watch? The instinct is to say no, the natural urge to recall big-name arrivals such as that of Jaap Stam, when in a rather more traditional Manchester welcome the defender stood under an umbrella \u2013 held aloft by his new manager \u2013 by the side of the pitch as their images were captured. Ferguson, for whom control was an addiction, would surely have been incandescent at such seemingly haphazard management of information and is unlikely to have sanctioned the level of extra-curricular activity in which his new player engaged to celebrate the transfer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88190d7b427839aa4bb2f8306148133114135593\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88190d7b427839aa4bb2f8306148133114135593/0_52_1376_826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaap Stam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Would today\u2019s football club chiefs stand for as low-key an arrival as that of Jaap Stam?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it is a difficult comparison to make. The package around football has moved at a staggering pace even since Ferguson\u2019s retirement three years ago; the sport itself increasingly feels a supplement to the money-driven pageantry around it, fuelled by channels such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Weibo, and it is more likely that Ferguson would have had to make compromises \u2013 much as a number of older-school managers have had to when faced with clubs\u2019 commercial imperatives, particularly in pre-season.</p> <p>For a more conventional breach of protocol that Ferguson would never have countenanced, perhaps it is more apposite to look across Manchester.

  "<p>In early 2016, I met a group of female sex workers (FSWs) in Bagalkot district in Karnataka, India. The campaign statement for their <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/women/endviolence/orangeday.shtml\">Orange Day</a> event calling for an end to violence against women in December 2015 was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.whatworks.co.za/resources/project-resources/item/100-samvedana-plus-orange-day-2015-celebrations-infographic-report\">Violence is not love</a>\u201d. I was curious about what this meant because the women had framed it in the context of intimate relationships with their male partners. </p> <p>Just a year earlier, the results of a formative <a href=\"http://www.whatworks.co.za/resources/presentations/item/93-2015-samvedana-plus-svri-rct-presentation\">study</a> by researchers from the <a href=\"http://www.khpt.org/\">Karnataka Health Promotion Trust</a> among 620 female sex workers (FSWs) in the same district had revealed that 51% of them faced emotional, physical or sexual abuse from their intimate partners. Almost half the FSWs reported humiliation, threat of harm or intimidation, 33% were either kicked, choked, burnt on purpose, forced to engage in humiliating sex acts or threatened with a weapon, and 7% were raped by their partners in the six months prior to the survey.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we don\u2019t beat them, the mistakes done by women will become visible, and then the public will question my manhood</p> <footer> <cite>Kiranmay, sex worker's partner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tara, one of the FSWs I met, shared the story of a long raised scar on her right arm. On a Friday evening in August 2014, her partner came home to find her with a client. She defended herself when he accused her of cheating: \u201cWhat will happen if I continue sex work? You don\u2019t earn and give me money. How should I earn my livelihood? I need to eat. What do you expect me to do?\u201d Seething with rage, he kicked and pinned her to the ground with his legs on her chest. The pocketknife meant to slit her neck instead slashed her arm raised in an act of self-protection.</p> <p>A majority (64%) of sex workers surveyed for the study met their current partners as clients. The men, before they transitioned into a lover/partner, were just one of the many clients the women serviced. So there is something deeper than an act of betrayal that triggers violence in these relationships.</p> <p>In early 2014, a qualitative <a href=\"http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/resources/understanding-masculinities-gender-norms-and-intimate-partner-violence-affecting-female\">study</a> with FSWs and their partners quoted Kiranmay, a 24-year-old study participant who justified hitting his lover, saying: \u201cIf we don\u2019t beat them, the mistakes done by women will become visible, and then the public will talk about me and question my manhood.\u201d </p> <p>Men reported using violence to assert dominance, correct perceived transgressions and lack of obedience, and maintain their public image of being in control of the household and family. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"247f9b6da5700371931939af8f6f5acbab020b87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/247f9b6da5700371931939af8f6f5acbab020b87/0_0_5456_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A FSW gets ready to receive her clients in the red tinged room at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sex worker gets ready to receive clients in her home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Priya Pillai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a society where roles and expectations from women and men are gendered and fixed, sex workers act out the norms so that they can belong to the mainstream.

They expect their partners to treat them as they do their wives, and fear that they are loved less if they are not hit. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rates of condom use fall further when the relationship is violent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The norms governing these relationships have significant implications for public health interventions, particularly for HIV/Aids programmes. Women\u2019s unquestioning acceptance of masculinity norms and trust in their partners create barriers to condom use and uptake of health services by both women and men.</p> <p>An overwhelming 91% of FSWs in the survey reported trust as the main reason for not using condoms with their partners. Unlike with their clients, FSWs hesitate to insist on condom use with their partners for fear of being perceived as disloyal, losing their partners or experiencing violence. Rates of condom use fall further when the relationship is violent. Only 24% of FSWs who had experienced violence reported consistent condom use with their partners, as compared with 49% of sex workers who did not face violence.</p> <h2>Love, loss and unsafe sex</h2> <p>How do they navigate this seemingly impossible matrix of violence, love and loss, and unsafe sex? <a href=\"http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/projects/samvedana-plus-reducing-violence-and-increasing-condom-use-intimate-partnerships-female-sex\">Samvedana Plus</a> is a violence reduction intervention that aims to reduce the risk of HIV in FSWs by addressing partner violence in their intimate relationships. Since early 2015, a total of 800 FSWs in the district have been learning to better negotiate violence and condom use with their partners.</p> <p>Individual and group sessions inform FSWs about protective laws and teach them to better communicate with their partners. Peer support groups, outreach workers and a crisis management team from <a href=\"http://www.chaitanyamahilasangha.org/\">a sex worker\u2019s collective</a> work to guide them about how to better resist violence from their partners. The programme provides access to HIV services and distributes male and female condoms.

The sessions are safe spaces for men to open up about the burden of supporting many families, measuring up to society\u2019s expectations of being a man and the fear of being considered weak if they do not keep their women in check. They are seen not just as the aggressors, but also as individuals in equal need of support and potential allies in preventing violence. The FSWs say violence continues to happen but at a lower rate.</p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b723d206d22ece4fc6e85e4eb72371c895c4fc7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b723d206d22ece4fc6e85e4eb72371c895c4fc7c/0_0_5456_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female condom sachet used by sex workers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female condom sachet used by sex workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Priya Pillai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Giving these women and men information, condoms and legal aid doesn\u2019t address the complex drivers of unsafe sex and violence in these relationships \u2013 patriarchal gender norms that lead men to believe that women are deserving of violence and that their honour is conditional upon her subservience.</p> <p>Gender roles need to evolve so that women believe in their right to safe sex and men can define themselves without violence.

  "<p>Tyrone Harts sneaked into his former girlfriend\u2019s house while Brandi Morales and her six children slept. He beat her, shot her to death and then lit her body on fire. Her two little boys tried to douse the flames with cups of water from the kitchen sink. Her two little girls fanned smoke away with sofa cushions.</p> <p>Francisco Zavala stabbed Eric Sargeant Jr while stealing his cellphone. The 16-year-old died from his wounds.</p> <p>Harts was the first person sentenced to death in Riverside County in 2015, a year when the southern California region sent more people to death row than any other county in the United States. Zavala was the eighth and final. </p> <p>Insofar as sentencing goes, the county, east of Los Angeles, was the death penalty capital of America.</p> <p>The two men and the county where they murdered are exhibit A for what is wrong with the death penalty in California, a broken process whose future is on the ballot in November. That\u2019s when voters \u2013 through dueling measures \u2013 will face some of the thorniest questions confronting the justice system.</p> <p>To kill or not to kill? Which murderers, if any, deserve to die for their crimes? Should geography decide who is executed and who is not?</p> <p>Proposition 62 is the simpler of the two measures before voters. Titled the Justice That Works Act, it would replace the death penalty with life in prison without parole. It would require offenders to work and pay restitution. Its supporters say it would save California taxpayers $150m annually.<br></p> <p>Proposition 66, the Death Penalty Reform and Savings Act, would streamline the lengthy appeals process for condemned inmates, expand the pool of attorneys available for appeals, and allow the state to place those on death row in cheaper housing as they await execution. Supporters say it would save \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d each year. </p> <p>Proponents of the opposing measures agree on just one thing: that the death penalty in the Golden State does not work.</p> <p>Or as Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, the former president and first lady, said when endorsing Proposition 62 in July: \u201cWe believe that the attempt to administer the death penalty in a fair and efficient manner has failed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f1d97e7a32d3728fd0d3c6a355e219b81ca53da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1d97e7a32d3728fd0d3c6a355e219b81ca53da/0_41_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"California currently has 746 men and women on death row, more than any other state in the country.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">California currently has 746 men and women on death row, more than any other state in the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kimberly White/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>California currently has 746 men and women on death row, more than any other state in the country. The oldest is 86; 11% are senior citizens. The average stay is 18 years. No one has been executed in California in more than a decade.</p> <p>And no one condemned in Riverside County has ever been executed, even though its voters wholeheartedly support execution and its courts are responsible for 89 defendants currently on death row. Per capita, that is 73% higher than Los Angeles County, its much larger neighbor to the north.</p> <p>The disparity underscores a major complaint of death penalty opponents: that the ultimate punishment as it is practiced in the United States in general, and in California in particular, is so capricious as to be unconstitutional.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about ending a man or a woman\u2019s life, you\u2019ve got to take arbitrariness out of it,\u201d said Riverside County public defender Steve Harmon. \u201cThe death penalty never can take it out, so that\u2019s another reason why we shouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d</p> <p> Zavala\u2019s crime \u201chas no comparison to the nasty facts of the Harts case\u201d, said Harmon, who opposes capital punishment on many grounds. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder case, and that\u2019s terrible, but that\u2019s the arbitrariness of the death penalty.\u201d </p> <p>Harts and Morales had lived together for several years before she broke up with him and asked him to leave. Although none of her children were Harts\u2019, he helped raise them in a tan two-storey house in a tired-looking subdivision in Moreno Valley. They called him Dad. He coached them at sports. </p> <p>The night he murdered Morales in February 2011, Harts called and talked with each of the children. When he got to the youngest boy, seven-year-old Israel, he asked for a particular favor: leave the sliding glass door open.</p> <p>\u201cTyrone told us he was bringing us a surprise,\u201d the boy later testified. </p> <p>Harts, then 39, borrowed a friend\u2019s car, packed a gun and a container of lighter fluid, and broke into the darkened house when the family was soundly asleep. He made his way to the upstairs bedroom he once shared with Morales.</p> <p>He attacked. She screamed. Kobe, 15, heard her cries from the downstairs bedroom where he and 13-year-old Isaiah slept. Kobe grabbed a kitchen knife and raced upstairs to help his mother. But when Harts fired a shot at the boy, he fled for a neighbor\u2019s house, Isaiah in tow.</p> <p>Morales broke free and headed for the stairs. Harts shot her. She crumpled on the landing. He doused her with accelerant and lit her on fire. That\u2019s when the four youngest children emerged from their bedrooms. Elijah, 11 at the time, Destiny, then nine, Israel, seven, and Jasmine, six.</p> <p>\u201cThe fire was big enough so they couldn\u2019t get by their mom\u2019s burning body without going single file,\u201d supervising deputy district attorney Jared Haringsma said. \u201cThey had to go to the kitchen and get cups of water to put their mom\u2019s burning body out and then wait for the police to arrive.\u201d</p> <p>Elijah called 911 but had trouble making the dispatcher understand. She asked him to put his mother on the phone. \u201cMy mom is the one that\u2019s on fire,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdaed1ff769721ec38a095b30e608d3bd8ecd53b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdaed1ff769721ec38a095b30e608d3bd8ecd53b/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Justice That Works Act would replace the death penalty with life in prison without parole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Justice That Works Act would replace the death penalty with life in prison without parole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jurors found Harts guilty of first-degree murder, attempted murder and five counts of felony child endangerment. They also agreed on the special circumstance of lying in wait, which made Harts eligible for execution. It took the jury less than a day to sentence him to death.</p> <p>Riverside County jurors took about the same amount of time to convict Zavala of murder in the 2013 death of Sargeant, a high school sophomore. Because the crime was committed during a robbery, Zavala also was eligible for the death penalty.</p> <p>But beyond the fact that both men had criminal records and were sentenced to die, their crimes were dramatically different. </p> <p>Sargeant was walking along a busy street in East Hemet after school when he was accosted by three young men. Zavala demanded Sargeant hand over his cellphone. When the teenager did not, the three men began punching him.</p> <p>Witnesses driving by testified that one of the men appeared to stab Sargeant, who later died at a local hospital. </p> <p>Zavala\u2019s accomplices were minors at the time of the crime and could not be sentenced to death, but Zavala was then 20.</p> <p>\u201cZavala is not the worst of the worst,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cBut to those 12 people sitting in the box, they\u2019ve never been in the same room with a murderer before. So Zavala is the worst of the worst they\u2019ve experienced. When given a chance, they say, well, this is the worst, so I\u2019m going to stamp \u2018death\u2019 on this.\u201d</p> <p>Riverside County has been featured in multiple reports about how unevenly the death penalty is meted out. Death by Geography and The 2% Death Penalty: How a Minority of Counties Produce Most Death Cases at Enormous Costs to All were penned by outside groups looking in.</p> <p>But perhaps the most damning analysis came from inside the county\u2019s own court system. In a 2010 report, presiding judge Thomas H Cahraman rued \u201cthe pure volume of death penalty cases ... We now have more such cases than any other county in the state, including Los Angeles County.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, Riverside County had a population of 2.2 million, 45 death penalty cases and 11 more with special-circumstances allegations, which could draw a death sentence. Los Angeles County, with 9.8 million people, \u201chas 43 DP cases\u201d, Cahraman wrote.</p> <p>Rod Pacheco was the district attorney at the time, and his successor sought the ultimate penalty in fewer cases. And when Mike Hestrin became district attorney in 2015, he shrunk the list of death-eligible cases even further.</p> <p>But Hestrin is campaigning actively for Proposition 66 and said he would be \u201cvery disappointed\u201d if the death penalty is repealed in November. Deciding to seek the death penalty is difficult and sobering but necessary, he said, because \u201cthere are those heinous cases where we need the option\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Nigeria will be the first African country to switch from analogue to free digital television \u2013 and it is looking to a small British company to roll it out. </p> <p>Although several other African countries \u2013 including Rwanda and Tanzania \u2013 have migrated to digital and switched off their analogue signals, they work on a subscription model, so consumers have to pay.<br></p> <p>The Nigerian government, though, is following the Freeview model pioneered in Britain, and is aiming to get 30 channels into 20m homes via subsidised digital set-top boxes that cost $7.50 (\u00a35.70) each. Viewers will only have to pay for the boxes and a licence fee of $5 a year.</p> <p>Because about 16 digital channels can fit in the space of an old analogue one, this will mean that a spectrum worth about $1bn is freed up. The government plans to sell it to mobile phone companies to feed Nigerians\u2019 growing appetite for 3G and 4G.</p> <p>The cost of subsidising the boxes and installing transmitters across the country is about $500m, which leaves another $500m profit. Nigeria needs this money to plug the holes in its budget caused by low oil prices and production, the latter caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/niger-delta-avengers-militants-shut-down-chevron-oil-facility\">armed groups blowing up its pipelines</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a well-costed model, and the Nigerian government knows it works because they\u2019ve already sold off some spectrum to MTN [a South Africa-based mobile telecoms firm] for $170m,\u201d said Nick Markham, the chairman of Inview Technology, the British company launching FreeTV in Nigeria. \u201cSo basically there\u2019s a payback, and this is what we\u2019re telling all the different African governments.\u201d</p> <p>Inview is close to persuading Ghana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ivory Coast to follow suit. There should be a domino effect, as digital signals in countries that make the switch interfere with their neighbours\u2019 analogue signals.<br></p> <p>The main competition, StarTimes, is Chinese, but it works differently. It offers African governments cheap loans in return for control of the television service under a pay-TV model.<br></p> <p>FreeTV did its first launch in Jos, a city in central Nigeria, in May, and in November the analogue signal will be switched off.<br></p> <p>There should be a knock-on effect on the local film industry \u2013 Markham estimated that Nollywood studios, which at the moment struggle with piracy, would get an extra $250m a year.<br></p> <p>Some Nigerians have questioned whether the country will really be able to meet its target of switching off the analogue signal by next year, pointing out that the government has already missed targets in 2012 and 2015.</p> <p>But others say it could be \u201cthe new telecoms\u201d industry, as its 30m households means Nigeria is a bigger market than any of the countries that currently have free digital television.

  "<h2><strong>Joni Mitchell \u2013 The Jungle Line</strong></h2> <p>When pressed for an answer, I\u2019ll say The Jungle Line is probably my favourite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/may/02/10-of-the-best-joni-mitchell-readers-choice\">Joni Mitchell </a>track.

  "<p>A referendum recognising Indigenous people in the Australian constitution will not be held next year, scuppering a plan to hold the vote on the anniversary of the 1967 referendum.</p> <p>The Referendum Council chairs, Mark Leibler and Pat Anderson, said the deadline had been pushed back to allow for better consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, with the final report now due mid-2017. That means the referendum would be unlikely to be held before 2018.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/indigenous-affairs/referendum-council-communique-9-august-2016\">a communique on Tuesday</a>, the council said the decision was made in response to feedback received at meetings in Broome, Thursday Island and Melbourne in the past few months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/19/backing-for-indigenous-treaty-grows-as-constitutional-recognition-loses-support\">Backing for Indigenous treaty grows as constitutional recognition loses support</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMembers acknowledged the broad-ranging views being raised at the meetings and noted this was to be expected given the complexity of the issue, the diversity of people being canvassed across the country and the reality that Indigenous peoples had not been given such an opportunity previously to express their hopes and concerns to the wider community,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cMembers also noted the strong message received from meeting participants that the consultation process should not be rushed by working to an artificial deadline.\u201d</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands the majority of the 150 delegates at those meetings were boadly in support of constitutional recognition, with many saying it should be developed in tandem with a treaty that would provide tangible benefits to Indigenous people.

  "<p>What do you do when the internet decides you\u2019ve been kidnapped?</p> <p>It sounds like a strange question, and it is. Yet that\u2019s what happened to the 19-year-old Marina Joyce. Somehow, a video about some dresses turned into a huge conspiracy theory involving her friends, family and even the police. Then people online turned on Marina herself, accusing her of planning the entire thing. How did it happen?</p> <p>It\u2019s a question her mum, Cheryl Joyce, is still asking. She told the Guardian: \u201cShe\u2019s just been caught in the middle of something peculiar that the pair of us don\u2019t even understand.\u201d</p> <p>Marina\u2019s reaction to it all has been a little different. She\u2019s no stranger to YouTube fame, albeit not on this level, and was fairly well-known even before it all kicked off. She said: \u201cI felt a bit overwhelmed, but I really cared and I just appreciated that it was other people caring about me at the end of the day.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t frightened, I\u2019ve been OK with it the whole time.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqhFUbtpiB4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FqhFUbtpiB4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The story starts on a hot day in July, when Marina asked Cheryl to help her with a video. She\u2019d been sent some dresses by a clothing company to review and advertise, something which happens fairly regularly among popular YouTubers.</p> <p>\u201cIt could have been anybody, but she asked me because I was the one in the house at the time,\u201d she said. It was a nice day, so they filmed it outside. Cheryl remembers holding the paperwork, which you can see in the corner of the screen at one point, and on one occasion whispered suggestions to Marina on how to pose. Once it was done, they got on with their day.</p> <p>Marina uploaded the video on Friday \u2013 in the Joyce household, the whole internet goes down when she\u2019s uploading to YouTube \u2013 shut her laptop, and got on with her weekend.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until Monday that Cheryl thought to have a look at the video, and realised it had more views than usual.</p> <p>\u201cJust as I was looking at it, a friend of Marina\u2019s texted me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey said is Marina all right, we can\u2019t get hold of her. I said, has it got something to do with this video, it seems to have a lot of views? They said, yes, read the comments.\u201d</p> <p>Somehow, commenters decided something was terribly wrong with Marina. They analysed the video, found a spot where she seemed to be saying \u201chelp me\u201d, claimed she looked scared, that there was someone behind the camera telling her what to do. They screenshotted her videos, circling bruises on her arms. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43e0ab858859614433ee0bf6ed0ae7e1c08aae50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43e0ab858859614433ee0bf6ed0ae7e1c08aae50/0_0_588_383/500.png\" alt=\"Some people claimed Marina was whispering \u201chelp me\u201d in the video.

I think she\u2019s just been experimenting with her YouTube style.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, the consensus became: she was in trouble, she had been kidnapped by a boyfriend who was forcing her to make videos so no one would realise anything was wrong. They thought she needed help.</p> <p>Cheryl was taken aback. \u201cI read the comments, I saw what was going on. I got frightened. I ran up to Marina and I told her, she was in shock.</p> <p>\u201cAll she said to me was: \u2018But I haven\u2019t been kidnapped.\u2019 What else can you say?\u201d</p> <p>Much of what raised suspicions in the video could be easily explained. The whispered \u201chelp me\u201d? That was Cheryl telling Marina to turn around \u201clike me\u201d. </p> <p>Bars on the back of the window? Installed after two burglaries at the recommendation from a friend. The bruises? From a nasty fall Marina had a few weeks before the video was shot.</p> <p>But the internet wasn\u2019t to know that. And the Joyces weren\u2019t sure what to do next. The hope was, the furore would have died down by Tuesday. They texted Marina\u2019s friends, some of whom are also YouTubers, asking them to spread the word. </p> <p>One friend told her, don\u2019t make another video, it will only fuel things. Besides which, everyone would just assume the kidnapper forced her to make it.</p> <p>Tuesday night, it got to another level entirely.

My mum is part of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/06/were-not-cult-members-labour-supporters-at-corbyn-rallies\">'We're not cult members': Labour supporters at Corbyn rallies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am, of course, talking about the people who support Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 12,000 of whom have joined <a href=\"http://www.peoplesmomentum.com/\">Momentum</a>, the activist movement that propelled Corbyn to power. And after Monday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">high court win and a clean sweep in the elections</a> to Labour\u2019s national executive committee, support for Corbyn shows no signs of abating \u2013 despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/762699781546381312?s=09\">continued suggestions</a> that those supporters are nothing more than an abusive rabble. How many of the journalists writing panicked screeds about these awful people have actually met any of them, do you think? I ask because writing about the Corbyn phenomenon over the last year means I\u2019ve met probably hundreds of his supporters and to be honest, I find dealing with them the most pleasant element of writing about Corbyn.</p> <p>A couple of months ago, I went to a political event that included a branch of Momentum. All young women; they were energetic, funny and very friendly. Two weeks ago, I had a debate with a Momentum member about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/14/does-jeremy-corbyn-have-a-media-strategy-apparently-not\">Corbyn\u2019s media strategy</a>. Of the two of us, it was me who was the ruder, more impatient one. When Corbyn ran for leadership last year, I visited phone banks for him dozens of times, and spent hours in the company of the very people who went on to found Momentum. I told myself I was <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/11/britains-bernie-sanders-is-about-to-win-big-jeremy-corbyn-labour/\">researching a piece</a>; actually I think I just liked talking to them.</p> <p>Sure, my experiences of these Corbyn supporters might not be representative. But they do suggest that the depiction of them as a madcap bunch of deluded cultists is not representative either. Broadly speaking, the media has failed to understand the political moment in the Labour party; it has shown a damning lack of interest in the fact that people who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands \u2013 preferring instead to dismiss them as an angry mob.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'People who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One half of that description is accurate, however. Corbyn supporters may not be a mob, but they are angry. And to understand why, it is useful to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/jeremy-gilbert/is-momentum-mob-no-this-is-what-democracy-looks-like\">consider the words</a> of the academic Jeremy Gilbert, a longstanding Labour member and activist who has joined Momentum: \u201cMomentum is simply trying to give a voice to a body of opinion which has been widespread throughout the country for many years, but has been denied any kind of place in our public life since the early days of New Labour. It is a body of opinion which believes, with good reason, that the embrace of neoliberal economics and neoconservative foreign policy under Blair was a disaster \u2026 Naturally some of those voices, suppressed for so long, sound raucous, aggressive and uncouth.\u201d</p> <p>The anger that commentators detect in the Corbyn movement, in my experience, is not a symptom of the fact that it has been infiltrated by bullies \u2013 but that its members feel as though the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/labour-coup-disastrous-jeremy-corbyn\">Labour coup</a> is as much an attack on their right to participate in public discourse as it is on Corbyn.</p> <p>Everything the left traditionally stands for \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/04/theresa-may-wrong-cat-deportation\">human rights</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/Ed-Miliband-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html\">socialism</a> to a <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/02/the-iraq-wars- real-victims- laurie-penny- and-the- narcissistic-left/\">foreign policy driven by diplomacy</a> \u2013 has been, at best, marginalised and, at worst, actively mocked in mainstream political discourse since the 1970s. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the depiction of the trade unions, the last bastions of organised British socialism, as insidious barons intent on wrecking British life (a claim that sounds particularly ludicrous when made by newspapers who supported the Conservatives at the last election \u2013 a party consisting of members of the actual landed gentry).</p> <p>I am yet to meet a single Corbynite who is naive about Corbyn\u2019s failings as a leader, the great challenges he faces, or who does not want to win a general election. But the reason so many have coalesced around him anyway is because they view his leadership as the only opportunity they have had in at least 30 years to see their views finally represented in public life. The Labour rebels\u2019 attempt to unseat him is, in their minds, as much an attempt to excommunicate the wider left as it is to get rid of Corbyn himself. Perhaps the most salient evidence of this is the decision to charge affiliate members \u00a325 to vote in the leadership election, and ban outright members who joined fewer than six months ago \u2013 a decision that has now been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">overturned in court</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4pd7c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2627517\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a06c0ae4b07e27cb7e00e3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\">Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Worse still for Corbyn supporters, the policy positions they have taken over the last 30 years have often been proven right. Lack of social housing has led to a spiralling housing crisis; the deregulation of the financial industry would have caused economic collapse had it not been for state intervention; queasiness around public ownership has caused escalating transport costs and arguably the shambles that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/aug/08/southern-rail-strike-begins-live-updates\">Southern Railway</a>; inequality is the UK\u2019s most pressing social issue; a reluctance to rein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels\">fossil fuel companies</a> has led to a climate emergency; and even Tony Blair accepts that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/25/tony-blair-sorry-iraq-war-mistakes-admits-conflict-role-in-rise-of-isis\">Iraq war may have led to the rise of Isis</a>. This is why so many Corbyn supporters are upset by the coup, and why they have decided to back him unequivocally, in spite of the incompetence that has at times been part of his leadership.</p> <p>I have a lot of sympathy with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/owen-smith-plan-low-paid-workers-labour-leadership\">Owen Smith</a> supporters who are horrified by Labour\u2019s poll ratings. But I have zero sympathy with those in the party who have been utterly unwilling to engage with Corbyn supporters, and who have not reflected on why they lost control of their party to someone they so clearly regard as useless. There are simply not enough delusional Leninists in Britain to make up the entirety of Corbyn\u2019s support \u2013 these are ordinary British voters who want radical solutions to a growing number of crises. And until they are listened to and taken seriously, Corbyn and the movement keeping him in power is not going anywhere.</p>",

The bill, which was co-sponsored by the Labor senator Katy Gallagher and the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, lapsed when the parliament was prorogued.</p> <p>It is not clear whether or not the bill will be reintroduced when the new parliament resumes later this month, but the issue is likely to come back on the political agenda given there is residual support for change across party lines.</p>",

The email they had sent was well over 140 characters and I found it too difficult to digest. In order to even get through it I had to record myself reading it aloud in a series of Snapchats and watch them back. Some of it was difficult to decipher, as the sound effect of a dog\u2019s tongue every time I opened my mouth muffled some of the words but, from what I remember, they wanted to know if being funny online was part of a comedian\u2019s job, and if there\u2019s a pressure to live up to the expectations of everyone with an internet connection.</p> <p>The answer is simple. Being funny on social media is not a comedian\u2019s job, it\u2019s their duty. We\u2019re not artists any more. We\u2019re meme conduits. Gif deliverers. There is no longer any value in laughter.

Changing your mind on the internet is unforgivable and something no one is allowed to do. You tweeted you like Frubes in 2009? You better not get caught slagging off lunchbox yoghurt tubes in 2016, you hypocrite. On the internet, your views are your views for ever, regardless of societal change.</p> <p>The best way to not offend anyone on Twitter is to delete your account. Even then you run the risk of offending Milo Yiannopoulos, who recently had his account deleted. The fact you even have that choice is an honour. Check your privilege. Even if you\u2019re being ironic and you explain that critics might\u2019ve had a sense of humour bypass, should you really be joking about bypasses? Or senses? Some people are blind. Some can\u2019t smell. Others have no sense of taste. (Those ones are on GooglePlus.) </p> <p>If you delve deep enough into the internet superhighway you might stumble on a movie-talkie website called YouTubes. This is where spoken word artists will become the human manifestation of think-pieces and faux-passionately tell you we all need to \u2018log off\u2019 so we can reconnect as people, in person, face to face, in the real world. They\u2019ll then demand you like their video, subscribe to their channel and share it on Pinterest or something. They\u2019re wrong. The real world is too dangerous. You can\u2019t get punched in an @reply. Unless the person has tweeted a reply to your joke which explains your joke back to you, in which case you will be forced to smack yourself in the face until you draw blood.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just about tweeting. Retweeting is also vital. Play the game! You retweet my back, I\u2019ll quote tweet yours. In summary, if you want to be a successful Twitter comedian, which wasn\u2019t even the question posed by the Guardian, you\u2019ve got to log out of your feelings and log into your meme-catalogue. And don\u2019t, under any circumstances, post anything on the internet containing a spelling mistak. </p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/rhys-james-forgives/performances\">Rhys James: Forgives is at Pleasance Courtyard, to Sunday 28 August</a></strong></em></p>",

Rather, it\u2019s the way the Dodsons draw Quinn as a relentlessly porny creation, all massive silicone-enhanced bosom and peach-shaped backside in ultra-tight spandex. And the way that every other female supervillain in the comic, from Catwoman to Poison Ivy, is shown with exactly the same preposterously-proportioned physique, as if Gotham has been overrun with a plague of psychotic Playboy bunnies on steroids.</p> <p>Everyone knows that comic book artists have a tendency to draw female superheroes and villains in an overly sexualised manner \u2013 the standard excuse is that their male counterparts are also drawn as obscenely muscular mega-titans. But whether you agree with that particular argument or not \u2013 and I never did work out why big boobs are so vital for athletic success \u2013 Harley Quinn is a bizarre candidate for this kind of treatment. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZf7XhlKls\">Watch the show in which she was first introduced</a>, the enduringly brilliant Batman: The Animated Series, and Quinn is slender rather than pneumatic.

Harley is rendered as she should be, as a slightly sad case who is unable to resist the poisonous lure of the evil, controlling Joker.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZf7XhlKls\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9bZf7XhlKls?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In a famous 1999 episode of Batman: The Animated Series\u2019 sequel series, The New Batman Adventures (based on the Paul Dini-penned comic book), Quinn is re-introduced as the psychiatrist Harley Quinzel, who finds herself falling in love with her \u201cpuddin\u2019\u201d while she is meant to be studying him at Arkham Asylum.

The caped crusader\u2019s motives are entirely honourable \u2013 it\u2019s Harley who tries to turn the moment into something more amorous \u2013 but the use of violence and subsequent sexualisation of the encounter only serve to remind us of her background as the textbook victim of abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/batman-sexism-the-killing-joke-remake-source-material\">Batman: The Killing Joke and why you can't just 'update' sexist source material</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, Suicide Squad isn\u2019t the only DC property with questionable attitudes towards women right now. While the current animated hit Batman: The Killing Joke isn\u2019t part of the Warner Bros-backed DC Extended Universe (DCEU), a slate of nine or 10 planned live-action superhero movies between now and 2020, it is still based on the publisher\u2019s seminal 1988 graphic novel by Alan Moore (who has disowned his work), was made by Warner Bros Animation in association with DC, and is distributed by the studio. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/batman-sexism-the-killing-joke-remake-source-material\">As regular readers of this site will be aware</a>, Moore\u2019s comic has become notorious for a storyline in which Batgirl, aka Barbara Gordon, is crippled and most likely raped by the Joker as part of his efforts to destroy the mind of her father, the regular Batman ally Commissioner James Gordon. </p> <p>Not content with revisiting this controversial episode, the screen version has made matters even worse. It introduces a new prologue in which the young crimefighter is told by the Dark Knight, rather patronisingly, that she is no longer to be trusted with a dangerous case. She and Batman then have sex in the wake of their stormy argument, something that never happened in the comics and which completely undermines Batgirl as a potent force in her own right. </p> <p>While this double dose of misogyny may just be the result of poor timing, these are the kind of errors we cannot imagine happening at DC\u2019s rival Marvel, whose worst mistakes regarding its treatment of women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/marvel-axed-female-villain-from-iron-man-3-after-fears-of-poor-toy-sales-says-director\">seem to revolve around poor merchandise judgments</a>. </p> <p>There\u2019s a strong possibility, if the DCEU can survive Suicide Squad\u2019s critical bashing, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/margot-robbie-harley-quinn-suicide-squad-dc-marvel-comic-book-films\">Harley and Batgirl might even find themselves appearing together in an upcoming spin-off</a> featuring many of the key female stars of the Bat-verse, from Birds of Prey to Poison Ivy, Katana and Bumblebee. According to reports, the new film \u2013 Robbie herself has pitched the concept to Warner Bros \u2013 is being considered due to the popularity of the DC Super Hero Girls line of comics and related products, which have been successfully aimed at a burgeoning female readership. </p> <p>But if DC and its studio partners really want to start making movies that empower women, they\u2019re going a very funny way about it.</p>",

The US has failed at the Winter Olympics, too, having never medaled in the biathlon. America can\u2019t medal in a sport that combines shooting and skiing? So many in the snowy Rocky Mountain states demand their second amendment rights, yet they\u2019ve somehow not once been able to use their right to bear arms to put a medal in their hands. Sad. </p> <p>Further discussion of the USA\u2019s Winter Olympics disgrace can wait two years for Pyeongchang, however. For now, the country has its hands full (and medal display cases empty) with the Summer Olympics and the five-possibly-going-on-seven sports in which the former British colony repeatedly fails. Optimists will point out that the US won the first gold medal of these Rio Games. And that the US was tied for the most medals at the end of day one. Or they\u2019ll say that the US <a href=\"http://www.teamusa.org/About-the-USOC/Inside-the-USOC/Olympic-Movement/History/US-Medal-Chart\">has nearly 2,500 summer medals</a>, and just under 1,000 of those gold, in its Games history. They may mention that the US is the heavy favorite to lead the medal count at the end of Rio. But tell all those facts to the young American boy or girl who dreams of one day winning trampoline gold and see where it gets you. Who are to be their role models? Team USA trampoline participant Nicole Ahsinger of San Diego, California? Come on. She was merely a non-competing alternate at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. </p> <p>But America, for all its many flaws \u2013 from zero trampoline medals to economic inequality to zero biathlon medals \u2013 never gives up, even when its back is against the rhythmic gymnastics mat. So in order to form a more perfect union, the US must set its sights on ending its medals drought. Call it the new \u201cmoon shot\u201d mission, but launched from a trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/20/cleveland-cavaliers-win-nba-title-golden-state-warriors-game-7-nba-finals\">If Cleveland can win a sports championship</a>, surely the United States can manage bronze in ping pong. </p> <p>First, the US must funnel its best athletes into its worst sports. What else can Serena Williams prove in tennis? She has accomplished everything. Everything but become a two-sport star. After Rio she has one more Olympics left in her 30s. Let\u2019s get a badminton racket in her hand and watch her bring glory to the stars and stripes at Tokyo 2020. Venus, a little older than Serena and less mobile, will be tasked with ending the US goose egg in table tennis. America\u2019s most famous table tennis player currently is Forrest Gump and everyone \u2013 everyone outside of Philadelphia, at least \u2013 knows it is embarrassing to champion a fictional person as a sports hero. Venus could change that. </p> <p>Handball can be addressed with a resource the United States has more than any other nation: mobile quarterbacks.

  "<p>\u201cS<em>em jogo, sem gol e sem amor</em>\u201d was the verdict in O Globo on Brazil\u2019s latest Olympic horror, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/brazil-jeered-home-support-olympic-stalemate-iraq\">0-0 draw with Iraq in Brasilia</a>. No game, no goal, no love. Just an oddly familiar kind of angst and the latest significant staging post in the theatre of pain that has become Brazilian tournament football. In Brasilia the home fans cheered the opposition, chanted the name of Marta and generally continued the theme of domestic meltdown that has gripped this serial host nation in the last two years. Welcome back, <em>o jogo collapsico</em>.</p> <p>Brazil may be ambivalent about some aspects of this Olympics, torn in some sections about the sense of something plonked down among them. But football? That is a little different. The peculiar obsession with capturing the Olympic title, the one honour to evade them so far, has been well documented. Brazil picked a powerful, well-stocked squad for these home games. Neymar is, on the numbers, arguably the biggest star at the Olympics. No other player of his stature, no other \u00a330m wonderkid signing \u2013 enter Gabriel J\u00e9sus, newly of Manchester City \u2013 will be detained at this late stage in the pre-season with events in Salvador, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio.</p> <p>And yet here we are all the same. Another 0-0 draw to follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/04/neymar-brazil-rio-2016-south-africa\">the 0-0 with South Africa</a> last week leaves the host nation not just in a familiar state of head-scratching disbelief at the impotence of these neat but oddly uncompelling inheritors of the yellow shirt but in danger of a calamitous elimination at the group stage.<br></p> <p>There is, of course, a compelling kind of theatre in this process, evident first of all in that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/08/germany-brazil-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\">World Cup steamrollering by Germany</a> two years ago. A joyless elimination at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/13/brazil-copa-america-world-cup-2018\">group stage of the Copa Am\u00e9rica </a>followed in June. And now here we are after two fist-gnawingly dull goalless draws, at perhaps the lowest point in Brazil\u2019s combined modern tournament history, a nadir of confidence and cohesion for a team that has since the boom years of the 1950s been the most obvious muster point for a sense of Brazilian sporting identity.</p> <p>Not that the opposition here were simply patsies. Iraq played with real energy and no little skill, their energetic high press unsettling Brazil\u2019s backline and deep midfield axis. The tendency for Rog\u00e9rio Micale\u2019s team to attack down the flanks and to play long diagonal passes to the powerful Gabriel \u201cGabigol\u201d Barbosa demanded some stiff, if hardly intricate, defending. Iraq showed flair and confidence too at times.</p> <p>This is the reality of international football now. The extremes have narrowed \u2013 no easy beats for the local princelings.</p> <p>Brazil were still poor. Neymar spent a lot of time drifting to the left and looked short of his most compelling sprite-like sense of mischief. These things are relative, just as finding some extra muscle has been a major part of his successful training regime at Barcelona. But the world\u2019s top creative attacker-in-waiting is a much less slight figure these days. It seems to this observer he might just have mislaid a little of his wonderful swerving agility, the gymnastic ability to adjust the shape of his body in full flight, the minutely executed swerves and jinks that are his particular superpower.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b359228fa42943052ef778ec9f983bedbbced5d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b359228fa42943052ef778ec9f983bedbbced5d3/14_0_3149_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil v Iraq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil\u2019s Gabriel Barbosa struggles to find a way past Amjed Attwan from Iraq during their pool match in Brasilia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martins/AGIF/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alternatively Neymar might simply be marginalised by the attention he can attract from defenders in a team without any comparable, fully formed superstars. Local media have been pretty hard on Gabriel J\u00e9sus, a 19-year-old with little in the way of sustained first-team football behind him in his current position but elevated already to the status of next-in-line. Even the picture caption editors were at it on Monday morning. \u201cGabriel J\u00e9sus, who played badly, battles for the ball,\u201d was O Globo\u2019s withering aside.</p> <p>But his qualities were also evident in Brasilia, with the occasional nice moment of control, some gliding speed at times. Gabigol is clearly another who might develop into that rare thing, a high-class centre-forward.</p> <p>But he is also a teenager, burdened for now with that terribly weighty golden shirt, the squeals of disappointed expectation and a history not just of success but of freedom and creativity and talent in reserve that seems ever more distant with every passing tournament meltdown.</p> <p>The passage of Brazilian football from a thing of joy and thrust and playfulness to the current state of sullen inertia is, of course, an extended process now. It is customary to blame the lure of European club football, for which Brazil is now effectively an intensive-farming producer.</p> <p>The best Brazilian players are always destined to play abroad from their early teens. The muscle and tactical flexibility that have always been part of Brazilian football are now the chief non-negotiable qualities for any young footballer (plus entourage) looking to monetise natural talent.</p> <p>As a result a team of 11 Brazilians is often a team of samey, capable, all-round workers, players of great dexterity who simply lack the wildness, the arrogance and vision of the old champion class.</p> <p>Not that Brazil has really helped itself. The domestic league is frustratingly low-pressure for all its recent riches. There is no evidence of high-class coaching, of a real tactical acuity among Brazil\u2019s own managerial class, rather a sense of inertia and stagnation.</p> <p>And so let the bad times roll. The next stop is Salvador in two days\u2019 time for a decisive meeting with Denmark that will allow Lasse Vibe of Brentford and the 17-year-old Jacob Bruun Larsen the chance to stroll out, free from any pressure, and shank another tournament dart into the rump of this stumbling, trumpeting, footballing pachyderm.</p> <p>Either way further pain could yet await. If Brazil finish second in their group they will travel to Salvador to play Nigeria, synonymous with the historic agony of defeat in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPU-8LIi9Q\">gold-medal match eliminator in Atlanta in 1996</a>, perhaps the greatest Olympic football match of modern times.</p> <p>On that occasion a Brazil team containing Roberto Carlos, Bebeto, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Juninho (Middlesbrough version) were beaten 4-3 in extra time by a wonderfully compelling Nigeria team, Nwankwo Kanu scoring the winner in extra time.</p> <p>Brazil wept and wailed on that occasion. It would be a fitting moment either to find a little ignition, late in the day, or to complete a particularly compelling circle of angst.</p>",
  "<p>A package of measures intended to help customers save \u00a392 a year by switching their bank accounts has faced criticism for failing to do enough to encourage competition among the high street banks.</p> <p>After two-year investigation into the sector, the competition watchdog said technological advances that helped the development of Uber and Google Maps would make it easier for customers to compare bank accounts and should encourage customers to shop around. </p> <p>The \u00a35m investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/18/banking-sector-review-watchdog-finance-competition\">announced in July 2014</a> when former Labour leader Ed Miliband was vowing to create new banks \u2013 is intended to kickstart competition in a sector where only 3% of personal and 4% of business customers switch to a different bank in any year.</p> <p>It also tried to tackle the \u00a31.2bn a year the banks make from unarranged overdraft charges, as customers with overdrafts find it more difficult to change accounts. Banks will be required to send alerts to customers going into the red and set a monthly cap on such charges, which some campaigners argue are higher than those levied by payday lenders such as Wonga.</p> <p>But Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns at consumer watchdog Which?, said: \u201cIt is disappointing that the monthly charge cap is not actually a cap and banks will be allowed to continue to charge exorbitant fees for so-called unauthorised overdrafts, rather than protect those customers that have been identified as among the most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>The CMA stepped back from breaking up the big four \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays \u2013 which control 77% of the current account market and more than 80% of small business accounts.</p> <p>The key plank of the proposals is the adoption of new technology in 2018 that will enable customers to see hidden charges applied to their accounts, allowing them to shop around for the best deal. This might eventually happen through the creation of a \u201cdigital app\u201d or a sophisticated price comparison website \u2013 but this \u201copen banking\u201d technology will need to be developed.<br></p> <p>Alasdair Smith, who chaired the investigation and has faced criticism in the past for holding back from tough reforms, said: \u201cWe are breaking down the barriers which have made it too easy for established banks to hold on to their customers. Our reforms will increase innovation and competition in a sector whose performance is crucial for the UK economy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=banking_investigations\" data-alt=\"Banking investigations\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=banking_investigations\">Banking investigations</a> </figure>  <p>The CMA said that personal customers could save \u00a392 on average a year by switching provider, with savings of around \u00a380 a year on average available for small businesses. \u201cLarger savings are available for overdraft users \u2013 for example, personal customers who are overdrawn for one or two weeks every month could save \u00a3180 per year on average,\u201d the CMA said.</p> <p>The use of free-if-in-credit banking \u2013 in which customers do not pay a fee for services if they do not go overdrawn, but do not receive interest on their balances \u2013 by the big four is often criticised as impeding competition. This is because it can make it difficult for customers to see how much they are paying for their banking services in hidden charges.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Spanish-owned TSB \u2013 once part of Lloyds \u2013 wanted customers to be sent monthly bills to tackle this. Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, said: \u201cThe CMA has played right into the hands of the big banks and missed a golden opportunity to enable people across the UK to get a better deal from their banks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/banking-watchdog-to-announce-measures-to-boost-competition\">Banking watchdog to announce measures to boost competition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>MPs were also unimpressed. The Treasury select committee will call the CMA to give evidence in the autumn and Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the MPs would not give up on trying to find ways to give customers more choice.</p> <p>\u201cUntil people are able to find out how much their bank charges them for their current account, millions of customers will be denied genuine choice in retail banking. There\u2019s a lot to digest but, based on what I\u2019ve seen so far, I\u2019m not optimistic that the CMA\u2019s remedies will get to the heart of the problem,\u201d said Tyrie.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, a Labour MP who sits on the committee, will ask the Financial Conduct Authority to consider measures similar to those imposed on payday lenders to cap charges on overdrafts.</p> <h2><strong>The measures that were rejected </strong></h2> <p><strong>Breaking up banks</strong></p> <p>The CMA concluded there was insufficient evidence that the current structure of the industry was hurting competition. The separation of TBS from Lloyds Banking Group and the troublesome split of 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches out of Royal Bank of Scotland were \u201cexpensive\u201d and \u201chigh disruptive\u201d for customers. Both those divestments were demanded by the EU as a result of the taxpayer bailouts.</p> <p><strong>Ending free-if-in-credit banking</strong></p> <p>The CMA concludes this works well for many customers. The real problem is whether customers can work out if they are getting the best deal.</p> <p><strong>Easing capital requirements for mortgages</strong> </p> <p>New banks need to hold more capital for lending than established players.

A number of Turkish citizens were rounded up and kicked out of Russia, while life became harder for Turkish businesses in the country. </p> <p>In June, Erdo\u011fan <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/kremlin-says-erdogan-apologises-russian-jet-turkish\">penned</a> a letter to Putin that stopped short of offering a full apology for the incident but did <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/kremlin-says-erdogan-apologises-russian-jet-turkish\">apologise</a> to the families of the pilots. He also wrote that Turkey \u201cnever had the desire or deliberate intention of shooting down the Russian Federation\u2019s plane\u201d, according to a Kremlin statement. The Kremlin accepted Erdo\u011fan\u2019s letter as an apology and soon after announced Tuesday\u2019s meeting. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI hope that this will lead to the further normalisation of the whole spectrum of our relations with Turkey,\u201d Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told RIA Novosti news agency. \u201cThis is the first meeting after a long break in absolutely all contacts \u2013 political, trade and others. So it\u2019s important to have a full discussion, see where we are, and look at possibilities for further cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>Ushakov said the fact that Erdo\u011fan was making the effort to travel to St Petersburg despite the current internal situation in Turkey was evidence that the Turkish side was serious about a resumption of good relations between the countries.</p> <p>However, it is unlikely they will immediately return to their previous level, given the amount of angry rhetoric exchanged in recent months. Ushakov said the issue of compensation over the plane would be raised. Erdo\u011fan is also likely to ask Putin to temper Russian support for Kurds in Syria.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There were already signs of the thaw on Monday, as Turkish authorities unblocked the website of the Sputnik news agency, a Kremlin-funded news service. The agency had its website blocked by Turkey\u2019s communications regulator and its bureau chief was deported from Turkey in April. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Susan Collins announced she would not vote for Donald Trump on Monday, joining the few other Republican senators to repudiate the party\u2019s nominee for president.</p> <p>\u201cI will not be voting for Donald Trump for president,\u201d the senator from Maine wrote <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/gop-senator-why-i-cannot-support-trump/2016/08/08/821095be-5d7e-11e6-9d2f-b1a3564181a1_story.html\">in an op-ed published in the Washington Post</a> on Monday night. \u201cThis is not a decision I make lightly, for I am a lifelong Republican. But Donald Trump does not reflect historical Republican values nor the inclusive approach to governing that is critical to healing the divisions in our country.\u201d<br></p> <p>Senators Lindsey Graham, Mark Kirk, Ben Sasse, Dean Heller and Jeff Flake have all said they would either not vote for Trump or adamantly voiced their resistance to the notion. Senator Ted Cruz, who was defeated by Trump in the primary race, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/ted-cruz-speech-republican-national-convention-trump-endorsement\">urged conservatives to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d at the Republican national convention</a>.</p> <p>Two Republican representatives, Virginia\u2019s Scott Rigell and New York\u2019s Richard Hanna, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/06/republican-votes-libertarian-donald-trump-gary-johnson\">publicly rejected Trump</a> in the past week. On Saturday, Rigell told the New York Times he would vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and earlier last week Hanna said he would vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Both Rigell and Hanna have said they intend to retire after this term, and Collins does not face re-election this fall. She has consistently criticized Trump\u2019s racially charged and offensive comments throughout the primary and had refused to say whether she would vote for Trump.</p> <p>Other Republican senators put in difficult positions by Trump include John McCain, running for re-election in an increasingly Hispanic Arizona, and Kelly Ayotte, running for re-election in moderate New Hampshire. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-endorses-paul-ryan-wisconsin-rally\">awkwardly endorsed both senators</a> last week after initially refusing to do so.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s \u201cconstant stream of cruel comments\u201d disturbed Collins throughout the primary and through the Republican convention, she wrote, \u201cbut it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing \u2013 either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level \u2013 that revealed Mr Trump as unworthy of being our president\u201d.</p> <p>In particular, Collins cited Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-mock-new-york-times-reporter-disability\">mockery of a disabled reporter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">of Senator McCain\u2019s war service</a> last year, his insistence that a federal judge from Indiana <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-muslim-judges-face-the-nation\">had racial bias because his parents were from Mexico</a>, and finally his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">criticism of two gold star parents</a>, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son Humayun was a US army captain killed in Iraq protecting other soldiers.</p> <p>\u201cRather than honoring their sacrifice and recognizing their pain, Mr Trump disparaged the religion of the family of an American hero,\u201d Collins wrote. \u201cAnd once again, he proved incapable of apologizing, of saying he was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The senator also described Trump as a threat to world security, saying his \u201clack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies.\u201d</p> <p>Collins also responded to assurances from Trump\u2019s campaign and some Republican leaders that Trump would soften his tone in the general election, and cease criticizing party members and minorities. \u201cThere will be no \u2018new\u2019 Donald Trump,\u201d she wrote, \u201cjust the same candidate who will slash and burn and trample anything and anyone he perceives as being in his way or an easy scapegoat.\u201d</p> <p>Maine\u2019s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/14/who-supports-donald-trump-the-new-republican-center-of-gravity\">endorsed Trump</a>, and the candidate himself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft9oujWos64\">held a rally in Portland</a>, Maine, last week, despite the state\u2019s long history of voting Democratic in general elections. Collins is more moderate than some of her peers in the Senate, and penned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/gun-control-bipartisan-bill-congress-senate-house\">a compromise bill on gun control</a> earlier this year that has failed to gain traction. She was also the first Republican senator who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/susan-collins-supports-same-sex-marriage-108339\">supports same-sex marriage</a> and won re-election in 2014.</p> <p>She maintained that she will help campaign for other Republicans, but not Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI revere the history of my party, most particularly the value it has always placed on the worth and dignity of the individual,\u201d she wrote, concluding: \u201cIt is because of Mr Trump\u2019s inability and unwillingness to honor that legacy that I am unable to support his candidacy.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u2018I definitely feel,\u201d said Sam Adamson as she stood before the mighty Wearmouth Bridge, \u201cthat working-class people got&#xa0;their voice heard.\u201d You remember Adamson. She was the woman in all the newspapers held aloft at Silksworth Tennis Centre by cheering Brexiteers on 24 June, when her city voted to&#xa0;leave the EU. She wasn\u2019t exactly Brexit\u2019s poster girl, but was nonetheless emblematic of mass loathing for elitist&#xa0;politics. Westminster? Brussels? For her and her mates, these are latter-day Versailles \u2013 decadent, irrelevant, and frequently wigged out, if not in a good way.</p> <p>Just over a month after Sunderland voted leave, Adamson told BBC political editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak?lang=en-gb\" title=\"\">Laura Kuenssberg</a> on <strong>Brexit: The Battle for Britain</strong> (BBC2), what the result meant. \u201cFor the working-class people, it was like, \u2018Yeah, you heard us \u2013 now do something about it\u2019.\u201d But what is that something? Kuenssberg concluded that politics could not go on as before. She was light, though, on detail. She\u2019s not alone in being sketchy: the new prime minister Theresa May has said that \u201ca bright future awaits, where all our people can share in a new prosperity, freedom and democracy\u201d. A tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing.</p> <p>Kuenssberg didn\u2019t consider, either, how one consequence of Brexit may be Scottish independence, though that is surely a fascinating front in the Battle for Britain. Scottish independence would consign the remains of Britain to rule by an electorally unbeatable Conservatives, that party historically interested in destroying the working classes. Or so you might think.</p> <p>Instead, she anatomised the whole Eton mess of the last months \u2013 the tears, fears, posh-boy betrayals, lies and creative accountancy by means of which Britain has been torn into acrimonious shreds thanks to self-serving ghouls masquerading as our selfless betters.</p> <p>She had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nickclegg\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg</a> fingering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a> as the guy who leaked the lie that the Queen had told Clegg she backed Brexit. \u201c[T]he idea that the Queen, of all people, would even bother to give someone as insignificant as a \u2018here today, gone tomorrow\u2019 deputy prime minister a tongue-lashing about Europe I just think is \u2026 so preposterous,\u201d said Clegg, oleaginous even at his most faux self-deprecating. She showed how the rival campaigns\u2019 figures didn\u2019t add up. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\" title=\"\">leave campaign\u2019s claim that \u00a3350m a week of British taxpayers\u2019 money transferred into Brussels\u2019 coffers was a house of cards</a> that a single puff would flatten; pro-remain chancellor George Osborne\u2019s claim that the average British family would lose \u00a34,300 a year if we left the EU also bore scant scrutiny.</p> <p>She took Nigel Farage to task over that vile, cunning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\" title=\"\">Breaking Point poster</a>. Who did those crowds in the poster represent? Lithuanian plumbers? Syrians leaving hell? Wasn\u2019t its message racist, she asked the ex-Ukip leader? I couldn\u2019t tell you what Farage\u2019s reply was: my late mother had to leave the room whenever Thatcher came on TV in the 1980s; Farage rampant has the same effect on me in 2016.</p> <p>If only it was Clegg and Farage who sent my Oleaginousness Meter into overdrive. But no. If I had a euro for every time Cameron\u2019s former director of communications Craig Oliver asked and answered his own self-flattering question rather than Kuenssberg\u2019s worthwhile one, I could stop sterling\u2019s calamitous plummet. If the National Grid could harness leave campaign chief executive Matthew Elliott\u2019s aura of self-satisfaction, nobody would be calling for a nuclear power plant at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\" title=\"\">Hinkley Point</a>.</p> <p>Kuenssberg was alive to the irony of Tory toffs (Johnson, Gove etc) indicting Britain\u2019s elitist establishment. \u201cThe sheer nerve!\u201d exclaimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-mandelson\" title=\"\">Peter Mandelson</a>. Think of it this way: which benefits more from Brexit \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s career, or the British working classes? If you answered the latter, you\u2019re not paying attention.</p> <p>What will happen to the working classes post-Brexit in cities such as Sunderland? Perhaps Theresa May\u2019s bright future will include Sunderland\u2019s largest private sector employer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan\" title=\"\">Nissan</a>, leaving the north east in the wake of Brexit. Certainly it\u2019s not just me who fears that the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n15/john-lanchester/brexit-blues\" title=\"\">working classes won\u2019t so much be heard as screwed over</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Here\u2019s another post-Brexit scenario. Today, as you know, British tomatoes are picked by eastern Europeans. But who, asked Morland Sanders in <strong>Brexit: Who\u2019ll Do Your Job Now?</strong> (Channel 4), picks theirs? He found that Polish tomatoes are picked by Filipinos, Bangladeshis \u2013 and North Koreans. That last ethnic group intrigued Sanders. What are they doing in Polish polytunnels?</p> <p>Sanders found that North Korea is cash poor and sends workers abroad to pick soft fruit to earn hard currency. Such is globalisation in practice. Once the Poles leave British farms to pick fruit and veg back home, there will be a vacancy. Perhaps, Sanders suggested, North Koreans will fill it, doing the back-breaking, low-paid work that our native workers, apparently, disdain.</p> <p>Picture the scene: in the future, our farm produce will be gathered by slave labour, their wages sent to Pyongyang and used to bankroll nukes that Kim Jong-un will use to menace \u2013 there\u2019s no easy way to say this \u2013 us. The future Morland evoked was Swiftian in its savage inversion of Theresa May\u2019s Pollyanna-ish fortune-telling. It sounds&#xa0;nuts, but maybe not: in this Battle for Britain, we must learn to expect the unexpected.</p>",
  "<p>In 2013, two buddies from the Adelaide Hills, remote area nurse Aidan Glasby and website builder Daryl Clarke, bought two second-hand ultralight aircraft, and flew them 4,000km north to Broome in Western Australia over eight weeks, fundraising for charities. </p> <p>Conflict was inevitable: the pair had learned to fly the fragile aircraft only a week before their adventure, eschewing flight plans, emergency beacons or satellite phones. Glasby pushed boundaries, keen to fly on even in dodgy winds; Clarke was more chilled, prioritising cigarettes and coffee and taking in each location.

Not to mention Karpany\u2019s tiny dog, Mylo, which Karpany jokingly passes off as a miniature dingo.</p> <p>It soon becomes clear that the white men\u2019s adventure in Motorkite Dreaming is a Trojan horse for engaging a non-Indigenous documentary audience with Indigenous cultures, as the group immerses itself in remote communities along the flight path, representing 20 different language groups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/13/its-no-samson-and-delilah-stephen-page-on-the-film-adaptation-of-spear\">'It's no Samson and Delilah': Stephen Page on the film adaptation of Spear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsie Clarke, as the one person in the documentary who had never been to a remote Indigenous community, overcame fears she would find the experience confronting. </p> <p>\u201cI was really quite nervous because I was aware of being culturally sensitive but didn\u2019t quite know what to expect,\u201d she says. \u201cI connected with a lot of the ways Aboriginal people live out there, being very close with their family, and their appreciation and connection with the land.\u201d</p> <p>On the far edge of the Simpson Desert, Kokatha man Ramath Thomas speaks of the rainbow serpent, firesticks and western desert law.

He even doesn\u2019t resent being knocked down by Erislandy Savon, a Cuban heavyweight in the fine tradition and a nephew of the great Felix. On Monday night Okolie went over again, having been stopped in a round by Savon before the tournament, but got up and gave a decent account of himself to go the distance.<br></p> <p><br>\u201cIt was good and bad,\u201d he said, as a psychology student might. \u201cBad because I didn\u2019t get the decision, good because I\u2019ve progressed since our last fight. This time I went the three rounds. The knockdown took a lot of the momentum that I was trying to build.\u201d<br>His seemingly modest effort has to be put in context: Savon has had more than 250 amateur bouts; Okolie has now had 26 - and he would fight the Cuban again tomorrow if he could. He reckons he could be among the top four amateur heavyweights in the world, and says he is learning new tricks in every fight. Good place to learn them: at the Olympics against a Cuban.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking knowing there\u2019s someone better than me out there but it can\u2019t stay that way much longer.\u201d<br><br>Okolie said he took a call before the fight from the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, who took a close decision against Savon in London four years ago. \u201cHe told me to just relax,\u201d Okolie said. But not to the point of going on the canvas, he might have added.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a91c2ee4b0f5d064841a40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T23:56:33.400Z\">12.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And that\u2019s game, set and match for Serena Williams</strong> as she beats Alize Cornet in two sets (7-6, 6-2.)

It was always a tough draw, with the Frenchwoman ranked world No3 to Davis\u2019s 12, but the 23-year-old from London was determined to dwell on the positives, even in defeat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the strongest I\u2019ve ever been. I came prepared today and you can have a hard draw and that\u2019s just judo. You get beaten on the day, that\u2019s just the way it is. You\u2019ve got to come back stronger, fitter. I 100% believe my day will come. I know I will be world champion, European champion and hopefully Olympic champion one day,\u201d she said. Tokyo 2020 will be her time, she vowed.</p> <p>She said she was mentally stronger than any of her opponents, largely because of her background. She was brought up by a single mother on a west London council estate and said the hard knocks toughened her up:</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have everything as a kid growing up. I didn\u2019t have a lot of materialistic things. My mum didn\u2019t have a lot of money. So dealing with those things, and my mum had quite a tough upbringing in life, she came over here from Jamaica with me to give us a better life. She always taught me not to take things for granted and anything you do get in life you\u2019ve got to work hard for. I think that\u2019s where my mental strength and toughness comes from, my mum being a single mum and how hard she struggled. I knew that I would have to put the work in in life to make something of myself and not be poor. So it really comes from that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada8a8d1254c66fa49117500b04b6d022628d8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada8a8d1254c66fa49117500b04b6d022628d8ed/0_0_3500_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The women\u2019s sabre individual quarter-finals continues at the Carioca Arena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"571\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The women\u2019s sabre individual quarter-finals continues at the Carioca Arena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T16:20:58.265Z\">at 5.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ade0e4b03b51a99e120c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T16:07:05.322Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paul Drinkhall is in table tennis action now against Andrej Gacina of Croatia in round four</strong>.

A year-long Global Witness <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/myanmarjade/\">investigation published last year</a> found that multiple jade companies were linked to former dictator Than Shwe, high-ranking ministers in the army and former junta, and US-wanted narcotics kingpin Wei Hsueh Kang. </p> <p>Official production of the jade sector was estimated by Global Witness to be worth $31bn (\u00a323.5bn) in 2014, equivalent to nearly<a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/myanmar/gdp\"> half of Myanmar\u2019s GDP</a>, yet Kachin state \u2013 the world\u2019s largest jade producer \u2013 is racked by abject poverty, displacement due to civil war and drug addiction.</p> <p>According to Global Witness, most of Myanmar\u2019s jade is exported or smuggled to China, which borders Kachin state.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-wins-myanmar-landmark-election\">which came to power after a sweeping victory in elections last November</a>, is Myanmar\u2019s first civilian ruling authority since 1962.

After nearly 20 years of peace between rebels and the government,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/27/burmese-take-kachin-outpost\"> civil war resumed in 2011</a>, in part fuelled by unequal distribution of jade profits. An estimated 100,000 people have been displaced as a result of the fighting. </p> <p>Cleaning up the industry will be complicated, but not impossible, say campaigners. Both the Burmese army and the rebel Kachin Independence Army use jade mining to finance their activities (and the conflict). </p> <p>\u201cFor some of the armed ethnic organisations, jade is an important source of income, as they provide services in areas not under government control, such as health services, education, or supporting IDPs displaced by the Tatmadaw [the Myanmar army],\u201d said Mark Farmaner, director of Burma Campaign UK. \u201cSuspension of all licences could be perceived by some armed ethnic organisations as pressure on them to agree to a ceasefire at a time when Aung San Suu Kyi is trying to prioritise the peace process and finally bring about some change. It needs to be clear that they are doing this to clean up the industry, not for any other political motives \u2013 to push them into agreements they might not want to agree to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90f706d977abbce45aa925f6384ccf5795c99911\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90f706d977abbce45aa925f6384ccf5795c99911/0_140_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miners search for jade stones at a mine dump at a Hpakant mine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miners search for jade stones at a mine dump at a Hpakant mine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soe Zeya Tun/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later this month, Aung San Suu Kyi will hold another Panglong Conference to persuade 20 armed rebel groups from around the country, including the Kachin, to sign a peace treaty.

Alternatively, students may bring in iPads they already own. Hardship funds are available and children who receive free school meals get at least a 46% discount, while siblings get at least a 33% discount.</p> <p>The school\u2019s director of finance, Simon Bryan-Smith, says it subsidises every iPad bought via the scheme. \u201cIt would be fantastic not to have to ask parents to contribute, but we have to work within a budget and school budgets are continually being hit,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Even after parental contributions, Bryan-Smith estimates that the cost of the school\u2019s subsidies and discounts \u2013 along with other costs, such as providing iPads for teachers \u2013 means it spends about \u00a345,000 a year on iPads. He argues that schools that run iPad learning schemes should be given a larger IT budget. \u201cAt the moment, if parents don\u2019t contribute, we can\u2019t run the scheme.\u201d</p> <p>Other schools agree. \u201cWe do not receive any government funding for \u2026 this, so we need to ask parents to \u2026 make a contribution towards the running costs,\u201d Heathfield community college in East Sussex states <a href=\"http://www.heathfieldcc.co.uk/?page_id=415965#q3\" title=\"\">on its website</a>, adding that the school had committed significant funds to the scheme. \u201cA new wireless network has been installed, online resources have been purchased or subscribed to, staff continue to undergo a full training programme. Heathfield is also committed to significantly subsidising the cost of the scheme year on year [but] we can only run this scheme if parents are prepared to contribute.\u201d</p> <p>Conyers school in North Yorkshire <a href=\"http://www.conyers.org.uk/images/ipadsforlearning/New%20Parent%20Info%20Pack%20iPads.pdf\" title=\"\">states in its FAQs [pdf]</a>: \u201cEmbedding technology in the classroom, alongside traditional learning, has been shown to enhance learning. iPads provide an opportunity for students to really extend and enrich their learning. Unfortunately, as a school, we cannot afford to buy this technology for everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60aa5072493ebd529062bf536a4eee23f432ced2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60aa5072493ebd529062bf536a4eee23f432ced2/0_127_5642_3385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils with iPad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils at Ormskirk school using an iPads in their science lessons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of these schools, along with others whose policies we looked at in detail, offered financial assistance or even a&#xa0;free iPad to parents on low incomes. A&#xa0;small number also offered sibling discounts of between 25% and 100%.</p> <p>Although some schools will make exceptions, most parents will be expected to pay for their child\u2019s device. Schools will usually allow parents to pay in instalments, but will automatically include \u201cextras\u201d such as a case, extended warranty, insurance and apps in the price, which can push up costs.</p> <p>At one school, parents who do not qualify for a discount are asked to pay \u00a3785 in 36 monthly instalments for a fully insured 64GB iPad Air 2. The same device, bought upfront without extras, would cost \u00a3429 direct from Apple. Another school asks some parents to contribute \u00a3990 over five years (in this case, a fully insured 64GB iPad Air 2 will be replaced, free of charge, with a newer model after three years).</p> <p>Both schools \u2013 and many others \u2013 allow children to bring in their own devices. But, because of the cost and problems involved in supporting multi-platform teaching on different tablets, several of the schools we looked at specify these must be iPads, even if the child owns a cheaper Android tablet. Some of these schools, such as Hove Park school in Brighton, describe themselves as \u201cApple schools\u201d.</p> <p>If parents don\u2019t participate in an iPad scheme, all the schools we looked at would offer to loan a school iPad in lessons (but not, usually, at home) \u2013 if there are enough. However, most schools emphasise to parents that the school needs their financial contributions to support the scheme.</p> <p>\u201cAs a matter of national policy, we must question the practice of asking parents to pay for iPads,\u201d says Russell Hobby, general secretary of NAHT. \u201cNot every family will be able to afford it, but some may feel obligated to do so. Where technology is required in support of learning, the government should fund it properly rather than forcing schools into such a position.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"30f7829ee7a0bcb449788a4c1d9f62c4e239b813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30f7829ee7a0bcb449788a4c1d9f62c4e239b813/242_115_1084_1355/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Wood\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Wood</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Neal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alex Wood, senior assistant headteacher at Ormskirk school in Lancashire, said the reason his school wanted children to have iPads was primarily an educational one. \u201cWhen students have choice and control over how they work, can collaborate easily and receive good feedback, they are more likely to progress. With 1:1 iPad access, students can learn in ways that suit them, and our teachers can work more productively, providing increasingly personalised learning opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with a lack of government support, some schools are turning to the Learning Foundation, a charity that aims to inspire learning through technology, to ensure their iPad schemes are affordable for all parents. The charity is working with 50 state schools on schemes that ask parents to make voluntary contributions to the charity, which will then fund the purchase of mobile computing devices such as iPads for all the pupils in a year group. The \u201csuggested contribution\u201d is typically \u00a310 a month for three years, but there is no set minimum. No iPads will be purchased unless enough parents donate the funds to provide a device for each child in the year, regardless of how much that individual child\u2019s parent has contributed.</p> <p>However, the charity estimates that hundreds of other schools are working with more commercial organisations. Our investigation suggests parents of children at these schools are typically asked to pay set prices for iPads.</p> <p>On social media, parents across the country report feeling under pressure from schools. One mother, who would give her name only as \u201cHelen\u201d to prevent her son\u2019s school in the Midlands from identifying her, told the Guardian: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t really say no, could we? I&#xa0;wasn\u2019t going to allow my son to be the only one in the class who didn\u2019t have an iPad and had to borrow one.\u201d</p> <p>Even though she has four children, Helen\u2019s household income of \u00a340,000 meant she was not offered financial assistance, and had to spread her monthly iPad payments over three years to afford the device. She is now saving to buy iPads for her younger children outright when they start at the school. In total, the scheme will cost her more than \u00a31,400 at current prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"14eac560971c5392703b256e9d4e68c8cf385e66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14eac560971c5392703b256e9d4e68c8cf385e66/229_252_1993_2990/667.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Hobby\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Hobby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money and I\u2019d rather not have had to pay it, on principle.

It made me feel like I&#xa0;had to buy it.\u201d</p> <p>Children\u2019s charities criticised schools&#xa0;for adding to parents\u2019 financial pressures. \u201cIf iPads are now considered essential school equipment \u2013 in the same way as textbooks were for previous generations \u2013 schools should&#xa0;provide them,\u201d says Dame Hilary Blume, director of the Charities Advisory Trust.</p> <p>\u201cState education must be free for all&#xa0;children,\u201d says Jan Tallis, of School-Home Support, a charity helping disadvantaged children overcome educational barriers. \u201cWhile technology can offer wonderful educational opportunities, it can\u2019t come at the expense of parents who are unable to&#xa0;afford it.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Education refused to comment on the funding issues raised by the NAHT. However, it emphasised that schools cannot require a parent or pupil to pay for, or to have to supply, any equipment for the purposes of their education.</p> <p>\u201cSchools may ask parents for voluntary contributions for the cost of equipment, but they must be clear in making such requests that any contributions or purchases are voluntary, and that children will not be treated any differently according to whether or not their parent has paid,\u201d a spokesperson said.

  "<h2>Jenny Agutter, actor</h2> <p>I was still at ballet boarding school when I went to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/12/features.culture1\">Nic Roeg</a> about the role. His wife had seen me in a BBC drama and, after school one day, I met him in his flat, wearing my little grey skirt. It had been longer \u2013 but when you\u2019re at boarding school, your parents can\u2019t keep an eye on your uniform, so it was quite mini. Nic had it reproduced for the film.</p> <p>Shooting in Australia was extraordinary, though some people were terrified. They thought everything in the outback was trying to kill them, which it was, particularly the snakes. But I was never scared. There was a motel that had these draught-excluders on the bottom of its doors. I said: \u201cWhy in the world would you have draught-excluders? It\u2019s so hot at night, I just leave my door open.\u201d Someone said: \u201cThey\u2019re not draught-excluders. They\u2019re to keep the snakes out. They like to get into bed with you.

And I remember seeing these huge clouds of flying ants at one point. They were dropping to the ground because of the rain.</p> <p>Nic wanted the scene in which I swam naked to be straightforward. He wanted me to be uninhibited \u2013 which I wasn\u2019t. I was a very inhibited young woman. I didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable about the intention of the scene, but that doesn\u2019t make you feel any better. There was no one around, apart from Nic in the distance with his camera. No lights, nothing. Once he\u2019d got the shot, I got out of the water and dressed as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t think people were as obsessed with nudity back then as they are today. <br></p> <p>I remember having too much wine over dinner in Darwin and then filming hungover. The crew drank a lot. It was like travelling around with a bunch of circus people. I went back to school for a couple of months and was really dozy, not very together.

It turns off the suction and brush bar when it\u2019s driving too and from the base station, and also while it pauses and works out ways around objects.</p> <h2>Noise</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dd095aa9e5aac2286874477d1f762e3ed188e0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dd095aa9e5aac2286874477d1f762e3ed188e0d/0_0_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dyson 360 eye review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The robot is probably short enough to fit under an average bedstead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 360 Eye isn\u2019t the quietest of vacuums and is loud enough to prevent you hearing the television if it starts cleaning near you, but it is also at a more pleasant pitch than most others.

Once a month you have to wash the pre and post-motor filters, which are easy to detach - one at the back and one near the bin - run under a tap and let dry for 24 hours.</p> <p>The 0.33L bin is very easy to empty. Just press the release button on top, pull it out, lift the lid and shake into the bin. A 30 second job at most.</p> <p>Clearing obstructions from the brush bar is simple. It can be unscrewed and removed from the side, but I found I never actually needed to do that, even for shoe laces it had eaten.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a540459bf69b43d16141bc670c113a361b61121\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a540459bf69b43d16141bc670c113a361b61121/0_0_4410_2647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dyson 360 eye review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One cleaning run on a supposedly clean carpet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>If it loses connection to the internet, scheduling appears to be a bit hit and miss</li> <li>It can get stuck on small lips or objects quite easily if it is forced to turn on one</li> <li>The amount of dirt it pulled up from a supposedly clean carpet was quite horrifying</li> <li>The 360 Eye doesn\u2019t need to run as frequently as some others to maintain a perceivable level of clean</li> <li>It\u2019ll do 20 square metres of carpet with various bits of furniture and obstacles in under 30 minutes without needing a second charge</li> <li>It needs to be able to drive out about a metre or so from the dock to be able to start cleaning, which means it has to have a free path to a decent open space</li> <li>It isn\u2019t as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/24/irobot-roomba-880-review-robotic-vacuum-cleaner-thats-almost-a-pet\">adorable as other robot vacuums</a></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Dyson 360 Eye costs \u00a3800. For comparison, iRobot\u2019s Roomba 980 with visual navigation also costs \u00a3800, while bump-navigation robot vacuums start at around \u00a3150 and up.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Dyson 360 Eye is the best performing robot vacuum available. It\u2019s simply better at cleaning than all the others, but it also has its downsides. It can\u2019t get under as many things as a Roomba, it still bumps into thin things and it still can\u2019t clean everything, meaning it\u2019s not the only vacuum you need to own.</p> <p>Its smaller footprint makes a difference in its ability to get in and around table and chair legs, and it takes up less space when sat on its dock, which makes it a lot easier to live with in cramped flats and terraces.</p> <p>Robot vacuum cleaners are designed to vacuum everyday or at least several times a week, which means that out-and-out cleaning power doesn\u2019t matter as much. The regular cleaning never lets it get to particularly bad levels, and if you spill something you\u2019re more likely to get out a vacuum then and there and clear it up rather than leave it for the robot.</p> <p>You could therefore argue that a less capable robot could do the job just as well, but the 360 Eye also doesn\u2019t need to run as frequently as some others to maintain a perceivable level of clean, precisely because it gets more on its first sweep. It\u2019s also easy to transfer between floors to cover different areas on different days.</p> <p>It costs a lot, it isn\u2019t perfect and it certainly isn\u2019t a must-buy for everyone. But it is the best robot vacuum right now.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> fits in tighter gaps, cleans better on each run, makes a more pleasant noise, better edge cleaning, easy maintenance, good app, simple scheduling</p> <p><strong>Cons: </strong>can\u2019t get under as much furniture, expensive, cannot be your only vacuum, requires internet access for most features beyond push-button cleaning, can get stuck like all robot vacuums</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd3824bbb119e91cf403e36df9e58741a1d23ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3824bbb119e91cf403e36df9e58741a1d23ccd/0_0_4266_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dyson 360 eye review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dyson 360 has a smaller diameter than the Roomba 880 pictured here, but is taller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/24/irobot-roomba-880-review-robotic-vacuum-cleaner-thats-almost-a-pet\"><strong>iRobot Roomba 880 review: a robotic vacuum cleaner that\u2019s almost a pet</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/04/dyson-v8-review-absolute-animal-cordless-vacuum\"><strong>Dyson V8 Absolute review: finally a cordless alternative to an upright</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/05/tried-and-test-five-best-vacuum-cleaners-dyson\"><strong>Best vacuum cleaners?

  "<p>In the long history of the Games there can\u2019t have been many sadder silver medalists than Yulia Efimova. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the race, or that she finished second. She said herself that it was \u201cthe best I can do right now\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/efimova-and-sun-on-podium-as-king-delivers-victory-for-clean-sport\">Efimova and Sun on podium as King delivers 'victory for clean sport'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the fact that winning it meant she finally had to talk to the press. And everything else she has been through too; the boos she has heard every night in the pool, and the blunt opinions expressed by her fellow competitors. </p> <p>Not least the one who beat her, the USA\u2019s Lilly King, who said over and again that Efimova shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to swim here, and refused to congratulate her after the race was over, because Efimova had twice failed drugs tests. </p> <p>And here\u2019s the thing: King was right to take that stand. Too few in her sport do, least of all the men and women who run it.</p> <p>Efimova said she was happy, but didn\u2019t seem it. Speaking in faltering English, she said that she couldn\u2019t explain how she felt but that she would ask everyone to \u201cjust try to understand me, if you can.\u201d She felt she was being persecuted. </p> <p>She has been living in the USA for four years, she said, and was only in Russia for \u201cmaybe one month a year\u201d. She insisted she had nothing to do with, and knew nothing about, the Russian state-sponsored doping program which was exposed in the McLaren report, and that she was being unfairly persecuted for political reasons. </p> <p>\u201cIn the Olympic Games, usually all wars stop, but now they can\u2019t find a way to beat Russia and now they try to make use of athletes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would really like to encourage my fellow athletes to understand my problems,\u201d Efimova said, \u201cand not let politics into it,\u201d Efimova said. \u201cIt is very upsetting that some athletes don\u2019t believe that. They watch television, they read newspapers, they have no idea of the facts.\u201d </p> <p>Efimova failed her first drugs test in 2013 when she tested positive for the steroid 7-keto-DHEA. She said then that it was a hidden ingredient in a supplement she was using. Last night admitted that was a lie, and that she had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/michael-phelps-cupping-russian-tv-meldonium-rio-2016\">Russian TV likens Michael Phelps cupping therapy to meldonium</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then she failed again this winter, for meldonium. This, she says, was not her fault. She insists that she was only using meldonium before it was banned, but that it stayed in her system so long that subsequent tests still picked it up after she gave it up.</p> <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency might yet agree. After the positive test Efimova was temporarily suspended by F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (Fina), then reprieved after Wada decided that they needed more time to investigate how long meldonium stays in the body. Fina allowed her to compete while the decision is pending. </p> <p>Then she seemed to have been banned again when the IOC recommended that any Russian competitors who had served suspensions for doping violations should be withdrawn from these Olympics. But she was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who ruled that she shouldn\u2019t be punished twice for the same offence.</p> <p>As confusing as the situation is, it\u2019s still clearer than Fina\u2019s thinking. The Russian press reported that Fina actually wrote to CAS to support Efimova <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio-2016-279-russian-athletes-cleared-olga-zabelinskaya-yuliya-efimova\">in the very case she was bringing against them</a>. Fina declined to comment on that. </p> <p>They were, however, very keen to talk about Wada\u2019s McLaren report. So keen, in fact, that two days before it had even been released their President, Julio Maglione, put out a statement saying that the report lacked credibility and that he was worried there was \u201ca drive behind the scenes to get a global coalition of support\u201d to \u201ccall for the total ban on Russia\u201d. A little later, he added that he felt Wada had \u201cexceeded its powers\u201d.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t so long ago \u2013 a year and ten months to the week, if you like to be precise \u2013 that Maglione flew to Russia to personally present Vladimir Putin with something called <a href=\"http://www.russkiymir.ru/en/news/152560/\">the \u2018Fina Order\u2019</a>, which they award \u201cto a head of state or individuals of high dignity who have achieved remarkable merit in the world of aquatics\u201d. </p> <p>It was a thank you for his personal contribution to their sport. Putin\u2019s most notable contribution was that he had Russia host the lavish World Championships in Kazan last year. The very same World Championships, of course, which McLaren revealed had been systematically undermined by the Russia\u2019s sports ministry, security forces, and anti-doping agency. Which is what Efimova says she is now being punished for.</p> <p>Long before those Championships had even started, Fina\u2019s Executive Director Cornel Marculescu <a href=\"http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/john-leonard-calls-fina-executive-director-asking-updates-russia-doping-scandal\">was warned by the World Swimming Coaches Association</a> that \u201c[Rusada] are clearly complicit in the doping of Russian athletes\u201d and \u201cthat the legitimacy of the Fina world championships this summer is at great risk.\u201d</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t inside information. It was readily available in a German TV documentary that could be seen on YouTube. Marculescu\u2019s response was to promise \u201cthat we have excellent working relations with Rusada and we co-ordinate with them our doping control programme in Russia.\u201d Marculescu and Maglione both agreed that the Kazan Championships were the best there had ever been.</p> <p>No wonder that Jon Rudd, who coaches the former Olympic champion Ruta Meilutyte, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/04/poison-pool-swimming-scandal-trust-rio-2016-olympics-fina\">told the Guardian last month</a> that Fina have \u201clost their way\u201d, that their \u201ccredibility and respect could not be any lower\u201d. No wonder that the great Australia coach Bill Sweetenham thinks the doping problem is \u201cas bad as it has ever been\u201d. </p> <p>Because Efimova isn\u2019t the only one. Like Rudd said, she\u2019s just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d, a \u201ca representative of the system that doesn\u2019t work\u201d. </p> <p>Efimova may be a cheat, but they run the system that has let her compete. It is Fina\u2019s fault that there have been as many jeers as cheers in the Aquatic Stadium so far this week, so if you really want to know who to boo, it isn\u2019t her, but them.</p>",
  "<p>In the end, the most compelling drama took place in a press conference room in the bowels of the aquatics centre. At one end of the table sat the new Olympic breaststroke champion Lilly King from the United States. Further down sat her controversial Russian rival, the silver-medallist Yulia Efimova, keen to explain why people should have more sympathy over her previous 16-month ban for taking steroids. As a symbol of the fragile mood of the Games, the sport of swimming and global politics it was spot on.</p> <p>It rounded off an evening that, depending on your perspective, either summed up the hopelessly compromised modern Olympics or saved the IOC\u2019s bacon. When two swimmers previously banned for doping offences are garlanded on a podium in front of millions of TV viewers worldwide it is hardly a resounding win for athletic integrity. Yet, as King bluntly informed the world she had just achieved \u201ca victory for clean sport\u201d, it was equally possible to see her triumph as the moment the forces for good finally began their overdue fightback.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/olympic-swimming-yulia-efimova-fina-fallout\">Yulia Efimova met with boos, but it is Fina who deserve opprobrium | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It had not seemed likely to end that way when China\u2019s Sun Yang, another with a contentious doping record, stormed to 200m freestyle gold. Sun, who still maintains his positive test and three-month suspension this year was a result of taking heart muscle medication, was a spectacular winner of a thrilling race, battling back to defeat South Africa\u2019s Chad le Clos. So when Efimova, back in circulation having been suspended between 2013 and early 2015 after testing positive for a steroid hormone, looked to be edging an equally gripping women\u2019s 100m breaststroke contest, the worst-case scenario loomed. Had the Russian also won gold the last fig-leaf of the IOC\u2019s shredded dignity would have floated embarrassingly away. A number of people owe King, perhaps the steeliest 19-year-old on the planet, a vote of thanks.</p> <p>Her intervention, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/mack-horton-speaks-out-gold-medal-rio-2016\">along with Australia\u2019s Mack Horton at the weekend</a>, will certainly be seized upon by clean athletes and disenchanted spectators, who have been growing steadily more militant in Rio. With a tearful Efinova just yards away, King used her victory platform to twist the knife a little further, even hinting the American sprinter Justin Gatlin should not have been selected. \u201cShould people who have been caught for doping issues be on the team? No they shouldn\u2019t. There shouldn\u2019t be any bouncing back and forth. I stand by what I said yesterday but I have to respect the IOC\u2019s decision.\u201d</p> <p>Given the rancorous back story with Efinova \u2013 King mockingly raising her index finger to mimic the Russian\u2019s No1 gesture following her semi-final victory, while the defending Olympic champion Ruta Meilutyte tweeting her dismay at Fina\u2019s decision to allow Efinova to compete at the Games \u2013 it made for an unmissable race, a globally-broadcast morality play lasting just a shade over a minute.</p> <p>The loud boos that accompanied Efimova to her blocks further increased the sense of melodrama.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/09/rio-olympics-great-britain-miss-bronze-in-rugby-lilly-king-wins-and-brazil-take-first-gold-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q59z\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2641434\"            data-video-name=\"Great Britain miss bronze in rugby, Lilly King wins and Brazil take first gold \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a9793ae4b03b51a99e14ee\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/09/16080olympicsxx_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/09/16080olympicsxx_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/09/16080olympicsxx.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/09/rio-olympics-great-britain-miss-bronze-in-rugby-lilly-king-wins-and-brazil-take-first-gold-video-highlights\">Great Britain miss bronze in rugby, Lilly King wins and Brazil take first gold</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As it turned out it was King, brimming with determination in the last 25 metres, who came through in 1min 4.93 secs, a mere 57 hundreths of a second ahead of Efimova, with the Plymouth-based Meilutyte back in seventh. King could not have looked more thrilled, leaving Efimova to rail against inaccurate perceptions from her fellow competitors, the mixing of politics and sport, why her doping \u201cmistake\u201d should be forgiven and the \u201cunfair\u201d treatment of Russian athletes. \u201cThey have no idea of the facts. They can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like if they swapped places with me.\u201d</p> <p>It was hard to remember a more charged press conference, the inevitable consequence of athletes being left exposed to the weather-vane of public opinion by their governing bodies. An IOC spokesman was even forced to issue a plea to athletes \u201cto respect their fellow competitors\u201d following the particularly pointed weekend spat between Sun and Horton. Horton, having beat his Chinese rival into second place in the 400m freestyle, openly refererred to his rival as a drug cheat and has since been subjected to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/swimmer-mack-hortons-social-media-accounts-flooded-by-angry-chinese-fans\">torrent of social media abuse from the Far East</a>.</p> <p>As Sun skipped around the arena last night brandishing his national flag to polite applause, it was not hard to guess how this sequel was going down back in his homeland. Having served his ban \u2013 curiously it was not announced by the Chinese authorities until after it had elapsed \u2013 he clearly sees this as the beginning of a new chapter. \u201cWhat is past is past,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThe medal to me means I have to work even harder.\u201d The American bronze medallist Conor Dwyer described Sun as \u201cone of the greatest freestylers of all time\u201d, but added a caveat. \u201cWe just have to be more on top of cleaning up the sport. The people that do get caught I think should be punished harder. I think Sun is a good guy, a great competitor. But as far as drug testing goes I have no control of that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/lilly-king-ryan-murphy-swimming-gold-rio-2016\">Lilly King wins grudge-match gold and takes aim at US team-mate Justin Gatlin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fairness to Sun he did produce a rousing comeback,surging back over the second half of the race after Le Clos had gone out ominously fast. Having touched first in a time of 1min 44.65secs he sat on the lane markers punching the air with both arms and milking the applause of his country\u2019s supporters. The only hiccup came when he tried to toss them his swimming hat and flipped it back into the water behind him. Otherwise he looked an insanely happy and vindicated man.</p> <p>Michael Phelps, who produced the second fastest time in the 200m butterfly semi-finals, added his views, unsurprisingly backing up his team-mate King. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that today in sports in general, not just only swimming, there are people who are testing positive who are allowed back in the sport and multiple times. It breaks my heart and I wish somebody would do something about it.\u201d</p> <p>Phelps will bid for his 20th Olympic gold medal in the 200m butterfly final which is being billed as a rematch with Le Clos, who edged him out in London four years ago, but the Hungarian duo of Tamas Kenderesi and Laszlo Cseh are also very much in contention. \u201cShould be a fun race,\u201d Phelps said to which Le Clos countered, \u201c\u201cMay the best man win. I\u2019ll race my heart out. Of course there\u2019s a huge rivalry between Michael and myself. I race to win and I want to beat Michael.\u201d</p> <p>There was scant consolation for Britain\u2019s James Guy, who could not quite replicate the outstanding feat of his room-rate Adam Peaty and finishing an agonising fourth behind Sun. Starting in lane eight he delivered his best swim of the Games but ended up suffering the sixth fourth-place finish for a GB athlete at these Games so far.</p> <p>Hungary\u2019s Katinka Hosszu, in contrast, cannot stop winning, adding the 100m backstoke title to her gold in the 400m medley.

  "<h2><strong>Inside the Factory </strong><br>8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Brits get through more than two million tins of baked beans a day. This latest episode of Gregg Wallace and Cherry Healey\u2019s series \u2013 exploring the process by which industrially produced food reaches our plates \u2013 tracks the undeniably spectacular techniques involved. It feels a little basic at times (\u201cBeans begin life in a pod,\u201d explains Wallace at one point) but some neat history segments \u2013 including the class trajectory of canned food \u2013 raise the tone. An amiable enough watch. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>An Hour To Save Your Life</strong><br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Return of the series that illuminates what paramedics and doctors call \u201cthe golden hour\u201d \u2013 the 60 minutes immediately following a major trauma in which responders must make literal life and death decisions. This episode focuses, with an intimacy that can make for difficult viewing, on a moped rider hit by a lorry, a police officer suffering a heart attack in a gym, and a bicycle accident in a dauntingly remote location. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>The Job Interview </strong><br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>More hopefuls consent to having their job interview experience played out in front of a national audience. God help them. This week, car hire firm Planet Leasing, located in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, has a sales opening, with 52-year-old Mark and 40-year-old Tina vying for the post. Mark has applied for more than 800 jobs, while Tina is a cleaner hoping to make a career change. Meanwhile, in London, PR agency Whitehair Co, which specialises in fashion, is seeking a new press assistant. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>First Dates </strong><br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>After a celebrity spinoff that followed the likes of Scarlett from Gogglebox and Esther Rantzen on their searches for love, there\u2019s something comforting about returning to the original First Dates, where jittery strangers occasionally get a piece of spinach stuck in their teeth. As ever-optimistic ma\u00eetre d\u2019 Fred welcomes back the Jane and John Does of the dating world, among potential lovebirds on view are podiatrist Felicity and city boy Jethro, and pensioners Dee and Joe. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Borderline <br>10pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The comedy mockumentary series about security staff at Northend airport continues. Tonight, Chief Inspector Linda is distracted by her husband\u2019s recent career change, a Ukrainian lingerie entrepreneur is pulled in on a \u201crandom\u201d check, while Andy\u2019s attempt to bond with a lively hen party reveals her fun side, sort of. A bit more signposting of forthcoming jokes than you might expect, perhaps, but the decent performances generally win out. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Wasted <br>10pm, E4 </h2> <p>With its bickering cast of self-sabotaging slackers framed by lickety-split editing and 8-bit sound effects, this West Country-set sitcom feels like a rural offshoot of Spaced, with the added attraction of Sean Bean sending up his Westeros hinterland as a grumpy spirit guide. As the gang\u2019s sleepy village of Neston Berry gears up for its annual Berry Man revels, D&amp;D doughboy Morpheus is unexpectedly tapped to be the star of the show. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Dice <br>10.10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Andrew Dice Clay first achieved fame as the most obnoxious of a new wave of non-PC standups in the 1980s. In this new, middling, vaguely Curb Your Enthusiasm-style sitcom, Clay is reimagined as an ageing comedian now on his financial uppers, saddled with a bad reputation but insisting he\u2019s not such a bad guy in \u201creality\u201d. In the first of this double bill, he is guest at a gay wedding; in the second he is shadowed by Adrien Brody, who wants to research him for a film role. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Chef </strong>(Jon Favreau, 2014) 9pm, Film4</p> <p>Jon Favreau takes time off from his Iron Man directing duties to serve up this light culinary tale, and as director, writer and star takes on most of the kitchen tasks himself. He plays chef Carl Casper, who, bored with dishing up the same-old for restaurant boss Dustin Hoffman, quits to start selling tacos from a Twitter-promoted truck, reconnecting with his son and attracting Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Vergara in the process. Enjoy! <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>Olympic choice</h2> <p>David Florence won gold in canoe slalom\u2019s C1 event at both the 2013 and 2015 world championships and, having celebrated his 34th birthday yesterday, today he could claim his first Olympic title (7.15pm, BBC1).

Now Ferrovial must either exit the camps, or become mired in material risk \u2013 including operational uncertainty, exposure to legal action and the devastation of its reputation \u2013 until October 2017. </p> <p> Ferrovial\u2019s financial stakeholders have also come under fire. A recent <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Association_with_Abuse.pdf\">report</a> released by the Human Rights Law Centre and GetUp\u2019s No Business in Abuse campaign reveals the global banks and corporate investors linked to the offshore camps through their relationship with Ferrovial, and calls on them to take immediate action to end the business relationships that associate them with gross human rights abuse. </p> <p> Already the Norwegian Central Bank, which holds a stake in Ferrovial, has acknowledged the potential for an ethical problem and referred the issue to Norway\u2019s Council on Ethics for an independent judgment. This response will sound a warning to Ferrovial\u2019s prospective successors: business in abuse will hurt you. </p> <p> Ferrovial\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/30/new-manus-and-nauru-operator-signals-plans-to-quit-detention-centre-business\">decision to walk away</a> ought to deter any company considering profiting from human suffering. The government\u2019s decision to unilaterally extend the offshore contract despite Ferrovial\u2019s clear indication that it does not want to continue its work in the camps certainly suggests that the market is not crowded with contractors eager to step into Ferrovial\u2019s shoes. </p> <p> Cracks are also appearing in the legal framework underpinning the arrangements. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">highest court in PNG recently ruled that the Manus centre is illegal</a> and PNG prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill has conceded it must end. It took retrospective legal changes and a last minute opening of the gates to fend off a similar <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/high-court-set-to-hear-challenge-to-offshore-detention-on-nauru-nauru-announces-transition-to-open-centre/\">legal challenge</a> we made to the detention facility on Nauru. </p> <p> The PNG supreme court is currently considering exactly how it will enforce its own orders. It has demanded answers from the Australian and PNG governments about resettlement plans for the 900 men still languishing in limbo. Our government will pretend that everything is fine but something has clearly got to give. PNG sovereignty, so often used as a shield by successive Australian governments to deflect criticism of the Manus camp, is poised to become the sword, striking a blow to the core of the current detention arrangements.</p> <p> Finally, slowly but surely, public opinion is shifting. During the recent <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/letthemstay/\">#LetThemStay</a> campaign we saw the faces of 37 babies born in Australia but facing deportation to Nauru. These kids have never set foot on a boat but are classified by our laws as if they arrived on one, meaning they face mandatory deportation to a tiny island. Also at risk were men violently beaten on Manus, women who had been sexually assaulted on Nauru and over 50 children, many of whom had been going to Australian schools and were beginning to rebuild their lives in our communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/detention-centre-operators-contract-extended-despite-owners-objection\">Detention centre operator's contract extended despite new owner's objection</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The response to their plight was phenomenal.

So the trajectory of public opinion is clear. People are realising that the status quo is unsustainable, cruel and fundamentally wrong. </p> <p> Pressure is clearly building. Rather than waiting for the current system to collapse the Turnbull government must look at innovative, humane policy alternatives. And they do exist \u2013 instead of using costly and cruel measures to close unsafe pathways, we could look at smart ways of opening up new ones. Measures which improve conditions in transit countries and re-allocate skilled migration places to skilled people who are also seeking asylum should be considered. </p> <p> The Manus and Nauru camps are dead ends, not long-term solutions. Built on a foundation of deliberate cruelty and cynical political expediency, they have always been destined to fail.</p> <p><em>Daniel Webb will be taking part in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-australia/2016/jul/13/guardian-workshop-can-we-solve-the-asylum-seeker-crisis\">Guardian workshop, Can we solve the asylum seeker crisis</a>, at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas at the Sydney Opera House on 3 September 2016. </em></p>",

But not in a flattering way.</p> <p>If last week came the point at which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-week-campaign-turning-point-2016-election\">self-immolated the campaign</a> and beloved Trump brand, this week may be remembered as the time he finally drove his party\u2019s national security leadership to support the Democratic candidate for president en masse, either by voting for her expressly or by abstaining.</p> <p>National security is an issue that Republican presidential candidates have historically been able to dominate but Trump may be the first guy in recent history to blow that for the party. Even more remarkable is that top neoconservatives in the party are all taking the Democrat\u2019s side: Clinton has said Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button\u201d of our nuclear arsenal. It looks like even Republican top brass agrees.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/politics/republican-national-security-letter-donald-trump-election-2016/\">a long list of GOP national security hands wrote a letter</a> saying Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history\u201d and that electing him in November would but the nation\u2019s security at risk. Some of the 50 signatories said they\u2019d vote for Clinton while others deemed it better to abstain from voting entirely. But all were in fundamental agreement on one main point: \u201cTrump is not qualified and would be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>This comes after Evan McMullin, a former CIA official who recently worked for the House Republican conference, filed papers to run for president as an independent candidate. He doesn\u2019t support Clinton, and having missed the ballot-access deadlines in most states, the move is expected to have little effect on the race other than to help the former secretary of state by cutting into Trump\u2019s margins. But that\u2019s just fine with McMullin, who says, \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to do the right thing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/trump-national-security-neocons-freaking-out-republicans\">Trump's national security nightmare: now even the neocons are freaking out | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ff0ee4b033cb0795e33f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alan-yuhas\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T21:53:05.854Z\">10.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fact-checking Donald Trump\u2019s speech on his economic plan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">outlined his economic vision for the US on Monday</a>, including plans to dramatically slash taxes.

It was the latest sign of traditional Republicans, usually a fractious group, striking at Trump while the nominee reels under signs of cratering poll numbers and self-inflicted political wounds.</p> <p>Many of the signatories have made their doubts known before. A March letter published at the online national-security salon<a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\"> War on The Rocks</a> sounded warnings on Trump\u2019s character, policies and fitness for office. It included many who signed the current letter, including George W Bush\u2019s homeland-security secretary Michael Chertoff; ex-Pentagon undersecretary for policy and ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman; Condoleezza Rice aide Philip Zelikow; John McCain advisers Richard Fontaine and Kori Schake; and former US ambassador to Iraq Robert Blackwill.</p> <p>But the previous letter was penned in the midst of the Republican primary, when several other candidates remained competitive in the race. For dozens of high-profile intelligence officials to rebuke their own party\u2019s nominee with the general election officially underway is yet another indication of the unprecedented nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>The new letter also arrives amid heightened concerns over Trump posture toward Russia -- the former reality TV star has lavished unusual praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, while his campaign manager Paul Manafort has been scrutinized for holding ties to Russian politicians. Former CIA acting director Michael Morrell, who endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this weekend, has insinuated that Putin is manipulating an unwitting Trump.</p> <p>Signing the new letter are former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, who has let his antipathy to Trump be highly public in recent months, and John Negroponte, a senior official in the Reagan, George HW Bush and Clinton administrations and George W Bush\u2019s first director of national intelligence. So did George W Bush\u2019s White House Iraq and Afghanistan adviser, Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, who is held in high esteem amongst congressional Republican internationalists.</p> <p>The new letter also contains harsher language than the old. While the March letter compared Trump to a \u201cracketeer,\u201d the new one flatly says Trump \u201clacks the temperament to be President.\u201d It also calls into question his fitness to wield \u201ccommand of the US nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnlike previous Presidents who had limited experience in foreign affairs, Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHe continues to display an alarming ignorance of basic facts of contemporary international politics.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has also sought to cast a spotlight on Trump\u2019s competence to be commander-in-chief as voters grow increasingly alarmed over national security. The Democratic National Convention featured a cadre of generals, admirals and former officials from Republican administrations making the case against Trump in primetime, honing in on his erratic behavior and wayward statements on US foreign policy.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign also released a video stringing together clips of both national security officials and former Republican presidential candidates, from Mitt Romney to Marco Rubio, stating that Trump was fundamentally unqualified to be president and should not have access to the nuclear codes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ed45e4b0f5d06484198a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T20:36:39.628Z\">9.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>Donald Trump sought to regain momentum with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">an economic speech</a> in which he floated new tax breaks and cuts to regulation, as protesters repeatedly interrupted him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q3zq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640383\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump outlines his economic plan \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8d83ee4b0f5d064841920\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808economy_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\">Donald Trump outlines his economic plan</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He told the Detroit Economic Club, a traditional venue for political candidates to discuss their economic vision, that his plan would include imposing a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations, and reducing rates for income and corporate taxes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8dbd7e4b03b51a99e12f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/amber-jamieson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T20:21:09.058Z\">9.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Currently the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=mobilebar&amp;v=1#now\">New York Time\u2019s Fiverthirtyeight blog</a> has Clinton\u2019s odds of winning the election - if it was held today - at 94%.

  "<p>A veteran, award-winning television producer has joined more than 20 women in accusing former Fox chief Roger Ailes of sexual harassment, saying that early in her career he proposed a \u201csexual alliance\u201d with her.</p> <p>In a long, first-person account published Monday <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/08/roger-ailes-sexually-harassed-me-i-thought-i-was-the-first-and-last.html?via=newsletter&amp;source=DDAfternoon\">in the Daily Beast</a>, Shelley Ross recounts how she got a job at NBC in 1981, not long after the network had hired Ailes from his political consulting firm. That year Ross met with Ailes to discuss a job on NBC\u2019s The Tomorrow Show, a late-night talk show, at a time when she was struggling to find work.</p> <p>At a lunch meeting, Ross wrote, Ailes asked: \u201cWhen did you first discover you were sexy?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/22/roger-ailes-fox-news-sexual-assault-allegations\">How one lawsuit unleashed a cascade of allegations against Roger Ailes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ross looked down \u2013 \u201cmy head suddenly dropped like a marionette\u201d \u2013 and replied: \u201cI am finding this conversation very embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p>According to Ross, Ailes persisted and explained that \u201che believed the best expression of that loyalty comes in the form of a \u2018sexual alliance\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis was not a romantic or flirtatious conversation,\u201d Ross recalled. \u201c\u2018Predatory\u2019 is not quite accurate either. Roger expressed a true philosophical conviction that this would be mutually beneficial for us both, that he was looking for a partnership and it was somewhat special that he had chosen me. So perhaps \u2018cultish\u2019 needs to be in the mix.\u201d</p> <p>Ross continued to reject Ailes\u2019s advances, she wrote, but her diplomatic responses did not deter him. \u201cAt some point [he] suggested I hold off with business affairs,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cThis unnerved me greatly. Why couldn\u2019t I deflect this? I took a Valium and crumpled under the covers.\u201d</p> <p>Ross said she called her lawyer, who called her own boss \u2013 the former attorney for NBC host Johnny Carson. Network lawyers joined the conversation, Ross said, and they all called Ailes. The next day Ross flew to New York, and Ailes apologized profusely.</p> <p>\u201cPlease forgive me, forgive me, this must be middle-age craziness,\u201d he said, according to Ross. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I did, how I spoke to you.

The network\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, has hired a law firm to investigate the allegations against Ailes and of a broader culture of harassment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-fox-news-ideology-conservative-baby-boomers\">How Roger Ailes disgraced Fox News and tarnished a unique legacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ailes has denied Carlson and Luhn\u2019s allegations through his attorney, Susan Estrich, who called Carlson\u2019s claims \u201ca retaliatory suit for the network\u2019s decision not to renew her contract, which was due to the fact that her disappointingly low ratings were dragging down the afternoon lineup\u201d.</p> <p>Estrich added of Luhn:\u201cBased on her statements, it is disturbing that she is the subject of one reporter\u2019s journalistic exploitation.\u201d</p> <p>Also on Monday, Fox host Andrea Tantaros <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/andrea-tantaros-made-harassment-claims-against-roger-ailes.html\">told New York magazine</a> that she had filed complaints dating back to 2014 about Ailes\u2019s sexual advances, saying that he had asked her to \u201ctwirl\u201d and that she would \u201creally look good in a bikini\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe made multiple harassment and hostile-workplace complaints,\u201d her attorney Judd Burstein told the magazine, adding that he believes the network\u2019s actions were \u201cretaliatory\u201d. Lawyers for the company have said that Tantaros violated contract agreements by declining to let Fox vet a book she published this year.</p> <p>Estrich responded with a statement to the claims, saying: \u201cAndrea Tantaros is a talented political commentator whose absence from Fox recently had absolutely nothing to do with Mr Ailes. He is bewildered by her accusation and strongly denies it.\u201d</p> <p>Tantaros remains employed by Fox, where Burstein has said the owners, Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan, \u201chave made it clear they want to clean up the place\u201d.</p> <p>Tantaros says she was demoted and taken off the air after making the complaints.<br></p> <p>Ross and Ailes worked together on The Tomorrow Show, and then stayed in contact after they left for jobs at other networks: Ailes eventually made his way to Fox News, Ross to 17 years at ABC News. In her account, Ross insisted that Ailes \u201ccannot be painted with one simple brushstroke\u201d despite the graphic accounts of harassment and abuse that have emerged in the past few months.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The powerful Fox boss encouraged Ross in her professional life, she said, and told her he recommended her to run CNN. He also sent a gift on learning Ross had been diagnosed with cancer, though they had not worked together for three decades. \u201cIt is difficult to reconcile the two Rogers,\u201d Ross wrote. She added that she believed herself to be the last woman Ailes harassed.</p> <p>Ross also described pervasive sexual harassment at other media companies, recalling that coworkers once gave her \u201ca birthday cake with a penis on top\u201d, and saying: \u201cMuch of the time, harassment has too many faces to even recognize when it is happening. Whisper campaigns, false accusations, holding women executives to impossible standards not expected of men.</p> <p>\u201cNo one has yet nailed the pervasiveness, the bigotry, the diminishing and oppression of over half the population in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted Ailes\u2019 legal team for comment on the new allegations.</p>",
  "<p>In 2014, Johnny Slager was trying to come off methadone. He recognised that he was struggling to care for his 22-month-old son Braxton and had contacted child protection services for help.</p> <p>Despite reservations about putting his son into foster care (he had suggested alternative accommodation with family), Slager signed the temporary care form, assigning care of his son to an accredited, non-government organisation for three months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/08/rio-olympics-2016-day-three-adam-peaty-gold-michael-phelps-tom-daley-live\">Rio Olympics: Serena Williams wins,  USA hoops beat Venezuela \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Three weeks later <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4240283.htm\">Braxton was dead</a>. He had drowned in the backyard pool of the western Sydney foster home in which he had been placed. The photographs from the scene show a slimy green pool and a backyard littered with debris, and a pool gate that did not self-lock.</p> <p>The police report was damning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... the pool fence did not comply with legislative standards as it was not a self-latching gate ... the premises were not safe or secure for young children placed under foster care. There were also excessive amounts of alcohol ... and blister packs with medication left throughout the location and within reach of the children.</p> </blockquote> <p>How was this environment deemed suitable for the care of a vulnerable child? </p> <p>Since 2012, more than 7,500 children have been transferred from the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services to the care of NGO out-of-home care providers, which represents approximately 56.2% of all children in out-of-home care.</p> <p>Despite the significant number of children receiving care by NGO providers, there is no measurable way to assess the adequacy of care being provided, or outcomes to be achieved with respect to the welfare and wellbeing of children.</p> <p>The department must have a role in monitoring the number of caseworkers providing care in the NGO sector, the nature of the care being provided, and an assessable measurement of welfare goals to meet the complex needs of a child.</p> <p>One of the primary roles of government is to take care of those children whose parents are unable or unwilling to care for them. The government cannot absolve itself of responsibility from providing oversight into the operations of NGO foster care providers, because the community counts on the government to step in where no one else can. With increased scrutiny, the department, alongside the NGO providers, can work hand in hand to deliver better outcomes.</p> <p>A government must be held to account where it fails in its duty of care to those children. And we must leave no stone unturned in our efforts to improve the care and protection of children.</p> <p>The 2016/17 NSW budget papers reveal that 100 child protection jobs are forecast to be cut over the next 12 months, including 56 staff involved in the assessment of children at risk of serious harm and 35 staff supporting children in foster care.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the recently announced <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/nsw-government-does-not-add-up-child-abuse-reports-20160614-gpj6jg.html\">NSW inquiry into child protection</a>, to examine the amount and allocation of resources in the sector, is so important.</p> <p>There are too many instances where children in care have slipped through the cracks. We cannot tolerate a system where the cascade of mistakes that allowed Braxton to wander into a murky pool and drown can be repeated.</p> <p>But repeated attempts to access statistics and information under the Government Information Public Access Act are denied, met with the Baird government\u2019s usual secrecy.</p> <p>Much vaunted attempts to increase transparency and accountability in child protection outcomes, trumpeted by a succession of ministers in the family and community services portfolio, have come to nought. Under this government, things are only getting more opaque.</p> <p>When the caseworker dashboard was established in 2013, just 28% of all children at risk of significant harm received a face-to-face assessment by a caseworker. Not only has that number remained stagnant for three years, a majority of children in out-of-home care are no longer included in those quarterly statistics because the dashboard does not cover children in the NGO sector.</p> <p>Children in NSW deserve better than mere bureaucratic sleight of hand.</p> <p>And just as horrifying is the fact that the NSW government has admitted <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/nsw-government-does-not-add-up-child-abuse-reports-20160614-gpj6jg.html\">it does not know how many reports of sexual abuse against children in state care</a> it receives. Compiling totals of alleged abuse incidents was deemed not a \u201creasonable\u201d use of resources.</p> <p>How can the government determine where resources are most needed if accurate statistics about abuse aren\u2019t readily available?</p> <p>And now we hear that <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/children-in-nsw-protection-sleeping-overnight-in-government-offices/news-story/a301e8654cedc9c68c0cec153d61be18\">at-risk children are being placed in motels, or even worse, sleeping on beanbags</a> in the corner of department offices. </p> <p>The parliamentary standing committee inquiry into child protection will hopefully shine a light into the full functions and activities of the Department of Family and Community Services, as well as the NGO providers they work with.</p> <p>It will scrutinise the ability of the government\u2019s systems and procedures to identify and investigate the risks facing children in the care of the minister, the systems by which we assess risk, and their overall adequacy and reliability.</p> <p>Perhaps most crucially, it will examine the adequacy of funding allocated to the department and NGOs for casework and the associated costs of caring for children in care.</p> <p>Despite a 20% increase in the number of children reported to the department as being at-risk of significant harm, incredibly the Baird government has cut funding for administrative staff in the department. The minister says it won\u2019t affect the jobs of frontline caseworkers. Yet these frontline staff speak of soaring workloads, as the day-to-day administrative tasks overwhelm caseworkers who would otherwise be working to protect children or reunite them with their families.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/handy-greyhound-facts-and-other-reasons-to-adopt-a-large-pointy-dog-today\">Handy greyhound facts and other reasons to adopt a large pointy dog today | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The inquiry will review the relationship between the department, the NGO providers, and the Office of the Children\u2019s Guardian, the organisation tasked with accrediting providers and carers through the working with children check.</p> <p>The inquiry will also examine the specific initiatives targeted at our at-risk Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The auditor general has identified the lack of services in rural and remote areas as an area of shortcoming. This inquiry will only reveal more about what can be done in this critical area, especially when it comes to increasing the percentage of children we place in kinship care.</p> <p>It has been almost eight years since the Wood special commission of inquiry shook up child protection in NSW. In the last five years, the situation in this portfolio has decreased markedly. </p> <p>It\u2019s high time we took another look at the way we care for at-risk children, because we can ill afford to it get wrong. </p> <p>Johnny Slager asked for help from the system. The system failed him. And most tragically, it failed Braxton.</p> <p><em>Tania Mihailuk is the NSW shadow minister for family and community services.</em></p>",

Spain wasted its players time and efforts, Spain wasted the officials time, they STOLE the audiences money, they wasted the USA\u2019s time, and they cheated the t.v. viewers as well. And let me remind you that Team USA left Candace Parker at home. And as a USA Basketball fan, that was a BIG mistake. But imagine, we left at home a BETTER player than ANY OTHER National has at HOME or at Rio.And let me also remind you that the USA U17 boys team beat Turkey by exactly 40 points in the Final in Zaragoza Spain for the FIBA U17 World Title. That was our FOURTH CONSECUTIVE FIBA U17 World Title.

This squad in particular could be the best collection of women\u2019s basketball players ever assembled (and it\u2019s only competition would be previous US teams).<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8fb0ee4b0f5d0648419bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T21:41:45.207Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Predictions</strong></p> <p>Normally here I would include predictions about which team will win.

The contest was a rematch of the 2014 world championship gold medal game that the Americans won by 13.

Once again first-time Olympian Delle Donne was in the middle of it. She had seven points, including a three-pointer from the wing that made it 27-11 during the game-changing spurt. The Spaniards couldn\u2019t get within single digits the rest of the way. The US women were nowhere as crisp as they were in the opening rout of Senegal, and Spain had a lot to do with that.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div>"
