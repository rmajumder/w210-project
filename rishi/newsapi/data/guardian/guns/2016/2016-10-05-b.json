  "<p>There\u2019s an old adage in politics: never waste a crisis. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/28/south-australia-braces-for-storm-that-could-be-most-severe-in-50-years\">severe storms caused a power blackout</a> across South Australia last week, the Turnbull government bent mother nature to its will.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another adage that Malcolm Turnbull and his energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, should remember: don\u2019t win the battle only to lose the war. </p> <p>Last week Frydenberg showed what a shrewd politician he is. He won lots of battles. First, after the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, blamed renewable energy for causing the blackout, Frydenberg appeared sensible as he assured Australians that he knew it really was the 80,000 lightning strikes and 140km/h winds that caused the power to go out. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/05/wicked-windfarms-and-how-to-separate-the-facts-of-the-blackout-from-the-storm-of-spin\">'Wicked' windfarms and how to separate the facts of the blackout from the storm of spin | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Frydenberg then <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4547631.htm\">massaged</a> Joyce\u2019s unfounded renewable energy alarmism into an acceptable message about the challenges renewable energy might pose. </p> <p>\u201cThere are real challenges and the priority for us as a Coalition government is energy security. You see, it\u2019s OK to have more renewables, to reduce emissions, to meet our international targets but if people\u2019s homes go dark, if businesses get shut down, if there\u2019s huge economic loss and there\u2019s a threat to safety.\u201d</p> <p>And who poses this \u201cthreat to safety\u201d and the economy, according to Frydenberg? <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate/bill-shortens-crazy-ret-plan-to-cost-50bn-josh-frydenberg/news-story/fee56396b8ce4b5b1846fd0449d9b252\">State governments</a> that have set higher renewable energy targets than the federal government. Specifically, Labor state governments. And, for good measure, Frydenberg also fingered the federal Labor opposition\u2019s 50% renewable energy target by 2030 for blame.</p> <p>Then Frydenberg distracted everyone\u2019s attention by creating a \u201cproblem\u201d to be solved. All the energy minister had to do shift the nation\u2019s focus is suggest that renewable energy targets across the nation should be \u201c<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/renewable-targets-'bring-challenges'-to-stability/7887280\">harmonised</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Frydenberg didn\u2019t have to explain why a different target in different jurisdictions is a problem. He didn\u2019t have to explain why he\u2019s never raised that issue in a serious manner before. (Case in point \u2013 the Coag energy council last met on 19 August 2016. That meeting\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.scer.gov.au/sites/prod.energycouncil/files/publications/documents/Energy%20Council%20Communique%20-%2019%20August%202016%20-%20FINAL.pdf\">communique</a> made no mention of the need for a nationally harmonised renewable energy target.) </p> <p>The minister deployed a trick as old as the Australian federation. Never forget, consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. When a federal government has nothing else to say, it reaches for national harmonisation: it sounds so insightful and sensible and self-evident. It\u2019s not. </p> <p>There are lots of good reasons to avoid harmonisation for its own sake. It stifles innovation. It disregards local solutions for local conditions. It reduces capacity to respond to changing circumstances. It creates red tape. It often adds cost.</p> <p>Nonetheless federal governments usually win with propaganda on harmonisation (until it falls apart: think the VET Fee-Help scheme). On renewable target harmonisation, Frydenberg is winning so far. </p> <p>But \u2013 pardon the awful pun \u2013 storm clouds are gathering on the government\u2019s horizon. </p> <p>Frydenberg has made himself and the Turnbull government responsible for delivering solutions they will struggle to achieve.</p> <p>Start with Frydenberg\u2019s decision to convene a meeting of the Coag energy council this Friday to force the states and territories to discuss harmonising renewable energy targets and achieving energy security. </p> <p>Does anyone seriously think that state Labor governments are going to adopt the Turnbull government\u2019s lower renewable energy target of 23% by 2020? No chance.</p> <p>Even if Frydenberg redefines his harmonisation goal to getting the state and territories to slow down or stretch out their targets, he\u2019s still got a problem. </p> <p>The premiers and chief ministers won\u2019t agree to a compromise without the prime minister giving something away too, like increasing the federal government\u2019s target. Little chance Joyce and the anti-renewables brigade in the Coalition will applaud that. </p> <p>Second, \u201cenergy security\u201d appears to be Frydenberg\u2019s shorthand way of saying that Australia needs to ensure that its infrastructure \u2013 poles and wires and baseload supply in our national energy market \u2013 is sufficient to withstand major weather events. Sounds benign, doesn\u2019t it?</p> <p>For example, a second interconnector in South Australia might have kept the lights on in part of the state during last week\u2019s once-in-50-year storm. But at what cost? And who is going to pay for it? </p> <p>Remember that much of that infrastructure in SA and around the country now sits in private ownership \u2013 thank you, Liberal state governments.</p> <p>Either the Turnbull government stumps up the cash for these private sector companies (yeah, right) or it faces the wrath of voters when their electricity bills jump ever higher to pay for the upgrades the federal government requires. </p> <p>So much for Tony Abbott\u2019s efforts to save households all that money on their electricity bills by removing the carbon tax.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame\">South Australia's blackout explained (and no, renewables aren't to blame)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, it beggars belief that Frydenberg and Turnbull think the government\u2019s continued drop in the polls can be arrested by allowing Malcolm to look tough on renewable energy targets. </p> <p>Only six years ago, Turnbull was <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/energy-smart/how-to-be-fully-renewable-in-10-years-20100812-121l0.html\">predicting</a> Australia could be 100% reliable on renewable energy within a decade. A little over six days ago, he \u201csaved\u201d<br>the Australian Renewable Energy Agency from his own government\u2019s cuts. But now Turnbull says renewable energy is a threat to our economy and safety?</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s continued drop in the polls suggests voters are frustrated that the \u201creal Malcolm\u201d \u2013 who supported same-sex marriage, a republic and an emissions trading scheme \u2013 is not the prime minister. It\u2019s hard to see how giving voters another example of Turnbull\u2019s inauthenticity is going to help his \u2013 or his government\u2019s \u2013 standing. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the renewable energy battle is under way, and Josh Frydenberg is leading the charge. Add it to the list of battles the Turnbull government is fighting: business tax cuts, school funding, the ABCC legislation, the same-sex marriage plebiscite, media law reform, a childcare package, university deregulation, NDIS funding, Stuart Robert, the looming Myefo and the NBN, to name a few.</p> <p>In hindsight, maybe Turnbull and Frydenberg should have just let mother nature take the blame for what happened in South Australia, and moved on. This might have been one crisis worth wasting.</p>",
  "<p>Young people carrying knives who film the humiliation of their victims for social media could face more severe punishments under draft sentencing guidelines published for England and Wales on Thursday.</p> <p>Other \u201caggravating factors\u201d for judges and magistrates to take into account when considering defendants convicted of possessing a bladed article or offensive weapon in public include being in a group or gang. <br></p> <p>Those attempting to conceal their identity by wearing a hood or balaclava and anyone targeting the vulnerable or victims working in the public sector are also likely to receive tougher sentences.<br></p> <p>The new draft guidelines are published by the sentencing council in order to take into account changes in the law and recent court judgments. The latest proposals do not cover offences where a knife or other weapon is actually used to harm a victim, nor the use or possession of firearms. </p> <p>The aggravating factors for youth offenders include the proposal that \u201cdeliberate humiliation of victims, including but not limited to filming of the offence, deliberately committing the offence before a group of peers with the intent of causing additional distress or circulating details/photos/videos etc of the offence on social media or within peer groups\u201d. <br></p> <p>The council said it was included because it is \u201caware that through the use of social media, the recording and sharing of photographs and video footage has become increasingly common\u201d, adding: \u201cThis sort of behaviour is often used to embarrass or humiliate the victim.\u201d</p> <p>Such circumstances could also be taken into consideration in cases involving adults. <br></p> <p>Courts deal with large numbers of offensive weapon cases, the consultation document said, with approximately 7,800 adult offenders sentenced for the offences in 2015. <br></p> <p>Last year the government introduced a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/07/two-strikes-rule-jailing-carry-knives\">\u201ctwo strikes\u201d regime</a> meaning adults caught with a blade more than once face a minimum custodial sentence of six months. Courts should impose the minimum punishment unless there are particular circumstances that make doing so unjust.</p> <p>Figures released last month showed that nearly half of repeat offenders avoided jail in nearly a year after the change took effect. Overall, the proportion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/10/more-offenders-being-punished-for-carrying-knives-latest-figures-show\">knife possession offenders</a> sentenced to immediate custody is rising, while average prison terms have also gone up. <br></p> <p>The council said the introduction of the guidelines, which would cover England and Wales, may therefore lead to some increases in sentence levels \u2013 most likely in relation to adults convicted of possession offences. </p> <p>In cases involving youths, courts will be encouraged to look in greater detail at their age and maturity, background and circumstances. <br></p> <p>District judge Richard Williams, who is a member of the sentencing council member said: \u201cIf people carry knives, there is always the risk that they will be used, and with tragic consequences. <br></p> <p>\u201cAs the court of appeal has stated, too many people are carrying knives and it only takes a moment of anger or drunkenness for one to be pulled out with fatal results or serious injury. <br></p> <p>\u201cThrough these guidelines, we want to provide courts with comprehensive, up to date guidance to ensure that sentences reflect the seriousness of offending.\u201d</p>",

The singer had been charged in relation to allegations that she had tried to arrange a contact of hers to supply \u00a3800 worth of cocaine to Mahmood, who had posed as a movie producer promising a new career on the big screen.</p> <p>Contostavlos\u2019s trial collapsed after it emerged that Mahmood had tampered with evidence being used against her, leading to the controversial journalist being prosecuted.</p> <p>The self-styled \u201cking of the sting\u201d claims to have helped secure the convictions of 100 criminals over his 25-year career after his evidence was handed to police. But some trials that resulted from Mahmood\u2019s investigations collapsed, including one involving an alleged attempt to kidnap Victoria Beckham.</p> <p>The information police received in 2003 and 2005 came after an earlier police review had identified concerns about Mahmood. That review was conducted by Robert Quick, then senior officer in the Met\u2019s anti-corruption command, as part of an investigation of a private detective agency, Southern Investigations, which Mahmood and others at the News of the World used.</p> <p>One source with knowledge of the Met\u2019s internal workings said: \u201cThe Met continued to make use of his services \u2026 By 2005 they knew he was suspect but they were still involved with him.\u201d</p> <p>The fallout from Mahmood\u2019s conviction also threatened to engulf Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspapers in the UK and US in fresh litigation and demands for huge payouts. The solicitor Mark Lewis said he was acting for 20 people who say they were victims of Mahmood\u2019s suspect methods, in claims that could total \u00a3800m.</p> <p>Among those planning to sue, he said, were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/12/fake-sheikh-panorama-expose\">Emma Morgan, a page 3 model</a>, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/27/mazher-mahmood-thepeople\">John Alford, the former star of ITV\u2019s London\u2019s Burning</a>. Lewis has previously acted for clients suing Murdoch-owned tabloids over phone hacking.</p> <p>Alford has said in the past that his life was destroyed by Mahmood, who promised him a role in a Robert De Niro movie in exchange for drugs. The actor lost his \u00a3120,000-a-year job as a result and in 1999 was jailed for nine months.</p> <p>According to Los Angeles court papers, a US financier, John Bryan, who once dated Prince Andrew\u2019s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, is suing News UK\u2019s parent company, News Corp, for libel, invasion of privacy and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. He is claiming $50m (\u00a339m), which could triple to $150m under US law, which allows \u201ctreble damages\u201d where punitive compensation is awarded. \u201cThe vile conduct giving rise to this lawsuit includes a failed entrapment scheme, unlawful recordings and a malicious libel,\u201d says the 13-page document.</p> <p>Bryan\u2019s case has been brought in relation to a sting in which Mahmood\u2019s undercover team offered the American an investment opportunity in a casino and then allegedly tried to entrap him by \u201casking him to supply prostitutes and drugs\u201d. .</p> <p>Lewis says they will be suing for a multitude of alleged wrongs expected to include libel, reputational damage and loss of earnings. He is also examining whether there could be a basis for a claim of vicarious malicious prosecution against News UK. A malicious prosecution claim would involve accusations that, as Mahmood\u2019s employer, News UK facilitated the alleged entrapment and subsequent prosecution.</p> <p>After a two-week trial at the Old Bailey, a jury found Mahmood, 53, and his driver, Smith, 67, guilty of plotting to pervert the course of justice.</p> <p>When the case against Contostavlos collapsed, the former N-Dubz star branded Mahmood\u2019s investigation \u201chorrific and disgusting\u201d, telling reporters that she was \u201cnever involved in taking or dealing cocaine\u201d and had been entrapped by Mahmood, who had offered her a leading movie role alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/fall-of-the-fake-sheikh-how-the-tables-turned-on-mazher-mahmood\">Fall of the 'Fake Sheikh': how the tables were turned on Mazher Mahmood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey targeted me at a time when things were going badly for me and they had no mercy,\u201d she said last year after the Sun on Sunday claimed she had agreed to arrange the supply of cocaine because she thought it would help her land a role in a Bollywood blockbuster.</p> <p>\u201cMahmood got me and my team completely intoxicated and persuaded me to act the part of a bad rough ghetto girl. They recorded this and produced it as evidence when I thought it was an audition. It was a terrible thing to do.\u201d </p> <p>After the verdicts Ben Rose, Contostavlos\u2019s defence lawyer, said: \u201cThe real scandal in this case is that Mahmood was allowed to operate as a wholly unregulated police force, \u2018investigating\u2019 crimes without the safeguards [that] apply to the police.</p> <p>\u201cIt was obvious from the outset that Tulisa should never have had to go to court. If Mahmood\u2019s evidence had been properly stress-tested instead of accepted wholesale by the CPS, we are confident it would have come to the same conclusion.\u201d</p> <p>DC Jim Morrison, of Scotland Yard, said: \u201cThis case is a reminder that perverting the course of justice is a very serious offence that goes to heart of our justice system. We will always take action where statements or other evidence has been tampered with.\u201d</p> <p>A News UK spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed by the news that Mazher Mahmood has been convicted. We do not have further comment at this time.\u201d</p>",

The picture they paint is one of routine dysfunction and deliberate cruelty.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf women aren\u2019t being raped in these detention camps, if children aren\u2019t being abused and men aren\u2019t losing their minds on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca150253\">Nauru</a> and Manus, then why can\u2019t journalists and independent observers go into the camps to see what\u2019s going on?\u201d said Eva Orner, the Academy and Emmy award-winning Australian documentary-maker who made <a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=chasingasylum\">Chasing Asylum</a>.<br></p> <p>Orner calls her documentary \u201cthe film Australia doesn\u2019t want you to see\u201d. No journalist has ever been allowed to visit the two detention centres where intercepted refugees are taken. Both camps are far from Australia: one in Nauru, a small, impoverished Pacific island republic; the other in Papua New Guinea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">The Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The documentary\u2019s footage was clandestinely filmed during riots at the Manus and Nauru camps, which resulted in beatings and the death of Iranian asylum seeker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/10/man-accused-of-asylum-seeker-reza-baratis-recaptured-by-png-police\">Reza Berati</a>. The media is banned from both centres. In the middle of filming, the Australian government passed the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/27/immigration-detention-doctors-challenge-border-force-acts-secrecy-clause-in-court\">Australian Border Force Act</a>, which made it a crime, punishable by two years\u2019 imprisonment, for whistleblowers to speak publicly.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is it a crime with two years\u2019 imprisonment for employees to talk about what goes on there?

There are DVDs, an iTunes release and streaming releases coming up as well as an announcement in the coming weeks concerning further international releases. </p> <p>The documentary is to have its UK premiere this week with two screenings of the work at the London Film Festival. Orner is in talks with the United Nations for screenings in Geneva and New York. It will be screened at the New York University law school later this year.</p> <p>\u201cProjecting our film on the Australian high commission isn\u2019t just a stunt,\u201d said Orner. \u201cThis film has already been seen by thousands of people across Australia and will shortly be released far more widely and publicly, in a way that will mean it\u2019s seen by millions of people in every corner of the globe. I\u2019ll be able to announce the details over the next month but it\u2019s going to be a very widely watched film.</p> <p>\u201cBut despite us continuously asking the Australian government to comment on the claims made in our film about what\u2019s happening on Nauru and Manus islands, the only time our politicians will comment is when the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/opinion/australias-offshore-cruelty.html\">international media run the story</a>, specifically the Guardian, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03vkv44\">BBC</a> and the<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimescohen/status/735642573663023105\"> New York Times</a>. But even then, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimescohen/status/735643150979608578\">they refuse to engage properly</a>: they\u2019ve never answered the claims we make in the film.</p> <p>\u201cBy projecting our film on to the high commission building in the centre of London, I\u2019m hoping to goad Alexander Downer, the Australian high commissioner to the UK \u2013 who was an architect of the Pacific Solution and is a vocal supporter of them \u2013 to finally engage in a debate about what\u2019s going on in them,\u201d she said.</p> <p> Last month, a young Iranian refugee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/asylum-seekers-set-themselves-alight-nauru\">Omid Masoumali</a>, set himself alight on Nauru and died in a Brisbane hospital. Soon after, a 21-year-old Somali refugee, identified only as Hodan, set herself on fire and was taken in critical condition to Brisbane. </p> <p>\u201cI hope this film helps to educate and galvanise people to stand up and say this is unacceptable and to pressure the government to change its policies,\u201d said Orner.<br></p> <p><br> </p>",
  "<p>Observing the actions and utterings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tyson-fury\" title=\"\">Tyson Fury</a> this week has served as a reminder of just how complex the human mind is and how, for some, it can become too much to handle. There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/03/tyson-fury-retirement-boxing-twitter\" title=\"\">the retirement that never was on Monday</a> and then 24 hours later the publication of an interview with Rolling Stone in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/04/tyson-fury-cocaine-live-anymore-boxing\" title=\"\">Fury claimed he had taken \u201clots of\u201d cocaine</a> in order to deal with a bipolar disorder. If that was not disturbing enough, the 28-year-old openly spoke about being at \u201cthe brink of death\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see a way out,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live any more.\u201d</p> <p>Fury has become a figure of ridicule for some and loathing for others but, with his life and livelihood on the line \u2013 the British Boxing Board of Control confirmed on Wednesday it will discuss withdrawing his licence on 12 October in light of the Rolling Stone interview \u2013 a more sympathetic consensus is beginning to form round the man who 11 months ago shook the boxing world with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/28/tyson-fury-shocks-wladimir-klitschko-world-heavyweight-title-champion\" title=\"\">victory over Wladimir Klitschko in D\u00fcsseldorf</a>. A troubling figure for so long, it is increasingly clear he is troubled himself.</p> <p>Few have more sympathy for Fury than David Allen, a fellow British heavyweight who stepped away from the sport in August so he could deal with his depression. Allen sees some of the reactions to Fury\u2019s behaviour, this week and previously, as part of a lack of awareness in regards to mental health and, having got to know Fury, believes he has become a deeply misunderstood figure.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to mental health we\u2019re years behind where we should be,\u201d Allen says. \u201cPeople in this country either don\u2019t know enough about it or don\u2019t take it seriously enough and you can see that in the way the media in particular have questioned if Tyson has even got mental health issues. It\u2019s just not the type of thing a person would make up.</p> <p>\u201cTyson shares some of the behavioural patterns that depression has caused in me \u2013 being happy one second and down in the dumps the next \u2013 but, whereas I can deal with my problems in private, Tyson is the world heavyweight champion so can\u2019t escape the spotlight.</p> <p>\u201cI trained at the Fury gym in Bolton in the buildup to my fight against Larry Olubamiwo in June 2014 and have been back a few times since. Whenever I\u2019ve seen Tyson there he\u2019s been great to me. He\u2019s a really nice man, someone who\u2019s got time for everyone and who never says no to a fan who wants a photo or autograph. I can\u2019t say a bad word about him or the Fury family in general. They\u2019re lovely people.\u201d</p> <p>Allen had fought 11 times as a professional, winning nine times. He took Dillian Whyte the distance in his most recent contest in July and the plan was to kick on. But the 24-year-old, nicknamed \u201cWhite Rhino\u201d, has instead been inactive for the past three months following a relapse into his long-standing mental health problem.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve struggled with depression since I was 14-15 years old but for a long time, swept it under the carpet,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it got to a stage where I felt I had to get on top of it. I started seeing a counsellor in June 2015 and since then have been managing my problems. I\u2019m in a good place at the moment but I\u2019m aware a bad day, a bad week, is never far away. And when that moment comes I\u2019ll go see a counsellor again and talk things through \u2013 I feel comfortable doing that now.\u201d</p> <p>Allen, who also admits to having had issues with gambling, plans to return to the ring in November. \u201cI can\u2019t face the gym right now but boxing is what I do and financially I\u2019m not in a position where I can\u2019t fight. So I\u2019ll be back,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily the case with Tyson but I hope to see him in the ring again. For now, though, he needs to take some time off. While he does, I hope his critics leave him alone.\u201d</p> <p>As far as Paul Farmer, the chief executive of the mental health charity, Mind, is concerned, Fury\u2019s priority should be seeking as much help and support as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no contact with him but he\u2019s clearly going through a tough time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important he\u2019s been open about his mental health issues and not put them to one side. That\u2019s maybe helping people understand some of the behaviour he\u2019s exhibited recently.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people are in the public eye and speak about mental health it also helps others seek support \u2013 Mind consistently see a rise in people seeking help; it gives people permission to talk about it and help remove the stigma. That was certainly the case when Frank Bruno and Ricky Hatton spoke about their own problems. And the more we discuss mental health, the healthier society in general will become.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>This week, Demi Lovato announced that in 2017 she was taking a break, declaring that she\u2019s not cut out for the celebrity life and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/783376057349054464\">would rather do charity work</a> instead. </p> <p>\u201cSo excited for 2017,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/783375748103081984\">she tweeted</a>. \u201cTaking a break from music and the spotlight. I am not meant for this business and the media.\u201d</p> <p>Lovato seems to have been pondering a hiatus over the past few months. Back in June, <a href=\"http://people.com/celebrity/demi-lovato-quits-instagram-and-twitter-stays-on-snapchat/\">she quit Instagram and Snapchat for 24 hours</a> in the wake of her split with longtime partner Wilmer Valderrama. Her latest declaration comes in the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/gianfrancol2/demi-lovato-announces-hiatus-1g772?utm_term=.gjQ9zDpgXn#.fk3DPLRKXB\">wake of comments she made about Taylor Swift</a> \u2013 specifically that Bad Blood was antifeminist because it attacked Katy Perry, and because nobody in the video boasts a \u201cnormal\u201d body. (Cue: grimacing emoji face.) </p> <p>Understandably, her fans are more than a little rattled, but should the rest of us be surprised? Considering that most of us get a few years to figure our lives out, why shouldn\u2019t young stars bow out of the spotlight for a while?</p> <p>It\u2019s a question they themselves seem to be asking. Recently, Chloe Grace Moretz pulled out of The Little Mermaid and announced <a href=\"http://www.celebuzz.com/2016-09-14/chloe-grace-moretz-time-off-acting-movies-break-hiatus-picky/\">she intended to be \u201cpicky\u201d </a>with future roles. In February, Emma Watson revealed plans to spend a year free of acting projects, opting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/19/emma-watson-year-off-acting-to-focus-on-feminism\">brush up on feminism</a> instead. And last month, <a href=\"http://www.teenvogue.com/story/michael-b-jordan-selena-gomez-encouragement-mental-health-lupus\">Selena Gomez chose to put her mental and physical health first</a>, taking time off to deal with lupus and anxiety.</p> <p>Which, admittedly, is a lot different from Lovato\u2019s Swift-inspired flounce. But at the same time, Lovato\u2019s break indicates a shift in the cultural landscape. While previously the only reason to leave the spotlight was to study (like <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-be-at-Harvard-with-Natalie-Portman\">Natalie Portman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/james-franco-is-teaching-high-school-now\">James Franco</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-anna-chlumsky-veep-20140506-20140507-story.html\">Anna Chlumsky</a>) or abandon showbusiness altogether (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/18/macauley-culkin-no-i-was-not-pounding-six-grand-of-heroin-a-month\">Macaulay Culkin</a>), social media has given young actors and musicians a means of seizing control of their lives\u2019 narrative and dictating the terms of their own well-being. In short: we won\u2019t forget about them provided we can still see what they\u2019re up to, and because of this connection, they can get up to whatever they please.</p> <p>A \u201cbreak\u201d isn\u2019t the same as it was pre-Twitter or Instagram. When child stars of the 90s took time off to emerge as bankable adult actors (<a href=\"http://www.nickiswift.com/22030/real-reason-devon-sawa-disappeared-hollywood/\">Devon Sawa</a>, <a href=\"http://hellogiggles.com/joseph-gordon-levitt-left-hollywood/\">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a> and<a href=\"http://www.papermag.com/former-child-star-gaby-hoffmann-tiptoes-back-into-the-spotlight-1425637588.html\"> Gaby Hoffmann</a>), writers (<a href=\"http://marawilsonwritesstuff.com/\">Mara Wilson</a>), or to simply revel in normalcy (I miss you,<a href=\"http://www.aol.com/article/2016/02/16/remember-jonathan-taylor-thomas-from-all-of-our-90s-dreams-jtt/21313635/\"> Jonathan Taylor Thomas</a>), they just bowed it, and it was easy for us to focus less on their absence and more on the incoming crop of newly appointed it-stars. But now, to take time off tends to be accompanied by an announcement, therefore piquing our interest and garnering a response. That means it\u2019s only a break for as long as the artist chooses to be on one, and it\u2019s only news if they decide to make it so. </p> <p>Because lest we forget how little we saw of <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/harry-styles/news/11-things-we-know-about-harry-styles-dunkirk-movie\">Harry Styles when he was filming Dunkirk </a>(or before or immediately following). Or how Justin Bieber\u2019s life pre-Apology tour was marked not by his music or social media presence and far more by his tendency to act out. Also, Solange Knowles took four years between this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/02/solange-seat-at-the-table-observer-review\">A Seat at the Table</a> and 2012\u2019s True, and Frank Ocean also waited four years between Channel Orange and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/25/frank-ocean-blonde-review-a-baffling-and-brilliant-five-star-triumph\">Blonde</a>. And while none of the above announced a break for school or reprieve a la Watson and friends, their absences were noted and when they surfaced with new music, apologies or magazine spreads, we lapped their returns up happily.</p> <p>So announcing a break may seem to defeat the purpose of a break at all, but it actually also helps cultivate a world in which celebrity isn\u2019t the ultimate end game. (Not to mention inciting communication about one\u2019s goals, problems, trials and tribulations.) And while it may seem like young stars \u2013 and particularly young women \u2013 are succumbing to industry pressures, they\u2019re actually just putting the industry in perspective. Time off is sending the message that acting, singing and being generally adored pales in comparison to education, self-care and self-awareness. And that tells younger followers particularly that the world is a multidimensional place with many more options than just fame.</p> <p>Because even though Lovato\u2019s break seems to come from defensiveness \u2013 like she\u2019s peacing out in the wake of Swifterati fury \u2013 it\u2019s still a bold move. She could choose to fuel a feud or compromise her thoughts for the sake of appealing to Taylor\u2019s posse. Instead, she chose to acknowledge that the place she\u2019s in isn\u2019t where she wants to be. And if that isn\u2019t control over one\u2019s own creative narrative; to prioritize happiness or fulfillment or even take one\u2019s self out of the line of fire, then I don\u2019t know what is. Take all the breaks in the world.</p>",
  "<p>Not for the first time when it comes to global football\u2019s discredited overlords, the closing lines of Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again by The Who come to mind. \u201cMeet the new boss, same as the old boss\u201d. Ever since the former Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino almost accidentally ascended to the Fifa president\u2019s office following the fall from grace of Michel Platini the question has been whether the Swiss-Italian who hails from the next village along from Sepp Blatter\u2019s birthplace represents a break from the past or a continuation of it.</p> <p>Allegations that swirled about his predilection for private jets and apparent desire to use his new powers to water down the independence of Fifa\u2019s oversight committees were dismissed by staff as rumours propagated by those who resisted the winds of change blowing through the world body\u2019s HQ.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/world-cup-expand-48-teams-fifa-gianni-infantino-suggests\">World Cup could expand to 48 teams, Fifa\u2019s Gianni Infantino suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even Infantino\u2019s enthusiasm for his Fifa Legends side, with whom he was endlessly photographed playing alongside and flew to Mexico City at great expense for his inaugural Congress in May, has been put down by supporters to his desire leave the politics behind and focus on football.</p> <p>Yet there was something about his throwaway line positing a 48-team World Cup that was pure Blatter. Apparently off-the-cuff yet clearly designed to start a hare running? Check. Capable of winning votes among those confederations disgruntled with their allocation of World Cup places (that is, anywhere but Europe)? Check. Completely ill-thought through and bearing only passing acquaintance with common sense? Check.</p> <p>Infantino\u2019s proposal for a 40-team World Cup, made to persuade floating voters during the presidential campaign at a time when all the candidates should have been focused only on the mess left behind by the corruption that had eaten world football from the inside out, was bad enough. It made little arithmetical sense and was almost impossible to implement without destroying the competitive balance of a competition that showed in Brazil that on the field at least it was still capable of delivering the goods.</p> <p>But it is so very Fifa, and so very in keeping with the gigantism that infects modern football (see also Euro 2016, Fifa\u2019s endless spin-off tournaments, Uefa\u2019s Champions League mission creep) that, instead of ditching the idea and sticking with 32, Infantino has instead proposed expanding to 48 teams.</p> <p>Not only that but in proposing 32 teams play off to enter the group stages he gives rise to the ludicrous prospect of 16 sides flying in from around the globe to play a solitary match before heading home again. Each of those sides would have to budget and plan for a potential stay of several weeks, bringing all their players to the host country for a pre-tournament training camp with all the attendant hype, before turning around and heading home after one game.</p> <p>The new president may counter that Fifa would pick up the tab but, as with the millions wasted on pointless committees, congresses and publications, this is all cash that could otherwise be diverted into growing the game.</p> <p>The proposal would be funny if Infantino were not so serious. Rather than boosting interest and TV broadcasting income, as he no doubt envisages, it just may go some way to adding to the growing sense of disillusionment with the international game. \u201cIt means we continue with a normal World Cup for 32 teams but 48 teams go to the party. Fifa\u2019s idea is to develop football in the whole world, and the World Cup is the biggest event there is. It\u2019s more than a competition, it\u2019s a social event,\u201d Infantino said.</p> <p>The idea of the World Cup as a party for fans did not seem to be so high in his mind when he was insisting recently that the next two World Cups in Russia and Qatar would be triumphs.</p> <p>The expansion idea is so simple minded, and so transparent in its aims, that it barely merits discussion. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that what the president wants he usually gets, despite the reforms that are on paper designed to dilute his influence, and the proposal is sure to receive serious consideration around the table of the Fifa Council next week.</p> <p>The former executive committee may have been rebranded and expanded as part of Infantino\u2019s reform process, but it remains to be seen how much else has changed. Won\u2019t get fooled again? Don\u2019t bet on it.</p>",
  "<p>One of the few surviving elements of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s pre-prime ministerial mythology is that of the dot-com entrepreneur whose mastery of all things digital would give the nation a railroad into the future.<br></p> <p>It won\u2019t survive for much longer if new figures published in today\u2019s Essential Report are any guide.</p> <p>Just as his Q&amp;A leather jacket has not translated into socially progressive garb and his mastery of merchant banking has not armed him to tame the banks, so his apparent technological expertise has failed to download the network solution the nation needs.</p> <p>As Tony Abbott\u2019s preferred \u201ctech-head\u201d, Turnbull enabled the winding back of Labor\u2019s finer to-the-premises model of a National Broadband Network, to a cheaper system that relied on the existing copper wiring to deliver services to the home.</p> <p>Even three years ago, the difference between the models seemed largely theoretical \u2013 both systems seemed to deliver faster downloads of \u201cthe Internet\u201d.

  "<p>If you decided to skip the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday evening and just tune into to the late night talk shows to get all of your information (and, these days, the gap between comedy and news is forever narrowing), then you probably came away thinking only one thing: the debate for the second most powerful job in the free world was dreadfully boring.

Trevor Noah flat-out said: \u201cThe debate was boring. It was boring as hell.\u201d He joked that it was so boring that the ratings showed that \u201c80 million people had <em tabindex=\"-1\">not</em> watched the debate\u201d, adding that it was the first time a broadcast had negative ratings. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPtcDrbUa1A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HPtcDrbUa1A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt was the biggest white guy argument in history,\u201d Noah said. He saw little differentiation between the two candidates and said that if they were both bags you were picking up at the airport you would definitely get them mixed up. </p> <p>However, he saw that each candidate had a distinctive job to do. Tim Kaine had to seem affable and lifelike to counteract Clinton, \u201cwho died six weeks ago\u201d, and Mike Pence had to make some of Donald Trump\u2019s crazier statements seem palatable. He said Pence\u2019s performance was sponsored by Febreze and that he was basically spraying the air freshener and saying, \u201cNothing smells here.

He said that Pence saying that he \u201cspends a bit of time on his knees every day\u201d was evidence that he is \u201cvery close with Vladimir Putin\u201d.

They\u2019re trying to make content which is personal and all about trying to get young people to understand the world in which they exist.\u201d</p> <p> Heald said the channel would not be a feed of the Vice cable channel but would \u201ccherrypick\u201d the best of its culture, music, travel, food, sport and news content for Australian audiences. There was even scope for Vice to produce local Australian content with SBS in the future.</p> <p> SBS2, which started in 2009, is largely an acquisitions channel that commissioned only 10 hours of local content last year on top of its in-house program The Feed. As a secondary channel, SBS2 doesn\u2019t have the budget to commission significant amounts of local content.</p> <p> Heald said SBS as a whole was still strongly multicultural, pointing to the SBS on demand platform, which has 900 movies \u2013 90% of which are in languages other than English.</p> <p> \u201cEven the content which Viceland is producing in the US is incredibly diverse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that because they are in the US they are producing Anglo-Celtic content is just factually incorrect.</p> <p> \u201cI am a passionate defender of SBS and the fact is we are producing more multicultural and more multilingual content than ever before.

  "<p>The Scottish government is pressing Westminster to ensure that people taking part in voluntary work programmes in the country\u2019s newly devolved social security system do not have to face stigmatising sanctions.<br></p> <p>Addressing Holyrood on Wednesday afternoon, the employability minister, Jamie Hepburn, called on the UK government to urgently clarify its position after formally asking the UK secretary of state for work and pensions to confirm that Scots taking part in the programmes will be exempt from having their benefits stopped or reduced.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/01/scottish-government-to-set-up-benefits-agency-to-streamline-welfare\">newly devolved powers</a>, which were agreed under the Scotland Act, allow Scottish ministers to design their own employment services for disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment for the first time from April 2017, and will account for around \u00a32.7bn or 15% of the total Scottish benefits bill. These transitional arrangements will be made before a full Scottish programme of employment support begins in April 2018.</p> <p>But sanctions will remain reserved to Westminster. According to <a href=\"https://greens.scot/scotland-against-sanctions\">research by the Scottish Greens</a>, 80,000 sanctions have been issued to people on employment programmes in Scotland since 2010. </p> <p>An initial response from the DWP to Hepburn\u2019s request lodged last month was received the day before the debate. The employability minister deemed it \u201cinconclusive\u201d because, while it accepted that it was for Scottish ministers to decide how conditionality would apply to devolved employment programmes, it fell short of confirming that sanctions would not apply to people taking part in these programmes.<br></p> <p>Meeting a group of single parents at the Edinburgh offices of One Parent Families Scotland earlier on Wednesday, Hepburn emphasised that his government \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to facilitate the UK government\u2019s sanctions regime\u201d.<br></p> <p>Instead, it was planning work programmes that were voluntary and took into account the complexity of individual circumstances, Hepburn explained, after hearing the parents describe sleepless nights under threat of sanction and the practical difficulties of finding even entry-level jobs that were possible in tandem with childcare. </p> <p>Satwat Rehman, director at One Parent Families Scotland, welcomed the proposed voluntary regime, explaining: \u201cThe vast majority of single parents want to work but feel they are made to choose between being a parent or a worker, and forced into low-paid work with no career progression that isn\u2019t going to get them out of poverty.</p> <p>\u201cWe are fundamentally opposed to the use of forced destitution as a policy instrument. This offers the opportunity to develop a more effective approach to the UK government\u2019s very damaging \u2018work-first\u2019 conditionality regime.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/04/scotland-introduces-alcohol-tests-gps-tracking-tagged-offenders\">Scotland to introduce alcohol testing and GPS tracking for tagged offenders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking later in the chamber debate, Hepburn told MSPs: \u201cWhile we won\u2019t have the powers to prevent people from being sanctioned, we want to do what we can to protect people from this unnecessary stress and harm, and to give people taking part in our new voluntary programmes the assurance that they will not be sanctioned.</p> <p>\u201cI will continue to urge [the DWP] to respect our desire that no JobCentre Plus client is forced to take part in our programmes and is under threat of sanction,\u201d and that he would press UK ministers at a meeting in London next week. </p> <p>Hepburn also referred to the drastic cut in funding from the DWP for the devolved employability programmes from \u00a353m to \u00a37m next year. The Scottish cabinet has since offered an additional \u00a320m annually, up to the end of the current parliament. </p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Scotland\u2019s communities secretary, Angela Constance, announced a new socio-economic duty, legally obliging all public bodies across Scotland \u2013 including councils and Holyrood \u2013 to consider how policy and strategy decisions contribute to tackling poverty. <br></p> <p>Part of the Fairer Scotland Action Plan, introducing the duty was a recommendation of the Scottish government\u2019s poverty tsar, Naomi Eisenstadt.

Our panel\u2019s verdict | Jonathan Freedland, Polly Toynbee, Anne McElvoy, Joseph Harker, Giles Fraser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May gave that reassurance on Wednesday. She is unscrutinised by the public and is the most opaque of politicians. She duly had to plead with her party to come with her on the \u201cquiet revolution\u201d, entrusted to her government by the voters, to fashion a new \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. She was unequivocal. They should \u201cstop quibbling\u201d and withdraw Britain from the European Union. It should become again a \u201cfully sovereign and independent country\u201d, outward-looking and embracing free trade. As for filling in the details, that was for the \u201cgive and take\u201d and wait and see. It was hardly satisfactory, but it served its purpose.</p> <p>May\u2019s other ambition was harder to articulate. It was to carve out a Mayism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-draws-line-under-cameron-era-with-return-to-small-c-conservatism\" title=\"\">distinct from a Cameronism</a>, to put her own stamp on a government for which the electorate did not vote. Her desire for that most tedious of cliches, change, in \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d, was beyond banality. It is one of those political phrases that reads the same in any word order. In comparison, Tony Blair\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\" title=\"\">\u201cthird way\u201d</a> and David Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10680062\" title=\"\">\u201cbig society\u201d</a> seem like white papers. May\u2019s constant reference to \u201ceveryone \u2026 ordinary people \u2026 working people\u2026 working-class people\u201d bordered on a speechwriter\u2019s tic.</p> <p>We know May wants to be cut from a different cloth from Cameron. We are told of her supposed puritanism. She is Thames Valley lowland, not Cotswolds upland.

May\u2019s ruthless culling of the Cameroons was clearly an emotional release, but it suggests a lack of tolerant collectivism. One chumocracy has gone, but only to make way for new chums.</p> <p>May claims to oppose privilege, and believes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-tory-leadership-pitch-andrea-leadsom\" title=\"\">fairness, justice, hard work</a> and love of country. Who would not? There was certainly a mischievous, leftwing tinge to her remarks. She ridiculed Labour as the new \u201cnasty party\u201d and must be the first Tory in decades to demand we should \u201cremember the good that government can do\u201d. She is certainly the first to speak in favour of taxation, if only to threaten tax dodgers, multinationals and \u201ccitizens of the world and of nowhere\u201d \u2013 a felicitous phrase. May attacked the \u201cliberal elite\u201d, people who \u201cpatronised the electorate\u201d over immigration and Brexit. We might forget that she too voted for remain. She clearly has \u201cremorse issues\u201d.</p> <p>Of all vacuities, Tory centrism is the most empty. May ruined her pitch by then advocating the brutal divisiveness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/thatcher-grammars-poison-theresa-may-tories\" title=\"\">selective schools at 11</a>. Her belief that this \u201cgives every child access to a good school place\u201d is bereft of intellectual coherence. She must also have approved home secretary Amber Rudd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\" title=\"\">\u201cnaming and shaming\u201d</a> of foreigners in employment.

She seems likely to do the same on Heathrow. These hard choices mock her professed eagerness to boost under-privileged regions, the powerless and the poor. They suggest the Downing Street apparatchiks cannot tell good infrastructure from bad, or disentangle private gain from public interest. If this is the template for Brexit, it augurs chaos.</p> <p>May is gambling. She feels she is on a roll. She shows no sign of humility towards her lack of a personal mandate. She is cruelly dismissive of the legacy of the man, David Cameron, who holds that mandate, and who put her where she is. She may regard the June referendum as trumping the 2015 election, but she too \u201clost\u201d that referendum. And however it is spun, the referendum was on Brexit, not a government as a whole.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">We are witnessing nothing less than a Tory reformation  | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May won a rousing conference reception.

And on Wednesday, Schuette announced he would move forward with the case.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a tirade of hate and violence, specifically directed toward police, encouraging people to kill police,\u201d Schuette said at a press conference on Wednesday.</p> <p>Though the comments may be incendiary and violent, experts have said uncertainty over what constitutes a \u201ctrue threat\u201d remains a difficult issue for law enforcement. The first amendment gives broad protection to online comments, but doesn\u2019t cover what\u2019s known as true threats..</p> <p>Courts have yet to settle what sort of intent is required to show someone is making a genuine threat. But Paulson said it boils down to whether someone is mentioning a specific target.</p> <p>\u201cIf somebody says all cops must die \u2026 there\u2019s no individual who would rationally believe that threat was directed to them specifically,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s going to create generalized anxiety in the department, but it wouldn\u2019t meet the test of a true threat.\u201d</p> <p>Dan Korobkin, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, said the constitution protects free speech that can be \u201cdisturbing to people and can even appear to encourage illegal conduct\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut under clearly established first amendment rules, unless what someone says is a true threat, a mere generalized statement, particularly in a political context \u2013 which this was \u2013 is protected under the first amendment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Korobkin said what was concerning was that police were \u201cgoing after specifically Facebook postings that they find disturbing to them, because the Facebook postings appear to be about police officers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWould they be doing this if the Facebook posts were about anyone other than police?\u201d he said. \u201cIf not, then we have a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Paulson said it\u2019s not uncommon for someone to be charged with making a terroristic threat over social media postings, but \u201cunless they\u2019re targeting a building associated with police officers, that would not typically be what you\u2019d charge them with\u201d.</p> <p>In these cases, he said, if police discover a threatening remark, officers \u201ccan, and should\u201d follow up with questioning \u2013 and then make a decision about whether to arrest.</p> <p>\u201cToo often the exact opposite happens,\u201d he said. \u201cThey arrest first, and ask questions later. And that\u2019s where constitutional questions arise. Free speech gives you the right to say sometimes outrageous things and not be punished unless you are genuinely threatening an individual.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The one thing that cannot be said about Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live\" title=\"\">debut leader\u2019s speech</a> to the Tory party conference is that it was the voice of the \u201csame old Tories\u201d. David Cameron was given a brief tribute but he might as well have moved to Paraguay. This was a speech and a conference shaped at every turn by the Brexit vote in June. Mrs May has to make a reality of that convulsive decision. She will be judged by how she handles it. She gave little away on the EU today that she had not already signalled on Sunday. Migration law will be the&#xa0;priority. The economic consequences remain unclear. But Mrs May\u2019s real aim this week was to get her party behind her. She succeeded in that.</p> <p>Yet this was also a speech that went a long way to revealing what makes Mrs May tick, whether you agree with all, some or none of what she said. The woman who was scorned as \u201csubmarine May\u201d by David Cameron\u2019s circle surfaced today to make some big public declarations. This was not the speech of a liberal, either in economics or in social policy. But it was the speech of someone who thinks government can do genuine economic and social good. It was a speech of ambitious claims, some of them nasty but many not, which, if she turns the words into deeds, may possibly reset the dials of British politics.</p> <p>At the heart of <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/151378268295/prime-minister-the-good-that-government-can-do\" title=\"\">Mrs May\u2019s speech</a> was the reclamation of the role of the state in ensuring fairness and security. The Conservative tradition always had a place for good government. In the 19th century <a href=\"http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/history/joseph-chamberlain-and-municipal-liberalism/\" title=\"\">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, now fashionable in Tory circles, believed that the moral purpose of his adopted city of Birmingham lay in the hands of the local council. In the 20th, Harold Macmillan, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Middle_Way_(Harold_Macmillan_book)\" title=\"\">his prewar Middle Way</a> writings and as postwar housing minister, helping to rebuild Britain, had no doubt that government was a force for good. Yet ever since the ascendancy of Margaret Thatcher, most in the Tory party, whether at the top or the grassroots, have seen government as a problem to be shrunk and moved out of the way. Many in Mrs May\u2019s own cabinet still think that way. Nevertheless her speech could be said to mark the end of that era.</p> <p>Whether that proves so will depend on something that the speech completely skated over \u2013 the policies, measures and specific actions by which Mrs May intends to make good on her claim that there is more to life than individualism and self-interest. She talked at length about protecting British working-class families, about employment rights and the importance of paying taxes. Not so long ago, these priorities were those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband</a> rather than the government of which Mrs May was a part. Yet now Mrs May praised the NHS and even referenced Clement Attlee as one of the great prime ministers. There is no reason to suppose that this explicit pitch for the centre ground is anything except serious. Mrs May has Labour and Ukip voters in her sights. Jeremy Corbyn and whoever emerges as Ukip\u2019s next leader in the wake of Diane James\u2019s shambolic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/ukip-leader-diane-james-resigns-after-just-18-days-in-job-reports\" title=\"\">18-day tenure</a> should be very concerned.</p> <p>Yet if parts of the speech owed something to Mr Miliband, and others to the legacy of Chamberlain and Macmillan, some parts owed something to the Daily Mail\u2019s shouty populism. The party may already be rowing back from the unsavoury proposal to make firms disclose how many foreign workers they have, but when Mrs May addressed working-class voters whose \u201cdreams have been sacrificed in the service of others\u201d, she was not talking about bankers, tax avoiders and overpaid executives (though she could have been); instead she talked only about the impact of low-skilled immigration. If she is determined to make border controls the red line of the post-Brexit settlement, she is going to have to be much more honest about the likely bad economic consequences, which will hit working-class families in particular.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s speech was an attempt to fuse several traditions, none of them liberal in any of the many senses of that word. But it was not all a lurch to the right, and Mrs May\u2019s opponents should recognise the ambition of what she is doing. British voters seem to approve of Mrs May as prime minister, not least because they dislike the alternatives (and think what kind of speech <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrea-leadsom\" title=\"\">Andrea Leadsom</a> would have made today if she had become Tory leader). Today will have reinforced that approval. Yet British voters are not in love with the Conservatives. An interesting speech provides much to discuss and debate. But words are the easy bit. Policies and actions will define whether the change which Mrs May promised is a real possibility or not.</p>",

At present stamp duty and George Osborne\u2019s recent tax changes disincentivise professional investors from building a portfolio of rental properties. Suspending stamp duty for professional landlords with at least three properties is imperative. Not giving the right incentives will have a devastating impact on rental housing supply.</p> <p>It is wrong for the government to blindly push a home ownership agenda when all the data shows that the private rented sector is the solution to our housing crisis. Encouraging small and medium-sized landlords to scale up will increase the supply of housing stock now and generate income for the Treasury, while long-term strategies for corporate landlords will take years to kick in. Generation rent is here to stay. In light of this report, a stamp duty reversal for professional landlords is an absolute no-brainer.<br><strong>Simon Gerrard </strong><br><em>Managing director, Martyn Gerrard</em></p> <p>\u2022 There\u2019s a need for more growth in housing supply across tenures, including private rented accommodation, but this affects people\u2019s chances of staying in their homes as they grow older. With private renters outnumbering those in social rented housing, there\u2019s a risk that fewer people will be living in suitable homes as they age. Some 95% of current housing doesn\u2019t have the basic characteristics for independent living; of the 5% that does, the majority is in the social rented sector. Private rented property is more likely to be older and in disrepair.</p> <p>Home adaptations improve access and help people feel confident and in control of daily living, but tenants in private rented accommodation have limited rights on accessibility. Rules introduced in the Equality Act 2010 make it harder for landlords to refuse permission for home adaptations, but grants to support this (disabled facilities grants) are only given if you intend to stay in the property for five years. The focus needs to be on suitability as much as supply, for everyone to live in a home that\u2019s right for them as the population ages.<br><strong>Rachael Docking</strong><br><em>Centre for Ageing Better</em></p> <p>\u2022 Each year, as a private tenant, I don\u2019t know if I will have to spend time and money finding a new home for my family. Meanwhile buy-to-let landlords have had a cut in tax reliefs. Why not offer tax breaks in return for five-year fixed-term contracts linked to inflation rises? And perhaps bigger reliefs if those contracts renew on a rolling basis.

  "<p>In the final stretch of a presidential campaign that has seen little sustained debate over reproductive rights, Tuesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate brought the issue of abortion firmly into focus. </p> <p>It started with Republican Mike Pence on the attack, accusing Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-hillary-clinton-supports-abortion/\">falsely</a> \u2013 of actively supporting an outlawed form of abortion late into pregnancy.

James was shocked, I think, at the level of venom directed at her. One intolerant leftist jeered and spat at her at Waterloo station. This thuggish behaviour should be completely beyond the pale after the Jo Cox tragedy, but because James is \u201crightwing\u201d, the media turns a blind eye. On top of this, she ran into a brick wall trying to tackle the fifth column within Ukip, which wants to frustrate any attempts at reform.</p> <p>Farage had to fight an extremely draining two-front war against these opportunist carpetbaggers during the referendum, as they sought to seize control of the party he built up from nothing while he was out winning the campaign.</p> <p>Led by Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, this cabal would utterly destroy Ukip. Yet they have reaped huge benefits from courting the party\u2019s outdated national executive committee. This body is populated by a motley collection of amateurs; leftovers from a bygone age, when Ukip was a ragtag band of volunteers on the fringes of British politics. Watching them try to run the modern political movement that Farage built is like watching a team of circus clowns trying to carry out a pit stop at the Silverstone Grand Prix.</p> <p>Yet the old constitution gives them power, and Carswell and Evans have lavished them with attention. They found a useful creature in the absurd figure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/07/neil-hamilton-mark-reckless-ukip-welsh-assembly-elections\" title=\"\">Neil Hamilton</a>, a relic from the dregs of the Tory party best known&#xa0;for the \u201ccash for questions\u201d scandal and exactly the sort of representative Ukip doesn\u2019t need.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These people would be out of their depth in a paddling pool, and couldn\u2019t be more unfit to run a modern political party</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The committee\u2019s selfish, shortsighted ambition was encapsulated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-steven-woolfe-excluded-from-ballot\" title=\"\">its exclusion of Steven Woolfe</a> from the leadership race, ostensibly on the technical basis of some papers being submitted through their ancient computer system 17 minutes late.

Perhaps James could have seen them off, but with the strain of being a hate figure and with a seriously ill partner to care for, who can blame her for deciding to step away?</p> <p>It isn\u2019t too late. The Labour leadership elections proved the party is incapable of becoming a credible opposition. Ukip is now the only force in British politics that can represent the millions of working-class voters who don\u2019t want to see backsliding on Brexit. Corbyn\u2019s Labour doesn\u2019t represent these people \u2013 it doesn\u2019t even like them.</p> <p>Theresa May, who backed remain during the referendum and endorsed a status quo which has been failing working-class communities badly, has enjoyed a boost in the polls because she hastily adopted a series of popular Ukip policies on things such as grammar schools and national security.

  "<p>Like so many people of my generation, I was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/05/rod-temperton-dies-songwriter-behind-thriller-michael-jackson-hit\">fan of Rod Temperton</a> before I even knew his name. I was a fan before I even knew what he looked like. Back in the late 70s, before I alighted upon his writing credits, scattered as they were across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/11/michael-jackson-off-the-wall\">Michael Jackson\u2019s Off the Wall</a>, his songs punctuated my earliest memories of Top of the Pops. The first was Heatwave\u2019s Boogie Nights. Released in 1976, when boogie was still a quaint byword for disco, it bore all the hallmarks that made Temperton\u2019s songwriting so impossible to resist. The groove was what got you moving and the hooks were what ensured you would want to come back for more. But really, it was the warmth of Temperton\u2019s arrangements that made you want to be a participant in the scenarios sketched out by his songs. I didn\u2019t know what club Boogie Nights was describing, but I dearly wanted to go there. It seemed like the happiest place in the world. Temperton had a way of perfecting this illusion over and over again. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a85d8ffb03bfd2a9a47e8d3b387ac98f6d390e0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a85d8ffb03bfd2a9a47e8d3b387ac98f6d390e0c/0_0_2517_1511/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rod Temperton and his wife Kathy attending a Teenage Cancer Trust concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rod Temperton and his wife Kathy attending a Teenage Cancer Trust concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Written almost 40 years ago, the Heatwave songs The Groove Line and Gangsters of the Groove are absolutely timeless productions, still fizzing with the purity of their original intent. With early songs like Too Hot to Handle and Ain\u2019t No Half Steppin\u2019, Temperton had alighted on the method, but he needed to find a group to perform them. As an aspiring keyboard player in Cleethorpes, perhaps his single greatest piece of good fortune was finding Heatwave \u2013 an American group formed by two brothers from Dayton, Ohio, based in Germany. Johnnie and Keith Wilder had everything but a reliable supply of decent songs. It was their small ad in Melody Maker that Temperton answered and, in doing so, secured his first full-time work as a professional musician. \u201cAll Set to Burn Ya!\u201d trumpeted the headline of Heatwave\u2019s first music press feature, in Blues &amp; Soul Magazine in November 1976, running at a relatively inauspicious half page.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5d176693310effddc69d912fe1d205cf5402bdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5d176693310effddc69d912fe1d205cf5402bdf/0_0_4355_4287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rod Temperton and his disco band Heatwave, February 1976.

Years later, Temperton still seemed amusingly nonplussed by the notion that a ballad written in his Cleethorpes bedsit amid \u201cpiles of washing\u201d should have made such waves amid the American songwriting fraternity. \u201cThere was no hidden meaning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was purely an attempt to write a romantic ballad for the singer.\u201d Furthermore, he said, he \u201cabsolutely hated writing lyrics and, to be honest, still do, to this day\u201d.</p> <p>One sensed that he didn\u2019t rate his own lyrics especially highly, but there was a kind of genius in the Temperton lyrical method. Quite simply, he wrote about what he knew in a vernacular that was second nature to him, this being the vernacular of all the soul and R&amp;B records that he and his mates used to spend Saturday afternoons listening to. While looking to catch a break, he worked in the offices of Ross frozen foods in Grimsby. He wrote about what he saw happening all around him. You worked in the week and you let your hair down at the weekend. And mercifully, it was a formula he didn\u2019t see fit to change when Jones \u2013 fresh from having worked with Michael Jackson on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiz_(film)\">The Wiz</a> \u2013 called him about contributing songs to a new album by Jackson.</p> <p>The history of pop is littered with stories of artists who appear to enter some sort of visionary creative state and reel out a high concentration of classics in a surprisingly short amount of time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/28/johnny-marr-interview\">Johnny Marr</a> wrote the foundations of How Soon Is Now?, William, It Was Really Nothing and Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I want on the same weekend. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/sep/13/artsfeatures1\">Harry Nilsson</a> wrote Without Her, Don\u2019t Leave Me and 1941 in one overnight session. In what must surely count as an even greater achievement, within days of receiving the call from Jones, Temperton delivered Off The Wall, Rock With You and Burn This Disco Out. And his impact on Jackson went beyond individual songs. Temperton\u2019s work on Off the Wall and then Thriller in effect reinvented the Jackson brand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/kalavas1/playlist/3IgCzEzqodupxWQcZHSWVJ\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:kalavas1:playlist:3IgCzEzqodupxWQcZHSWVJ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The persona of the new grown-up, suit-and-tied Jackson that greeted the world with Off the Wall was built in no small part out of the songs that Temperton wrote for him. To those of us thousands of miles away, hoping that we might, in time, turn into the sort of cocksure young lothario that Jackson seemed to have become, this was a rock solid role model. Even those of us who looked at the songwriting credits didn\u2019t spend too long pondering where the line between author and performer was drawn. If, you asked us, as 12-year-olds, which pop star we thought reminded us of ourselves at that moment, we would have said Madness. If you asked us which pop star we wanted to be at 18, we would all have said Michael Jackson. Temperton\u2019s songs were key to that idolisation. </p> <p>Thriller served to cement the existing perception of Jackson. Jones recalled leaning on Temperton to come up with a name for Jackson\u2019s 1983 album, since he had managed to do the same for Off the Wall. The song which would eventually become Thriller was originally called Starlight, before Temperton changed it to Midnight Man, before he arrived at Thriller. Temperton said he just woke up one morning and it was there, waiting for him: \u201cI could visualise it on the top of the Billboard charts.\u201d By the time the cab arrived to take him to the session where Vincent Price would be waiting to record his voiceover for the song, Temperton recalled having only written one verse. As the car pulled up to the studio, where Price\u2019s limo had already arrived, Temperton rushed in with the newly finished words, asked the secretary to photocopy Price\u2019s monologue, and placed it on the music stand. Price nailed it in two takes.</p> <p>Between the two Jackson albums, Temperton had accrued a level of respect among the American R&amp;B fraternity rarely accorded white British musicians. By this time, I knew his name, and knew a record with his name on it was almost always worth owning: Donna Summer\u2019s Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger), Quincy Jones\u2019 Razzamatazz, Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan\u2019s Live In Me, the Brothers Johnson\u2019s Stomp, Anita Baker\u2019s Mystery, George Benson\u2019s Love X Love and Michael McDonald\u2019s unsurpassable Sweet Freedom. Beyond the pages of Record Mirror and Blues &amp; Soul, Temperton wasn\u2019t always accorded his due by the music press, but he never lost sight of the people for whom he was making records. In the late 70s and early 80s, the British charts were full of songs by emerging British artists who had clearly paid close attention to his writing style: Sade, Central Line, George Michael, Linx, Loose Ends, Paul Weller and Freeez, to name but three. Later on, Justin Timberlake would even launch his solo career with a sound based on the blueprint that Temperton\u2019s songs had created for Jackson, back in 1979.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkMpQsVux3g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lkMpQsVux3g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Anyone in music who was serious about improving their songwriting game knew how much work Temperton put into making his songwriting seem so effortless. In a previously unpublished extract from her memoir Bedsit Disco Queen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/12/tracey-thorn-extract-naked-at-the-albert-hall\">Tracey Thorn </a>recalled the time that Everything But the Girl turned to him for inspiration. \u201cWe engineered a meeting with him, in the lounge of his London hotel suite. We sat down with a tape recorder and played him some songs \u2026 and he was spectacularly gracious and helpful, saying nice things at appropriate moments, and pointing out where songs went a bit flat, or a bit weird, and how to structure things so that you held people\u2019s attention beyond the intro. </p> <p>\u201cThe song he liked the most was the song that everyone was liking the most, and it was called Driving. Our indie/punk roots had often led us into a subconscious self-destruct mode when it came to the commercial potential of our songs. We balked at writing pay-off choruses, always opting to play down any such moments. Rod Temperton encouraged us to make more of this song\u2019s pop potential, and not shy away so much from stating the obvious, and we left his hotel room feeling that we had genuinely learnt something about songwriting.\u201d Rod Temperton may no longer be with us, but for anyone serious about the science of songwriting, these songs have countless more lessons to impart.</p>",
  "<p>Television spinoffs are all the rage at the moment. The Netflix show Luke Cage came from Jessica Jones. Punisher is being spawned from Daredevil.

Pence is the overly relaxed one who had his face permanently set to condescension.</p> <p>If you only saw photos from the debate: Kaine looks like a friar who has drunk too much mead. Pence <a href=\"http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mike_pence3.jpg\">looks like</a> he has been embalmed.</p> <h2><strong>Sometimes commercial breaks are a good thing</strong></h2> <p>Did anyone really want to watch two men in their late 50s argue for 90 minutes straight? </p> <p>This was one of the rare occasions where television viewing would have been improved by the show being broken up. It certainly would have been more humane.</p> <p>Three commercial breaks during Tuesday\u2019s debate would have been perfect. One to use the bathroom, one to fetch refreshments, and an extra one in case of emergencies.</p> <h2><strong>Pre-cooked lines are terrible</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoPu1UIBkBc\">Ronald Reagan had a good one once</a>, but he was actually an actor.

But the problem is we have tasted Trump now. It tastes awful, obviously, but it has rendered everything else bland by comparison.</p> <p>Kaine and Pence did not call each other names. They did not insult whole groups of people. Neither man referred to his phallus.</p> <p>Consequently, neither came across as unequivocally odious. </p> <p>We\u2019re used to turning on a debate and sitting back while Trump shoots himself in the foot, as Kaine might say. Kaine and Pence didn\u2019t so much as stub their toe.</p> <p>Pence defended Trump and Trump\u2019s views, but he did it pleasantly, like a smiling sales assistant telling you he won\u2019t honour your return even though you have a receipt.

He said he thought it was a gunshot. But when he looked out the window, he saw numerous law enforcement vehicles, including two large vans that parked in front of the house.<br></p> <p>Glen Bond, who has lived in a house across the street from Bond for 50 years, said there were two big vans in front of the house blocking it from view and \u201c25 or 30 cars\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey were in camouflaged uniforms, two dozen of them. They were serious. Helmets, rifles,\u201d Murray Bennett, who lives next door to Martin, said.</p> <p>\u201cBig guns,\u201d Bond said. \u201cWhen they came they took out a whole bunch of stuff but it was all in black trash bags. You couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p> <p>A woman who came to the door of Martin\u2019s home said: \u201cThis is a matter that\u2019s under investigation. I have no comment ... I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d leave from the front of my house so my dogs will calm down and I can get some peace.\u201d</p> <p>Neighbors describe Martin and the woman he lives with \u2013 no one could say whether they were married \u2013 as \u201cnice\u201d, \u201cdecent\u201d, and \u201cpeaceful\u201d.</p> <p>During execution of the warrants, investigators found hard-copy documents and digital information stored on various devices and removable digital media.<br></p> <p>\u201cA large percentage of the materials recovered from Martin\u2019s residence and vehicle bore markings indicating that they were property of the US government and contained highly classified information, including Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). In addition, investigators located property of the US government with an aggregate value in excess of $1,000, which Martin allegedly stole,\u201d a justice department press statement said.</p> <p>Martin is said to have had six classified documents obtained from sensitive intelligence and produced by a government agency in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThese documents were produced through sensitive government sources, methods and capabilities, which are critical to a wide variety of national security issues. The disclosure of the documents would reveal those sensitive sources, methods and capabilities,\u201d the justice department said.<br></p> <p>The documents have been reviewed by a government agency and designated as top secret, \u201cmeaning that unauthorized disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the US\u201d, the justice department statement said.<br></p> <p>If convicted, Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property. An initial appearance was held for Martin in US district court in Baltimore on 29 August and he is still detained.</p> <p>The arrest is a major embarrassment for the NSA and its contractor Booz Allen coming just three years after Snowden, who worked for both.<br></p> <p>The NSA said in the wake of the Snowden revelations in 2013 it had tightened up internal security, introducing more stringent monitoring of staff and a double-checking system in which sensitive information needed two people to access it rather than just one. Highly classified information would no longer be concentrated in one place, making it harder for potential hackers.<br></p> <p>The new breach provides fresh arguments for privacy activists who argue that the NSA cannot be trusted to protect all the personal data it gathers, from bank accounts to health records.</p> <p>Supporters of Snowden quickly made a distinction between him and the motives of the arrested man. They reiterated that Snowden is a whistleblower who leaked top secret material out of principle, believing the NSA was acting unconstitutionally by engaging in mass surveillance.<br></p> <p>It was not yet clear what motivated the latest alleged leaker.<br></p> <p>Snowden, who had worked for the CIA and the NSA, handed over material to journalists at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">the Guardian in 2013</a> when he was employed by Booz Allen as contractor to the NSA. As a computer specialist based in Hawaii, he was engaged in a number of operations, including targeting China.<br></p> <p>Flying from Hawaii, where he was based, to Hong Kong, he gave tens of thousands of top secret documents to journalists to illustrate the scale of surveillance by the NSA and Britain\u2019s GCHQ. The documents also revealed the extent to which major US tech companies were cooperating with the NSA in providing details from customer accounts.<br></p> <p>Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who was given material by Snowden, rounded on the NSA for its lack of security. \u201cNobody is more inept at securing its own data than NSA. But trust them to keep all yours safe and secure.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jesselyn Radack, a US lawyer who represents whistleblowers, was among those quick to caution journalists about making comparisons with Snowden. In a tweet, she wrote: \u201cMedia;pls stop comparing theft of NSA source code to @Snowden blowing whistle on secret domestic surveillance.\u201d</p>",

The upshot, says Vijg, is that people should focus on enjoying life and staying healthy for as long as possible. \u201cThat\u2019s where we have to invest our money,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The notion of extending the human lifespan has captured imaginations for millennia. Among scientists, enthusiasm for the idea has grown in recent years with a host of Silicon Valley companies springing up to join academic institutions in attempting to chip away at issue of longevity - among them Google\u2019s California Life Company, <a href=\"http://www.calicolabs.com/\">or Calico</a>, as it is known \u2013 with big-buck prizes such as the Palo Alto Longevity Prize adding to the clamour.</p> <p>But the researchers, writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature19793\">Nature</a>, describe how analysis of records from a number of international databases suggests there is a limit to human lifespan, and that we have already hit it.<br></p> <p>Using data for 41 countries and territories from the Human Mortality Database, the team found that life expectancy at birth has increased over the last century. That, says Vijg, is down to a number of factors, including advances in childbirth and maternity care, clean water, the development of antibiotics and vaccines and other health measures.</p> <p>But while the proportion of people surviving to 70 and over has risen since 1900, the rate of improvements in survival differ greatly between levels of old age. Large gains are seen for ages 70 and up, but for ages 100 or more the rate of improvement drops rapidly. \u201c[For] the oldest old people, we are still not very good at reducing their mortality rates,\u201d said Vijg. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/japans-centenarians-hit-by-austerity-as-numbers-soar\">Japanese centenarians' honorary gifts hit by austerity as numbers soar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more, in 88% of the countries, the ages showing the greatest rate of improvement have not changed since 1980. <br></p> <p>The researchers then turned to the International Database on Longevity and analysed data from France, UK, the US and Japan - four countries with a high proportion of those aged 110 or above - so-called \u201csupercentenarians\u201d.</p> <p>The researchers found that the maximum reported age at death rapidly increased between 1970 and the early 1990s, rising by around 0.15 years every year. But in the mid-to-late 90s, a plateau was reached, with the yearly maximum reported age at death at around 115 years. </p> <p>Modelling of the possibility of living beyond such an age offered further insights. \u201cBased on the data we have now, the chance that you will ever see a person of 125 [years] in a given year is about 1 in 10,000,\u201d said Vijg.</p> <p>The apparent limit to human lifespan, the authors say, is not down to a set of biological processes specifically acting to call time on life.

Helena Smith reports: </p> <blockquote> <p>Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who had defaulted on a \u20ac300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u20ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.</p> <p>Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u2019s rescue from insolvency. </p> <p>But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u20ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u20ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u20ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u201cCitizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u2019s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u201d </p> <p>The Greek real estate market \u2013 with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u2013 is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

  "<p>Do you trust the people? Being able to answer \u201cyes\u201d has long been taken as a litmus test of the depth of your commitment to democracy. In a democracy, the people, like customers, may often be wrong, but must always be treated as though they are always right. That\u2019s why Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest campaign gift to Donald Trump was her comment that half of his supporters belonged in a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">basket of deplorables</a>\u201d. \u201cNo one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their president,\u201d Trump said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No sensible person thinks majority opinion is a good guide to best practice in health or engineering.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the UK, when David Cameron recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\">resigned</a> as prime minister he was not ashamed for having called a referendum he lost but \u201cproud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people for these big decisions\u201d. This was one Cameron line his successor Theresa May was all too happy to keep faith with. \u201cWe know there is no finer accolade than to say David Cameron put his trust in the British people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd trust the people we will.\u201d</p> <p>But history suggests it is unwise to trust any politician\u2019s claim to be trusting the people. In 1906 Winston Churchill even had the gall to assert \u201cTrust the people\u201d was his motto in a speech defending the hereditary monarchy and House of Lords. Of course there is a sense in which democracy is about trusting the people. The mistake, however, is to assume that this trust is in the majority\u2019s ability to reach fair and wise decisions about specific policies. That kind of trust is not just unjustified, it\u2019s borderline insane. No sensible person thinks majority opinion is a good guide to best practice in health, education, engineering, or pretty much everything else. So why would public policy be any exception?</p> <p>Plato and Aristotle get a bad rap these days for their rejection of democracy. But the substance of their objections were spot-on, and not just because they saw that majority opinion is not the same as wisdom. For <a href=\"http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_aristotle_democracy?page=all\">Aristotle</a>, democracy\u2019s fatal problem is that it divides society by pitting the majority \u2013 however slender \u2013 against the minority. We\u2019re seeing this playing out in America, where the divide between Republican and Democrat has never been wider, but in elections the winner takes all. We\u2019re also seeing this in Britain, where cosmopolitan liberal cities and conservative communitarian towns and villages view each other with incomprehension.</p> <p>Why then has democracy actually served us so well? Put simply because it is not democracy as conceived by its ancient Greek critics. What we call democracy is actually a system of representative government which leaves most big decisions to elected leaders. Crucially, it is also a system in which the rule of law is more important than the will of the majority at any given moment. That\u2019s a safeguard Aristotle didn\u2019t anticipate. Indeed, he argued that democracy was opposed to the rule of law because he thought it meant the will of the people transcended the law.</p> <p>To say democracy is about trusting the people is therefore simplistic in two ways. First, for democracy to work it requires the people to trust those they elect to make decisions. Demanding that politicians instead trust the people to tell them exactly what is best turns this on its head, undermining one of actual democracies\u2019 greatest strengths.</p> <p>Second, our democracies are built around constitutional arrangements that make major change difficult precisely because it does not trust the people or the government to be reliable or constant.</p> <p>Western democracy is built around a tripartite trust: trust in the people to hold government to account and to set the general direction of policy, but also trust in politicians to make specific decisions, and in institutions to provide safeguards against rash or tyrannical actions. What we are seeing all over the western world are the last two pillars being torn down, leaving all trust resting on the people.</p> <p>This is rightly called populism, not in the American sense, but as understood in the rest of the world. Populism is generally defined as a mode of politics in which the will of the people is seen as clear, virtuous and homogeneous. Populist politicians simply promise to do what this will commands, ignoring or denying the fact there are different, competing interests in society, not just those of the majority. Populists do not try to square the simple desires of the electorate with the complex realities of society but pretend that what seems simple is simple and that anyone who says otherwise belongs to an obfuscating elite looking for excuses to defend its own interests.</p> <p>Those who oppose populists are accused of being anti-democratic because in a sense they are: they reject pure, direct democracy in which the people dictate policy, as did Plato and Aristotle. But they are completely on the side of the very successful form of democracies that we have developed, systems of government that are much better than any imagined by those great philosophers. We trust the people to play their part, but not to run the whole show.</p>",

Here\u2019s the most obvious winners and losers.</p> <h2>Winners</h2> <p><strong>British workers</strong></p> <p>May promised her government would be on the side of British workers, ruling out a bonfire of employment rights post-Brexit, reiterating her leadership race commitment to putting employees on company boards and attacking company bosses who \u201cearn a fortune but don\u2019t look after your staff.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Rural Britain </strong></p> <p>Broadband is a priority which May mentioned in her speech, and one her spokeswoman said had been discussed in cabinet meetings and committees. It\u2019s in rural, and traditionally Tort, areas where connectivity is poorest and expect to see some concrete new policy on this in coming weeks and months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a013ebd79c4e53dcee595bdb4f18a664763dd6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a013ebd79c4e53dcee595bdb4f18a664763dd6b/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Openreach engineers working on a broadband internet fibre cabinet in the street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT Openreach engineers working on a broadband internet fibre cabinet in the street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Savers</strong></p> <p>May said it was clear current low interest rates were not working for everyone, and there were gentle hints that the government may be preparing to rethink quantitive easing, a policy that would be attractive to savers. May said though QE had been good after the financial crash, the government would \u201cacknowledge there have been some bad side effects.\u201d Monetary policy like this however, is really the domain of the Bank of England.</p> <h2>Losers</h2> <p><strong>Foreign workers</strong></p> <p>May has made it clear she wants to prioritise voter concerns about immigration in her Brexit negotiations. Her speech will have unnerved many overseas workers, including doctors, whom the Prime Minister suggested may only be allowed to stay in the UK for a limited period. Firms have already started a huge backlash against a proposal floated by Amber Rudd to make companies list the number of foreign workers they employ. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d51fc0ddbe8ca6d5fb1c9985b69905818b873e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51fc0ddbe8ca6d5fb1c9985b69905818b873e92/231_43_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green Party banners during the Refugees Welcome march.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green Party banners during the Refugees Welcome march.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Baggott/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Energy companies </strong><br>May strongly hinted she wanted to tackle high energy bills, without a firm proposal. But her words about energy companies have been seized on as potentially a move towards Ed Miliband-style energy price caps. Her official spokeswoman did not rule out even tougher action, but said firmer policy announcements would follow.</p> <p><strong>Human rights lawyers</strong><br>One of the biggest cheers in the hall came as May attacked \u201cactivist, left-wing human rights lawyers.\u201d The focus of her anger was abuse claims against British troops, which defence secretary Michael Fallon had announced earlier would be protected against claims arising from the ECHR for future conflicts.</p> <p><strong>Tax avoiders</strong></p> <p>Nothing concrete yet, but May has seized on another Labour soundbite, it\u2019s patriotic to pay your taxes. \u201cWhoever you are you \u2013 however rich or powerful \u2013 you have a duty to pay your tax. And we\u2019re going to make sure you do,\u201d she said.

Business leaders are not pantomime villains, evading taxes and employing cheap labour from abroad out of some destructive desire to do Britain down, and for every Mike Ashley or Philip Green there are hundreds of thousands of hard-working entrepreneurs who are more likely to remortgage their homes than own a super yacht.

Labour will be watching closely to ensure these aren\u2019t just more empty promises from a prime minister who has left the British economy with no fiscal framework and is pressing ahead with cuts to in-work benefits, and local authority funding. That\u2019s not on the side of ordinary working class people; it\u2019s the same old Tories helping just the privileged few.</p> <p>This week was about Theresa May finally outlining her vision. It\u2019s now clear what that vision is not optimistic about the future but small, mean and nasty.

She is setting out an agenda for the things that we will be looking at; the further detail will come from the departments.</p> </blockquote> <p>Broadband access in particular will be under the spotlight, and has been raised repeatedly at cabinet and other committees, the spokeswoman said. Corporate governance is also a key policy area where announcements will be made in the coming months.</p> <p>In the speech, May appeared to be pointing the finger at specific companies and individuals \u2013 Facebook, Google and the responsibility of billionaire Philip Green for the BHS pensions\u2019 crisis, or Mike Ashley for working conditions of Sports Direct employees.</p> <p>That was predictably denied by May\u2019s team.

But that was the Scottish leader, Ruth Davidson, whose speech introducing Theresa May was one of the best of the whole conference season. As for Theresa May\u2019s, it was rather more questionable.</p> <p>What was certainly bold was May\u2019s decision to cast herself as the leader of a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-57f4daf8e4b0e2a2a25af297#block-57f4daf8e4b0e2a2a25af297\">11.51am</a>). Taking the EU referendum vote as her starting point, she said it was not just a vote to leave the EU but a protest against an economic and political system rigged in the interests of the elite to the detriment of ordinary people. She is not necessarily wrong, and this analysis is not unlike Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, but May then set out to use it to make the case for her own brand of pragmatic, populist, \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism. What she had to say about tax-dodgers (and, even more pointedly, tax-dodging accountants), corporate responsibility, market failure and industrial intervention was provocative in Tory terms, and yet another indication of how far the party has come from the days of Margaret Thatcher. Edward Heath coined the term \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, and May has placed herself firmly in the Heath/Major/Blair centrist tradition. It\u2019s Christian democracy \u2013 or perhaps Anglican democracy, given that May\u2019s father was a vicar.</p> <p>Yet there was nothing in the speech to show that May is willing to match her rhetorical courage with action. If she really thinks working people are losing out under the tax system, she could abandon George Osborne\u2019s inheritance tax cut. If she is serious about intergenerational fairness, she could shelve the \u201ctriple lock\u201d. And if she accepts that housing policy needs to change so that people can get on to the ladder, she could rip up planning laws and send the bulldozers on to the green belt. But of course that wouldn\u2019t go down well in Maidenhead (her constituency), or with the Daily Telegraph, or with the Conservative party at large.</p> <p>May said at one point that government was about \u201caction \u2026 about doing something\u201d. But caution seems to be more her watchword. We\u2019re still waiting for a decision about Heathrow. </p> <p>Ultimately this speech will be judged by whether May can deliver on the heady ambitions that she set herself. It is not inconceivable; in some respects her record as home secretary was radical. But she would have been much more convincing today if she had backed her rhetoric with at least one announcement to show that change is real.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T12:58:28.033Z\">at 1.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4e71de4b08ebe3d557064\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T11:46:20.230Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is an agenda for a Conservatism rooted in the centre ground.</p> <p>That is what this government is about, she says.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-57f4b9c8e4b0afec6ad16f7a#block-57f4b9c8e4b0afec6ad16f7a\"> 9.37am.)</a> He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The tone of the Conservative conference has become increasingly xenophobic.

Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learned.</p> <p><strong>1. Brexit will be at the harder end of the scale. </strong>This was signalled in Theresa May\u2019s speech on Sunday and \u2013 judging not least by the market reaction \u2013 it is the most important takeaway from the whole conference. Ministers still seem uncertain as to exactly what they want, but the Norway/Switzerland models (soft Brexit) are out and, although May is not planning to simply walk away and slam the door (the hardest possible Brexit), she will prioritise getting control over immigration over single market membership. Brexiteers strongly object to the terms hard/soft on the grounds that they are loaded, because hard implies bad (clean/dirty is one alternative formula they prefer), but this terminology is not unreasonable. Economists believe disengaging from the single market will have negative consequences.<br></p> <p><strong>2. The Conservative party is largely united behind May on Brexit, but it is complacent about the risks. </strong>From what has been said in the conference hall, and on the fringe, you could easily forget that the party was split down the middle on the EU four months ago, because now the Tories seem remarkably unified. According to a <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2016/10/brexit-members-survey-todays-conservativehome-conference-newspaper-in-full.html\">ConservativeHome poll</a>, 76% of members back the harder Brexit May is offering. But there is a considerable disconnect between Toryworld, where many members are convinced that all forecasts about Brexit being bad for the economy are just wrong, and reality, where May\u2019s speech sent the pound tumbling. Two figures who are not complacent are May herself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\">who has been warning about \u201cbumps in the road\u201d</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\"> </a>and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who used his speech on Monday to try to warn his party about potential bad news ahead.</p> <p><strong>3. City and business opinion does not matter to the Tory leadership as much as it used to.</strong> Traditionally the Conservative party has been quite deferential towards the City and business, but now the tone is different. \u201cCity delegates stranded on Planet Tory for the duration of the party conference report the atmosphere has turned toxic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7133664a-8a29-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">the Financial Times\u2019 Lombard column reports</a>. A Bloomberg story saying <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-03/may-said-to-downgrade-city-in-brexit-shock-for-financial-sector\">the City would get no special favours in the Brexit negotiations</a> caused alarm (even though it was denied) and then Amber Rudd, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on work visas, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/79577/business-backlash-against-amber-rudds-fresh-immigration\">which prompted a strong business backlash</a>. In government Hammond is fighting to protect business interests in the Brexit talks although, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1703845213273550\">in a perceptive Facebook post</a>, ITV\u2019s <strong>Robert Peston</strong> says the conference shows \u201cthe Treasury, in the May government, is less powerful than it\u2019s been for many decades.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>4. May seems serious about defining herself as a centre-ground politician, although so far there is little policy evidence to show that she will be very different from her predecessor.</strong> It is commonplace for political leaders serious about power to argue that they represent the centre ground, or that the centre ground has moved towards them, but May is finding it easier to make this case than David Cameron because for most his premiership the centre ground was taken by his coalition partners, the Lib Dems. However, so far, we have yet to see a big policy shift that makes this real. When Nick Robinson challenged her yesterday to show her commitment to working people by axing inheritance tax cuts (which only help the wealthy), or higher public sector pay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b#block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b\">May ducked for cover</a>. </p> <p><strong>5. The Tories aren\u2019t very worried about Labour, but that has not stopped them annexing some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy territory.</strong> In some respects, competitive party politics is quite simple: all you have to do is attack your opponents\u2019 bad ideas, pinch their good ones, and make sure you have the sense to tell which is which. The Tories have done that this week, hijacking some of the soundest aspects of the Corbyn agenda \u2013 a slower timetable for balancing the budget, reviewing whether employment laws suit the modern workplace, and a migration impact fund. Some Labour figures think that, if the Tories are on their turf, that will help Corbyn, but that is not necessarily so because, on the economy and immigration, the Tories are more trusted than Labour. The Tory MP Robert Halfon <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tories-should-be-worried-and-not-celebrating-robert-halfon-minister-mp-a7342636.html\">gave an interesting speech</a> saying his party should worry about Corbyn\u2019s ability to inspire young voters, but he has been a lone voice and generally the Conservatives are not taking the threat from Corbyn seriously at all. </p> <p><strong>6. Next year\u2019s most important election may well be the West Midlands mayoral one.</strong> Labour is expected to win the mayoral elections in Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region next year quite easily, but the contest in the West Midlands could turn out to be gripping. The Tories have used the conference to promote their candidate, the outgoing John Lewis boss Andy Street, and Street say he just needs a 4% swing from the general election results to win. Given that the West Midlands is one of the regions where general elections are often decided, this will be a key test for Corbyn\u2019s Labour versus May\u2019s Conservatives.<br></p> <p><strong>7. The Tories have ditched the Cameron era quite ruthlessly. </strong>There is little gratitude in politics. Ministers have been acknowledging David Cameron in their speeches, but their tributes have barely gone beyond the polite and, outside the conference hall, it\u2019s more a case of \u201cDave who?\u201d. In the atrium there is a display featuring pictures of Tory prime ministers from Robert Peel to John Major, from which Cameron is notably absent. The people most closely associated with his administration, such as George Osborne and Michael Gove, have not turned up and, in a final indignity, Sir Craig Oliver, Cameron\u2019s former communications chief, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/david-camerons-former-aide-charged-1500-for-conference-ticket-after-publishing-attack-book-on-a7334966.html\">had to pay the extortionate business attendee rate</a> to get a pass to be allowed entry into the conference building.<br></p> <p><strong>8. Being foreign secretary has not changed Boris Johnson. </strong>Diplomacy is normally associated with a certain amount of gravitas, and before the conference it was not clear whether Johnson would adopt a serious tone, or whether we would get the usual faux-spontaneous, rambling, semi-frivolous standup routine. In the event we got the latter. It was actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c#block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c\">a very good speech</a>, probably the best anyone has delivered so far (not least for the use of the word \u201cfunkapolitan\u201d), although what the mandarins at King Charles Street and Johnson\u2019s fellow foreign ministers made of it is anyone\u2019s guess.<br></p> <p><strong>9. The Tories who backed the Vote Leave campaign are not willing to defend its key claims.</strong> One of the TV highlights of the conference has been Sky\u2019s Darren McCaffrey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/783193789158481920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">trying to get the Tory Vote Leave leaders to defend their claim that Brexit would free up \u00a3350m a week for the NHS</a>. The Vote Leave NHS promise was disowned some months ago, but this week we\u2019ve seen further evidence that Vote Leave\u2019s Brexit forecasts were misleading. Rudd said she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live?page=with:block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e#block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e\">not planning to increase immigration from the Commonwealth as EU immigration falls</a> (leavers forecast the opposite), and Brexit ministers are backing away from the claim that there will be no trade-off between controlling immigration and enjoying the full benefits of the single market. (Admittedly, some of the worst remain economic forecasts have failed to materialise too, but the person most associated with those claims, George Osborne, is out of the picture.)</p> <p><strong>10. An early election looks less and less likely. </strong>May has been saying for some time that she has no plans for an early election, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f#block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f\">in an interview on Sunday</a> she went further then before, saying an early election would generate \u201cinstability\u201d. Just as significantly, it has become clear from what has and has not been said around the conference that there is little appetite in the party for an early poll.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T10:40:05.813Z\">at 11.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4c868e4b0d9ed530ef255\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T09:35:17.565Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNP, Greens and Plaid Cyrmu issue joint statement condemning Tories's stance on immigration</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The SNP leader and Scottish first minister <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the Green co-leaders <strong>Caroline Lucas</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Bartley</strong> and the Plaid Cymru leader <strong>Leanne Wood</strong> have released a joint statement this morning condemning the Tories for their stance on immigration. Here it is in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The countries of the United Kingdom face a spiralling political and economic crisis.

We will not tolerate the contribution of people from overseas to our NHS being called into question, or a new version of the divisive rhetoric of \u2018British jobs for British workers\u2019. Neither will we allow the people of these islands, no matter how they voted <a>on June 23rd</a>, to be presented as a reactionary, xenophobic mass whose only concern is somehow taking the UK back to a lost imperial age. At a time of increasing violence and tension, we will call out the actions of politicians who threaten to enflame those same things.</p> <p>This is not a time for parties to play games, or meekly respect the tired convention whereby they do not break cover during each other\u2019s conferences. It is an occasion for us to restate the importance of working together to resist the Tories\u2019 toxic politics, and make the case for a better future for our people and communities. We will do this by continuing to work and campaign with the fierce sense of urgency this political moment demands. </p> </blockquote> <p>The statement has also been signed by Steven Agnew, leader of the Greens in Northern Ireland, Patrick Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, and Alice Hooker-Stroud, leader of the Welsh Greens.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f4bf25e4b0afec6ad16f97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-elgot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T08:52:21.671Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Communities secretary <strong>Greg Clark</strong> joked last night to a meeting of liberal Tories that Theresa May had been great for progressives because Boris Johnson \u201cspends most of his time out of the country\u201d.</p> <p>At a midnight reception for the Tory Reform Group, members of the group cheered as Clark, who was a remain campaigner teased his cabinet colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for the TRG and particularly a great summer as there are more TRG MPs than there are Liberal Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cDamian Green in the cabinet!

Rudd,</strong> the home secretary, was on the Today programme this morning defending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">the plans she announced yesterday to restrict the number of foreign workers coming to the UK. </a>She said some firms were not doing enough to employ local people.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The purpose of this review is to look at whether they are doing enough to train people locally when they could be able to do that. There are record levels of employment, which is great, but there are still one in 10 18- to 24-year-olds unemployed and I want businesses to think first about locally training people where possible. For instance, I went and visited a factory quite recently where they recruit almost exclusively from Romania and Poland, where they have people who have experience in factories building these sofas that they have. They didn\u2019t even consider training locally \u2013 there was a local college they could have worked with, but they choose to recruit outside the UK. We set policies to encourage businesses to make a profit and be successful, but also to have a responsibility to local employment and we\u2019re asking them to join us on this journey so they don\u2019t automatically go abroad where it\u2019s cheaper perhaps and sometimes they feel more efficient.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the Times, one of Rudd\u2019s proposals is for firms to have to publish figures showing what proportion of their workforce is foreign. Rudd told Today that this was just a proposal and that it would not definitely be implemented.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The business I mentioned to you would have shown it had 80-90% non-UK citizens working there. But it\u2019s not something we\u2019re definitely going to do, it\u2019s one of the tools we\u2019re going to use as a review to see if we can use it as a way of nudging people to do better behaviour.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f160837fa9421047a8323f41dcc1efc178aeea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f160837fa9421047a8323f41dcc1efc178aeea/0_225_3216_1927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DAVID HARTLEY/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T10:30:52.817Z\">at 11.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f3ead3e4b0afec6ad16cae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T08:16:32.588Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This morning we learn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/nigel-farage-says-he-may-technically-still-be-ukip-leader\">Nigel Farage may still be technically leader of Ukip</a>, even though the party announced a new leader last month.

  "<p>In those entertaining early days of the Republican primaries, the illogical popularity of Donald Trump seemed like a lark. Snarky nicknames were coined, toupee memes were shared. And even when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/mar/10/donald-trump-rally-black-man-sucker-punch-north-carolina-video\">Trump dissenters were sucker-punched at rallies</a> and racists grew emboldened, candidate Trump\u2019s oratory provided comic relief because so many sensible Americans were confident that, comparisons to Mussolini notwithstanding, it really can\u2019t happen here.</p> <p>In 1935, just after the rise of the Third Reich, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1930/lewis-bio.html\">Sinclair Lewis</a> wrote<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/09/29/it_really_can_happen_here_the_novel_that_foreshadowed_donald_trumps_authoritarian_appeal/\"> It Can\u2019t Happen Here</a>, a satirical novel about fascism in America. His intention was to shake up an American electorate complacent that the land of the free could never become a police state. So Lewis wrote about a demagogue who becomes president of the United States by promising to return the country to greatness and by demanding law and order.</p> <p>Now the time seems ripe for a new look at Lewis\u2019s cautionary tale. The world premiere of <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyrep.org/\">Berkeley Rep</a>\u2019s theatrical adaptation of It Can\u2019t Happen Here promises shrewd parallels between then and now. But the production is less lacerating satire than agitprop. Tony Taccone and Bennett S Cohen intended to improve upon a previous theatrical adaptation staged by the earnest <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/dustbowl-wpa/\">WPA</a> in 1936. Yet under Lisa Peterson\u2019s stylized direction, this version retains a didactic righteousness.</p> <p>The play never shakes its bookish shape. Actors stand in sober formation to address the audience. Descriptive sentences are parceled out to actors and dialogue takes the backseat to pontificating and political speechifying. Characters aren\u2019t much more than mouthpieces.</p> <p>The mouthpiece with the best words is Doremus Jessup, played by Tom Nelis. A social-democratic newspaper editor (from Vermont of all places), Jessup is the wry voice of reason. He knows those who express certainty that there\u2019s no way Americans will elect Buzz Windrip are \u201coverestimating the country\u201d. Played bigly by David Kelly, Senator Berzelius \u201cBuzz\u201d Windrip is a charismatic charlatan who spins stagecraft and peddles fears.</p> <p>Taccone and Cohen sprinkle Trumpiness throughout their adaptation. Resemblances to today\u2019s headlines are like a theatrical round of Where\u2019s Waldo. Windrip, we hear, \u201cpretended he was his own publicity man\u201d, telling reporters that he \u201cwas the smartest man on Earth\u201d. At a rally, Windrip kicks out a commie, yelling, \u201cGet him out \u2026 Get him out of here! \u2026 In the good old days we would\u2019ve known what to do with this boy.\u201d</p> <p>These nimble additions put a fresh orange coat on the 1934 narrative but Sinclair Lewis\u2019s original book was eerily on the nose. Lewis describes Windrip as \u201cvulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his \u201cideas\u201d almost idiotic\u201d. He is backed by \u201cThe League of Forgotten Men\u201d \u2013 men who would fit well into a basket of deplorables one imagines. To add to the festive election spirit, the theater audience is instructed to cheer and boo on command. Placards are thrust into our hands. Flags are waved.</p> <p>But after Windrip is elected, the play loses some of its cleverness. The genre shifts to wartime noir as paramilitary thugs squash dissent, martial law is imposed, jails spill over into concentration camps and a resistance movement forms. But for all the high stakes suspense and totalitarian brutality, the stage action fizzles. It\u2019s hard to care about resistance fighters who spout undiluted ideology. </p> <p>To the extent that there are parallels to contemporary politics in the play\u2019s second half, it\u2019s the Bush administration that one sees reflected \u2013 scoundrels exploiting patriotism and snatching liberties in the name of freedom. Lewis even anticipated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/06/sorryforthefreedomfries\">freedom fries</a>; Jessup recalls the war hysteria that had them calling sauerkraut liberty cabbage.</p> <p>From our vantage point, this as an eerily prescient foreshadowing of current affairs. But like some other politically knowing dystopian narratives, (Orwell\u2019s 1984<em> </em>for one) Lewis was writing about the state of his own contemporary society. His objective was to take down presidential hopeful Huey Long \u2013 who was actually assassinated before the election. In Sinclair Lewis\u2019s call to arms, the fearless journalist and his printing press is the final image that inspires hope for political change. Eighty-one years later, Americans might be forgiven for believing that that won\u2019t happen here.</p>",

Bauman lost both of his legs in the bombing and the film will detail his adjustment to a new life. A third film was also announced in 2014, originally set to star Casey Affleck, but the star has since dropped out.</p> <p>Patriots Day will open on 21 December in major cities, including Boston, and nationwide on 13 January.</p>",

The event took place in Birmingham and there was only one question on everyone\u2019s lips: which idiot put the word COUNTRY in the platform backdrop? \u201cA COUNTRY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE,\u201d it read.

Back even when he was London mayor, Boris Johnson had a failsafe shtick that was aped by the likes of Liz Truss, and which he was still flogging this week. We\u2019re so perfectly placed as a global trading nation, this runs, that \u201cwe sell tea to China, TV aerials to Korea and, my friends, we export French knickers to France!\u201d This riff has now also been nicked wholesale by those we might politely term lesser orators. Consider Liam Fox \u2013 pushing for such a hard Brexit that it was like a Viagra ad every time he opened his mouth \u2013 who declared (for the third time in a week) that the UK sold \u201ctea to China, wine to France, and boomerangs to Australia\u201d. Fox had taken the stage right after Leadsom, Britain\u2019s luckiest escape, who had trilled wide-eyed: \u201cWe\u2019re selling coffee to Brazil, sparkling wine to France and naan bread to India.\u201d We were even, Andrea smiled excitedly, selling \u201cbottled English countryside air for up to \u00a380 a go\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"923ff9bbc0c4bc16ca9ee5c6faff4e66f96665cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/923ff9bbc0c4bc16ca9ee5c6faff4e66f96665cb/0_135_3695_2217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t worry, exports of naan bread will save the economy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t worry, exports of naan bread will save the economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Look, no one wants to let daylight in on tragic. But even cursory research reveals that the coffee claim amounts to a very small hill of beans we import from Brazil, then process and export back to Brazil in a deal worth the titchiest fraction of the coffee we buy in. The boomerang triumph can be traced back to a single company in Leighton Buzzard whose own general manager is at pains to stress <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37510315\">\u201cBoomerangs are obviously not exactly a huge market\u201d</a>, while the naans-to-India bit is a reference to <a href=\"http://www.dunstabletoday.co.uk/news/business/our-naan-is-so-good-we-re-taking-it-to-india-1-2193427\">one baker in Dunstable</a> who has invested in a factory outside Mumbai. Less than 2% of wine exported to France is English \u2013 around \u00a3940,000 worth \u2013 while we import \u00a3881m of the French stuff. Arguably, the crowning achievement of this vision of a post-Brexit trade bonanza is the guy selling the \u00a380 jars of \u201cfresh air\u201d to the Chinese. He turns out to be <a href=\"http://www.aethaer.com/\">a self-styled \u201cair farmer\u201d</a> with a website so pretentious it reads like a Chris Morris hoax, and who will only admit to having flogged around 300 units of his <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/fart-in-a-jar-and-sell-it-at-twice-the-price?utm_term=.ylA9DZn2w#.ilMbqWreE\">nonsensical product</a>.</p> <p>So those are your big bucks post-Brexit beacons, ranging from a boomerang-maker who would very much like you to commute your expectations, to some hipster chancer who has sold fewer than 300 empty jars to Chinese ironists.

At present, Johnson\u2019s magic mirror still tells him he is the fairest of all, but the suspicion must be that one day he will see Ruth Davidson\u2019s face smiling insolently back at him. The Scottish Tory leader is very much the coming draw, inevitably chosen to warm up for May\u2019s climactic speech, but whose open distaste for Johnson saw her gift us three of the more amusing slapdowns of the summer. The first was during the Question Time that came live from Wembley, when she interrupted some military posturing by Boris to sniff: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/7-times-ruth-davidson-told-8252001\">I think I\u2019m the only one on this panel who\u2019s ever worn the Queen\u2019s uniform.\u201d</a> The next saw her decline to even break stride as a reporter asked her about Boris crashing out of the race to succeed David Cameron, only smiling lightly that, \u201cLeadership is hard. It\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d And the third was Davidson\u2019s majestically off-colour joke to a Westminster reception, which characterised the post-result landscape thus: \u201cLabour is still fumbling with its flies while the Tories are enjoying their post-coital cigarette. After withdrawing our massive Johnson \u2026\u201d I\u2019m not saying the Tory crowds don\u2019t still love Boris.

  "<p>Romania has banned all trophy hunting of brown bears, wolves, lynx and wild cats in a surprise decision that gives Europe\u2019s largest population of large carnivores a reprieve from its most severe and immediate threat.</p> <p>The move on Tuesday reverses a trend which has seen the number of large carnivores being shot by hunters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/16/romanian-politician-calls-for-the-army-to-help-control-bear-population\">grow year on year</a> since Romania\u2019s accession into the European Union in 2007. In 2016, the largest hunting quotas yet gave hunters the mandate to shoot 550 bears, 600 wolves and 500 big cats over 12 months. </p> <p>Over the last decade, hunting has grown into a multimillion-euro industry in Romania, with hunters from all over the world paying up to \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,800) to claim a \u2018trophy\u2019 \u2013 hunting parlance for the carcass of a hunted animal \u2013 from the Carpathian mountains. </p> <p>The government has claimed that in order to exist, the industry relies on a loophole in European law which allows for the culling of wild animals that have been proven to be a danger to humans. Under the habitats directive, all large carnivores are protected in European Union member states, yet the state can order the killing of specific animals if shown to have attacked a person or damaged private property.</p> <p>\u201cHunting for money was already illegal, but it was given a green light anyway,\u201d environment minster, Cristiana Pasca-Palmer, told the Guardian. \u2018The damages [clause in the habitats directive] acted as a cover for trophy hunting.\u201d</p> <p>Each year, hundreds of hunting associations across the country would submit two numbers; the total population of each large carnivore species, and the total number which they believed to be likely to cause damages. The second number would then act as a basis for a government-issued hunting quota for each species. These quotas were then carved up between hunting companies and sold as hunting rights to the public. </p> <p>\u201cThis method raised some questions,\u201d says Pasca-Palmer. \u201cHow can hunting associations count how many animals are causing damages a priori \u2013 before the damages have happened? By introducing the ban, what we are doing is simply putting things back on the right track, as the habitats directive originally intended.\u201d</p> <p>Wildlife NGOs claim that the methodology also tended to dramatically overestimate the populations of large carnivores. The official figure for the number of bears in Romania is over 6,000, and for wolves is 4,000. Yet with hundreds of hunting associations each responsible for monitoring a small area of land, and animals prone to wandering, it is understood that individual animals were often counted multiple times, potentially pushing the total population statistics up by thousands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/16/romanian-politician-calls-for-the-army-to-help-control-bear-population\">Romanian politician calls for the army to help control bear population</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Announced late on Tuesday evening, the ban is expected to divide Romania\u2019s population, pitching rural and urban dwellers against each other. The government\u2019s decision has strong support in the larger cities, which have seen a growing movement against hunting in recent months. But in much of Romania\u2019s remote countryside large carnivores are a daily threat to villagers and a persistent nuisance to livestock farmers, and many see hunting as the only solution.</p> <p>Csaba Domokos, a bear specialist with wildlife protection NGO Milvus group, is convinced that the success or failure of the hunting ban rides on the government\u2019s ability to address the rural population\u2019s fears. </p> <p>\u201cDamages caused by large carnivores are a very real concern in the countryside,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system up until now did not work; hunting does not reduce conflicts between carnivores and humans; in fact many studies show that with wolves and large cats, it can actually increase the problem. </p> <p>\u201cBut the rural population believe that hunting is the answer, and unless they can be convinced otherwise, people may well start to take the problem into their own hands. The ban is a great step, but we don\u2019t want hunting to be replaced by poaching.\u201d</p> <p>Domokos points out that hunters also have a vested interested in the protection of their quarry. \u201cTo some extent, hunting acts as a financial incentive for wildlife management, from preventing poaching to conserving habitats. There is some concern that once you take that away, the government will not invest enough to replace it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eddcc9143d53cedd87d48e139734cf83d1daf98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eddcc9143d53cedd87d48e139734cf83d1daf98/0_0_5428_3539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hunters pay up to \u20ac10,000 to trophy hunt in the Carpathian mountains\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunters pay up to \u20ac10,000 to trophy hunt in the Carpathian mountains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Turner/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s response is to take management into its own hands.

  "<p>Workers in more than 30 US cities are planning to join a lunchtime protest at their local McDonald\u2019s stores on Thursday to draw attention to 15 different sexual complaints that have been filed against the company and its franchisees over the past month.</p> <p>The allegations, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claimed that in addition to experiencing sexual harassment on the job those who complained were often retaliated against. Complaints were filed in eight states: California, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Illinois, Missouri, Florida, New York. Fourteen of the complaints filed detail harassment occurring in franchise stores. While just one complaint is about harassment that took place in a corporate McDonald\u2019s store, all complaints name the company as joint employer. It is up to EEOC to determine whether McDonald\u2019s is jointly responsible for the harassment that occurs at its franchise stores. </p> <p>One of the 15 complaints was filed by Kristi Maisenbach, who used to work at McDonald\u2019s in Folsom, California. In her complaint, she alleged that her supervisor<strong> </strong>\u201cgrabbed [her] breasts on several occasions and would intentionally rub his genitals against [her] butt\u201d and sent her a text message offering $1,000 for oral sex. After Maisenbach complained to her general manager, she said her hours were reduced and she eventually quit to look for another job.</p> <p>Cycei Monae, a former McDonald\u2019s worker from Flint, Michigan, also filed a complaint alleging that her supervisor rubbed his genitals against her, complimented her body and said he wanted to \u201cdo things\u201d to her. Monae said that she reported the behavior to her store manager as well as McDonald\u2019s corporate office. </p> <p> \u201cMcDonald\u2019s monitors everything we do \u2013 from how fast the drive-thru is moving, to how we fold our customers\u2019 bags. Yet when I filed a complaint against my shift manager for regularly sexually harassing me \u2013 which included him showing me a photo of his genitals \u2013 McDonald\u2019s had no response,\u201d said Monae. </p> <p>Monae said that she quit because of the incessant harassment. </p> <p>\u201cI really needed that job and the money, and I considered remaining silent. But I believed McDonald\u2019s had my back and would be horrified by the way I was treated. I was wrong,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/oct/07/sexual-harassment-rife-restaurant-industry-women\">Restaurant industry rife with sexual harassment but bosses 'just laugh it off'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Protesters are calling for McDonald\u2019s to enforce its zero-tolerance sexual harassment policy.</p> <p>\u201cMcDonald\u2019s has zero tolerance for any form of sexual harassment of any employee,\u201d according to the McDonald\u2019s operations and training manual. \u201cSexual harassment is prohibited because it may be intimidating, an abuse of power and is inconsistent with McDonald\u2019s policies and management philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement provided to the Guardian, McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman Terri Hickey said: \u201cAt McDonald\u2019s, we and our independent owner-operators share a deep commitment to the respectful treatment of everyone. There is no place for harassment and discrimination of any kind in McDonald\u2019s restaurants or in any workplace. We take any concerns seriously and are reviewing the allegations.\u201d</p> <p>The workers plan to carry signs that read \u201cMcDonald\u2019s, Hands Off My Buns\u201d and \u201cMcDonald\u2019s, Put Some Respect in My Check\u201d. The protests are being organized by the Fight for $15 movement, which has been pushing for a $15 minimum wage and the right to unionize for all workers. According to the movement, the complaints filed were made by Fight for $15 activists.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s worth noting here that if these workers had a union that the process and the outcome would be a lot different,\u201d said Kendall Fells, organizing director at Fight for $15.\u201d If someone sent you a message offering you a $1,000 for oral sex, you would actually have a way on the job to handle that.\u201d </p> <p>This is not the first time that McDonald\u2019s has been named in sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC. </p> <p>In 2008, a Colorado-based owner of 25 McDonald\u2019s franchise stores settled an <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/4-7-08.cfm\">EEOC lawsuit for $505,000</a>. That lawsuit alleged that employees, who were 15 to 17 years old, were subject to sexual harassment that included supervisors biting their breasts, grabbing their rears, making sexual comments and offering favors in exchange for sex. </p> <p>In 2010 McDonald\u2019s itself settled <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/10-20-10d.cfm\">an EEOC sexual harassment suit</a> that alleged that a teenager was hugged, spanked and touched by his supervisor in a way that made him uncomfortable. That case, filed in New Jersey, was settled for $50,000.</p> <p>In 2012, another Milwaukee-based owner of 25 McDonald\u2019s franchise stores called Missoula Mac agreed to <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/7-18-12a.cfm\">pay $1m</a> to settle a similar complaint. In this case, female employees alleged that their male co-workers made sexual comments, touched them inappropriately and forced their hands on to the men\u2019s private parts. From the time that the EEOC filed a lawsuit in 2011 to when it was settled in 2012, Missoula Mac went from operating <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/4-13-11.cfm\">42 stores</a> to operating <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/7-18-12a.cfm\">25</a>.

Eleanor vows that this is the day she will initiate sex with Joe, her husband, and play a board game with her son, Timby. She will radiate calm, buy local, be her best self.

Eleanor\u2019s witchy ESP, developed from being the child of an alcoholic and hence highly attuned to body language and verbal tells, reads much into the receptionist\u2019s surprised \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d Joe has told his staff he\u2019s on vacation with his family. \u201cHad I lost him? Might there be someone else?\u201d Timby in tow, Eleanor embarks on an increasingly wild odyssey across Seattle in search of answers.</p> <p>The joy, as before, is in the narrative voice. Semple foregrounds forty- and fiftysomething women who have all the zest, poor impulse control and boiling emotion of 20-year-olds, only with added menopause and fear of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cWho feels sexy during the slog of motherhood, the middle-aged fat roll and flattening butt? Who wants anyone to see them naked, let alone fondle their breasts squishy like bags of cake batter, or touch their stomachs spongy like breadfruit?... Me, that\u2019s who, if I don\u2019t want to get switched out for a younger specimen.\u201d</p> <p>The day comprises a series of unwelcome shocks, including that dreaded call from the publisher, and a chance meeting with a former employee that brings Eleanor into contact with parts of her traumatic past she\u2019d much rather not access. Joe may have started lying, but it turns out Eleanor has her own skeletons. Timby, trotting out his simplistic school coping axioms, is a perfect sidekick, both wily and innocent. When Eleanor confesses, \u201cI just acted really weird and scary,\u201d her son replies: \u201cPut it behind you. Good job.\u201d</p> <p>Brilliant set pieces include a scene of existential despair in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/jun/05/costco-v-supermarkets-better-value\" title=\"\">CostCo</a>, a flashback to a hideous society wedding in the deep south, and Dr Joe\u2019s epiphany during a Seattle Seahawks game while attaching a splint to one of their star players. And the running gag about a concussion app just keeps on giving.</p> <p>Semple reaffirms her gift for creating memorable, monstrous characters. The most striking here is Bucky, the insufferable New Orleans groom, who turns from a Prada-clad figure of fun into a malevolent threat to the family. Once more, the harshly witty one-liners mask a surprisingly soft heart: will the family survive? Will love prevail? Will they all have to go and live in Spokane? \u201cNothing\u2019s keeping me in Seattle,\u201d Eleanor observes. \u201cI can draw and do damage anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>The narrative is more conventionally structured than <em>Bernardette</em>\u2019s grab-bag of letters, emails and police reports, but Semple is skilled in holding back revelations and planting clues to later emotional payoffs. Somehow she makes her seethingly intolerant and dissatisfied heroines lovable for all their flaws (Eleanor makes a list of hers which begins: \u201cOnce I ate a bagel on the toilet\u201d). The important thing is to persevere with the maddening business of being human. As Timby says, smell the soup (breathe in), cool the soup (breathe out).

Over the course of nine days, the couple, who are based in Brooklyn, pulled together volunteers from all over North America, organizing a 10-camera shoot on a micro-budget and sourcing hundreds of suits from thrift stores all over New York. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/185625717\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/185625717\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cI was feeling frustration that people have a hard time connecting to [Hillary Clinton] and feeling her humanity,\u201d said Rowlson-Hall, a choreographer, director and actor <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl6DrZCxid4\">whose debut feature Ma</a><em> </em>won the audience award at the 2015 <a href=\"http://www.afi.com/afifest/\">AFI film festival</a>. Kneeling at a coffee table in their Williamsburg apartment after an all-night session of editing, holding a half-eaten apple which she jokingly described as their collective breakfast, she told me, \u201cWe were tired of the narrative of the candidates being \u2018two sides of the same coin\u2019 with one as a lesser evil. We wanted to turn attention to the positive qualities of Hillary, and focus on the people in the United States that she and her campaign are including.\u201d </p> <p>Lidofsky, whose first TV series, <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/strangers-an-original-series-by-mia-lidofsky#/\">Strangers</a>, will premiere early next year on Refinery29, added, \u201cEver since Hillary announced her run for the presidency, there\u2019s been a heightened sense of sexism in the air and in the press. There\u2019s such a double standard in the media. They focus on her emails, her apparent lack of transparency, and how much she smiles and what she wears. And we wanted to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re behind you. And we wanted to pay homage to her pantsuits, as we think of them as her superhero costume. She\u2019s a superhero to us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Rowlson-Hall and Lidofsky met while both working on the set of Lena Dunham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/girls\">Girls</a><em>. </em>They belong to a vibrant community of young, creative women making their own way in an often male-driven film and television industry \u2013 the type of people, perhaps, that you might have expected to have supported Bernie Sanders. \u201cSo many of my friends were supporting Bernie and I wanted to make it clear that I was \u2018with her\u2019,\u201d said Lidofsky, with a nod to Clinton\u2019s campaign slogan. She cited Clinton\u2019s pragmatism and experience as the reason she voted for her in the primaries. \u201cShe\u2019s a warrior and a pioneer,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s been working for 35 years, and I look at that as a way to progressively and actively change the system, because she understands it.\u201d</p> <p>What a Clinton presidency would mean for America is something that Rowlson-Hall, whose work is always imbued with meticulous symbolism, gave careful consideration while choreographing for the flashmob. Each movement of the dance contains messages about issues at stake in this election, like a thumb and forefinger motion that represents an ovary and reproductive rights, or a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">Michelle Obama\u2019s speech at the Democratic national convention</a>: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c0279f7ece63efee38a77f95c6d9439c86d0f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c0279f7ece63efee38a77f95c6d9439c86d0f7c/144_53_1538_923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mia Lidofsky (left) and Celia Rowlson-Hall: \u2018Hillary\u2019s a superhero to us\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mia Lidofsky, left, and Celia Rowlson-Hall: \u2018Hillary\u2019s a superhero to us.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Crozier</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Participants in the dance travelled from as far as Toronto, and included US residents with green cards who couldn\u2019t vote, but wanted to \u201ccontribute to world peace\u201d. Men danced alongside women, and all ages were represented. In one sequence, the camera pans from a pregnant dancer to a woman dancing with her toddler on her hip.</p> <p>Children made the shoot seem even more crucial. \u201cThere was this moment when these little girls arrived in their soccer outfits to the rehearsal,\u201d said Rowlson-Hall, \u201cThey\u2019d just come from a game, and their moms had brought them to learn the dance. I started weeping. I thought, \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019re fighting for them\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The resulting video is an uplifting burst of energy, a tonic to the often negative and divisive tone of the election. \u201cWe believe that with empathy, the story can be changed,\u201d said Lidofsky, who as an LGBT woman found herself psychologically affected by the Orlando shooting this summer. \u201cFor the first time in my life [after Orlando], I felt like a target, and I felt that my partner and the love of my life was a target. A lot of our black friends have expressed that they were born into that fear. This video was about the message of love over hate, and reaching out to our communities and shining a light on how Hillary could support us, and how, in the end, your vote matters.\u201d</p> <p>Within a few hours, the first share of the video had been viewed 300,000 times on Facebook. Should one of those viewers include Hillary Clinton, Lidofsky and Rowlson-Hall had one message for her.</p> <p>\u201cHillary, we love you, we\u2019re with you, we\u2019ve got your back,\u201d said Lidofsky. </p> <p>\u201cAnd,\u201d added Rowlson-Hall, laughing, \u201cwe will choreograph your inauguration entrance.\u201d</p>",

Still later it was revealed that much of the money was not distributed to veterans\u2019 groups until after the paper raised questions about the whereabouts of the donations.</p> <h2>Who is investigating the allegations?</h2> <p>The New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/donald-trump-foundation-donations-new-york\"> issued a notice </a>this week after the Post reported that the charity did not have the correct paperwork to solicit donations. </p> <p>According to the notice, the Trump foundation must immediately cease fundraising and soliciting contributions in the state, wrote James Sheehan, the head of the charities bureau in Schneiderman\u2019s office. The foundation has 15 days to provide the bureau with the proper documentation and paperwork, including delinquent financial reports for previous years, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. Failure to do so \u201cshall be deemed a continuing fraud upon the people of New York\u201d, Sheehan wrote.</p> <p>In a statement, campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks replied: \u201cWhile we remain very concerned about the political motives behind AG Schneiderman\u2019s investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation. Because this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Last month Schneiderman, a Democrat supporting Hillary Clinton, launched a broad investigation into the Trump Foundation amid a string of reports that raised questions over its practices. Schneiderman is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/eric-schneiderman-trump-university-fraud-223812\">also suing the Republican nominee </a>over Trump University, alleging that the businessman ran a fraudulent online education program that bilked students. </p> <h2>What does this mean for Trump?</h2> <p>It\u2019s not yet clear how this will affect Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions.

A slate of recent national and battleground state polls show that support for Trump has dropped, giving Clinton a significant lead.</p> <p>The controversy around Trump\u2019s foundation came up during Tuesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate.

May used her main speech to the party faithful on Wednesday to reject both the small-state libertarianism of her own party\u2019s rightwing and the socialist left.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\">Theresa May's Conservative party conference speech \u2013 key points analysed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, she laid down the rhetoric for a more interventionist approach, in which the Conservative government was ready to pull the levers of government in an attempt to improve people\u2019s lives. The move, which could be seen as another break from the more laissez faire messaging of the former chancellor George Osborne, does have echoes of a different set of very un-Conservative politicians.</p> <p>May\u2019s promises to reform companies and examine ways of regulating labour markets to help employees in the gig economy could have easily have been made by Ed Miliband; and Philip Hammond\u2019s decisions to ditch Osborne\u2019s surplus target and pave the way for targeted investment spending could easily have been made by Ed Balls. May might have dismissed Labour as the \u201cnasty party\u201d but she borrowed its language to make her case.</p> <p>The prime minister came to Birmingham with a new style, too. Her team planned to run a tight ship, with both No 10 and Hammond\u2019s departments running the slide-rule over every other minister\u2019s conference speech, to root out headline-grabbing stunts or unfunded spending pledges.</p> <p>One minister asked to meet away from the conference site to avoid being spotted by wandering Downing Street eyes. Others said they had been told not to appear at too many fringe meetings and, if they must, to avoid making waves. </p> <p>May\u2019s quip that Boris Johnson had \u201cjust about\u201d stayed on message for four days was a joke \u2013 sort of. If in doubt, the answer from May\u2019s ministers to any tricky question appeared to be \u201cwe\u2019re studying the evidence\u201d.</p> <p>And while Cameron was surrounded by friends in government, May\u2019s closest cabinet allies described a professional working relationship, with one admitting \u201cbuddies\u201d was not the right way to describe the link. May would like her government to be seen as workmanlike, cautious, technocratic, in another break from the past.</p> <p>In Birmingham, the efforts to control from the centre were unquestionably effective, with almost every news story emerging from the ICC planned and on message. There were none of the usual conference missteps that had journalists tailing politicians around with questions about Autocues or the rights of cats.</p> <p>With May\u2019s Tory honeymoon still well under way in Birmingham, her \u201cless is more\u201d approach with the media worked well. </p> <p>But there was also a cautious welcome from the minority of members who said they were committed Cameroons. One young woman said she had joined the party for gay marriage and would be ready to leave if May chose a more illiberal direction.</p> <p>The moderniser MPs are watching closely too, and at times in alarm. One said they were appalled by the headlines generated from the conference. Those liberal Tories represent another break from the past, which May might not welcome so readily.</p> <p>While Cameron had to deal with the complaints of rightwing, Eurosceptic MPs on his backbenches who are now cheered by Brexit, May has to deal with a new group organising behind her. This breed of modernising Conservatives have not left, and will be watching every move as she navigates Britain\u2019s thorny path out of the European Union.</p>",

May offered a vision that was a radical break from Thatcherism. She said: \u201cThere is more to life than individualism and self-interest,\u201d as if rebuking the notorious claim that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-quotes\">\u201cthere is no such thing as society\u201d</a>. While Thatcher\u2019s ally Ronald Reagan always insisted that government was the problem, May said it could be \u201cpart of the solution\u201d.</p> <p>She made the case for an active state, intervening where the market had failed. She praised Clement Attlee, the NHS and the BBC. She made a moral argument for rich people to pay their taxes. She called the housing market \u201cdysfunctional\u201d, and promised that the government would start building houses. While she was at it, she denounced modern slavery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/11/uk-police-forces-still-abusing-stop-and-search-powers\">stop-and-search</a> and institutional racism.</p> <p>The political pitch was clear: to promise onetime Labour voters that they could have everything they used to value in Labour, without backing what had become \u2013 in a neat reverse of her past verdict on her own political tribe - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/08/uk.conservatives2002\">\u201cthe nasty party\u201d</a>. For it was, she said, the Tories who were now the party of the workers, the NHS and of public servants.</p> <p>It was bold, even shameless. Thanks to Brexit, it may also prove hollow \u2013 since exiting the EU will threaten many of the things about Britain she boasted of. (How long will Britain boast three of the world\u2019s 10 best universities when foreign students are discouraged from coming here?)

A million have been sacked, and the rest suffer the harshest pay downgrade ever.</p> <p>Yes, this powerful speech will be remembered and May will be reminded of these words every step of the way. Will she halt the disastrous \u00a313bn benefit cuts still to come, especially to tax credits of her \u201cjust-about-managing\u201d families, whose incomes will fall sharply? Will she stop the great giveaways to the \u201cprivileged few\u2019, in inheritance tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax bonanzas?

  "<p>Insurance companies and pension funds are at risk of becoming insolvent if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/lower-interest-rates-failed-spending-retirement\">ultra-low interest rates </a>persist for a prolonged period, the International Monetary Fund has warned.</p> <p>After almost eight years in which central banks have kept borrowing costs at record lows in an attempt to boost growth, the IMF said an over-reliance on monetary policy could have unwanted side-effects.</p> <p>It used its half-yearly health check of the global financial system to advise that the calmer-than-expected conditions since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote might not last.</p> <p>While short-term risks had abated over the past six months, the IMF said big challenges remained \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/negative-interest-rates-the-case-against-john-maynard-keynes\">the impact of record-low interest rates on pension funds and insurance companies</a>, the fragility of banks, rapid credit growth in China and the heavy indebtedness of the corporate sector in emerging countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe solvency of many life insurance companies and pension funds is threatened by a prolonged period of low interest rates,\u201d the IMF said in its global financial stability report (GFSR).</p> <p>\u201cLow interest rates add to the legacy challenges facing many insurance companies and pension funds, along with those from ageing populations and low or volatile asset returns. Heightened concern over these important long-term saving and investment institutions could encourage even greater saving, adding to financial and economic stagnation pressures.\u201d</p> <p>The GFSR said regulators and supervisors needed to take prompt action to sustain the strength of insurance company and pension fund balance sheets, including identifying risks of insolvency and funding gaps. \u201cMany pension funds face funding gaps, where the present value of future liabilities exceeds the market value of their assets,\u201d the IMF said.</p> <p>Poor profitability continued to blight Europe\u2019s banks, the GFSR said, noting that a third would remain weak even if growth accelerated from the low levels recorded since the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09.</p> <p>For the west as a whole, 25% of banks with assets of $11.7tn (\u00a39.21tn) would remain in poor shape after a cyclical recovery. Since the start of the year, the market capitalisation of western banks had fallen by almost $430bn, strengthening the case for tackling vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\u201cMore deep-rooted reforms and systemic management are needed, especially for European banks,\u201d the IMF said. It said the number of bank branches in Europe should be reduced, while stronger measures were needed to tackle the high level of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/european-banks-prepare-for-possible-shockwaves-from-stress-test-results\">non-performing loans.</a> Together, the two changes would add a net $180bn to the capital position of Europe\u2019s banks, allowing them better to support growth.<br></p> <p>The GFSR said the shock of Brexit had initially led to turbulence in financial markets, but they had subsequently shrugged off concerns about the risks to the UK from leaving the EU.</p> <p>But it said the medium-term outlook was less rosy, with a need to look beyond monetary stimulus from central banks towards a stronger mix of policies to strengthen the foundations of the global position. The GFSR said this could help avoid financial stagnation and protectionism, which would reduce global growth by around three percentage points over the next five years.</p> <p>Low interest rates raised the present value of existing long-term liabilities, steadily eroding capital and solvency buffers the longer the low-rate environment persists.<br></p> <p>\u201cA protracted period of low and negative policy rates and yields could undermine financial resilience in the medium term, but the risks of increased headwinds may materialise more immediately,\u201d the IMF said, adding that falling share prices were likely to put pressure on banks to curtail lending until early 2018.</p> <p>\u201cIn many European countries, a more complete solution to address legacy bank problems can no longer be postponed. Specifically, both the high level of nonperforming loans and rising strains on profitability require urgent and comprehensive action.\u201d The IMF identified Italy and Portugal as particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>While fears of a market meltdown after the Brexit vote had not materialised, there was a risk of the City losing business as a result of the decision to leave the EU, according to the report.</p> <p>\u201cThe post-referendum bout of market volatility faded after central banks responded promptly; no major disorderly market events surfaced, other than a sharp sell-off in some UK-based real estate funds,\u201d the GFSR said.<br></p> <p>\u201cYet the biggest challenges remain ahead. The shape of future trade arrangements and the uncertain impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom\u2019s large and globally integrated financial system have created uncertainty over the longer-term financial prospects of the United Kingdom. There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future arrangements and the implications for the UK financial sector.\u201d <br></p>",

  "<p>Poland is unlikely to back Donald Tusk\u2019s bid to stay on as president of the European council, the head of the country\u2019s governing rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS) has said, in a move that could destabilise the EU during Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine the government will back Donald Tusk for a second term,\u201d Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the former prime minister and Poland\u2019s de facto kingmaker, told the Polska Times newspaper. \u201cIs this the sort of person who should remain at the head of the European council?

One of the men later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/14/newsoftheworld.pressandpublishing\">won a libel action</a> against the newspaper.</p> <p>In 2004, Mahmood joined forces with the Metropolitan police anti-terrorist branch in order to expose three supposed terrorists seeking to build a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d. Mahmood agreed to supply them with a non-existent substance called \u201cred mercury\u201d. Two years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/31/newsoftheworld.newspaperformats\">their trial also collapsed</a>.</p> <p>Along the way, many people were jailed because of Mahmood\u2019s stories, though nothing like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/aug/20/mazher-mahmood-sundaytimes\">261 he claimed during the Leveson inquiry</a>. He was later forced to testify that lawyers acting for his employer, News UK, could find proof of only 94 prosecutions, and not all had gone to prison. <br></p> <p>Mahmood\u2019s career began as a schoolboy in Birmingham, helping his parents, both journalists, produce Urdu-language papers for the local Asian community. </p> <p>When he was 18 he exposed family friends for selling pirate videos. It proved to be a stepping stone to the Sunday People, where he impressed the head of investigations, Laurie Manifold, with his undercover reporting skills.</p> <p>He later spent a year on the Sunday Times but departed under a cloud in 1988 following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/dec/14/mazher-mahmood-sundaytimes\">an attempt to cover up an error</a>. After a spell as a TV researcher and producer, he joined the News of the World in 1991, where he enjoyed considerable success.</p> <p>Mahmood was noted for being a self-starter, coming up with his own story ideas and gradually building his own team of helpers separate from the regular staff. </p> <p>He was obsessed with personal secrecy, refusing to allow his photograph to be published on the grounds that his life was in danger because of threats from criminals he had exposed. Instead, a silhouette was used alongside his byline. In so doing, he created a mystique and editors came to regard him with awe.</p> <p>There can be no doubt that he was responsible for highlighting a great deal of low-level corruption, particularly involving Asian immigrants using fake passports or taking part in bogus marriages.</p> <p>But by the late 1990s, questions were being raised about his methods, with some of his victims contending that they had been persuaded to buy drugs.</p> <p>In 1997, Mahmood reported that a young actor, John Alford, then starring in the TV show London\u2019s Burning, had supplied him with cocaine and cannabis. At his subsequent trial, Alford complained that he had been entrapped, having been fooled by elaborate subterfuge. Although the judge agreed, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/353259.stm\">he sentenced Alford to nine months in jail</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d09730949f4c356310d5b4ac3993ec2179883de9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d09730949f4c356310d5b4ac3993ec2179883de9/0_303_1854_1112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Alford in 1999\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Alford in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter J Jordan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years later, another Mahmood \u201cvictim\u201d, the Earl of Hardwicke, made a similar complaint when he was on trial for obtaining drugs at Mahmood\u2019s behest. The jury convicted Hardwicke but took the extraordinary step of sending a note to the judge saying: \u201cHad we been allowed to take the extreme provocation into account, we would undoubtedly have reached a different verdict.\u201d</p> <p>The judge appeared to agree by giving Hardwicke and his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/sep/27/newsoftheworld.mondaymediasection\">suspended prison sentences</a>. The News of the World responded by criticising the judge for not sending them to jail.</p> <p>Mahmood\u2019s modus operandi came under closer attention in 2005 when Gashi turned against Mahmood and decided to speak out, claiming to have been \u201cresponsible for innocent for people going to jail\u201d. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/17/newsoftheworld.pressandpublishing\">told the Guardian</a>: \u201cI tricked them, and I\u2019m ashamed. It\u2019s time to tell the truth.\u201d </p> <p>He then gave evidence for the three men prosecuted for the dirty bomb plot, one of the Beckham kidnap accused and another victim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/jan/31/newsoftheworld-mazher-mahmood\">Besnik Qema</a>. In all three cases, Gashi admitted to having instigated the crimes. </p> <p>Mahmood suffered an embarrassing reverse in 2006 when he targeted George Galloway, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/29/newsoftheworld.pressandpublishing\">who saw through his disguise</a>. The then MP denounced Mahmood as an \u201cagent provocateur\u201d for trying to coax him into making antisemitic comments.</p> <p>At the time, Mahmood was under investigation by Scotland Yard following Gashi\u2019s about-turn. But those inquiries fizzled out and he went on leading what seemed like a charmed life.</p> <p>That came to an end at the Old Bailey. Now he is likely to see more courtrooms in future because lawyers representing 25 of his past victims are preparing to launch civil actions against him. The days of the \u201cFake Sheikh\u201d are well and truly over.</p>",

It is no surprise she admires elements of Thatcher\u2019s leadership but the reference to Labour\u2019s Attlee, the architect of the welfare state, is a more unusual choice for a Conservative. The speech has shown she is ideologically difficult to place, with rightwing policies on immigration and education, a left-leaning attack on the excesses of corporatism and a populist attack on elites who do not listen to ordinary voters. However, there was very little concrete new policy to back any of this up.</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>When it comes to British living space, how small is too small? How cramped is too cramped? How poky, is, ultimately, far too poky for comfortable human habitation?</p> <p>The way things are going, we could soon see. Tory housing minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/19/a-quick-guide-to-new-housing-and-planning-minister-gavin-barwell\" title=\"\">Gavin Barwell</a> has a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/housing-crisis-gavin-barwell-flats-smaller-pocket-a7344061.html\" title=\"\">possible answer to our housing crisis</a>, and it involves relaxing the regulations on how cramped a flat or house can be, so that young people can afford to get on the property ladder. In the absence of any solid ideas as to what the government might do to solve our ticking time bomb of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/aug/05/those-who-deny-the-housing-crisis-can-no-longer-conceal-their-idiocy-resolution-foundation\" title=\"\">housing situation</a>, Barwell wants the private sector to \u201cinnovate\u201d solutions to the crisis. Such is our obsession with owning property in this country, of course, that assisting first-time buyers in scraping together enough capital to invest in a coffin-sized \u201cexistence pod\u201d of their own is far more of a priority than, say, instigating rent control, reining in buy-to-let baby boomers, penalising foreign investors and second-home owners who leave their properties empty, legalising squatting, building more houses (especially on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2015/dec/08/building-on-green-belt-relax-laws-starter-homes\" title=\"\">green belt</a> golf courses), and introducing legislation that makes renting out slum-like properties to poor people for extortionate rates a criminal offence.</p> <p>Of course, a governing party that is itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jan/14/mp-landlords-number-risen-quarter-last-parliament-housing-bill\" title=\"\">crammed full of buy-to-let landlords</a> that last year opted out of legislation stipulating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/tories-reject-move-to-ensure-rented-homes-fit-for-human-habitation\" title=\"\">rental properties should be fit for human habitation</a> is somewhat unlikely to introduce such measures.</p> <p>We have a saying, us youngish people, and it\u2019s not one especially suitable for a family newspaper. It is a metaphor pertaining to the wisdom of not defecating in close proximity to the locale in which one might also consume food. But if the Tories have their way and building regulations can be circumvented so that tiny flats can be constructed, many more of us may indeed end up in that very situation.</p> <p>Even more insulting is the insinuation from Barwell that many potential first-time buyers are not acutely aware that what we can afford is technically known by estate agents as \u201csweet sod all\u201d. Does he assume that we spend our time looking at lavish palaces on Zoopla and that all that is required of our generation is that we simply lower our unrealistic expectations?</p> <p>Perhaps he is unaware that our expectations are already so low that taking a tour of them would give a figure in a Hieronymus Bosch painting decompression sickness. If Barwell had wanted to know just how small is too small, he could have asked my friend and colleague who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/11/living-airing-cupboard-housing-crisis-rent\" title=\"\">lived in my airing cupboard</a> for several months. Or the person who ended up inhabiting the attic I viewed in north London that you couldn\u2019t stand up straight in but which, I was assured, was very warm because it was next to the boiler. He could have asked the guy I know who shares a double bed with his (straight, male) friend, or the other guy I know who, as a property guardian, is paying \u00a3500 a month to share a bath with 35 other people. I\u2019m sure whoever ended up renting that much-shared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/03/shoebox-studio-flat-london-renters-hours\" title=\"\">studio flat for \u00a3737 a month</a> could tell him how small is too small, or indeed one of the many dodgy landlords renting out overcrowded houses in risible conditions to migrant workers across the country.</p> <p>In order to really get his point across, Barwell\u2019s speech waxing lyrical about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/dec/19/pocket-size-flats-young-first-time-buyer\" title=\"\">\u201cpocket housing\u201d</a> should have, to my mind, been accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation consisting of the childhood homes and property holdings of the entire Tory government, while the saccharine tones of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_2lGkEU4Xs\" title=\"\">Malvina Reynolds\u2019s 1962 classic Little Boxes</a> jingled in the background.Or, perhaps, as a chorus line of renters such as myself tap-danced across the conference stage singing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q671QIDeH-U\" title=\"\">Wouldn\u2019t it Be Loverly</a> in mockney accents, complete with jazz hands.</p> <p>Britain already builds the smallest homes in Europe. A one-bedroom flat averages at 500sq ft \u2013 about the size of a tube carriage \u2013 while Barwell\u2019s favoured developer, <a href=\"https://www.pocketliving.com/\" title=\"\">Pocket Living,</a> sells 400sq ft flats for a quarter of a million pounds apiece. The Royal Institute of British Architects says that more than half of new houses built are too small for families to live in (it\u2019s a bit of a mystery where all these \u201chome-grown\u201d workers our Brexit-mad government keeps going on about are actually going to, well, grow up). The average home in Denmark is twice as big as one of ours already. It\u2019s a shameful state of affairs unlikely to be remedied by one of the stupidest policy suggestions to come out of the housing crisis thus far.</p>",
  "<p>This weekend, as Donald Trump went into freefall so drastic and self-defeating we had to wonder if <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">he was the one</a> who mailed his tax forms to the New York Times, his campaign sent out a supposed elder statesman to defend him: Rudy Giuliani.</p> <p>That Giuliani should be viewed as a credible and authoritative voice is as laughable as Trump\u2019s combover.</p> <p>To people around the world, Giuliani may still seem like a paragon of leadership, the man who saved New York City in the dark days after the twin towers fell 15 years ago. But if you can cast your mind back to those days, you\u2019ll also remember how he crudely tried to manipulate the fear of that moment in a naked power grab. Giuliani <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121313&amp;page=1\">considered running for a third term</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/04/nyregion/giuliani-says-he-won-t-seek-a-third-term.html\">delaying his departure</a> from office (despite the law).</p> <p>And if you think of how people love to say that Giuliani\u2019s follies can be excused by the fact that he \u201cmade New York safe\u201d, remember: his signature technique, \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, is a fraud, and he did not make it safe for young black and Hispanic men, for the mentally ill, or for the poor.</p> <p>It is frightening to hear Trump say he wants to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/09/21/trump-calls-for-national-stop-and-frisk-policy-for-cops-does-it-work/\">develop a national stop and frisk policy</a>, in which police are encouraged to stop and search people all the time, because it threatens the fourth amendment and will lead to more racial profiling. But it\u2019s even more chilling to hear Giuliani still touting it and lying that <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/09/28/giuliani_stop_frisk_blind.php\"> it saved black lives</a>. Under Giuliani, the NYPD ramped up this controversial practice, which is currently under federal monitoring for unfairly targeting young black and brown men <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/01/politics/fact-check-stop-and-frisk/\">and for being unconstitutional \u201cas applied\u201d</a>. Crime has gone down in New York City even as the use of this ruinous technique has <a href=\"http://www.nyclu.org/content/stop-and-frisk-data\">decreased</a>, so reliance on it was meaningless except as a form of social control.</p> <p>While Giuliani was mayor, the NYPD\u2019s use of stop and frisk led to the arrest of the most people ever arrested for marijuana in a single year, despite the <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/young-mens-initiative-the-white-mayors-burden-6433075\">decriminalization</a> of small amounts of pot in 1977: <a href=\"http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Levine_NYC_MJ_Arrest_Crusade_Continues_Sept_2009.pdf\">more than 50,000 people were arrested in 2000</a>, Giuliani\u2019s penultimate year in office. Of those, 85% were black or Hispanic, <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/young-mens-initiative-the-white-mayors-burden-6433075\">even though</a> \u2013 according to the NYPD\u2019s own data \u2013 \u201cwhites demonstrate slightly higher rates of contraband\u201d when stopped.</p> <p>Years before he called the Black Lives Matter movement \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/rudy-giuliani-black-kids-99-chance-killing-article-1.2706349\">inherently racist</a>\u201d, or said that \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/rudy-giuliani-black-kids-99-chance-killing-article-1.2706349\">there\u2019s a 99% chance</a>\u201d black children will kill each other, he was making life hell for the families of victims of police violence. For example, when Patrick Dorismond was killed after he rebuffed requests from undercover police asking where they could buy marijuana (the same year, remember, as the record marijuana arrests occurred), Giuliani <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,41921,00.html\">said Dorismond was</a> \u201cno altar boy\u201d and said a charge he once faced as a child over a fistfight (later dropped) \u201cmay justify, more closely, what the police officer did\u201d. (As Politico <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-2016-214207#ixzz4M3mCX6ee\">reported</a>, despite the post-mortem smear, it emerged that Dorismond was an alumnus of the same Catholic school Giuliani attended, and that he had in fact been an altar boy.)</p> <p>Then there was Giuliani\u2019s war on the homeless. While he was running for Senate (before dropping out) in the fall of 1999, \u201cGiuliani ordered that all \u2018able-bodied\u2019 homeless people must go to work or risk losing their city-provided shelter and possibly their children to foster care,\u201d <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,35839,00.html\">Time reported</a>. And if you want to understand how so much of American life has become criminalized for the poor, consider how Giuliani <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/20/nyregion/in-wake-of-attack-giuliani-cracks-down-on-homeless.html\">said</a> the right to sleep on the streets \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist anywhere\u201d, raising the prospect of those who were unable to find shelter being arrested.</p> <p>If Trump wants an elder statesman who shows that his team is full of calm, steady, thoughtful people, Giuliani is hardly the face he needs. But if Trump wants to show who he is and how he\u2019d lead, then this aggressive, offensive purveyor of failed policies maybe is a good spokesman for him after all.</p>",
  "<h2>Amsterdam, the Netherlands: \u2018When scarcity is applauded, that\u2019s very wrong\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cHere gentrification happens very quickly. Every month some \u2018nice\u2019 restaurant or shop opens. The old name of my neighbourhood (Kinkerbuurt) was changed and rebranded to \u2018Hallenkwartier\u2019. I would enjoy many of the changes if I knew others could enjoy it as well. But poor people have to leave, social housing is sold off, and rich people and tourists move in.</p> <p>There was a squatting action, a demonstration and protests against the rebranding of the neighbourhood. I have seen posters and banners on houses. But the city council is just selling off social housing. Waiting time for a house in this neighbourhood used to be eight years, now it is 18 years. The biggest ruling party has even worse plans; they want to give the social houses only to working people, saying jobless people should leave the city.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe what Amsterdam has become, it was very different 10 years ago (I\u2019ve lived here for 22 years). Generally rent is easier to control with rent caps than housing prices, so this ideal of having property should be discouraged. We have a great tradition of social housing corporations in the Netherlands \u2013 some cities had 50% social housing. Now the whole way of thinking is about extracting money, not creating communities. When prices go up, they say \u2018the market is doing well\u2019.

We should also have rent controlled apartments and a centralised office, like in Paris, that decides a price ceiling for every rental apartment in the city.</p> <p>This is a turning point. The city is becoming an entirely segregated, exclusive place. Local and national governments are doing nothing to stop this happen. The issue of gentrification has been dismissed or called collateral damage. Some activist groups have been stirring the waters, but it is very difficult to fight the power of money especially when it\u2019s supported by government.\u201d <em tabindex=\"-1\">(Catarina)</em></p> <h2>Newcastle, UK: \u2018I want to believe that cities can be both regenerated and inclusive\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cTwenty-five years ago there were riots near where I live, in the west end of Newcastle. Fifteen years ago there was talk of demolition. Now, after regeneration efforts, we\u2019ve got cleaner streets, reduced crime, and a revived local economy - due in no small part to immigration, by the way. The housing crisis is a scandal. But conflating it with regeneration, and damning cafes, cycle lanes, enterprise and opportunity as \u2018gentrification\u2019 runs the risk of undermining efforts to make places better. It also lets our policy makers, whose actions are making matters worse, off the hook.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has a slogan called \u2018Building a new Chicago\u2019; what does that mean? There is already a Chicago here. There is obviously an agenda to gentrify and attract tourists to make Chicago a \u2018global city\u2019. We should be subsidising affordable housing, instead of downtown hotels. We need rent control and eviction laws. As a lifelong resident of the north-west side of Chicago, I\u2019m afraid of there coming a day when I don\u2019t recognise my neighbourhood, when the stores, the people, the library are all gone.

The city has taken some steps to keep prices down (for instance by capping rent increases) but this has also ignited the popularity of Airbnb and similar sites, where renters can take advantage of these laws by paying low rents themselves, but making huge profits through short-term rentals. This then takes a number of apartments off the market, increasing rent prices and shortages. </p> <p>An acquaintance has rented four flats at a low rate, and rents them all out through Airbnb. It\u2019s become a very profitable full-time job for him. The city has put some restrictions on the amount of days you can rent your property, but these are apparently easy to evade and not well enforced. The city is still catching up to the use of new technologies. Rent caps and restrictions on Airbnb are a start, but they need to be more strictly enforced.\u201d <em>(Daniel)</em></p> <h2>Somerville, US: \u2018We need more community control of land\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cGentrification is out of control here in Somerville, Massachusetts.

Its negative effect such as displacement of people should be tackled by a housing plan that includes affordable apartments for rent inside more expensive buildings, sponsored by the state. Displacement of poor people out of gentrified neighbourhoods is a serious issue here: people have to move to housing projects that are located 50km away from the city centre. But land developers are not to blame, they respond to the free trade economy.

I\u2019m from a working-class background and have always worked. Affordable housing has always been an issue for my friends and family. No one wanted to live here when I first moved in, but now it is considered a highly desirable area. We have seen the mass selling-off of council flats on the estate to property developers, the private and buy-to-rent markets. This has put a lot of pressure on tenants like myself, with our homes constantly under threat as the council tries to find ways to evict or move you out of the area to free up properties to sell, creating anxiety and vulnerability.</p> <p>What gets forgotten is that we have a diverse community of people in my block who know each other and help each other out. My experience of people who have bought flats is that they don\u2019t actually want to live in a diverse community. Shop prices have gone up locally, expensive coffee shops and restaurants have opened. It has created a class and race divide that didn\u2019t exist here before. The tenants\u2019 association has been good at campaigning to stop flats from being demolished to make space for luxury apartments \u2013 but they\u2019ve been unable to stop the sell-off of flats.

But there is a district called Goutte d\u2019Or which is maybe one of the last areas in the inner city trying to resist it. Despite the loss of some of the shops and communities which create the identity of this area, there are a few initiatives that are trying to resist the present trend. In order to preserve the ethnic and social diversity in Goutte d\u2019Or, the city has been trying to slow down the process of gentrification by developing social housing. One third of the flats created were reserved for emergency housing, one third for regular social housing and one third for middle class \u201cpioneers\u201d. This policy has been criticised for dragging the middle class in to this area and increasing real estate prices.</p> <p>Gentrification is a natural trend but it has to be regulated especially in a multicultural and socially divided city such as Paris. This city is very rich in terms of diversity, but this is now being threatened, especially because private housing is deregulated and many foreigners are investing in real estate, making prices grow artificially. I think people who own flats and leave them empty should be taxed, and the city council should encourage owners to transform unused spaces such as abandoned offices into residential units to create more offers on the market.\u201d <em>(Alexia Chauliac)</em></p> <h2>Callao, Peru: \u2018The government here doesn\u2019t even know what gentrification is\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cCallao is a city full of history and traditions and is undergoing a process of gentrification, specifically in the historic centre.

  "<p>Theresa May\u2019s speech on Wednesday may turn out to be the most revealing of the party conference but after three days quite a lot has already emerged about the state of the Conservative party. Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learned.</p> <p><strong>1: Brexit will be at the harder end of the scale. </strong>This was signalled in Theresa May\u2019s speech on Sunday and \u2013 judging not least by the market reaction \u2013 it is the most important takeaway from the whole conference. Ministers still seem uncertain as to exactly what they want, but the Norway/Switzerland models (soft Brexit) are out and, although May is not planning to simply walk away and slam the door (the hardest possible Brexit) she will prioritise getting control over immigration over single market membership. Brexiters strongly object to the terms hard/soft on the grounds that they are loaded, because hard implies bad (clean/dirty is one alternative formula they prefer), but this terminology is not unreasonable. Economists believe disengaging from the single market will have negative consequences.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live\">Conservative conference: Theresa May's speech - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>2: The Conservative party is largely united behind May on Brexit \u2013 but it is complacent about the risks. </strong>From what has been said in the conference hall, and on the fringe, you could easily forget that the party was split down the middle on the EU four months ago because now the Tories seem remarkably unified. According to <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2016/10/brexit-members-survey-todays-conservativehome-conference-newspaper-in-full.html\">a ConservativeHome poll,</a> 76% of members back the harder Brexit May is offering. But there is a considerable disconnect between Toryworld, where many members are convinced that all forecasts about Brexit being bad for the economy are just wrong, and reality, where May\u2019s speech sent the pound tumbling. Two figures who are not complacent are May herself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\">who has been warning about \u201cbumps in the road\u201d</a>, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who used his speech on Monday to try to warn his party about potential bad news ahead.</p> <p><strong>3: City and business opinion does not matter to the Tory leadership as much as it used to.</strong> Traditionally the Conservative party has been quite deferential towards the City and business but now the tone is different. \u201cCity delegates stranded on Planet Tory for the duration of the party conference report the atmosphere has turned toxic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7133664a-8a29-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">the Financial Times\u2019 Lombard column reports.</a> A Bloomberg story saying <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-03/may-said-to-downgrade-city-in-brexit-shock-for-financial-sector\">the City would get no special favours in the Brexit negotiations</a> caused alarm (even though it was denied), and then Amber Rudd, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on work visas <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/79577/business-backlash-against-amber-rudds-fresh-immigration\">that prompted a strong business backlash.</a> In government, Hammond is fighting to protect business interests in the Brexit talks although, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1703845213273550\">in a perceptive Facebook post,</a> ITV\u2019s <strong>Robert Peston</strong> says the conference shows \u201cthe Treasury, in the May government, is less powerful than it\u2019s been for many decades\u201d.<br></p> <p><strong>4: May seems serious about defining herself as a centre-ground politician \u2013 although so far there is little evidence to show that she will be very different from her predecessor.</strong> It is commonplace for political leaders serious about power to argue that they represent the centre ground, or that the centre ground has moved towards them, but May is finding it easier to make this case than David Cameron because for most his premiership the centre ground was taken by his coalition partners, the Lib Dems. However, so far, we have yet to see a big policy shift that makes this real. When Nick Robinson challenged her on Tuesday to show her commitment to working people by axing inheritance tax cuts (which only help the wealthy), or higher public sector pay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b#block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b\">May ducked for cover.</a> </p> <p><strong>5: The Tories aren\u2019t very worried about Labour \u2013 but that has not stopped them annexing some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy territory.</strong> In some respects competitive party politics is quite simple; all you have to do is attack your opponents\u2019 bad ideas, pinch their good ones, and make sure you have the sense to tell which is which. The Tories have done that this week, hijacking some of the soundest aspects of the Corbyn agenda: a slower timetable for balancing the budget, reviewing whether employment laws suit the modern workplace, and a migration impact fund. Some Labour figures think that, if the Tories are on their turf, that will help Corbyn, but that is not necessarily so because, on the economy and immigration, the Tories are more trusted than Labour. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tories-should-be-worried-and-not-celebrating-robert-halfon-minister-mp-a7342636.html\">The Tory MP Robert Halfon gave an interesting speech saying his party should worry about Corbyn\u2019s ability to inspire young voters,</a> but he has been a lone voice and generally the Conservatives are not taking the threat from Corbyn seriously at all. </p> <p><strong>6: Next year\u2019s most important election may well be the West Midlands mayoral one.</strong> Labour is expected to win the mayoral elections in Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region next year quite easily, but the contest in the West Midlands could turn out to be gripping. The Tories have used the conference to promote their candidate, the outgoing John Lewis boss Andy Street, and Street says that he just needs a 4% swing from the general election results to win. Given that the West Midlands is one of the regions where general elections are often decided, this will be a key test for Corbyn\u2019s Labour versus May\u2019s Conservatives.<br></p> <p><strong>7: The Tories have ditched the Cameron era quite ruthlessly. </strong>There is little gratitude in politics. Ministers have have been acknowledging David Cameron in their speeches, but their tributes have barely gone beyond the polite and, outside the conference hall, it\u2019s more a case of Dave who? In the atrium there is a display featuring pictures of Tory prime ministers from Robert Peel to John Major from which Cameron is notably absent. The people most closely associated with his administration, like George Osborne and Michael Gove, have not turned up and, in a final indignity, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/david-camerons-former-aide-charged-1500-for-conference-ticket-after-publishing-attack-book-on-a7334966.html\">Sir Craig Oliver, Cameron\u2019s former communications chief, was forced to pay the extortionate business attendee rate to get a pass to be allowed entry into the conference building.</a><br></p> <p><strong>8: Being foreign secretary has not changed Boris Johnson. </strong>Diplomacy is normally associated with a certain amount of gravitas, and before the conference it was not clear whether Johnson would adopt a serious tone, or whether we would get the usual faux-spontaneous, rambling, semi-frivolous standup routine. In the event we got the latter. It was actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c#block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c\">a very good speech</a>, probably the best anyone has delivered so far (not least for the use of the word \u201cfunkapolitan\u201d), although what the mandarins at King Charles Street and Johnson\u2019s fellow foreign ministers made of it is anyone\u2019s guess.<br></p> <p><strong>9: The Tories who backed the Vote Leave campaign are not willing to defend its key claims.</strong> One of the TV highlights of the conference has been Sky\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/783193789158481920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Darren McCaffrey trying to get the Tory Vote Leave leaders to defend their claim that Brexit would free up \u00a3350m a week for the NHS.</a> The Vote Leave NHS promise was disowned some months ago, but this week we\u2019ve seen further evidence that Vote Leave\u2019s Brexit forecasts were misleading. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live?page=with:block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e#block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e\">Rudd said she was not planning to increase immigration from the Commonwealth as EU immigration falls</a> (leavers forecast the opposite) and Brexit ministers are backing away from the claim that there will be no trade-off between controlling immigration and enjoying the full benefits of the single market. (Admittedly, some of the worst remain economic forecasts have failed to materialise too, but the person most associated with those claims, George Osborne, is out of the picture.)</p> <p><strong>10: An early election looks less and less likely. </strong>May has been saying for some time that she has no plans for an early election, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f#block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f\">in an interview on Sunday</a> she went further then before, saying an early election would generate \u201cinstability\u201d. Just as significantly, it has become clear from what has and has not been said around the conference that there is little appetite in the party for an early poll.<br></p>",

And it is this opposition \u2013 competence v charisma \u2013 rather than substantive policy disagreements, that is framing the election.</p> <p>Consider that, when it comes to policy positions, these two candidates are among the most <em>different</em> in recent memory. Yet such differences don\u2019t really seem to be at the center of attention, either for the candidates themselves, or the public at large.</p> <p>In their recent debate, Clinton said explicitly that she intends to \u201cincrease taxes\u201d for the rich and address the \u201csystemic racism\u201d of the country\u2019s criminal justice system: positions that not even Obama had dared to take so plainly four or eight years ago. Trump instead declared he intends to lower taxes for the top income brackets and dismissed the problem of racism as a question of \u201claw and order\u201d. Similarly, on international trade, they took almost diametrically opposed stances: Clinton sees it as a factor of growth and stability, whereas Trump says trade is \u201ckilling our country\u201d.</p> <p>Yet all this somehow remains in the background. The real core of what Clinton was attempting to communicate is that she is more competent than her rival, because she has greater policy expertise. This explains her reliance on the opinion of \u201cindependent experts\u201d to make the case for her economic plan, as well as the insistence on \u201cfact-checking\u201d Trump\u2019s assertions.</p> <p>Conversely, most of Trump\u2019s efforts went into depicting Clinton as a political insider, who is responsible for the \u201cmess\u201d the country is supposedly in at the moment, while presenting himself as a \u201cstrong leader\u201d who can solve the country\u2019s problems precisely by virtue of his decisive and unconventional approach.</p> <p>The roots of this populist drift in the Republican party go back several decades. Although the party\u2019s current establishment professes to be outraged by at least some of Trump\u2019s excesses, there is a direct line of continuity running from the late 1990s\u2019 bid to impeach Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky affair, to George W Bush\u2019s self-presentation as the candidate one would \u201cmost like to have beer with\u201d, the choice of Sarah Palin as John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2012 and many features of Trump\u2019s current campaign.</p> <p>The Democrats\u2019 response has been to move progressively towards the center, assuming the mantle of \u201creason\u201d and \u201crespectability\u201d, while presenting their rivals as irresponsible mavericks. No wonder the substantive policy differences between them have fallen into the background: when politics is structured around the opposition between competent technocrats on one hand and anti-establishment populists on the other, there is little room left for substantive policy disagreement in the middle.</p> <p>Nor is America alone in this shift. The debate over Brexit in the UK was fought along the same axis of opposition. The core of the Remain campaign\u2019s argument rested on the opinion of \u201cexperts\u201d, according to which leaving the European Union would have had objectively catastrophic consequences for the country. In contrast, the Leave campaign appealed to many of the same sentiments that underscore Trump\u2019s appeal: widespread anti-establishment feeling, guttural nationalism and concerns about immigration and international trade.</p> <p>The paradox is that all this is depoliticizing public debate, precisely as campaigns become more bitter and conflictual. Democratic politics depends on the confrontation between rival political agendas and ideological visions. But in the struggle between technocrats and populists all we are left with is the choice between preserving the system as it is or burning it all to the ground. For those who want meaningful political alternatives, this doesn\u2019t bode well. <br></p>",

  "<p>Nigel Farage has declared himself the interim leader of Ukip following the resignation of Diane James after just 18 days in the post.</p> <p>The MEP said he had spoken to the Electoral Commission, which confirmed he was technically still leader. He made the declaration amid rumours that Ukip\u2019s ruling body could try to install Neil Hamilton, the former Tory politician and Ukip leader in Wales, as temporary leader.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC2\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show, Farage said he hoped that \u201chorror show\u201d would not come to pass as Hamilton was not good for the image of the party.</p> <p>James stepped down saying she did not enjoy the support of MEPs or party officials for changes that needed to be carried out to Ukip\u2019s national executive. </p> <p>She was elected at Ukip\u2019s party conference last month, but in a statement released on Tuesday night she said she would not formalise her leadership.</p> <p>\u201cIt has become clear I do not have sufficient authority, nor the full support of MEP colleagues and party officers, to implement the changes I believe are necessary and upon which I based my campaign.\u201d</p> <p>However, Farage claimed she had a \u201cpersonal problem\u201d relating to the health of a family member and had been shaken by being spat at while at Waterloo station.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as the party is concerned, it\u2019s not a great day but it not the end of the world,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A Ukip source said James had filled in an official form to take over control of the party and added the words \u201cunder duress\u201d in Latin; and confirmed that Farage himself believed he may \u201ctechnically\u201d still be leader \u2013 but had no intention of running in a new contest.</p> <p>Farage told the Press Association that he would not return as Ukip leader \u201cfor $10m\u201d. Asked if he\u2019d take $20m, he replied: \u201cNo I\u2019m not coming back. I\u2019m retired.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier Paul Oakden, the Ukip chairman, when asked who was currently leader of the party, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIn my mind it is Diane James; she has quit indeed, but that doesn\u2019t mean she is not the leader until a new leader is appointed.\u201d</p> <p>But he said he would consult the Electoral Commission on Wednesday, adding: \u201cIf they still have Nigel Farage down as leader, that will make it a very interesting day for me, I suspect.\u201d</p> <p>Oakden said he had not spoken to James directly about her resignation, and insisted: \u201cBoth I and the NEC have been consistently supportive of Diane since she was elected as leader.\u201d He added: \u201cThe job of being leader is often very difficult from the job of running to be leader.\u201d</p> <p>The Electoral Commission said Ukip submitted the paperwork notifying it of the change in leadership on Monday, although it had not been processed as officials had questions regarding the completion of the form. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe are aware that the newly elected leader of Ukip has now stood down and are in touch with the party to confirm how they wish to proceed regarding updating their entry on the statutory register,\u201d a spokesman said. </p> <p>James, who was chosen by Ukip\u2019s members after Farage stepped down in the wake of the Brexit vote, said she would continue as MEP for South East England.</p> <p>Discussions are taking place within the party about holding a snap two-week election to install a new leader quickly, with former deputy Paul Nuttall and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-steven-woolfe-excluded-from-ballot\">disqualified former candidate Steven Woolfe</a> two possible candidates.<br></p> <p>Raheem Kassam, the former chief of staff to Farage who left after the election, has confirmed he will run for the leadership. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/19/ukip-suzanne-evans-unsacked-media-spokesperson\">Suzanne Evans</a>, the former deputy chair who clashed with Farage, could also try again after she missed out because she was suspended at the time of the last contest, while Lisa Duffy, who ran against James, also said she could participate.</p> <p>Two other candidates who lost to James told the Guardian they would also consider standing again. Phillip Broughton, who fought the Hartlepool seat at the 2015 general election, said he would \u201crule nothing out\u201d. Bill Etheridge, a West Midlands MEP, said he might step forward \u201cif there is no other serious libertarian candidate\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>An MEP for South East England since 2014, 56-year-old James was the Eurosceptic party\u2019s first female leader and won the post by a wide margin after securing the backing of senior Ukip figures including Farage. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In her acceptance speech, she promised to bring a new professionalism to the party, saying: \u201cWe are going to confound our critics, we are going to outwit our opponents, we are going to build on our election success that we have achieved to date and do more.\u201d</p> <p>But questions were raised about her commitment to the post after she declined to take part in hustings debates around the country with rival candidates.</p> <p>After a career in the healthcare sector, she was elected to Waverley borough council in Surrey as an independent in 2007 after becoming disillusioned with the Conservatives.</p> <p>She switched to Ukip in 2011 and shot to national prominence in 2013 when she fought the parliamentary byelection in Eastleigh, Hampshire, which was triggered by the downfall of cabinet minister Chris Huhne, who was jailed for lying about a speeding offence. She came close to taking the seat from the Liberal Democrats, coming second with 27.8%, fewer than 2,000 votes behind the winning candidate.</p> <p>James raised some eyebrows in a 2015 interview when she declared her admiration for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, describing him as a strong leader who stood up for his country.</p> <p>Her elevation to the leadership of the party meant that Ukip joined the Conservatives, Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru in having a female politician at the helm, while the Greens have a woman as job-sharing co-leader.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DianeJamesMEP/status/783418481333137409/photo/1\"><br></a></p>",
  "<p>A man has been convicted of the murder of Sikh waiter Surjit Singh Chhokar 17 years after he first stood trial for the killing.</p> <p>The victim\u2019s family sobbed and embraced in the public gallery as Ronnie Coulter was found guilty of fatally stabbing the 32-year-old in Overtown, North Lanarkshire, in November 1998, after a row over a \u00a3100 cheque.</p> <p>In one of Scotland\u2019s longest-running and most controversial murder cases, Coulter was retried following a change in the double jeopardy law in 2012.</p> <p>The case was officially reopened four years ago after a lengthy campaign for justice by Chhokar\u2019s family, supported by Scotland\u2019s leading human rights lawyer, Aamer Anwar. On Wednesday Anwar described the verdict as \u201cnot a cause for celebration but relief that finally justice has been done\u201d.</p> <p>The failure of two prosecution cases in 1999 and 2000 led to a public outcry, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/17/stephen-lawrence-surjit-singh-chhokar\">comparisons to the Stephen Lawrence case</a>. Two official inquiries were launched, with one finding the prosecution and police guilty of institutional racism. The then lord advocate, Colin Boyd, admitted that Chhokar\u2019s family had been failed by the system.</p> <p>Following the verdict, Anwar said: \u201cAt the end of the second trial in 2000, I stood on the steps of this court accusing our justice system of acting like a gentleman\u2019s colonial club, of being arrogant, unaccountable and institutionally racist. But today the Chhokar family want to thank the prosecutors, Crown Office and Police Scotland for their unwavering commitment to justice. They have shown themselves at their finest.\u201d</p> <p>During the four-week trial at the high court in Glasgow, the jury heard that Coulter, his nephew Andrew and another man, David Montgomery, went to see Chhokar on the night he died following a row over a stolen Giro cheque.</p> <p>The trio confronted the waiter in the street as he returned home from work with a takeaway meal and, after an altercation, the father of two collapsed and died of massive blood loss after being stabbed three times, once straight through his heart.</p> <p>Coulter denied murdering Chhokar, lodging a special defence blaming his nephew and Montgomery for the killing.</p> <p>The court heard that Coulter had been cleared of murder following a trial in 1999, and that Andrew Coulter, who was convicted of stabbing and killing another man in 1999, and Montgomery were also cleared of the murder in 2000.</p> <p>Both men gave evidence during the most recent trial and admitted being present on the night Chhokar died, but denied murder.</p> <p>For the defence, Donald Findlay QC argued that members of his family had conspired to make Ronnie Coulter a \u201cscapegoat\u201d for the murder, claiming that the trial had heard from witnesses who were \u201cdetermined to say what they wanted to say for their own personal reasons\u201d.</p> <p>But the prosecution dismissed the theory, with Alex Prentice, QC for the crown, urging the jury to ignore the unusual features of the case and describing the two previous trials as \u201clargely irrelevant\u201d.</p> <p>The jury heard Ronnie Coulter\u2019s former sister-in-law describe an alleged confession made when she visited him in Barlinnie prison while he was on remand awaiting the first trial.</p> <p>She was asked by Prentice: \u201cDid Ronnie Coulter ever say anything about the death of Surjit Singh Chhokar?\u201d She replied: \u201cHe said \u2018I stabbed him. I stabbed the Paki bastard.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The third trial was attended every day by Chhokar\u2019s 73-year-old mother, his sister and her children. His father, Darshan, died last October. </p> <p>Responding to the verdict, DCS Clark Cuzen acknowledged the \u201cyears of uncertainty\u201d the family had endured, and said: \u201cIf Darshan Singh Chhokar was alive today, I can only imagine his feelings at seeing justice being served. </p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is important to recognise the tireless campaigning for justice over the years by the Chhokar family and their lawyer, Aamer Anwar. I hope they can take some comfort from today\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p> <p>Describing the \u201ccomplex and challenging\u201d two-year investigation that led to Coulter\u2019s conviction, Cuzen said: \u201cThrough the passage of time, people can change allegiances and new evidence can come to light through independent statements. This tireless activity ultimately revealed fresh evidence that pointed the finger firmly at Ronnie Coulter as the man responsible for the violent and calculated attack on Surjit Singh Chhokar.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst we were unable to find evidence of racial motivation at the time of the murder, there was evidence to support the fact that Ronnie Coulter described Surjit using racist terms when confessing to the murder. </p> <p>\u201cSurjit Singh Chhokar was a well-liked member of the community and did not deserve to be the victim of a sustained period of intimidation which ultimately led to his murder.\u201d </p> <p>The judge Lord Matthews told Coulter: \u201cThere is only one sentence I can pass of life imprisonment. The only question for me is how long you should serve before being eligible for parole.\u201d<br></p> <p>Calling for background reports given the relatively minor nature of Coulter\u2019s previous convictions and his mental health issues, he deferred sentence until 31 October.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

  "<p>Louis Armand\u2019s themes are as big as his novel is long. His anti-novel The Combinations sets out to investigate \u2013 among other things \u2013 the psychological fallout from the collapse of communism and the more intimate breakdown of a lost soul. The soul in question belongs to a man called Nemec, who wanders around a city very similar to Armand\u2019s home city, Prague (here called Golem City) while attempting to come to terms with a world without moorings. There are grand political and moral themes here, as well as more personal explorations of loneliness, loss and intellectual instability. </p> <p>To borrow one of Armand\u2019s most frequently recurring images, Nemec is playing a game of chess with no clear idea of the size of the board or the rules. He\u2019s been sent on a quest to unlock the secrets of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/tiny-spanish-publisher-wins-rights-voynich-manuscript-book-no-one-can-read\">the Voynich manuscript</a>, here described as composed \u201cby an Unknown Author, in an Unknown Language\u201d and which has, \u201cover the course of its moderately long history, attracted the various attentions of occultists, amateur riddlers, pseudoscientists and crackpots of every stripe from the four corners of the globe\u201d.</p> <p>The Combinations attempts to give most of these riddlers and crackpots space, jostling on the crammed pages alongside the strangely blank and insubstantial Nemec. During one of several metafictional digressions jokily interrogating the nature of The Combinations itself, Armand says that Nemec is \u201csomehow unreal\u201d. He\u2019s right; Nemec never feels like a fleshed-out character, and we never get a glimpse of the inner workings of his mind. To be at such a remove is alienating, but it also fits the uncertainty of this story, where everything is as intangible as mist, obscuring and forever swirling out of reach.</p> <p>All of this confusion is well reflected in the fractured, sprawling narrative. The novel gets diverted into all the obscure nooks and crannies of Golem City, while the plot winds around itself as much as it moves forward. Armand\u2019s book is freighted with heavily adjectival, overloaded sentences, as well as bursting with lists, ideas half-formed, allusions uncertain and unsettling illusions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The style feels too much like reheated but still undercooked William Burroughs.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s no doubt that Armand is aiming for something profound and challenging, and it is clear that The Combinations is the product of hard work and hard thought. It\u2019s a book that deserves attention. More attention \u2013 if I\u2019m honest \u2013 than the rushed couple of weeks\u2019 reading I\u2019ve been able to give it during the shortlist stages of this competition.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t entirely invalidate my objections, however. The chief of these relates to one of the things that I most wanted to like about the novel. The Combinations is unashamedly avant garde and I want to applaud Armand\u2019s attempt to reach the out-there territories. But the sad truth is that he hasn\u2019t really travelled far at all. Like many who court the avant garde, Armand ends up disappointingly conservative. There\u2019s little that feels new, even in spite of the relentless tide of name-checking and references. It\u2019s all rats, alcohol, asylums, Mitteleurope, masons, Faust, alchemy, dingy laboratories, Enoch, Babbage, <a href=\"http://gnosis.org/hermes.htm\">Hermes Trismegistus</a>, John Dee, Rorschach blots, the sphinx, mysterious bookstores \u2026 It\u2019s sometimes obscure, but mainly predictable.</p> <p>The style too, feels too much like reheated but still undercooked William Burroughs. Armand has got the sly and sarcastic tone, but the jokes aren\u2019t as funny, the images aren\u2019t as fresh, and \u2013 to be brutal \u2013 the prose isn\u2019t as good. His metaphors are especially strained: \u201cLike a zen cop on a permanent stakeout.\u201d What\u2019s a zen cop? And how can you be like someone on a \u2013 oh, never mind. Look at this one instead:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The watery folds of the Prof\u2019s eyes contracted as he forged ahead with his proofs and speculations like a Buster Keaton character who conceals his disappointment at finding only an inattentive audience with increasingly strange antics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Is it the folds of the eyes that are performing those antics? Or the Prof? And when exactly does that Buster Keaton character encounter such disappointment?</p> <p>That Buster Keaton reference brings up another problem, exemplified in yet another tricksy simile:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a vortex beneath the central light fixture, five tireless March flies alternately pursued one another and were pursued \u2013 feinting, retreating. Spiralling in a kind of three-dimensional chess puzzle Kepler might\u2019ve set himself had the game been known to him.</p> </blockquote> <p>It isn\u2019t just that that metaphor is strained, or that it is a desperately verbose way to describe something as inconsequential as the movement of flies. It\u2019s that you\u2019ve got to know enough about Kepler for it to make sense. Such references aren\u2019t only frustrating \u2013 I sometimes wondered if Armand really knew all the root meanings of all his allusions, if he cared, or if it mattered. This uncertainty was increased by occasional lapses. To give a quick and minor example, he translates a bit of Latin for Pythagoras - \u201c<em>numero est ipsum movens</em>\u201d \u2013 as \u201cthe soul is the number that moves itself\u201d. Alas, the Latin Armand provides doesn\u2019t actually have a word for \u201csoul\u201d in it, leading to the suspicion that he\u2019s quoting without properly understanding. And since there is so much quotation everywhere, a lapse like this seriously undermines faith in the book.</p> <p>And you just can\u2019t lose trust in a novel where so much depends on believing that the author is in control. To go back to those metaphors, Armand possibly has a get-out clause. He could argue that those similes are deliberately half-cocked and discombobulating \u2013 which would certainly fit the rest of his themes. But there are so many more clumsy sentences that it\u2019s hard to be sure that he knows what he\u2019s doing. </p> <p>The biggest loss of belief came for me when immediately after page 202, I found myself reading page 427. There was then a straight sequence of pages until page 650 \u2013 after which page 427 arrived again and the whole chunk was reprinted. The unsettling thing was the fact that I couldn\u2019t tell whether or not Armand had intended the pages to run in this curious manner. At first, I didn\u2019t even notice I\u2019d skipped so much. Was this another joke? Was it another convoluted metaphor for the ever-decreasing circles of Nemec\u2019s existence? Was it a genuine mistake? Or just more bollocks? I honestly didn\u2019t know. And when it\u2019s got to the stage that you can\u2019t tell the difference between an author\u2019s intentions and a printing error, you know there\u2019s trouble. </p> <p>But even that doesn\u2019t entirely invalidate this book. There are still some interesting moments and there\u2019s still something to be said for the book\u2019s ability to discomfit and destabilise. Yes, it\u2019s often boring; a few extravagantly soporific passages even rendered me unconscious. But art isn\u2019t just there to distract and amuse us and to seek easy pleasure in this work is to miss the point. Armand has interesting and ambitious things to convey, whether we like it or not.</p> <p>Even if you hate every page, this 888-page monster still has its uses. Should someone attack you, you can use it to fend him off. Or, if you really want to mess up your assailant, you can open it up and start reading it to him. </p>",
  "<p>The end of this year\u2019s summer term was a difficult time for staff at George Green\u2019s school, on London\u2019s Isle of Dogs. \u201cWe\u2019d never had so many goodbye speeches \u2026 it was heartbreaking,\u201d says Jill Baker, the principal of the 1,200-pupil secondary school. Amid tightening budgets, the school was forced to cut 30 support staff roles this year out of a total of 100 \u2013 18 of those through redundancies. </p> <p>And George Green\u2019s is not alone. Across the country, headteachers are complaining that they can\u2019t make ends meet. Headlines have screamed of cuts, redundancies and deficits, and in some areas teachers have threatened to strike.</p> <p>At times of austerity, budgets are bound to be difficult for schools. But last autumn\u2019s spending review seemed to provide some comfort for heads and teachers. \u201cNot only is the schools budget protected in real terms, but the total financial support for education, including childcare and our extended further and higher education loans, will increase by \u00a310bn,\u201d the then chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015-speech\">George Osborne, told MPs</a>.</p> <p>But the reality, it seems, is rather different from the political rhetoric. And the recent experience of George Green\u2019s can provide some answers as to why that is.</p> <p>Almost eight out of 10 of the school\u2019s pupils, aged 11-19, take free school meals; there\u2019s a family therapist and a safeguarding team on site and a significant proportion have profound physical and educational special needs. Many heads would envy Baker her budgets \u2013 George Green\u2019s has just short of \u00a37,800 per pupil to spend, plus a substantial sum of pupil premium money, which is designed to help raise standards in disadvantaged areas. <br></p> <p>So, why is the school facing such painful decisions while the politicians have been making all the right noises? The truth, according to a wide range of organisations representing schools and teachers, is that school funding has simply not kept pace with inflation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8027\">Research from the Institute of Fiscal Studies</a> shows that while the conservative government has protected day-to-day spending per pupil in cash terms for the current parliament, rising costs and an increase in pupil numbers have squeezed resources. In real terms, the institute says, spending per pupil is likely to fall by 8% over five years. <br></p> <p>The major factors are ones affecting all schools, from early years providers through to sixth form colleges: an increase in employers\u2019 contributions to the teachers\u2019 pension scheme from April 2015, an average public sector pay rise of 1% per year announced in summer 2015 and an increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions from April 2016.</p> <p>At George Green\u2019s, that added up to a total bill of \u00a3600,000 this year, half of which was saved through staff job cuts. More savings have had to be made by merging faculties and cutting planned building works, and almost 20 staff have agreed to work for less money.</p> <p>\u201cAs a headteacher I found it incredibly painful to have to stand up in front of my staff and say I\u2019m going to have to make many of you redundant,\u201d Baker says. \u201cMany of those staff went to this school, and many were family members of pupils.\u201d </p> <p>And yet Baker\u2019s school is better off than many: it is in Tower Hamlets, which is \u2013 with the exception of City of London, which has just one 200-pupil primary school within its boundary \u2013 the highest-funded local authority in the country. That means that while schools in the inner London borough receive more than \u00a37,000 per pupil per year, those in some other areas receive not much more than \u00a34,000 to do the same job.</p> <h2>An unfair system set in aspic</h2> <p>This discrepancy has been the subject of comment and debate over many years, and just about everyone agrees something needs to change. The reasons for it are largely historical and often have little to do with today\u2019s realities, according to experts.</p> <p>Until 10 years ago, the money given by the government to local authorities for schools\u2019 funding was based on a complex system of needs, taking into account factors such as deprivation, ethnicity and population density. In 2006-07 the Labour government decided to introduce a national per-pupil grant to each area \u2013 based on what the area had spent per pupil during the 2005-06 school year. </p> <p>And in effect, the system has been set in aspic ever since. Social, economic and demographic changes during the last decade have had little effect on schools\u2019 funding in the areas where they have taken place. And the funding discrepancies between areas that existed then still exist now. Academies receive funding centrally, but the amount they get is based on the funding paid in their local authority areas.</p> <p>According to Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, the combination of these historical differences with today\u2019s local decision-making in 152 English authorities has left schools in an unfair situation.</p> <p>\u201cThere were 150 different formulas incorporating lots of different factors,\u201d he says. \u201cSo now you still have 150 different ways of distributing money which is not equitably distributed in the first place. At the moment you can be up to \u00a3400 per pupil better or worse off than a virtually identical school. If you put that into a big comprehensive with 1,250 pupils, that\u2019s \u00a3500,000 per year.\u201d</p> <p>The government has promised to introduce changes that should help to iron out some of these problems. And as part of the process of moving towards a fairer system, it gave <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fairer-schools-funding-arrangements-for-2015-to-2016\">an additional \u00a3390m</a> to the lowest-funded areas in 2015-16.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why are children in West Sussex worth that much less than children in other parts of the country</p> <footer> <cite>Peter Woodman, headteacher, The Weald Community School and Sixth Form</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In March this year the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/07/london-and-inner-city-pupils-could-lose-out-over-changes-to-school-funding\">proposed a national funding formula</a> that would include a basic amount per pupil as well as additional sums reflecting pupil characteristics and school and area costs. But in July the new education secretary, Justine Greening, announced the planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/21/tories-delay-school-funding-overhaul-until-at-least-2018\">reform would be delayed</a> by a year until 2018-19.</p> <p>This, according to Trobe, leaves many schools facing difficult decisions after four years in which funding has not taken inflation into account: \u201cBy now most schools will have looked at cutting the cost of things like utilities, they will have pared down their contracts for services as much as they can. They\u2019re beginning to find there isn\u2019t much more they can save on their non-staff costs, which are typically about 20% of their budgets. So now most people are finding they are now looking at cutting staff costs.\u201d</p> <p>And while schools like George Green\u2019s are feeling the pinch, others have far less to cut. Peter Woodman is headteacher of The Weald community school and sixth form in West Sussex. West Sussex is the lowest-funded county in England \u2013 four non-county authorities do slightly better. Its schools receive just under \u00a34,200 per pupil per year.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is, why are children in West Sussex worth that much less than children in other parts of the country?\u201d Woodman asks. \u201cThis is not what a fair and just system looks like \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t want to deny schools in London but the disparity is huge.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to the number of things you can do to fill in the gaps. You can cut courses, and you can make classes bigger. We\u2019ve taken more students into year 7 without increasing the number of classes.\u201d</p> <p>Another issue faced by The Weald, along with many other 11-18 schools, is sixth form funding. Sixth forms are already funded through a national formula, but teachers\u2019 organisations argue that with a base rate of just \u00a34,000 per pupil the level is just too low. </p> <p>\u201cIn the western part of our county there\u2019s nowhere now that does A-level German,\u201d Woodman says. \u201cIt costs a quarter of a million pounds to run our sixth form. We used to subsidise the 11-16s from the money we had for sixth form; we can\u2019t do that now.\u201d</p> <p>At Woodman\u2019s school, which has 300 sixth formers among its 1,600 pupils, this means funding must be diverted from younger age groups to help make up the deficit.</p> <p>With plans afoot for a national funding formula, his school took the decision this year to run a deficit of \u00a3180,000 \u2013 on the basis that the changes would mean a redistribution and extra money next year. Now with the plans delayed, West Sussex\u2019s secondaries are left adrift \u2013 and are lobbying ministers for transitional funding to help them over the coming months.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought our funding per pupil would go up and so we decided we would live on our reserves for a year and it would be fine. But now that\u2019s not going to happen. We planned strategically, and then they changed the ground rules.\u201d</p> <h2>Primary schools: even tighter budgets</h2> <p>In primary schools, the issues are rather different. While secondaries have been hit hard, they tend to be larger and to have bigger budgets \u2013 and that does give them a certain amount of flexibility. Even big primary schools have less to play with.</p> <p>In Harrow, on the outer edge of London, Anne Lyons has been a head for 20 years. Her school, the St John Fisher Catholic primary, has expanded with rising rolls and is expected soon to have 650 pupils in an area where few parents are on benefits but where many work on low wages and need support from the school. Lyons has seen budgets \u2013 and results \u2013 rise in recent years but is now facing the prospect of a retreat.</p> <p>\u201cAt one point we had 39 or 40 pupils in a class with one teacher \u2013 would you believe it?\u201d she says. \u201cBut things were very different then. We had a much narrower curriculum; we didn\u2019t have computers.</p> <p>\u201cThen we moved to a situation where not long ago it would have been a teacher with a class of 30 plus a teaching assistant for each class, or maybe for two classes. Now that\u2019s reducing again. We can\u2019t have teaching assistants for general support; they\u2019re there to help specific children. That\u2019s because of budgets.\u201d</p> <p>The cost of national insurance and pension contribution rises at her school amounts to \u00a350,000 on a \u00a32m budget. And the prospect of a national funding formula is not greeted with such joy here as in shire counties such as West Sussex. Lyons fears there may have to be job cuts, and that areas such as the arts, music and sport \u2013 all strong in her well-regarded school \u2013 will be adversely affected. </p> <p>\u201cOur concerns are that there\u2019s going to be less money,\u201d she says. \u201cLondon does well in terms of attainment and progress, and that\u2019s because the money we\u2019ve had has been spent wisely. Our worry is that we\u2019re going to end up with a race to the bottom, rather than everywhere else being funded in the same way that London has been in recent years.\u201d</p> <p>Last autumn the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) surveyed more than 1,000 school leaders about budgets; eight out of 10 were in primaries. It found almost two thirds had balanced their budgets only by making significant cuts or using surpluses, and 7% had already set a deficit budget. Almost half had cut the numbers or hours of teaching assistants, and a similar proportion thought their budgets would be untenable by 2017-18.</p> <p>Valentine Mulholland, the NAHT\u2019s head of policy, says primary schools are making difficult decisions: \u201cSome of those decisions involve not investing in property, having to delay repairs, reducing teaching assistants or having to increase class sizes,\u201d she says. </p> <p>And those schools running early years provision find life particularly difficult: \u201cMore than half our members who provide early years education lose money on it and basically subsidise it as a sort of investment \u2013 if they can get those children in early their primary education will benefit. So they take a hit on it.\u201d</p> <p>But the nature of the costs schools face affect everyone to a lesser or greater degree. Elaine Colquhoun, OBE, is executive principal of the Whitefield academy trust which runs two special schools in Waltham Forest. </p> <p>Although the trust\u2019s schools are academies their funding is tied to that in their local authority, and is set at around \u00a310,000 per pupil. Because her schools are in London many pupils travel from other local authority areas \u2013 all with different levels of funding. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc7a30600d4012a21fdeea713202ca67c9808bc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc7a30600d4012a21fdeea713202ca67c9808bc8/2120_786_1706_6523/262.jpg\" alt=\"schoolfundingtimeline\" width=\"262\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cI would like to see in the future some form of national banding which means that a child in one authority would attract the same amount of funding as a child in another,\u201d Colquhoun says. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s a postcode lottery.\u201d</p> <p>Arrangements for recouping payments from a range of different councils can be labyrinthine. \u201cWe have children from 14 local authorities, and we have to invoice all of them \u2013 the arrangements have changed twice in the past four years and have become even more complex. It\u2019s very difficult on the cash-flow side, to make sure everybody pays their bills. Some local authorities just hang out and don\u2019t pay until the last minute,\u201d says Colquhoun. </p> <p>Across the country, in well-funded areas as in the less well-funded, there\u2019s agreement that things need to change. Yet there\u2019s also concern about how the government might decide to fund the necessary changes.</p> <p>Usman Gbajabiamila, policy adviser at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, speaks for many in the world of education: \u201cWe believe you can\u2019t do this with the same budget that exists now. We want a national funding formula because we want to eradicate all the discrepancies and unfairnesses, but we want that to be done by increasing the budget that schools are getting. There aren\u2019t any schools out there that are over-funded. There aren\u2019t any schools or local authorities saying they have more money than they need.\u201d </p> <p>The Department for Education says it wants a system that\u2019s fair for everyone, regardless of background. \u201cWe want all schools to have access to the resources they need so that every pupil regardless of background or ability can reach their full potential. That\u2019s why we have protected the schools budget so that, as pupil numbers increase, so will the amount of money for our schools \u2013 in 2016-17 that will total over \u00a340bn, the highest on record,\u201d said a spokesman for the department.</p> <p>\u201cWe are firmly committed to introducing a national funding formula so that all schools are funded fairly \u2013 both to address the historic unfairness in the system and also so that areas with the highest need attract the most funding.\u201d</p> <p> In Tower Hamlets, Baker is clear that heads in some other areas face a hard task in balancing their books.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that headteachers in less-funded authorities need more,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole funding system needs looking at, and there\u2019s a definite need for a fairer funding system. But what mustn\u2019t get forgotten is that schools which are serving poor communities need more money just to function efficiently. Some schools simply have a greater level of need \u2013 even though we have a high per-pupil income, we are not rolling in money.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s a nice touch, much like the permanently pained look on his face. </p> <p>But at Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear why Pence was so unhappy. Was he opposed to every word coming out of Tim Kaine\u2019s mouth? Or was he just dismayed at his own situation?</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy campaigning as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. You can\u2019t admit the obvious: that your presidential candidate is hiding his tax returns, stoking racism and spooking allies around the world. </p> <p>So you have to deny Trump\u2019s quotes, or accuse your opponent of hurling insults. But most of all, you have to look affable while your running mate looked irascible.</p> <p>In that sense, Pence succeeded in beating his boss. The problem is: so did Kaine. </p> <p>If Kaine had one job, it was to repeat as loudly and frequently as possible all the dumb and offensive words that have tumbled out of Trump\u2019s curled lips.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vice-president-debate-fact-check-mike-pence-tim-kaine\">VP debate fact-check: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine's claims reviewed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t a pretty night for the Democratic veep pick. He interrupted too often and smiled too little. He was forced to repeat Trump\u2019s worst insults. He looked and sounded too hot, where his rival looked and sounded too sincere.</p> <p>But in truth, neither man seemed comfortable in their designated role. Like two insurance salesmen getting drunk at their annual trade conference, Kaine and Pence were just trying too hard.</p> <p>Kaine tried to beat Pence into submission with pesky facts. Pence tried to smother his facts with a syrupy version of Ronald Reagan. \u201cYou can roll out the numbers and the sunny side,\u201d Pence said, \u201cbut people in Scranton know different.\u201d</p> <p>It would be easy to dismiss Kaine-Pence as a sideshow. But given the likelihood that either President Clinton or President Trump gets impeached, we might have just seen the only debate with the ultimate winner of the 2016 election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee245d323eeacef4ed640fb36f0250e4bff2d165\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee245d323eeacef4ed640fb36f0250e4bff2d165/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It would be easy to dismiss Kaine-Pence as a sideshow.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It would be easy to dismiss Kaine-Pence as a sideshow.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-aronoff\">Kate Aronoff:</a> Kaine was all interruption, no inspiration<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"83f4e66ac3deade0ad3425ded3956651d4b979b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83f4e66ac3deade0ad3425ded3956651d4b979b7/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Richard Wolffe\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This was a disappointing night for the Clinton campaign. While Pence kept his cool, Kaine tried to imitate Joe Biden\u2019s interruption-heavy performance against Paul Ryan in 2012 \u2013 without half his charisma. Kaine\u2019s biggest downfall, though, may not have been about tone. </p> <p>Compared to Kaine, Pence told a compelling \u2013 if terrifyingly cynical and blatantly false \u2013 story of a country that has lost its way, and how he and Trump intend to restore it. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d might be one of the best political slogans of the past decade. But Trump owes its creation to people such as Margaret Thatcher and Reagan, who worked to spread the neoliberal gospel that\u2019s now seeped into both parties. That evangelizing project has been incredibly successful, with each candidate airing concerns about government spending, personal responsibility and the limits of American coffers.</p> <p>There were glaring omissions tonight, too. Despite a series of increasingly brutal projections about the likelihood of catastrophic global warming, talk of climate change was limited to a few coded words at the debate\u2019s start, like the mythical \u201cwar on coal\u201d and \u201cclean energy jobs of tomorrow.\u201d A cringe-worthy conversation about criminal justice reform somehow managed not to breach mass incarceration. And a brief discussion of reproductive rights \u2013 one that should have been up top given Pence\u2019s deplorable record on the issue \u2013 got shunted to the very end.</p> <p>The Democratic party has spent the past several decades pivoting around terms of debate set by the right. Kaine\u2019s loss in tonight\u2019s debate showed just how much work the Democrats \u2013 and the social movements pushing them \u2013 need to do to recenter the conversation. </p> <p>More than the \u201cintelligence surge\u201d Kaine and Clinton keep pushing, the Democratic party needs a surge in imagination, to do more than play defense against attacks from across the aisle and propose transformative solutions, in line with the pain many Americans today are facing. That was sorely missing tonight. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carla-sorey-reed\">Carla Sorey-Reed:</a> Pence is a prettier, more practiced Trump<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5a8433f1e02dec97d23adf7ba1c40208f71e54c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a8433f1e02dec97d23adf7ba1c40208f71e54c2/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Richard Wolffe\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Kaine and Pence had a relatively balanced debate \u2013 no knockouts. Two experienced politicians dispatched to further the rhetoric of their campaigns and defend the candidates at the top of the ticket. Neither disappointed. </p> <p>At the start, when asked what made him a good candidate for the vice-presidency, Kaine faltered. Looking down, he rushed a heavily scripted first answer, told through the filter of Clinton\u2019s point of view, that took too long and strained to connect back to the question. Kaine directed his entire answer off camera, which greatly reduced his engagement with the television audience. </p> <p>Pence restated Trump\u2019s conservative positions, doubling down on wealth and whiteness for the win. Pence tried to spin away from Kaine\u2019s points on policy, using plain speak \u2013 the common language of the Trump campaign. When Kaine pushed Pence on social security, all that Pence could offer was: \u201cThere they go again. We\u2019re going to meet our obligations to seniors.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bd31e8805336ac7f00621b495777de931f074cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bd31e8805336ac7f00621b495777de931f074cd/0_48_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Pence won the debate by a landslide.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pence won the debate by a landslide.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was on the topics of policing, immigration and women that the difference between the men and their campaigns was made most clear.

Kaine spoke of \u201ccommunity policing\u201d and \u201cbuilding bonds of understanding\u201d while Pence seemed annoyed with the topic and impatiently attempted to dress down his opponent by saying \u201c\u2026 enough of seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs\u201d. A frightening reality check for minorities. </p> <p>On immigration, Pence offered more thinly veiled hate with \u201ctoo often with criminal aliens in the country, it\u2019s bringing heartbreak\u201d. If only Kaine had challenged him right then and there. As the debate went on, Kaine grew stronger, relying less on prepared statements and messages, and listening and responding in real time. <br></p> <p>In the words of Kaine: \u201cFrom the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks ... Donald Trump is showing you who he is.\u201d Pence speaks the same, only prettier and more practiced.

But unlike Trump, Pence apparently isn\u2019t prone to chasing shiny objects. <br></p> <p>Constantly interrupting Pence and speaking at a mile a minute, Kaine tried for the life of him to get Pence to discuss Trump\u2019s racist attack on Indiana Judge Gonzalo Curiel, Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims, Trump\u2019s praise of Vladimir Putin, Trump\u2019s call to deport all illegal immigrants, and so on and so forth. Whatever the accuracy of Kaine\u2019s attacks on Trump \u2013 and make no mistake, they were often accurate \u2013 Kaine\u2019s style was excessive. By throwing out so many issues in one breath, he made his rhetorical assault hard for viewers to follow. He also made it easy for Pence to ignore him with a shake of the head \u2013 a nonverbal \u201cthere you go again\u201d.</p> <p>Kaine\u2019s constant \u201cI know it all\u201d interruptions might be considered the 2016 version of Al Gore\u2019s groans. It made him come across as a thoroughly unlikable figure. </p> <p>By contrast, Pence was calm and cool. He methodically hammered home the Trump campaign\u2019s positive themes \u2013 let\u2019s get America\u2019s economy moving again, let\u2019s put American workers first, let\u2019s bring back American jobs, let\u2019s project strength in the world, America needs change. </p> <p>Sure, these are broad themes, but presented in Pence\u2019s confident manner, they resonate. Like Kaine, Pence had his share of canned lines. Unlike Kaine, he was able to deliver them in a way that made them appear sincere and sometimes even heartfelt. Performance matters. </p> <p>Pence won the debate by a landslide, and it\u2019s hard to imagine there will be many in the media who will even attempt to claim otherwise. The only question is how his running mate\u2019s fragile ego will react when all those who panned his debate skills praise Pence\u2019s. <br></p>",

Unlike many of the players, Rooney has not spoken to Allardyce since the manager\u2019s unceremonious departure, or even exchanged text messages.</p> <p>Rooney\u2019s annoyance stems from the fact it created the impression he might be choosing the tactics or even influencing team selection \u2013 \u201cwhich couldn\u2019t be further from the truth\u201d \u2013 and the episode has left him believing Allardyce needed to give more thought to his public pronouncements. \u201cThat\u2019s part of being involved at this level,\u201d Rooney, a veteran of 116 caps, said. \u201cHe knew he made a mistake. He said that to me on the plane home. He understood that quite early and unfortunately he doesn\u2019t have the chance to rectify that now.</p> <p>\u201cSam came out and said I play where I want. I played exactly to instructions, and what was asked of me. I\u2019ll play wherever the manager wants me. I don\u2019t pick myself, I haven\u2019t ever picked myself. I didn\u2019t come in and say: \u2018I want to play here or there.\u2019 I played where I was asked to play. That was a big misunderstanding and I seemed to get slaughtered for it. I suffered from that. I got battered in many different ways when I felt it was actually a decent performance.</p> <p>\u201cIt was over the top. I played in deep midfield and I thought, being honest, I actually did quite well, especially in the second half. I helped control the game. I turn up like every other player, ready to play and, if selected, I will play hopefully how the manager wants me to play, and that\u2019s it.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone else can say what they think, or what they think they know, but me, the manager and the players know what is required to do well.</p> <p>\u201cI played the role I was asked to play, played to instructions and that was it really. But it has all blown up.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/wayne-rooney-manchester-united\">Wayne Rooney\u2019s years at top take their toll on Manchester United captain | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a far-reaching interview, Rooney addressed questions about his deterioration in form, his removal from the United team under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and the widespread suspicion that, approaching his 31st birthday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/wayne-rooney-manchester-united\">he may be suffering from burnout after a career that started when he was 16</a>.</p> <p>Rooney accepted he deserved to lose his place at Old Trafford and, admitting he had lost the pace that once helped make him such a feared striker, he made it clearer than ever before that he believed he should be playing in midfield at this stage of his career.</p> <p>\u201cI have heard a lot of people talking about transition \u2013 well, let me do it. If that is what\u2019s going to happen, let me do that. I feel I am not being given a chance if that is the way I want to go in my career to expand it.</p> <p>\u201cI am not being given that chance to go from there to there [attack to midfield]. It is all right talking about your career, saying you can extend it by doing this and that, but you need to be given the chance to do it.\u201d</p> <p>His problem on that front is that Mourinho has stated he sees him only as a front player and, though Rooney insisted he would accept the manager\u2019s thinking, he also said \u201cthere will come a time, if I\u2019m not playing, I might have to be a bit more selfish in terms of where I want to play and making that clear\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>In 1933 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a> published an article about Beatrix Potter and her \u201clittle books\u201d, the 20-odd anthropomorphic animal tales that had already become nursery classics. Greene wasn\u2019t yet in full-on childhood-assault mode \u2013 that would come four years later when he suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shirley-temple\" title=\"\">Shirley Temple</a>\u2019s huge popularity among adult men was bound up with her \u201cwell-developed rump\u201d and \u201cdimpled depravity\u201d. But the novelist did suggest there was more to the appeal of Potter\u2019s tales than a charming procession of bunnies in blue&#xa0;coats and ducks in poke bonnets. Sidelining her illustrations, Greene concentrated on Potter\u2019s \u201celusive\u201d and&#xa0;\u201cpregnant\u201d prose. Here, buried in&#xa0;those two-part sentences with their psalm-like cadence, not to mention the surrounding acres of white space, lay much that readers of all ages found both unbearable and desirable: parental absence, boundless freedom, the threat and promise of being gobbled up by someone else. All delivered in what Greene referred to as Potter\u2019s \u201cgentle detachment\u201d, a kind of eerie calm that he tried to replicate in his own work.</p> <p>Mrs Heelis \u2013 Potter\u2019s married name since 1913 \u2013 wasn\u2019t having any of it. Writing from the fastness of Castle Cottage in the Lake District, where she lived with her husband and a prize-winning herd of Herdwick sheep, she made it clear that she thought Greene was being impertinent. In particular she disliked the \u201cFreudian\u201d \u2013 her word \u2013 suggestion that some trauma in her private life must have triggered her diversion from what Greene called \u201cthe&#xa0;great early comedies\u201d of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tale-of-two-bad-mice.html\" title=\"\"><em>Two Bad Mice</em></a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Peter+Rabbit&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\" title=\"\"><em>Peter Rabbit</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tale-of-tom-kitten.html\" title=\"\"><em>Tom Kitten</em></a> to the darker tragedies of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Jemima+Puddle-Duck&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\" title=\"\"><em>Jemima Puddle-Duck</em></a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Mr+Tod&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\" title=\"\"><em>Mr Tod</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Pigling+Bland&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\" title=\"\"><em>Pigling Bland</em></a>.</p> <p>The irony, of course, is that Potter\u2019s annoyance, the fact that she bothered to respond to Greene\u2019s provocation, means that she knew he was on to something. And that something is the subject of Matthew Dennison\u2019s new biography. It\u2019s not the first to&#xa0;appear in&#xa0;this, Potter\u2019s 150th anniversary year, and rather than plod through the timeline of her life yet again, Dennison mines her texts for the patterns of feeling and experience that will allow him to get beneath the skin of an author who believed that her inner life was no one else\u2019s business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46311014b4dac7f3914a54823dd529c766472218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46311014b4dac7f3914a54823dd529c766472218/20_0_960_1200/800.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration from Potter\u2019s The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration from Potter\u2019s The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beatrix Potter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, for instance, he suggests that if we want to know about the fakeness of&#xa0;family life at No 2 Bolton Gardens, where Potter lived in the third floor nursery until she was in her 30s, we have only to read about the dolls\u2019 house in <em>Two Bad Mice</em>, with its plaster food and its immobile chatelaines, Lucinda and Jane, who are unable to speak to one another. If we seek to understand the frustration that the adolescent Beatrix felt with her wealthy parents\u2019 listless but showy Kensington existence, we need only to turn to the account of the dinner party held by Johnny Town-Mouse: \u201ceight courses; not much of anything, but truly elegant\u201d.</p> <p>Potter\u2019s mother, Helen \u2013 remote, intrusive, nagging and negligent \u2013 comes&#xa0;off particularly badly in Dennison\u2019s account of how difficult feelings became coded in feather and fur. Rebeccah Puddleduck takes no interest in her sister-in-law Jemima\u2019s longing for ducklings, just as Helen Potter ignored Beatrix\u2019s reasonable desire for a mate by trying to stop her marrying not once but twice. First came publisher Norman Warne: despite the fact that the Potters\u2019 own fortune was invested in clattering Lancashire looms, they refused to announce the 39-year-old Beatrix\u2019s engagement to him on account of his being \u201cin trade\u201d. Then again, Beatrix\u2019s marriage to William Heelis in 1913 at the age of 47 was grumbled over because the now elderly Potters required their daughter to stay single in order to look after them.</p> <p>This brand of emotional cannibalism was heightened by worries and complaints. Tabitha Twitchit\u2019s anxious fussing over her children not being good enough \u2013 sending them to their bedroom and pretending they are ill when she has guests due \u2013 provides clues to Helen Potter\u2019s social jitteriness. As Unitarians, the family were isolated from establishment circles, and as a result felt a&#xa0;defensive pride about never quite fitting in. The desire of Mrs Twitchit\u2019s kittens to roll in the mud and walk on all fours speaks to Beatrix and her brother Bertram\u2019s longing to throw off decorum and behave like other children, whom they were never allowed to meet. While Beatrix kept a&#xa0;secret diary for years in which she poured out her frustrations, Bertram kept a secret wife, a lower-class girl whom he never permitted to meet his&#xa0;parents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most fulfilled charac\u00adters in Potter\u2019s books are those who manage to break free of the nuclear family to live alone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fathers, in Potter\u2019s world, may be less actively damaging, but they still fail to play their proper part. On the first page of her first book we hear that Mr Rabbit has already been caught and put in a pie by Mrs McGregor, the gardener\u2019s wife. His kinsman Benjamin Bunny, meanwhile, is too improvident to provide for his many children who are often left slightly hungry. No one could ever have accused Rupert Potter of having failed to feed the increasingly stout Beatrix, but it is the case that he never took his daughter\u2019s painterly talent sufficiently seriously. Despite being a friend of Millais, he failed to provide her with the kind of rigorous training that would have brought shape and purpose to what she described as a sleep-walking existence.</p> <p>For Dennison, then, it is no surprise that the most fulfilled characters in Potter\u2019s books are those who have managed to break free of the nuclear family to live alone: Jeremy Fisher, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Mrs Tittlemouse. Which is exactly what Beatrix did when, in the wake of her fiance Warne\u2019s premature death in 1905, and with money coming in from her wildly successful \u201clittle books\u201d, she bought Hill Top Farm in the Lake District and lived there alone for part of&#xa0;each year. Finally able to do as she wished, she took to dressing so sketchily that one vagrant, meeting her on a&#xa0;lake ferry, mistook her for being a&#xa0;member of his travelling clan.</p> <p>These insights about the dark side of&#xa0;Potter\u2019s work are not new \u2013 literary critics have long been in the business of producing interpretations that would have struck the chatelaine of Hill Top as \u201cFreudian\u201d in the extreme (<em>The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin</em>, for instance, is apparently an Edwardian morality tale about the dangers of masturbation). But Dennison attempts to work this kind of close and sceptical reading into&#xa0;a narrative that is essentially a cradle-to-grave biography. This fresh approach is most effective for the early books, with Dennison providing a persuasive account of how the best Potter tales grew out of the oppressive frustrations of Bolton Gardens. What is&#xa0;missing is a full understanding of Potter\u2019s diminishing creativity once she was in possession of a husband, a farm and a purpose, saving 4,000 acres of the Lake District for the nascent National Trust, and why she no longer had the desire or, as&#xa0;it turned out, the ability to add much to her basketful of imaginary animal friends.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Over the Hills and Far Away: The Life of&#xa0;Beatrix Potter</em> is published by Head of Zeus.

Gawker.com was soon <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/18/gawker-to-close-univision-sale\">shut down by its new owner, Univision</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The case wasn\u2019t entirely black and white, and controversy abounded when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/26/paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-admits-bankrolling-hulk-hogan-gawker-lawsuit\">it emerged that Bollea\u2019s lawsuit was actually funded by Peter Thiel</a>, a Silicon Valley billionaire and co-founder of PayPal, who had had his own issues with Gawker in the past after the site published an article about his sexuality. Press freedom advocates feared that the verdict would pave the way for other rich and powerful people to pursue personal vendettas by giving financial backing to chosen litigants in order to take down those who had wronged them. It is not a fear Harder shares.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a meritorious case,\u201d he says. \u201cIf my firm had taken on the case on a contingency fee basis, if a public interest organisation had taken on the case, if the client had paid for the case himself, or if he had gotten funding from an outside litigation funding company, he would still have gotten the verdict that he got. Mr Thiel just happened to pay Hulk Hogan\u2019s costs, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the merits of the case. Gawker had violated his privacy, violated the law, and a jury ruled in his favour. That\u2019s why the case ended up the way that it did.\u201d</p> <p>Since the Hogan verdict, Harder\u2019s list of influential clients has been growing. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/03/amber-heard-johnny-depp-divorce-blackmail-suit-doug-stanhope\">He was hired by Amber Heard to sue the comedian Doug Stanhope</a> after he wrote online that the actress was blackmailing her estranged husband Johnny Depp, whom she had accused of spousal abuse. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61d2be5c-7382-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a\">He was hired by the former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes to challenge negative media coverage in New York magazine</a> over sexual harassment allegations against him by his former colleagues, a partnership that led to one Forbes writer dubbing Harder <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/katiasav/status/773220883133497348\">\u201cthe rich man\u2019s favourite tool for assaulting journalism\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But perhaps his most intriguing relationship is the one he has with the Trumps.<br></p> <p>It is somewhat unusual for a major party\u2019s presidential nominee or their spouse to mount legal action against a publication so close to an election, but Trump has a reputation for threatening and pursuing legal action. The GOP candidate, who has banned publications such as the Washington Post, Politico <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">and a Guardian reporter and photographer from covering some of his events</a>, recently tweeted that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-irresponsible-intent\">his lawyers wanted him to sue the New York Times</a> for \u201cirresponsible intent\u201d in reports. While Trump never specifically mentioned Harder, some have speculated as to whether the lawyer will be acting as his right-hand man.</p> <p>When I put this to Harder, he laughs and firmly states: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, period. I don\u2019t represent Donald Trump, I represent his wife; it\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, does he agree with Trump that the hurdle established in the landmark supreme court decision in New York Times v Sullivan (1964), which requires public figures who bring defamation lawsuits against the media to establish \u201cactual malice\u201d, should be challenged?</p> <p>\u201cSeparate and apart from anything that Donald Trump has ever said, I\u2019ve always felt that the \u2018actual malice\u2019 standard is unreasonable,\u201d Harder says. \u201cJustice Byron White, who voted in favour of the standard in the New York Times v Sullivan case, 20 years later wrote a dissent in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet case, saying we all got it wrong, that the standard is far too high and it\u2019s very difficult for people who are public figures to prevail when they are actually defamed. I agree with him.\u201d</p> <p>As far as public figures go, does Harder think there is a difference between suits that come from celebrities and those that come from politicians, due to varying levels of public interest, and if so, should the term \u201cpublic figures\u201d be split into two?</p> <p>\u201cI do think that in the context of a political campaign, if a reporter is writing about issues that are relevant to the political campaign, there is some leeway there and there should be some leeway there,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re electing a Congress member, a senator, a governor, a president, or any other person to elective office, that is different from just the public\u2019s curiosity about somebody\u2019s sex life, somebody who is not seeking public office, who just happens to be an actor or a recording artist. I do think that those two have a different public importance.</p> <p>\u201cBut my view is this: if it\u2019s defamation, it\u2019s problematic, inherently. The actual malice standard basically says, \u2018OK, you do have defamation but there\u2019s an additional standard that needs to be overcome if you\u2019re a public figure.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6a9b428da1655204ccad2f302e1ffbb6160d5a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6a9b428da1655204ccad2f302e1ffbb6160d5a1/234_137_2582_1549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Denton, founder of Gawker, clashed with Terry Bollea, AKA Hulk Hogan, before the site declared bankruptcy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Denton, founder of Gawker, clashed with Terry Bollea, AKA Hulk Hogan, before the site declared bankruptcy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though he views libel laws as outdated, Harder has never seen himself as an adversary of the free press and disagrees with depictions of him as such. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m an advocate of responsible free press, but when people choose to tell lies about others, they\u2019re exposing themselves. Sometimes when people lie and lie, they become emboldened that they can get away with anything, and then they tell bigger and bigger lies against various people, some of whom can afford to bring an action. The takeaway is that news organisations need to be responsible, just like lawyers, doctors, and teachers.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Daily Mail said the newspaper had \u201coffered Mr Harder the opportunity to agree wording for the retraction days \u2013 not several weeks \u2013 after publication\u201d and that \u201cinstead of taking that opportunity, he rushed to file a lawsuit later the same day\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMr Harder\u2019s many public statements about the lawsuit have attracted vast amounts of media coverage, far more than the original article, which provoked very little response. The Daily Mail disagrees with Mr Harder\u2019s interpretation of the article as the retraction makes clear ... we note that, six weeks later, proceedings have still not been served by him in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Harder, meanwhile, says the recent increase in his profile hasn\u2019t changed his life much. \u201cI\u2019ve always been busy, I\u2019ve always been hardworking, and that remains. I\u2019ve got the same family, same house, same car, same routine.\u201d He spends his spare time with his wife and children, mostly going to places around LA and doing things together. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty boring life,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I enjoy it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong> <br></strong></p> <p>The almost 17 years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/12/juliet-lyon-now-right-time-to-leave-prison-reform-trust\">Juliet Lyon</a> spent as director of the <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/\">Prison Reform Trust</a> before stepping down in July was good preparation for her new role as chair of the Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody (IAP). With figures last month showing violence and death in English and Welsh prisons at an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/21/prison-violence-at-wholly-unacceptable-level-ombudsman-finds\">all-time high</a>, the need for the IAP has probably never been greater. At the PRT Lyon often came into contact with bereaved families whose loved ones had died while in the care of the state. Although some were homicides, most were self-inflicted.</p> <p>As a long-term prisoner, I was frequently on wings and landings when fellow prisoners took their own lives. My <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1998/jan/14/guardiansocietysupplement\">first-ever article</a> for the Guardian in 1998 was about the impact that such deaths have. There were 1,247 prison suicides in the 20 years I served before my release in 2004, according to figures from the charity <a href=\"http://www.inquest.org.uk/\">Inquest</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/12/juliet-lyon-now-right-time-to-leave-prison-reform-trust\">Why I\u2019m leaving the Prison Reform Trust now | Juliet Lyon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These days death is even more prevalent in our prisons. In the 12 months to June this year there were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/543284/safety-in-custody-bulletin.pdf\">321 prison fatalities</a>. With 74 more than during the same period the previous year, it was the highest toll ever recorded in England and Wales. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/28/suicides-and-assaults-in-prisons-in-england-and-wales-at-all-time-high\">Of these, 105 were self-inflicted</a>, 186 were recorded as death from natural causes, (although since the average age in the case of such deaths is 56 it suggests that these might not be just \u201cnatural\u201d) \u2013 and at least five were prisoner-on-prisoner killings. Twenty-five other deaths are still waiting to be classified. As well as the record deaths, last year there were on average 160 cell fires a month, more than 34,000 instances of self-harm and an almost trebling of incidents involving violence.</p> <p>So how does the IAP plan to bring about a reduction in deaths? Lyon says: \u201cA priority is to learn from bereaved families and people who have attempted suicide in custody and survived.\u201d She says that just before we met she spoke to a mother whose son had been killed in prison. \u201cIf the state deprives you of your liberty, the one thing it has an obligation to do is to keep you safe. The high rate of deaths currently indicate that something is going terribly wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The IAP, an independent arms-length body, set up in 2008 on the recommendation of the <a href=\"http://iapdeathsincustody.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The-Fulton-Report-2008.pdf\">Fulton review</a> into deaths in custody advises ministers from the Home Office, the Department of Health and the Ministry of Justice. Its remit is to \u201cact as the primary source of independent advice to ministers and service leaders on measures to reduce the number and rate of deaths in custody\u201d.</p> <p>While deaths in police and immigration custody have <a href=\"http://iapdeathsincustody.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IAP-End-of-Term-Report-2016.pdf\">remained constant</a> and decreased in the case of those detained under the Mental Health Act the increase in prison deaths is a particular concern. \u201cWhat you can see from the figures,\u201d says Lyon, \u201cis that the work the Prison Service did from about 2007 on safer custody was pretty effective. There was an intense concentration on how to make prison safer, particularly on how to reduce suicide. Safer custody teams in all prisons, working closely with the Samaritans and Samaritans-trained \u2018prisoner listeners\u2019 led to quite a drop in self-inflicted deaths.</p> <p>\u201cFew people know that almost 2,000 prisoners, trained by local Samaritans, now work day and night in almost every prison across England, Scotland and Wales to support people in need. Nothing else does as much to show how much responsibility and care people in prison can shoulder and to save countless lives.\u201d</p> <p>The IAP, she says, will focus on clusters of deaths in particular prisons and look at how to reduce high numbers of natural deaths in custody. \u201cWe\u2019ll also be briefing ministers on evidence and solutions to the distressing rise in the deaths of women in prison, 11 in the year to June 2016 compared to one death the year before \u2013 and on the particular vulnerability of people still serving the long-abolished<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/18/strasbourg-judges-indeterminate-sentences-unlawful\"> indeterminate sentence for public protection</a> (IPP). We have to really be prepared to work across departments to find solutions, but we can set and monitor guidelines.\u201d</p> <p>The justice secretary Liz Truss has declared very publicly that she wants to make <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmjust/647/64702.htm\">prison safety</a> her priority and when she was home secretary, Theresa May gave a speech supporting the joint PRT and Women\u2019s Institute <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/care-not-custody-speech\">Care not Custody</a> campaign to stop vulnerable people ending up in police or prison cells. But prison staff cuts, the massive increase in the use of new psychoactive substances \u2013 so-called \u201clegal highs\u201d \u2013 and general overcrowding has meant that prison regimes have become more and more limited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/28/prison-deaths-self-harm-figures-rise\">Deaths and self-harm in prison rise sharply</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does she agree with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/19/samaritans-urges-action-on-prison-staffing-after-sharp-rise-in-suicides\">Samaritans</a> that the cuts are largely responsible for the rise in prison deaths? \u201cThe causes are complex,\u201d she says, \u201cbut<strong> </strong>sucking hope out of the system has taken a terrible toll. Research and best practice show that good staff-prisoner relations, personal officer work, information-sharing with other disciplines, mental healthcare and constructive regimes with time out of cell, contact with family and friends and something to work towards all make a positive difference.\u201d</p> <p>She says she welcomes the opportunity and the responsibility to help reduce deaths in custody. \u201cWhen someone takes their own life it is hard to describe, or even imagine, the despair that has led to it or the pain of loved ones left behind. If you talk to anyone charged with the care of people who are detained, they never forget a death in custody \u2013 it\u2019s like swallowing a stone that never goes away.\u201d She says she had lots of misgivings about giving an interview so early in her new role.</p> <p>\u201cBut as long as it goes beyond a day in the papers and serves as a firm reminder of the state\u2019s duty to protect life and the pressing need to make prisons safer then it will be worth it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age</strong> 66.</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> North London.</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married, two children.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Exeter University (English and drama degree); Institute of Education (Rights MA).</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> 2000-16: director, Prison Reform Trust; 1990-2000: associate director, Trust for the Study of Adolescence; 1980-90: regional manager, Richmond Fellowship; 1976-79: head of community education, Court Fields school, Somerset; 1975-76: teacher in charge, Dryden Clinic Exe Vale; 1971-75; social services foster parent, Devon and Camden; 1971-72: research assistant, Schools Council.</p> <p><strong>Public life</strong> Chair, Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody; visiting professor, Birkbeck, University of London; CBE.</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> Gardening, beekeeping.</p>",

She says there\u2019s a \u201chuge problem\u201d with Brits working long hours. \u201cThe boundaries between home and work are blurring \u2013 not many people are clocking off anymore and the rise of technology means work follows you home.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dr&#xa0;Gail Kinman, professor of occupational health psychology at the University of Bedfordshire, says there are many advantages to flexible working, such as allowing people to juggle the demands of their work and personal life. But she admits there are plenty of downsides too. \u201cTechnology encourages employees&#xa0;to be \u2018always on\u2019 and employers and clients may increasingly expect availability and a prompt response,\u201d says Kinman. </p> <p>There are also issues around putting in longer hours when you are working remotely. \u201cPeople who feel they are not trusted to work at home&#xa0;unsupervised may be more likely to put in extra hours in order to show that they are worthy of trust and justify the \u2018favour\u2019 of being allowed to work remotely,\u201d Kinman says. \u201cThe potential to work all of the time means that some people have problems detaching themselves from work \u2013 both physically and mentally \u2013 and a lack of recovery time can impair health, personal relationships and productivity.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just affecting employees, it is an issue many entrepreneurs face too. \u201cPeople have to self regulate their time and this may be challenging under conditions of high demand or when people are deeply engaged in their work,\u201d says Kinman.</p> <p>This was the case for <a href=\"https://www.grace-gordon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grace Gordon</a>, founder of her eponymous accessories label. In the first two years of setting up her business, Gordon worked 12-hour days, plus weekends. \u201cIt was counterproductive \u2013 I was working so many hours but it didn\u2019t equal productivity because it would take longer to do something,\u201d she says. \u201cI was knackered.\u201d To prevent this, she\u2019s given herself set hours \u2013 8am to 6pm plus the odd hour on an evening or weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve got my work-life balance back,\u201d she says. It\u2019s also helped that she\u2019s now working from a studio in Lewes rather than her home, which gives her the sense that she\u2019s finished work for the day. </p> <p>Flexibility has taken off within small businesses, helping to not only attract staff but also retain them. Digital marketing agency <a href=\"http://thetypefacegroup.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Typeface Group</a> allows staff to work flexible hours \u2013 letting them work longer days (to make up time) or to complete a project from home. So how do they ensure staff have a good work-life balance? </p> <p>\u201cWe monitor hours to ensure that none of the team are heading for burn-out,\u201d says Typeface Group director Natalie Weaving. She says the businesses makes it clear that staff are not expected to to check work emails at weekends or while they are on holiday. \u201cWe\u2019ve started to make it clear to freelancers and contractors that after certain time on weekdays, or throughout the weekends, they are not going to get an immediate response. We are conscious if we start getting emails at random times of the night from employees or contractors that we need to speak to them to check they are not taking too much on.\u201d</p> <p>At London-based digital marketing agency <a href=\"http://www.platypusdigital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Platypus Digital</a> staff don\u2019t have set working hours, instead the goal is to hit deadlines. \u201cIt\u2019s been beneficial for work-life balance, simply because they can fit in work around life, not life around work,\u201d says Matt Collins,&#xa0;chief executive at Platypus.</p> <p>But does such an approach mean that staff are unable to switch off? \u201cFor most, work emails are just a tap away on their phones, day and night, weekdays and weekend,\u201d admits Collins. \u201cSwitching off is a state of mind and I go to great lengths to encourage a healthy attitude to our work along with the flexible working,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that I\u2019m not impressed by presenteeism, only outputs.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/may/31/time-saving-tools-ecommerce-businesses\">Time-saving tools for e-commerce businesses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Jackson, the issue isn\u2019t flexible working, it\u2019s the workload. \u201cPeople have got so much to do that they\u2019re still having to do extra hours and they\u2019re stressed. It\u2019s having a negative impact on people\u2019s physical and mental wellbeing. The real burden is the amount of work, not flexible working.\u201d<br></p> <p>For those working at home, experts recommend downing tools at a certain time and then focusing your attention on something else.

  "<p>The extent of the involvement of Amber Rudd\u2019s father in a business she was running in the late 1980s, despite him being declared unfit to be a director, has been disclosed by an accountant who worked for the family firm.</p> <p>Speaking exclusively to the Guardian, Simon Spector, an accountant for the family\u2019s investment vehicle Lawnstone, described how strategy would be discussed at Tony Rudd\u2019s home in Kensington Square, London and his \u201craft of contacts\u201d was used to help raise money.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose there were meetings there because that was where Tony lived and it was one of the places they met to gather and discuss strategy and opportunities,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The home secretary\u2019s father had been the subject of an excoriating 1988 Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) report, which dealt with his management of a separate company that ceased trading in 1981. The report said he was \u201ceither unaware or chose to ignore\u201d the duties of a company director and was unfit to direct \u201cany company whether private or public\u201d.</p> <p>In light of the report\u2019s criticisms and recommendations, in the past week the Guardian asked Amber Rudd how she had ensured that her father was not involved in the day-to-day running of Lawnstone. She declined to answer the question, as did her father.</p> <p>Instead, a spokesperson for the home secretary said: \u201cIt is a matter of public record that Amber had a career in business before working in politics.\u201d There is no suggestion of any breach of any of the laws governing the directors of companies.</p> <p>An analysis of the Lawnstone parent company\u2019s accounts also indicate that it paid no corporation tax in any of the eight years for which the home secretary was its director.</p> <p>Amber Rudd became a director and shareholder of Lawnstone Limited at the age of 24 in January 1988, taking over from her sister and brother-in-law.</p> <p>Seven months later, a report of a DTI investigation into Tony Rudd\u2019s management of the separate Greenbank Trust found that he had systematically misused it and stripped it of its assets.</p> <p>Having taken control of Lawnstone earlier that year, Amber Rudd restructured it with a new parent entity \u2013 The Lawnstone Group plc \u2013 owning the original Lawnstone Limited.</p> <p>Despite the parent company\u2019s registered office being in Lower Belgrave Street, its first three years of accounts were signed off at Tony Rudd\u2019s Kensington Square home, despite him officially playing no role in the running or ownership of the company.</p> <p>Spector, an accountant who served as The Lawnstone Group\u2019s secretary in the early 1990s, said that although he was \u201cin the background\u201d and not responsible for the day-to-day running of the firm, Tony Rudd continued to provide advice to the firm.</p> <p>Lawnstone specialised in developing startups and identifying potential investors. \u201cAmber would be finding investors, people. Companies that wanted investment would come to the advisers to try and find the people. Amber had connections in the City,\u201d said Spector. \u201cTony, I think, still had a lot of connections in the City.\u201d</p> <p>Under Amber Rudd, the company paid fees to her father \u201cin respect of financial consultancy and public relations advice\u201d, including a \u00a324,500 payment in 1995 and smaller payments of \u00a31,500 in 1996 and 1999.</p> <p>Richard Murphy, a chartered accountant and anti-tax avoidance campaigner, described the arrangement as \u201ca red flag signal that there may be something wrong\u201d, adding that the difference between an adviser and a director of a company was a distinction of which he had been conscious throughout his career.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between advising a company and going occasionally to a meeting, and being a regular attender at a meeting which takes place at your home, where you are paid,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Lawnstone Group\u2019s accounts reveal that the company paid zero corporation tax under the home secretary\u2019s control, despite reporting five-figure profits in its final four years.</p> <p>As a result of the losses acquired when the new company was incorporated, as well as further losses incurred between 1990 and 1993, the company paid no tax throughout its entire lifespan, despite reporting five-figure pre-tax profits from 1994 to 1997.</p> <p>The Lawnstone Group\u2019s 1990 accounts note that \u201ca subsidiary had corporation tax losses of approximately \u00a3178,000 available to be carried forward for set off against future profits\u201d. The company never paid tax, but did claim \u00a31,638 back from the government in 1991 for an overpayment of tax before Amber Rudd took over the company.</p> <p>Spector, who was not involved at the time, said that the company had been structured so as to avoid large tax bills by offsetting a \u201cbig deal\u201d that had \u201cgone very sour\u201d against future profits.</p> <p>\u201cThey were trying to structure it so they could actually utilise the losses,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a deal that had gone wrong, before I got involved so they were trying to structure it so they could utilise it against some of the things that were succeeding.\u201d</p> <h2>Amber Rudd and the Kensington Square connection</h2> <p>There are several houses currently for sale on Kensington Square.</p> <p>A four-bedroom house is priced at \u00a36.75m, with the estate agent praising the view over \u201cone of London\u2019s most beautiful and exclusive garden squares\u201d.</p> <p>Another Grade II house \u201cmoments from stylish Kensington High Street\u201d is on the market for \u00a37m.</p> <p>It was in these exclusive surroundings the home secretary took her first steps in a business career that is now raising questions about her life before she entered parliament six years ago.</p> <p>Central to the questions is her relationship with her father, the former stockbroker Tony Rudd.</p> <p>It is unusual to have been involved in one DTI investigation. Perhaps uniquely, Tony Rudd was involved in three.</p> <p>In the run-up to major changes to the City in the 1980s, his stockbroking firm Rowe Rudd decided to take over a small investment trust called the Greenbank Trust. To do this, he set up a company called Malton, which would acquire Greenbank.</p> <p>The takeover was a disaster. Within just a few months, Greenbank, Rowe Rudd and Malton\u2019s finances were precariously intertwined. Greenbank\u2019s assets were stripped, and the DTI stepped in.</p> <p>The DTI\u2019s report on Greenbank reveals serious issues in the management of the company.</p> <p>At one point, in order to remove debt from Rowe Rudd\u2019s balance sheet, 58 shares in another company were revalued. Despite having been valued at 10p each originally, the shares were re-priced at \u00a310,000. The DTI report says this was \u201cclearly designed to ensure there was no indebtedness\u201d in Rowe Rudd.</p> <p>\u201cThey were then transferred for \u00a3580,000,\u201d notes the report. \u201cThis converted a debit balance of \u00a3360,000 in the books of Rowe Rudd &amp; Co into a credit balance.\u201d</p> <p>On another occasion, Rowe Rudd carried out a series of trades for a Swiss company called Glenlyon \u2013 although no one at Rowe Rudd appeared to know who or what Glenlyon was.</p> <p>One of the Rowe Rudd partners told the DTI that Glenlyon was \u201ca client of Tony Rudd\u2019s\u201d, but was unable to provide any further information. Rudd\u2019s solicitors eventually provided an address for Glenlyon in Geneva.</p> <p>The DTI inspectors noted: \u201cWe wrote to Glenlyon Trading SA at this address; the letter was returned marked \u2018inconnu\u2019. We caused inquiries to be made in Switzerland for the years 1981-1983. From these inquiries it appears that no Glenlyon Trading SA or similar named organisation had traded from that or any other address in Switzerland in that period nor was any such company registered in Switzerland.\u201d</p> <p>Rowe Rudd\u2019s share structure was so complicated that when DTI inspectors asked who was managing the company, \u201cthe answer we received was that Mr Rudd has been running\u201d the company \u201cdespite not knowing who owned the company\u201d.</p> <p>At one point, Tony Rudd\u2019s colleague admitted to inspectors: \u201cI have actually spoken to one or two chums and it would appear there has been a breach [of company law].\u201d</p> <p>The DTI concluded: \u201cThe impression those concerned attempted to convey was that no one knew what had taken place. However, the fact is, sufficiently clear instructions were given and acted on which led to Greenbank being stripped of its assets.\u201d</p> <p>Although the Greenbank report was completed in 1985, the issue was passed to the official receiver, and the report was not published until the summer of 1988.</p> <p>Its conclusions were clear. Rudd and his business partner were \u201ctotally unfit to be directors of any company whether private or public\u201d.</p> <p>That was by no means the last of the problems.</p> <p><strong>A meeting with Katie Chalus</strong></p> <p>A new company had been set up: an investment vehicle called Lawnstone Limited.</p> <p>By 1984, Lawnstone\u2019s ownership was passed to Amanda Rudd, Amber Rudd\u2019s older sister. In that same year, Amanda married a man called Philippe Le Roux.</p> <p>The following year, the chairman of a manufacturing company, Dennis Poore, decided he wanted to break up the firm, which was called Manganese Bronze.</p> <p>Poore was a close friend of Tony Rudd\u2019s and consulted him and Lawnstone about what to do.</p> <p>Eventually, Rudd\u2019s son-in-law Le Roux and some associates decided to take over a division of Manganese Bronze. This became the Norton Villiers Triumph Group.</p> <p>This spin-off of Norton Villiers soon became the subject of a second DTI inquiry and, if anything, this was even more dramatic than the Greenbank investigation.</p> <p>At one point, for example, a Norton director gave a vivid description of an Iranian woman called Katie Chalus, who intended to buy one of the company\u2019s properties.</p> <p>\u201cI know she was an Iranian lady and reasonably wealthy,\u201d said the director, adding that he had met her at an airport. However, as the DTI continued to investigate, another director \u201cultimately acknowledged to us that the so-called Mrs Chalus did not exist\u201d.</p> <p>Although the home secretary was not formally interviewed by the DTI, Amber Rudd, along with her mother and father, did provide information to this inquiry.</p> <p>Le Roux was ultimately fined \u00a315,000, while other directors were jailed.</p> <p>With Amanda and Le Roux involved in Norton, Lawnstone was transferred yet again.</p> <p>This time, it passed to Amber Rudd.</p> <p><strong>Questions for the home secretary</strong></p> <p>Amber Rudd became a director of Lawnstone Limited in 1988 and the company was rapidly restructured.</p> <p>However, despite its new management and ownership, Lawnstone did not separate itself from the grand Kensington Square property where Tony Rudd continued to live.</p> <p>Simon Spector, the accountant for the family\u2019s investment vehicle told the Guardian that Amber Rudd continued to hold meetings there.</p> <p>Spector, who worked for Rudd family companies for several years, also said Tony Rudd\u2019s contacts were used to develop business deals.</p> <p>Under Amber Rudd\u2019s ownership, Lawnstone was restructured, which was advantageous because the company brought tax losses of \u00a3178,000 which could be set off against future profits.</p> <p>Lawnstone specialised in developing new companies and finding rich individuals who wanted to invest in start-up companies. The company continued to pay occasional consultancy fees to Rudd\u2019s father, including a \u00a324,500 payment in 1995.</p> <p>The Guardian asked the home secretary two key questions about Lawnstone: what steps did you take to ensure that your father was not involved in forming, marketing or running a company, given that the company was operating out of his home, and he was being paid for consultancy services? What did the consultancy services provided by your father involve?</p> <p>But her reply offered no answers.</p> <p>Instead, her advisers sent a statement which said: \u201cIt is a matter of public record that Amber had a career in business before working in politics.\u201d</p> <p>Under the home secretary\u2019s management, the Lawnstone Group was not successful. Within months, Lawnstone had bought two finance companies, both of which went bust within a year.</p> <p>A third company connected to the Rudd family was also struck off after the DTI petitioned for its winding up in 1987. Buckingham Corporate Securities had been based at offices occupied by Tony Rudd and Lawnstone. There is no suggestion that Amber Rudd was involved in Buckingham.</p> <p>A few years later, Lawnstone invested heavily in a company called Monticello, and Amber Rudd became a director of that company.</p> <p>The shares in Monticello were suspended from trading after the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark O\u2019Hanlon, gave an extensive and highly misleading interview about the company\u2019s prospects. O\u2019Hanlon was eventually jailed. There is no suggestion that Amber Rudd was involved in share-ramping.</p>",
  "<p>When I was 13, in 1983, I spent several weeks trying to like a new LP called <em>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</em>. There was no band name, or band photos, or song titles on the record sleeve, which was dominated by a doomy old painting of a basket of roses, bone-coloured blooms against a dark backdrop. The music seemed equally forbidding: long, circling, incremental songs, with a small-voiced singer trudging across great expanses of bass and drums. Most British pop then was much brighter and less mysterious. The older boys at school noted my choice of listening with approval.</p> <p>Over the 33 years since, New Order have gone from cult taste to pop institution \u2013 pioneers of both dance music and rock, co-writers of England\u2019s only decent World Cup song, global performers of addictive, happy-sad hits such as \u201cTrue Faith\u201d and \u201cBlue Monday\u201d \u2013 in a way that would have bewildered earnest early fans like me. This book, by the band\u2019s bassist Peter Hook, aims to be \u201cthe most complete and truthful record of life inside New Order as is humanly possible\u201d. It is as self-importantly long as a Victorian novel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYH8DsU2WCk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FYH8DsU2WCk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It will also come as a shock to anyone who has taken New Order\u2019s often solemn, hairshirt image at face value. While I was poring over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/08/power-corruption-lies-new-order\"><em>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</em></a> in 1983, the band were on tour in California: \u201cWe had a food fight in the dressing room,\u201d writes Hook. \u201cAfter the show we met ... two girls who both looked like Raquel Welch.\u201d The \u201conly other thing of note\u201d was their tour manager Terry Mason \u201cgetting so sunburned that when he dived in the pool the next day\u201d he and \u201chis top layer of skin parted company ... Everyone around the pool ran away screaming.\u201d</p> <p>Hook describes himself in the book as \u201ca daft twat from Salford\u201d. He includes on-the-road anecdotes about groupies and drink and drugs with such glee and tirelessness that even the most rock\u2019n\u2019roll readers will probably find themselves skipping sections. As soon as their career trajectory allowed, he says, New Order behaved like \u201cpigs at a trough\u201d. This note of self-disgust tempers all the laddishness a little, as does an unusual attention to detail: \u201cThe thing with crack is that it\u2019s better than coke while you\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s much smoother, warmer and not as edgy,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut then afterwards ... you\u2019d happily slit your own throat.\u201d At times, <em>Substance</em> \u2013 the book\u2019s title is surely an unsubtle druggy pun as well as a claim to definitiveness \u2013 becomes as debauched as the notorious biography of the 70s rock decadents Led Zeppelin,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/omm/story/0,13887,1415153,00.html\"> <em>Hammer of the Gods</em></a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0731935bc1df6a62396c9a28de523b52451f7e89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0731935bc1df6a62396c9a28de523b52451f7e89/0_156_1440_1799/800.jpg\" alt=\"Performing at the Super Rock festival, Portugal, in 2005.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing at the Super Rock festival, Portugal, in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel de Almeida/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But New Order were blotting something out as well as enjoying themselves. The band began in 1980, hastily formed from the remnants of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/12/ian-curtis-so-this-is-permanence-joy-division\">Joy Division</a>, a more tormented, more shortlived group whose singer Ian Curtis killed himself, partly because of the pressures of approaching fame. Four years ago Hook published a shorter, more delicate memoir about Joy Division, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/28/unknown-pleasures-peter-hook-review\"><em>Unknown Pleasures</em></a>, and in <em>Substance</em> he says little, at least at first, about the transition from one band to the other. According to him the three surviving musicians simply, almost unthinkingly, carried on playing together. Their sometimes tyrannical manager Rob Gretton chose another name for them, from a Sunday Times story about a Cambodian rebel group (and not, as widely supposed, as a would-be transgressive Nazi reference). Then the band began adapting their music to make up for Curtis\u2019s absence.</p> <p>Thanks to his unhappiness and sense of drama, Joy Division songs had been grand but terse. New Order\u2019s were less bleak, more expansive, shaped by the band\u2019s sense of a fresh start, and by the uplifting dance records they heard in New York nightclubs during their American tours. But because of limited technology \u2013 the electronics they wanted to use remained expensive \u2013 and lack of musical technique (\u201cnone of us could sing and play at the same time\u201d), it took half a decade for New Order to turn the sparse, awkward experimentation of their initial records into the busy, shiny, surging sound which would make them mainstream stars. Hook tells the story of this stop-start transformation well. \u201cThe best version\u201d of \u201cBlue Monday\u201d was lost when the drummer, Stephen Morris, used a kettle lead to connect a costly new drum machine to a socket: \u201cAfter days of programming \u2026 the mains lead popped out of the back \u2026 the machine dumped all its information\u201d.</p> <p>Hook portrays his bandmates as inspired, if sometimes careless, musicians, but pretty poor human beings. New Order\u2019s singer and guitarist Bernard Sumner, in particular, is \u201ca twat\u201d on one page, keenly appreciated on the next: \u201cThe struggle in Bernard\u2019s voice was a major part of the band\u2019s appeal.\u201d As New Order matured, there was an ongoing battle between Sumner, who wanted to make them more polished and electronic, and Hook, whose booming, melancholy bass-playing was a rawer, more analogue presence, a vestige of Joy Division\u2019s intensity. While recording New Order\u2019s 1986 album <em>Brotherhood</em>, Hook reveals with satisfaction, he conspired against Sumner with a sound engineer, disconnecting a control intended to quieten his bass on the LP. By the mid-80s, New Order and their swelling entourage had split into barely communicating factions.</p> <p>Rock writing rarely tells us properly what a band treading water or in slow decline feels like from the inside. Hook does so memorably. \u201cIn Japan again,\u201d he writes with ennui and pleasure, \u201cwe were introduced to two new wonderful things: kimonos and Kobe beef \u2026 Our palates, along with our waistlines, were expanding.\u201d The last two-thirds of the book is an ambivalent record of ever more lucrative foreign tours, drawn-out recording sessions and breakaway solo projects by band members \u2013 in many ways, New Order came to resemble the 70s rock aristocrats who had helped provoke Joy Division and other punk-aligned bands into being in the first place.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VcGJZpfl1c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0VcGJZpfl1c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>New Order retained their musical credibility, though, by being adaptable, their mindset and song structures open enough to absorb modern sounds and production techniques. The band\u2019s finances were another matter. Hook tells the familiar story of the fall of the innovative but rickety Manchester-based musical empire with which New Order were entwined: the record label <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/13/comment.pop\">Factory and the Hacienda nightclub</a>, which finally collapsed in 1992 and 1997 respectively. Other awful, premature losses have punctuated the band\u2019s long existence: the unhealthy Gretton died in 1999; Martin Hannett, the equally obsessive and brilliant producer of New Order\u2019s first releases and of Joy Division, died in 1991. The comedian Caroline Aherne, with whom Hook had a volcanic marriage between 1994 and 1997, died this July. Controversially, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/03/peter-hook-caroline-aherne-physically-abusive-during-marriage\">Hook accuses Aherne of \u201cputting cigarettes out on my arm, attacking me with bottles, knives, chairs\u201d</a>. For all his boisterous indestructability, this book often has a haunted quality, and is all the more powerful for it.</p> <p>He left New Order in 2007, not long after his 50th birthday. Several pages here usefully and drolly demystify the job of being a rock star, and one details the physical toll of decades of bass-playing, worsened by Hook\u2019s idiosyncratic, low-slung, Viking-warrior style: \u201ctrapped nerves in neck \u2026 bent lower spine \u2026 one arm longer than the other\u201d.</p> <p>New Order still exist, and last year released their tenth album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/27/new-order-music-complete-review-unexpectedly-coherent\"><em>Music Complete</em></a>, to decent reviews. In 2014, Sumner published his own memoir of Joy Division and New Order, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/30/musicians-memoirs-setting-the-record-straight\"><em>Chapter and Verse</em></a>. None of this receives much attention from Hook here. \u201cNever trust a musician,\u201d he warns at one point. \u201cEven me.\u201d For the last half dozen years, he has been performing Joy Division and New Order songs with a new band, the Light: Hook sings, his son plays bass. \u201cHe\u2019s almost as good as me,\u201d Hook writes, characteristically both bragging and self-mocking. It\u2019s a sentimental, slightly claustrophobic end to a book about how some gifted young Britons tried to escape a great darkness in the early 80s, like a few of their compatriots, and never quite did so.

  "<p>On 23 February, Donald Trump stood before a rally of cheering supporters to celebrate a thumping victory in the Nevada Republican caucus \u2013 his third consecutive win, in defiance of the naysayers who had predicted that his bubble was about to burst. \u201cIf you listen to the pundits, we weren\u2019t expected to win too much \u2013 and now we\u2019re winning, winning, winning the country,\u201d he bragged. \u201cWe won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.\u201d</p> <p>That last line provoked immediate waves of mockery. It sounded at the time like another one of Trump\u2019s many gaffes \u2013 he loves that people do not get a decent education? Yet behind the mockery was a real sense of disquiet, which has not gone away: Trump loves the less educated because they appear to love him back. As the Atlantic reported in March: \u201cThe best single predictor of Trump support in the Republican primary is the absence of a college degree.\u201d Education \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 seemed to be propelling the Trump bandwagon.</p> <p>The possibility that education has become a fundamental divide in democracy \u2013 with the educated on one side and the less educated on another \u2013 is an alarming prospect. It points to a deep alienation that cuts both ways. The less educated fear they are being governed by intellectual snobs who know nothing of their lives and experiences. The educated fear their fate may be decided by know-nothings who are ignorant of how the world really works. Bringing the two sides together is going to be very hard. The current election season appears to be doing the opposite.</p> <p>Trump continues to poll far ahead of Clinton among voters who did not go to college, while Clinton still leads by a considerable margin among college graduates. This is a significant change from 2012, when the picture was far more mixed. Four years ago, the college-educated vote was almost evenly split, with graduates favouring Obama over Romney by a narrow margin, 50 to 48. Recent polling puts Trump\u2019s lead over Clinton among <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/poll-trump-leads-clinton-76-percent-to-17-percent-among-white-men-without-college-degrees/\">white men without a college degree</a> at a sobering 76 to 19.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/29/how-the-education-gap-is-tearing-politics-apart-podcast\">How the education gap is tearing politics apart \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, there are other factors at play here. Race is one; gender is the other. The overwhelming majority of Trump\u2019s supporters are white, regardless of their education levels. However, white men with a college degree split much more evenly between the candidates, whereas white women without a college degree still strongly favour Trump. Less educated voters who support Trump are not necessarily poor: many earn more than $50,000 (\u00a339,000) a year. Trump scores particularly well among small business owners who did not go to college. These polling numbers \u2013 which are only indicative, since no one has actually voted yet \u2013 can be unpicked a hundred different ways. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that how people vote is increasingly being shaped by how long they spent at school.</p> <p>What is happening in the United States has also been happening in the UK. The Brexit campaign had its own Trumpian moment, courtesy of Michael Gove, who told Faisal Islam in an interview on Sky News on 3 June that \u201cthe British people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">had enough of experts</a>\u201d. Gove was also widely mocked \u2013 if not experts, who was he proposing to get to repair his car, fix his teeth, teach his kids?</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what he said struck a deep chord, because it contained a large element of truth. The experts Gove was deriding had been telling the British public that the risks of Brexit far outweighed any potential benefits. Gove insisted that the voters should decide this for themselves, on the basis of their own experiences, rather than listening to elite voices that had a vested interest in the outcome. Those voices came trailing educational qualifications, which had put them in their positions of authority \u2013 at the IMF, the Bank of England, the Treasury. Gove was asking voters lacking anything like the same educational qualifications to feel empowered to reject what they were being told. And in the referendum on 23 June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">that is what they did</a>.</p> <p>Voters with postgraduate qualifications split 75 to 25 in favour of remain. Meanwhile, among those who left school without any qualifications, the vote was almost exactly reversed: 73 to 27 for leave. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/people-who-felt-marginalised-drove-brexit-vote-study-finds\">report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> last month confirmed that \u201ceducational opportunity was the strongest driver\u201d of the Brexit vote. Again, there were plenty of other factors at work \u2013 including a significant generational divide. Older voters were far more likely to vote leave, which partly helps to explain the education gap, since the rapid expansion of higher education in recent decades means older voters are also much less likely to have attended university. But the Rowntree report concludes that educational experience was the biggest single determinant of how people voted. Class still matters. Age still matters. But education appears to matter more.</p> <p>A post-Brexit electoral map of Britain starkly illustrates this new divide. Scotland voted remain for its own particular reasons. But in England and Wales, many university towns emerged from the referendum as isolated outposts of pro-EU sentiment in a sea of Brexit. Newcastle, York, Nottingham, Norwich, Cambridge, Brighton, Warwick, Exeter, Bristol, Reading, Oxford and Cardiff all voted remain. I live in Cambridge, which voted remain by a margin of 74 to 26. There was consternation here following the result. It was accompanied by a barely suppressed feeling that ignorance had won the day. I lost count of the number of times I was told that one of the top trending searches on Google in the immediate aftermath of the vote was: \u201cWhat is the EU?\u201d The implication was that we had been taken out of Europe by people who did not even know what it was they were being asked to decide about.</p> <p>Few felt comfortable, at least in public, following this thought through to its logical conclusion. Yet it was hard to escape the sense that a long buried suspicion of democracy was fighting its way back to the surface. If politics has turned into a contest between ignorance and knowledge, then places like Cambridge may be starting to feel dismayed by the realisation they are now on the losing side. But that would be to fall into an old trap.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Elite anxiety about the consequences of political ignorance is nothing new. In the long history of intellectuals worrying about democracy and its failings, two basic fears keep nagging away. The first is that democracy will mean rule by the poor, who will use their power to steal from the rich. The second is that democracy will mean rule by the ignorant, who will use their power to do the dumbest things. Both these worries go back at least as far as Plato. The ancient Greeks understood full well that democracy meant letting the have-nots get their claws into the haves. For Aristotle, that\u2019s what the word meant: it was rule by the poor (the <em>demos</em>) over the wealthy. But if class conflict came with the territory, the deeper fear was what the masses might do out of sheer foolishness.</p> <p>For Plato, democracy suffered from the basic defect of putting decision-making in the hands of people who were not competent to decide. Politics was a skill \u2013 and most people were simply clueless. Worse, that made them prey for hucksters and demagogues who would promise the earth and get away with it. Democracy was fertile ground for fantasists with a taste for power. If you tell the people that up is down, and the people believe you, then who is going to let them know that they are wrong?</p> <p>These fears have never really gone away, and they reassert themselves at times of political crisis. In the 1920s, the American political commentator Walter Lippmann updated Plato for the 20th century by arguing that modern citizens simply lacked the mental capacity to process the information needed for intelligent decision-making. Lippmann had worked in American propaganda during the first world war and had seen at first hand just how easy it was to manipulate public opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIt is no longer possible,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto believe in the original dogma of democracy: that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart.\u201d People will vote on the basis of anything that grabs their attention in a passing moment, filtered by whatever deep prejudices they harbour beneath the surface. Evidence means little to the average voter; reasoned argument means even less. Lippmann concluded that democracy could only be rescued by establishing a cadre of specially trained experts, whose job was to steer politicians away from the dubious instincts of the people and back towards what the evidence required. Otherwise, the manipulation of public opinion would become the be all and end all of democracy, which is all the encouragement demagogues ever need.</p> <p>Lippmann\u2019s fears chimed with the growing worry of some prominent mid-20th century economists that too much democratic decision-making would lead to financial ruin. A series of future Nobel prize winners, from Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman, channelled the ancient critics of democracy by arguing that putting the voters in charge meant short-term impulses would prevail over long-term prudence. Ultimately, they thought, democracy produced inflation, which was just another way of the poor getting their own back on the rich. Hayek and Friedman both put their ultimate faith in the power of markets. But first, they felt experts had to be empowered to rein in the self-destructive impulses of the voters. Hayek at one point advocated restricting the franchise to those aged 45, in order to cut out the young, who don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them, and the old, who have a vested interest in the past. Hayek did not believe that anyone, however expert, could know the future. But he wanted to put self-knowledge back at the heart of democracy: the worldly wisdom of understanding what is possible, and what is just wishful thinking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that ignorance is being set against knowledge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lippmann, Hayek and Friedman insisted they were trying to save democracy, not destroy it. But what they thought democracy needed saving from was itself. The voters had to be rescued from their preference for fairytales and the people peddling them. In the late 20th century, partly under the influence of such thinkers, democratic politics did carve out spaces where experts could be better insulated from the impulsive decision-making of the masses, as independent central banks and other unelected bodies were entrusted with more and more decision-making capacity, away from the glare of public opinion. Now, in the 21st century, these are the experts who find that the voters no longer want to heed their advice.</p> <p>In the year of Trump and Brexit, it is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that popular ignorance is once again being set against expert knowledge. Trump is what you get when demagoguery is allowed to run unchecked, egged on by a craven media that simply enjoys the show. Brexit is what you get if you ask people a question that they lack the basic information to answer. This is the view that has been doing the rounds in the circles in which the highly educated move. But to think this is a big mistake.<strong> </strong>The educational divide that is opening up in our politics is not really between knowledge and ignorance. It is a clash between one worldview and another.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>What is the EU?<strong> </strong>Hearing educated remainers mock those who asked that question the day after the vote was an uncomfortable experience \u2013 and not just because the story about Google searches was largely apocryphal. After all, the question is not as straightforward as it seems: it is simple enough to say what the letters refer to, but far more difficult to know what they really mean for our politics and our future. Education is not the same as knowledge. Nor is knowledge the same as knowing which way to vote. The split between the university towns and other parts of the country did not arise because one set of people understood what was truly at stake and the others were just taking a wild guess. Both sides were guessing.</p> <p>Even now, no one truly knows what is going to happen. The better-educated cleaved to one set of predictions because these chimed with what they already believed in. Polling carried out before the referendum, which asked people what they thought was likely to happen in the aftermath of a Brexit vote, found that university graduates thought that it would produce an immediate financial crash, whereas those with fewer qualifications thought it much more likely that things would carry on as before. Prior political preferences shape what we think the evidence shows, not the other way round.</p> <p>None of this would have surprised Lippmann. When he argued that ordinary voters were incapable of judging complex policy questions on their merits, he did not exclude the educated from that judgment. He meant everybody. As he wrote: \u201cI have not happened to meet anybody, from a president of the United States to a professor of political science, who came anywhere near to embodying the ideal of the sovereign and omnicompetent citizen.\u201d He thought that we needed experts who were trained in eliminating their own biases \u2013 and whatever a regular university education does, it does not do that.</p> <p>\u201cThe historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone astray in their moral and political thinking as often as anyone else,\u201d write the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels in their new book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html\">Democracy for Realists</a>, echoing Lippmann. What the educated are better at is sounding like they know what they are talking about, because they have been trained in how to make an argument. \u201cWell-informed people are likely to have more elaborate and internally consistent worldviews than inattentive people, but that just reflects the fact that their rationalisations are better rehearsed.\u201d Education gives you the ability to tailor your arguments to suit your personal preferences, which is why it is a big asset on the job market. But it does little to help tailor your personal preferences to suit the best arguments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Design\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian Design</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the current political climate, a lack of education is sometimes blamed for the spread of conspiracy theories, which run like wildfire through many populist movements. Trump\u2019s campaign, with its nods and winks to \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on\u201d, and its pre-emptive warnings about the vote being stolen, has been feeding and feeding off the appetite for conspiratorial thinking. Yet to blame this on the absence of education is just another version of the old fear of the credulity of the untutored masses: they will believe anything.</p> <p>The real story is more complicated. Polling conducted earlier this year by a research project in Cambridge shows that education does sometimes make a difference when it comes to conspiracy theories: the likelihood of someone thinking the moon landing was a hoax, or that the government is hiding the existence of aliens, does decline as you go higher up the education ladder. But when the theories concern politically divisive issues, then education has far less effect.</p> <p>Possessing a university degree does not alter the probability of someone believing that global warming is a hoax \u2013 that tracks prior political commitments, not superior knowledge. Nor are conspiracy theories confined to the right. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s support among Labour party members contains a high proportion of university graduates. Yet in a YouGov poll, 55% of Corbyn supporters agreed with the statement that intelligence services such as MI5 have been working to undermine Corbyn since he became leader. That figure compares with only 19% of the wider public who give credence to the same claim. People will believe what their political loyalties incline them to believe, regardless of how much education they have received.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean that our political beliefs are simply a reflection of our narrow self-interest. It is true that we all have a tendency to favour the worldview that enhances our future prospects. The preference of university graduates for remaining in the EU echoes the benefits that EU membership gives them: the free movement of labour and easy access to European networks is better for those with the qualifications to take advantage of a knowledge economy. But it is not the case that the education divide is just another version of the class divide, with the winners from globalisation lined up against the losers.</p> <p>As with Trump supporters in the US, Brexit was not simply the cause of the disadvantaged and left behind. Many Brexiteers come from the affluent middle classes, particularly in the south of England, outside of the university towns. Meanwhile, universities are producing their fair share of losers these days, as students leave burdened with debt and confronted by a bleak job market. Yet these students \u2013 rich or poor, in work or out, elite or not \u2013 overwhelmingly favoured EU membership. Education does not simply divide us on the grounds of what is in our interests. It sorts us according to where we feel we belong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Why does education do this?<strong> </strong>Political scientists have been aware of the growing education divide for decades. A report on the 1983 general election \u2013 whose authors included a young John Curtice, the current eminence grise of the UK polling business \u2013 noted that education levels were emerging as a significant indicator of voting patterns. The report put this down to the distinctive social attitudes that were picked up at university. \u201cEducational experience,\u201d it noted, \u201cis an important source of values distinct from class experience.\u201d These values often related to issues that were not straightforwardly economic.</p> <p>Graduates, even in the 1980s, tended to be much more concerned about the environment than other sectors of the population. They were also strikingly more internationalist in outlook. In 1983, 58% of graduates expressed a positive attitude to what was then known as the European Economic Community, whereas only 35% of those who left school at 16 felt the same. Not much has changed since. But at that time, the Labour party was still overtly hostile to the European project, and withdrawal from the EEC was part of its famously radical 1983 election manifesto. Many graduates reported having leftish attitudes on a whole host of other questions \u2013 from defence spending to women\u2019s rights. But on this issue their cosmopolitanism took precedence over their party loyalties. The result was that in the 1983 election more than twice as many university graduates voted for the centrist pro-European SDP-Liberal Alliance as voted for Labour.</p> <p>One reason this was not a bigger issue back then \u2013 and the Alliance did not manage to supplant Labour as the main party of opposition \u2013 was that there were not that many university graduates. Although participation had been steadily rising, in the mid-1980s fewer than one in five people had benefited from higher education. That was enough to make a difference, but not enough to tip the balance. By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/24/students-higher-education-almost-50-per-cent\">2012, university participation among 18-30 year olds was close to 50%</a>, and it has only dipped recently because of rising tuition fees. That is enough to start splitting the population into two camps.</p> <p>But it is not simply a question of demographics. The gap has been amplified by certain forms of social mobility, which have reinforced the education divide by enabling the better-educated to start congregating together: socially, geographically, romantically. In a previous generation, graduates often married non-graduates, because their choices tended to be driven by where they happened to live or work. As the clich\u00e9 has it: bosses used to marry their secretaries. Not any more, and not just because there are fewer secretaries. If you went to university, ask yourself: how many of your friends didn\u2019t go to university? And among your friends, how many of those who did are married to people who didn\u2019t? Greater freedom of movement produces greater freedom of choice. But that does not produce more social diversity, it produces more social stratification.</p> <p>Social media now enhances these patterns. Friendship groups of like-minded individuals reinforce each other\u2019s worldviews. Facebook\u2019s news feed is designed to deliver information that users are more inclined to \u201clike\u201d. Much of the shock that followed the Brexit result in educated circles came from the fact that few people had been exposed to arguments that did not match their preferences. Education does not provide any protection against these social media effects. It reinforces them.</p> <p>The growing political divide between the educated and the less educated can be seen across Europe. It is most pronounced in Scandinavian countries, where university attendance is high and levels of education are an increasing driver of voting habits. It is less visible in southern and eastern Europe \u2013 in places such as Portugal and Poland \u2013 where participation in higher education is lower, and other social factors, including family and religion, still exert a strong grip.</p> <p>But Britain and the US are different again, because of their political systems. In European countries with proportional representation, smaller parties can offer a home to particular segments of the population, including those at both ends of the education scale. The support for many European parties of the populist right is heavily drawn from less educated voters. Meanwhile, green and liberal parties, especially those that favour immigration, rely strongly on university graduates for their support. That group includes the Liberal Democrats, which is still the UK-based party that attracts the highest proportion of graduates among its voters. But as the Lib Dems have discovered to their cost, with first-past-the-post that is not enough. Under a PR system, targeting the graduate vote can generate significant representation in parliament. Here, it can get you wiped out \u2013 especially if you make a promise to students not to raise their tuition fees and then fail to keep it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The education divide derives from values often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide is never going to supplant traditional left-right politics. There is not going to be a \u201cGraduate party\u201d taking on a party of \u201cSchool Leavers\u201d. Instead the divide cuts across left and right, which is why it is proving so disruptive to our politics right now. Big-tent political parties are struggling to hold their fractured coalitions of voters together. Polling still reveals some shared attitudes between university graduates and those without educational qualifications on economic issues, such as support for trade unions and mistrust of the free market. But the education divide derives from an alternative set of values, which is often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians.</p> <p>Authoritarians are looking for order and control, libertarians want greater freedom and tolerance. Along with education levels, the strongest indicator of likely support for Brexit was shown by attitudes to capital punishment: the more you were in favour, the more you wanted to leave the EU. These attitudes tend to track educational experience. Labour\u2019s support is now split between left-leaning libertarians (broadly pro-union and anti-banks, but also pro-immigration, and often highly educated) and left-leaning authoritarians (also pro-union and anti-banks, but far tougher on immigration and very concerned about crime and community). Each grouping might gather upwards of 20% of the electorate under its wing. Together that would be enough for a parliamentary majority. But they do not fit together any more, and increasingly they neither like nor trust each other.</p> <p>The same forces are threatening to play havoc with electoral politics in the US. Trump\u2019s army of the less educated is on the march inside the Republican party, but that leaves plenty of traditional Republicans \u2013 including many college-educated ones \u2013 wondering where to go. Some Republicans will be voting for Clinton. Some traditional Democrats<strong> </strong>will be sorely tempted by Trump\u2019s deeply authoritarian message. It is true that American democracy has proved highly resilient in the past and the party system has adapted to many demographic and cultural shifts. However, it is also possible that the gap between the educated and the less educated is going to become more entrenched over time, because it is not just a question of economic interests. It represents a gulf in mutual understanding.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The conflict between rich and poor<strong> </strong>still matters a great deal in our politics. But the age-old fear that democracy would end up letting the poor steal from the rich has always looked overblown. Constitutions \u2013 including the one carefully crafted by the American founders to guard against just that outcome \u2013 have done their bit to safeguard the interests of the propertied classes. So, too, have the increasingly complex institutional arrangements that give power to experts in areas \u2013 defence, finance, environment, health \u2013 where technical knowledge is assumed to be required. Representative democracy has proved effective at staving off class war. It has done it by finding electoral outlets for popular dissatisfaction \u2013 as with the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, of Attlee in 1945, or of Obama in 2008 \u2013 that never quite let the people take charge. When inequality gets out of hand, the system does what it can to correct for it. But it is designed to avoid extreme solutions driven by popular anger. That still holds. The haves do not look in danger of being expropriated by the have-nots any time soon.</p> <p>The contest between the educated and the less educated is different. Many of the safeguards that have been put in place to bypass popular politics \u2013 above all, the authority that now resides in central banks \u2013 have had the effect of empowering a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite. These are not just the bankers, but the lawyers, the doctors, the civil servants, the technicians, the pundits, the academics. Not all of the educated are winners in this world, but almost all of the winners are educated. It gives the impression that knowledge has become a proxy for influence.</p> <p>When Gove suggested that the experts should not be trusted because they have a vested interest in what they are saying, that was his point: once knowledge becomes a prerequisite of power, then it no longer speaks for itself. It appears to speak for the worldview of the people who possess it. At that point it ceases to be knowledge and simply becomes another mark of privilege.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of superiority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide has the potential to break apart the careful ties that hold representative democracy together. Regardless of our different interests, we elect representatives to take decisions on our behalf on the understanding that we share certain basic values, including a respect for knowledge, wherever it comes from. Once knowledge is assumed to be just another one of the perks of power, then the basis to trust others to take decisions for us becomes eroded. Asserting the facts and asserting your privilege grow increasingly difficult to distinguish.</p> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of moral superiority. These days the rich find it quite hard to get away with the presumption that their wealth is proof of their virtue. When they seek protection from the system, it is pretty clear what they are up to: they are looking after their interests. But when the educated look out for themselves they can dress it up as something ostensibly better than that: expertise.</p> <p>To those on the receiving end, that stinks. It stinks of hypocrisy, and it also stinks of self-interest. The fact that the educated are not always the beneficiaries of the social attitudes that they hold \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s supporters, like Bernie Sanders\u2019s, would rightly insist that many of the positions they adopt are designed for the benefit the socially excluded \u2013 does not help. It just makes them sound even more self-righteous.</p> <p>In the run-up to the EU referendum Jeremy Cliffe of the Economist \u2013 the house journal of the educated expert \u2013 suggested that although Brexit might win this time, it was possible the UK would vote to rejoin the EU in a second referendum 20 years from now, by which point current levels of university education would have spread to later age groups. Twenty years is a very long time in politics. Before then, the gap between the educated and the less educated has the potential to widen, as each side digs in. The viciousness of public debate, as bad as it is now, could still get worse. Because two-party politics does not map on to this division, mainstream politicians will have to find creative ways to try to harness it. These carry the risks of making it worse.</p> <p>The EU referendum was seen by educated optimists \u2013 including some of the people around David Cameron \u2013 as just another way for democracy to let off steam: a means of giving vent to anger without letting it run out of control. That is what the optimists have been saying about Trump too.

Both are practical requirements of the process; neither tells us anything about the outcome. The prime minister lit them up as beacons, rallying the troops for a liberation crusade.</p> <p>All that May has to offer is symbols, but symbols are a more powerful currency with true believers than is ever understood by agnostics. Likewise, the prime minister\u2019s repeated assertion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/01/no-10-brexit-means-brexit-tory-peer-lady-wheatcroft-lords-delay\">\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d</a> has attracted more ridicule than it deserves. (May has now added a second line to the mantra: \u201cIt means we are going to leave the European Union.\u201d) To the cynical ear this is vacuity dressed in tautology. But that objection presumes that slogans are meant to transmit information. Often their function is performative \u2013 a signal of belonging to the tribe. There is a liturgical quality to May\u2019s Brexit creed. You can imagine it as a call-and-response prayer, with the congregation supplying the new follow-up verse.</p> <p>It is the quasi-religious mood in Birmingham that makes Cameron\u2019s reign feel so remote. For years, the balance of Tory grassroots opinion was hostile to the power they called Europe. The demand for rupture was voiced by a small minority, but more would have joined in had they believed it was possible and available. Now they are told it is both, by a leader who \u2013 crucially \u2013 has far better credentials as an orthodox Tory than her predecessor. May, the provincial vicar\u2019s daughter, has done her time tramping the streets, stuffing envelopes, working the local Conservative association circuit. Her conversion is not mistrusted as some tactical ruse but celebrated as the completion of a journey on behalf of the whole party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/theresa-may-tory-conservative-party-direction\">Theresa May: a Tory saviour who offers no sense of hope | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is nothing less than a reformation in the Church of Conservatism, with the authority of Brussels cast as a modern-day Rome. Cameron tried to manage the old schism but the suspicion lingered that his loyalties were divided; that he read from a vernacular Tory bible at home and then jumped on the Eurostar to kiss the papal commission\u2019s ring. Now Theresa May stands before her party like Elizabeth I: a true, Protestant queen, their own Gloriana.</p> <p>By temperament, the new prime minister is not a fanatic, and the obligation to staff a government with recruits from across the Tory spectrum precludes a purge of heretics. Like Elizabeth, May comes to power with no desire to make \u201cwindows into men\u2019s souls\u201d. If ministers want to practise a bit of Europhilia at home, that is their business, but they should not go confessing it in public.</p> <p>It is striking how quickly this new regime has taken hold. Even quite ardent Tory pro-Europeans are suppressing private fears of an imminent economic blunder for the sake of party loyalty and ambition. Only a handful of backbenchers publicly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/hard-brexit-eu-trade-deal\">sound the alarm</a> about Downing Street\u2019s apparent willingness to abandon membership of the European single market. They are dismissed by colleagues \u2013 including former remainers \u2013 as rogue elements weirdly bent on career suicide.</p> <p>Misgivings about May\u2019s European position are transmitted mostly in code. Some moderates look to the Treasury for hope, seeing in Philip Hammond\u2019s warnings about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-pledges-economic-pragmatism-during-brexit-process\">Brexit-related \u201cturbulence\u201d</a> a discreet genuflexion to the old religion. Downing Street, meanwhile, eyes George Osborne warily as a dangerous grey cardinal, banished from court but maintaining his old network of allies and spies.</p> <p>Then there are the Brexit ultras to May\u2019s right, the caucus of hardliners who keep pulling their party towards the most austere professions of anti-Europeanism. They play the role of what the historian J E Neale dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan_choir\">the puritan choir</a>\u201d in Elizabeth\u2019s parliament, urging an extirpation of every last residue of papish corruption from the body politic.</p> <p>Finally there are the self-styled buccaneers of the free-trade seas.

That leaves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/globalisation-poverty-corruption-free-trade-liam-fox\">Liam Fox</a> to play Sir Francis Drake, looking for domestic glory in global circumnavigation but seen from abroad as a pirate.</p> <p>This is all myth and fantasy, of course. But parties have always been sustained by internal mythologies, and the task of exiting the EU is so complicated and fraught with danger that fantasy becomes a necessary comfort. As one former minister says of the puritan choristers: \u201cThey have spent their lives working towards this dream. Of course they don\u2019t want to accept that it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Tory pro-Europeans are in the impossible position of using rational argument against faith. If they counsel compromise on migration or the single market, they are accused of talking Britain down or trying to refight the referendum. They have few reinforcements across the political water.

Scotland has its own distinct politics, and in Nicola Sturgeon its own remainian queen with her own independence agenda.</p> <p>The Tories do not speak for all of England, but in the absence of credible opposition they feel as if they do, and will act accordingly. To those millions who did not vote to leave the EU, the message is clear: you are free to pray for whatever you like. Your antique rites will be tolerated.

That feedback was provided and considered.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the 30 November meeting was about the Guidance Note, not about the Legal Services Directions.</p> <p>Just over a week later Brandis appeared on the <a href=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/transcripts/Pages/2016/ThirdQuarter/24-July-2016-Interview-with-Fran-Kelly-Insiders.aspx\">ABC\u2019s Insiders where he claimed</a> the changes were to \u201cregularise\u201d arrangements so that all government agencies and departments were aware of the powers of the solicitor general under the Law Officers Act. </p> <p>Again he claimed that this was discussed with the solicitor general at the 30 November meeting. For Brandis to paint this as regularising \u201cthe practice across government to ensure it was in conformity with section 12(b) of the <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/loa1964127/s12.html\">Law Officers Act</a> is also misleading. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/16/george-brandis-has-a-history-of-meddling-with-independent-agencies-hes-at-it-again\">George Brandis has a history of meddling with independent agencies.

  "<p>Donald Trump was put on trial in his absence during the vice-presidential debate as his running mate Mike Pence was accused of trying to defend the indefensible.<br></p> <p>But Democrat Tim Kaine, embracing his role as Hillary Clinton\u2019s attack dog, interrupted so aggressively that many analysts felt he lost the debate on style to the calm, composed and measured Republican Indiana governor.<br></p> <p>In a focus group conducted by strategist Frank Luntz for CBS News in the swing state of Ohio, 22 people said that Pence won and only four said Virginia senator Kaine prevailed. When Luntz ran a similar group during last week\u2019s presidential debate, Clinton beat Trump 16-6.<br></p> <p>Pence gave a polished performance that could have given some hope to Republicans, and much wishful thinking about a non-Trump top of the ticket, but he was repeatedly forced on to the back foot by a brutal catalogue of the nominee\u2019s words and deeds.<br></p> <p>\u201cSix times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can\u2019t imagine how you can defend your running mate\u2019s position on one issue after the next,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cIn all six cases, he\u2019s refused to defend his running mate. And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.\u201d<br></p> <p>Pence remained steady under fire during the only vice-presidential debate of the campaign but when Kaine brought up Trump\u2019s campaign launch claim that the Mexican government is deliberately sending rapists into the United States, he awkwardly replied: \u201cYou whipped out that Mexican thing again.\u201d Kaine demanded: \u201cCan you defend it?\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-debate-tim-kaine-mike-pence-trump\">Pence could have stumbled in the debate \u2013 if only Kaine let him talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kaine attacked the Trump record on issues ranging from tax, nuclear weapons and Senator John McCain\u2019s war service to his description of women as \u201cslobs\u201d and \u201cpigs\u201d, his suggestion that women who have abortions should be punished and his questioning of Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace.</p> <p>Referring to Trump\u2019s past praise for dictators, Kaine said: \u201cHe\u2019s got a personal Mount Rushmore: Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein.\u201d</p> <p>Mostly Pence flatly denied that Trump had made controversial statements and, instead of defending the candidate, resorted to the strategy of gaslighting, by repeatedly challenging known facts to manipulate the truth. </p> <p>He claimed Trump\u2019s past remarks were \u201csmall potatoes\u201d compared with Clinton\u2019s infamous comment when she described half of Trump supporters as \u201ca basket full of deplorables\u201d.</p> <p>Pence ducked, dodged or denied statements that Trump has put on the record. The Clinton campaign accused of him telling downright lies in some instances. David Gergen, a former presidential adviser, said on CNN: \u201cPence will not fare well with fact checkers, but his poise and polish played well with voters. For better or worse, style counts a lot in these debates.\u201d</p> <p>The debate in Farmville, Virginia, with the candidates sitting at a table rather than standing at lecterns, was not expected to have a major impact on the presidential race, though Trump himself could not resist providing a live commentary via Twitter. He claimed: \u201cMike Pence won big. We should all be proud of Mike!\u201d</p> <p>Pence started strongly and looked directly into the camera in a way that Kaine did not. After a bewildering political year that has shaken the Republican party, Pence, a 12-year congressman and Indiana governor came over as a somewhat authentic voice of conservatism who may be consoling and energizing for party members who find Trump distasteful. </p> <p>He attacked Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state, arguing: \u201cWe see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.\u201d He cited the crisis in Syria and a newly emboldened Russia following a failed Clinton \u201creset\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vice-president-debate-fact-check-mike-pence-tim-kaine\">VP debate fact-check: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine's claims reviewed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Referring to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server at her home, Pence, referencing the fact that he and Kaine both have sons who are US marines, remarked: \u201cIf your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did, they\u2019d be court martialed.\u201d</p> <p>Seeking to play the role of Clinton attack dog, Kaine interrupted several times, perhaps a little too zealously. He delivered some evidently rehearsed lines, telling Pence: \u201cYou are Donald Trump\u2019s apprentice,\u201d and asking: \u201cDo you want a \u2018you\u2019re hired\u2019 president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \u2018you\u2019re fired\u2019 president in Donald Trump?\u201d</p> <p>Pence, who remained composed in manner and voice, a contrast to the thin-skinned Trump, responded: \u201cYou use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.\u201d</p> <p>Debating the economy, the Republican said with assurance: \u201cSenator, you can roll out numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different; people in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling.\u201d</p> <p>Kaine, however, gradually found his footing and scored points when he attacked Trump. He had plenty of material to work with. He seized the opportunity to rebroadcast, before an audience of millions, many of Trump\u2019s most offensive and infamous remarks about Mexicans, Muslims and women.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a fundamental respect issue here,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cAnd I just want to talk about the tone set from the top. Donald Trump during this campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals, he\u2019s called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don\u2019t like saying that in front of my wife and mother.</p> <p>\u201cHe attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn\u2019t a hero because he\u2019d been captured. He said African Americans are living in hell.

I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\"> early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts, </a>until finally promising<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\"> \u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></p> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>. The terms of the deal extend that \u201cbreakout\u201d ability to a year, and have restrictions extending over 10, 15 and 25 years.</p> <p><strong>Pence: the US doesn\u2019t know who Syrian refugees are and should block them</strong></p> <p>The government has a fairly clear idea about how many people are in the US without legal authorization. Using data from the Census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number, and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most \u2013 not 20 million as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the last 20 years.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></p> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here.

While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn\u2019t hold up either of them as role models for my kids,\u201d she said.<br><br>At the weekend Ayotte had struck a more moderate tone, giving away free condoms on the campaign trail to push her plan on birth control. The poster at the event claimed to \u201cUse Condom Sense!\u201d </p> <p>Ayotte is in a close race with Democratic governor Maggie Hassan, who was endorsed by Planned Parenthood, Emily\u2019s List and NARAL.

  "<h2><strong>Mike Pence: \u2018Norwood University\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In his opening statement, Pence misstated the name of the university hosting the debate. It is Longwood University, not Norwood.</p> <h2><strong>He also said that Barack Obama has raised more taxes to extraordinary levels</strong></h2> <p>This isn\u2019t quite right. There were two major changes to the tax code in Obama\u2019s two terms: the 2012 expiration of tax cuts created by George W Bush (with extensions for people making less than $400,000 a year), and levies to fund the Affordable Care Act (including a penalty for not having health insurance, a 10% tax on tanning services and a 3.8% tax on investment income for top earners).</p> <p>Obama also enacted temporary cuts meant to spur investment and help Americans in the depths of the financial crisis, but all in all tax rates for most Americans have not changed much since Bush\u2019s presidency, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361\">report</a> by the nonpartisan congressional budget office. Under Bush, the top tax rate was 35%; under Obama, the wealthiest Americans pay 39.5%.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: the Obama administration has \u2018stifled the economy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Obama took office in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, and the economy has crawled back into recovery over his two terms, with employment nearly down to pre-crisis levels. It\u2019s arguable that his policies have restricted some growth, but the economy has held to a steadily upward track.</p> <p>This summer the OECD gave its <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/United-States-2016-overview.pdf\">stamp</a> of approval to the US economy, saying in a report: \u201cthe US economy has rebounded: output has surpassed its pre-crisis peak by 10%, robust private-sector employment gains have sharply reduced unemployment, fiscal sustainability has been largely restored and corporate profits are high.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate-elections-live\">Vice-presidential debate live: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine face off</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign donations while she was secretary of state \u2026 She kept that pay-to-play process in\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Pence is correct that the foundation took donations from foreign governments, and that the charity did not disclose every contribution \u2013 in violation of an agreement to identify donors that it made with the Obama administration. But no one has yet produced evidence of a quid pro quo exchange between the Clinton Foundation and its donors.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018It was a failure of the secretary of state\u2019 to acquire a status of forces agreement with Iraq</strong></h2> <p>The argument that Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to secure an agreement with Baghdad over keeping American troops in Iraq ignores several key facts, including that the Bush administration similarly failed. It also ignores that Isis\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/world/middleeast/in-rise-of-isis-no-single-missed-key-but-many-strands-of-blame.html\">segments</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/middleeast/us-actions-in-iraq-fueled-rise-of-a-rebel.html\">formed</a> out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">post-invasion civil war</a> in Iraq, while Bush was president; that the group took root in Syria\u2019s civil war, where the US did not intervene until 2014; that Obama withdrew American forces in 2011 under the <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html\">timeline</a> agreed on by Bush and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\">Baghdad</a>.

Since Obama took office in January 2009 the US has created <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001\">10.8m private-sector jobs</a>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Kaine is counting back from the depths of the economic recession, in early 2010, which would erase a full year off of Obama\u2019s presidency.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: \u2018The debt explosion on the Trump side is much much bigger than anything on the Clinton side\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct, according to conservative and nonpartisan thinktanks alike. Clinton\u2019s proposed tax plan would add $191bn to the debt over the long term, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/sites/default/files/docs/TaxFoundation-FF496.pdf\">according to the </a><a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">Committee for a Responsible Budget</a>, a conservative thinktank. The Tax Policy Center, however, estimates that she would <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\">add $1.1tn in revenue</a> in a decade, though much of that would be offset by increased spending. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump\u2019s plan would add <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/09/26/donald-trump-would-boost-debt-more-than-hillary-clinton-report-says/\">$5.3tn to the debt</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: even Richard Nixon released his taxes</strong></h2> <p>Richard Nixon did not release his tax returns while running for president in 1960 or in 1968 \u2013 he released them in 1973, after his second term began. In 1968 Nixon only gave a limited glimpse of his to a magazine writer and only released the returns under pressure from the Watergate inquiry. He released the returns despite an audit by the IRS, which Trump has repeatedly claimed is his reason for not releasing returns.</p> <p>You can look at Nixon\u2019s returns at the <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/web/presidentialtaxreturns\">Presidential Tax History Project</a>.

Pence, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/capital-living/meet-the-lawmaker/20999-house-conservatives-oppose-add-ons\">supported</a> a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/15/news/economy/trump-pence-social-security/\">2005 plan</a> that would have modified the program into a private system.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018He\u2019s created a business that\u2019s worth billions of dollars\u2019</strong></h2> <p>There is no direct evidence that Trump\u2019s business is worth billions of dollars \u2013 the only tax return publicly available, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">published by the New York Times</a> last weekend, shows that he reported a $916m loss in 1995. Trump could prove the worth of his business by publishing his returns. Forbes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/donald-trump-net-worth-forbes-400\">estimates Trump is worth $3.7bn</a>, far lower than his claimed $10bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf7b56f52cd95fbe3764bedcbb05801dcc9f7c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf7b56f52cd95fbe3764bedcbb05801dcc9f7c0/0_95_4722_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Pence responds to Tim Kaine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Pence responds to Tim Kaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump would let states decide whether to be rid of the minimum wage</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct insofar as Trump has a position on minimum wages, if he\u2019s talking about the federal minimum wage, specifically.</p> <p>Trump has changed his position on the minimum wage at least three times, including within the span of a single interview. On 26 July, when Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMK8Iv7tiE\">asked him</a> where he would set a federal minimum wage, he repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump\">a stance from May</a> that the US does not need one: \u201cThere doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p> <p>He then immediately changed his position: \u201cWell, I would leave it, and raise it somewhat.\u201d A day later in Florida he said he wanted a $10 an hour minimum wage, up from the current level of $7.25, and confirmed to a reporter: \u201cfederal\u201d. He has most consistently said that states should decide a minimum wage.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine notes, correctly, that black people are more likely than white people to be arrested and given long sentences.</strong> </h2> <p>They are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">more likely to be shot by police</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: Clinton and Kaine support \u2018open borders\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Neither ticket supports \u201copen borders\u201d, which the US does not have. Pence appears to be using the word to denigrate Barack Obama\u2019s support for immigration reform and protection for some undocumented people from deportation. But Obama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/latino-immigrants-us-war-on-terror-study\">deported a record more than 2.5 million people since he took office</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/02/u-s-deportations-of-immigrants-reach-record-high-in-2013/\">a record 438,421 people in 2013</a>, and increased border patrol staff to <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/performance-accountability-financial\">a record 21,444 agents in 2011</a>; his policy could not reasonably be described as \u201camnesty\u201d or \u201copen borders\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay backtaxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports the deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump has \u2018called Mexicans rapists and criminals \u2026 He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified \u2026 He said African Americans are living in hell\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is right that Trump has broadly characterized immigrants in derogatory terms, but Trump also almost always gives himself a way out. On 16 June 2015, when he announced his candidacy, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim is patently false, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/donald-trump-fact-check-immigration-inner-cities\">we</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/492096565/fact-check-donald-trumps-speech-on-immigration\">fellow</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/01/fact-checking-donald-trumps-immigration-speech/\">fact-checkers</a> have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexican-government-forces-many-b/\">repeatedly</a> shown, since most migrants leave their homes for work or family and the Mexican government has nothing to do with their emigration. Statistics on crime by non-citizens mostly suggest that Mexican migrants \u2013 more of whom are leaving the US than entering \u2013 don\u2019t affect overall crime rates.</p> <p>Trump has i<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-muslim-judges-face-the-nation\">ndeed called judge Gonzalo Curiel unqualified</a> because the American judge is \u201cMexican\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/living-in-hell-milwaukee-segregation-donald-trump\">said that African Americans are \u201cliving in hell\u201d.</a></p> <h2><strong>Pence: Clinton called half of our supporters \u2018deplorable\u2019</strong></h2> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">a fundraiser</a> Clinton said: \u201cTo just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables\u201d. This group, she said, included \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u201d people.

Polls also show lower but significant such sentiment among supporters of Clinton. Her generalization pointed to real racial animus, ignored it among her own supporters and showed how difficult it is to attach a number to racism, even while <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">separate polling</a> shows <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/\">racism</a> is <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">affecting millions</a> in <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/29/roughly-half-of-hispanics-have-experienced-discrimination/\">widespread</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/\">systemic ways</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s complaint contradicts his own past remarks. In 2012, after Mitt Romney was lambasted <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/the-47-percent/\">for dismissing 47% of Americans</a>, Trump agreed, telling <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/video/trump-romney-dont-apologize-47-025517267.html\">Fox News</a>: \u201cYou do have a large percentage of people that feel they\u2019re entitled.\u201d Last year he similarly dismissed half of all Americans, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/18/donald_trump_eventually_50_of_americans_are_not_going_to_be_able_to_carry_the_other_50.html\">telling Fox</a>: \u201cWe have a society that sits back and says, \u2018We don\u2019t have to do anything.\u2019 Eventually the 50% cannot carry, and it\u2019s unfair to them, but cannot carry the other 50%.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump hasn\u2019t apologized to anyone</strong></h2> <p>Trump has expressed regret for having said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">the wrong thing</a>\u201d but not said what that thing was or whom he had caused \u201cpersonal pain\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump supports the mass deportation of 11 million people</strong></h2> <p>During <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDUADNTpAh0\">a 10 November debate</a> Trump expressed support for Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s Operation Wetback, the forcible deportation of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/06/annotated-transcript-the-aug-6-gop-debate/\">hundreds of thousands of migrants</a>, sometimes under inhumane circumstances. He was pressed on this support in an interview with O\u2019Reilly, who himself called the operation \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-immigration-deportation-215783\">really brutal</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ve heard it both ways. I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\">early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts,</a> until finally promising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">\u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></h2> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>.

Using data from the census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 million to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most, not 20 million people as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the past 20 years.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></h2> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by Isis to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.

For instance, on 18 December 2015 he <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/12/18/donald-trump-praises-putin-as-strong-leader/\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt fine about Putin. I think that he\u2019s a strong leader.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cHe\u2019s running his country and at least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Last September, he <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-gives-russias-putin-an-a-in-leadership/\">told Fox News</a>: \u201cIn terms of leadership [Putin\u2019s] getting an A.\u201d In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA2rmuJu9c\">a 10 March debate</a>, Trump tried to hedge on semantics. \u201cStrong doesn\u2019t mean good,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin is a strong leader, absolutely. He is a strong leader. Now I don\u2019t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.\u201d</p> <p>Pence also said, as Kaine points out, that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/08/mike-pence-says-its-inarguable-that-putin-is-a-stronger-leader-than-obama/\">it\u2019s \u201cinarguable\u201d that Putin is a stronger leader than Obama</a>.</p> <p>Kaine also said that Putin \u201chas run his economy into the ground, he persecutes LGBT folks and journalists\u201d.</p> <p>The caliber of Putin\u2019s leadership is debatable in and of itself. Russia\u2019s economy under Putin\u2019s 16 years of leadership has become over reliant on oil and hamstrung by economic sanctions, themselves prompted by Putin\u2019s aggressive military action in Ukraine.

Ukraine is not a member of Nato, the history of Crimea and Russia goes back centuries, and the continued war in eastern Ukraine is being fueled by both the Kremlin and local forces.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: the Associated Press found that more than half of Clinton\u2019s meetings as secretary of state were with donors to the Clinton Foundation</strong></h2> <p>The AP story on Clinton\u2019s meetings <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/09/ap-deletes-clinton-foundation-tweet-227917\">did not include her meetings with people in the US government and from foreign governments</a> \u2013 who were by a huge margin the people she met with while serving as the top diplomat of the United States.</p> <p>The news agency deleted a tweet about the story \u2013 virtually verbatim to what Pence said \u2013 for lack of context, and the Associated Press\u2019s vice-president for standards John Daniszewski wrote <a href=\"https://blog.ap.org/announcements/statement-on-why-ap-deletes-clinton-tweet?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">a blog post about the decision</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018Trump and I would just never support legislation that would punish a woman for making the heartbreaking decision to terminate a pregnancy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct that Trump suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">women should be punished for having abortions</a> \u2013 he then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">recanted the idea</a> at the end of a day of flip-flopping positions.

  "<p>If your only access to Aboriginal communities was through the media, you might believe there is a \u201cdevastating silence\u201d around the staggering rates of family violence in our communities. </p> <p>That\u2019s the position continually put forth by outlets like the Australian, which recycle these tired arguments every couple of months, pretending that each new piece is \u201cshocking\u201d and a brave exercise in speaking out. </p> <p>The latest comes from former ALP president, Warren Mundine, who on Monday laid the blame for this supposed silence at the feet of black Australia. </p> <p>\u201cFrankly, if Indigenous people remain silent we deserve to be tarnished,\u201d he wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/04/northern-territory-to-trial-domestic-violence-court-in-alice-springs\">Northern Territory to trial domestic violence court in Alice Springs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen communities protect abusers they are complicit in abuse. When families hide or turn a blind eye to abuse, they enable abusers to commit crimes. It\u2019s no wonder victims are afraid to speak up.\u201d</p> <p>But if you think Aboriginal women have been silent, it\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t heard us, our voices now hoarse after decades of screaming into the abyss of Australia\u2019s apathy.</p> <p>There are many strong Aboriginal women who not only talk about family violence in our communities regularly, but also work directly in the field. So many, I should add, that I\u2019ll no doubt fail to list them all. These are women like Judy Atkinson, Janet Hammill, Jackie Huggins, Kylie Cripps, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/larissa-behrendt\">Larissa Behrendt</a>, Megan Davis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/louise-taylor\">Louise Taylor</a>. The list goes on and on. I know because I\u2019ve had all of these women on my radio show Let\u2019s Talk on Brisbane Aboriginal radio station 98.9 FM. </p> <p>So it\u2019s always confusing when these strong voices are conveniently left out, as the media construct false narratives around silence in order to ironically, silence others. </p> <p>Throughout the history of \u201cAustralia\u201d, the bodies of Aboriginal women have been continually used for political purposes. Our ancestors were slandered, stripped of agency, and painted in racist caricature, to justify the theft of land and slaughter of tribes.</p> <p>This is a continuation of the colonial project, because it assumes that Aboriginal people, and women in particular, are somehow immune to feeling, that they are so depraved that they put up with, and even cover up, shocking levels of abuse. How much more can you deprive a people of humanity, than claiming they don\u2019t care about the most vulnerable in their communities? </p> <p>But that\u2019s what happens, even though it\u2019s so far from the truth. The piece from <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/indigenous-people-must-find-a-voice-to-condemn-domestic-violence/news-story/1670a3fe4f2651819f4625023b7c480f\">Mundine in Monday\u2019s Australian</a> was even worse, because it claimed that the only media outlet invested in breaking this constructed silence was Sky News, and specifically the journalist Matt Cunningham and commentator Paul Murray, as if we are now supposed to celebrate any journalist who bothers to do their job. </p> <p>Mundine also seems to think that the only Aboriginal women speaking out about these supposed silences are former Northern Territory politician and Warlpiri woman Bess Price, and her daughter Jacinta Price.</p> <p>But the issue here isn\u2019t really about the supposed \u201csilence\u201d in our communities, but about the solutions, and so strong Aboriginal women like Judy Atkinson who work directly with Aboriginal women and children to propose solutions that do not fit with the draconian, paternalistic positions of rightwing commentators, are overshadowed. </p> <p>To simplify a very complicated area, Aboriginal family violence is very different from domestic violence within non-Indigenous communities. It comes from a different place, from a different history, and therefore, will require different solutions. </p> <p>While mainstream commentators and feminists talk about domestic violence in the context of the criminal justice system for their own communities, they don\u2019t understand that for Aboriginal women, the criminal justice system can be just as violent, and these high rates of incarceration actually create and drive new forms of violence. So while the solution seems to be locking up more blackfellas, while it is overwhelmingly focused on \u201cpunishment\u201d, the reality is far more complex.</p> <p>History has shown us that locking up more Aboriginal men has meant higher rates of violence, and also has led to the over-incarceration of Aboriginal women \u2013 who are the fastest growing incarcerated demographic in this country. </p> <p>In 1992, when the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody was handed down, the focus was not on family violence, except for an excerpt in volume five that found the death of Aboriginal women and constant assault of Aboriginal women and children far exceeded, in sheer numbers and the enormity of suffering, the problems that deaths in custody pose for men. </p> <p>In fact, over half of the men who had died in custody were locked up for violent crime \u2013 32% of the men were in crimes for sexual assault. </p> <p>That was back in the late 80s and early 90s. </p> <p>But there was another statistic \u2013 more than 40% of men who had died in custody had been subject to child removal policies. They were the victims of the Stolen Generations, boys who were ripped from their families and institutionalised, educated within a setting of state-sanctioned violence. </p> <p>In an interview last year, Judy Atkinson told me that the men she worked with had \u201cthe highest level of shame of what they had done, but they particularly did not talk about what had been done to them.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, Aboriginal woman Caroline Atkinson (daughter of Judy) published a devastating thesis in which she interviewed 58 Aboriginal men who were incarcerated for violent crimes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/indigenous-australians-know-were-the-oldest-living-culture-its-in-our-dreamtime\">Indigenous Australians know we're the oldest living culture \u2013 it's in our Dreamtime | Larissa Behrendt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She found that the majority of those men had symptoms of PTSD suggesting that the \u201chigh rates of Aboriginal men being incarcerated for crimes of violence could be due to a history of widespread traumatic stressors that are being transmitted across the generations.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m including this information not to excuse these men for their crimes, not to elevate their suffering over that of Aboriginal women \u2013 but to show that simply demonising Aboriginal men in the media, does not help Aboriginal women and children. In fact, it makes it worse. Mundine uses the example of Don Dale to claim that while Australians care about Aboriginal children being tortured behind bars, they are less likely to care about \u2013 or least too scared to talk about \u2013 the abuse of women at the hands of their partners. </p> <p>But he fails to see outside of this silo, he does not explain that these issues are interconnected. He does not even attempt to broach the issue that we are locking up traumatised children, who go on to become traumatised adults and release this trauma through anger perpetrated against the very people they are supposed to honour and protect. He does not connect the violence within our communities to the ongoing, intergenerational trauma, even though it exists and is felt keenly across this country. </p> <p>It is time to stop the blame game, to dismantle these artificial \u201csilences\u201d simply used as political weapons to slander our communities, and start working towards healing our communities and bring back control to a people who have had it ripped away from them.</p>",
  "<p>Anu Singh (Maggie Naouri) sits among a circle of fellow Australian National University law students at a Canberra backyard night-time party, jokily putting down another student.

His agonising death would take a day and a half, after Singh doped him with Rohypnol and plunged fatal doses of heroin into his arm. </p> <p>The question that disturbed not only Garner but also everyone else who has encountered this grim, surreal story: with rumours circulating the couple\u2019s dinner parties about Singh\u2019s deadly intentions, why didn\u2019t anybody go to the police to report her?</p> <p>Singh\u2019s friend Madhavi Rao even helped procure the drugs Singh used on Cinque and witnessed Cinque lying drugged on the floor on the Sunday morning he died, his lips turning blue. Yet Rao would be found not guilty of murder, and acquitted. </p> <p>The only motivation Garner could attribute to Cinque\u2019s killing was that he had recommended Singh consider a drug, ipecac, which models took to keep their weight down. Singh began taking the drug, then blamed Cinque for subsequent physical illness. Singh\u2019s trial heard she had told another man she wanted to procure a gun or heroin, to commit suicide and kill Cinque.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61d64204c7b19789f6915868e7fbfff5483e0cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61d64204c7b19789f6915868e7fbfff5483e0cf0/0_55_1650_990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Joe Cinque's Consolation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The film Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation grapples with the question of how much responsibility Singh and her law school friends should bear for Cinque\u2019s death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Consolation Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly to Garner\u2019s book, this film, directed and cowritten by Sotiris Dounoukos, grapples with the moral, ethical and legal conundrum of what responsibility Singh and her law school friends should bear. </p> <p>Dounoukos was also an ANU law student at the time, and knew both Singh and Cinque. He has spoken to Joe\u2019s still-grieving parents, Nino and Maria, but refuses to say whether he has spoken to Singh for his film, though it seems unlikely. (Garner did not speak to Singh for the book, despite initial attempts to make contact.)</p> <p>\u201cReading the book, even from [Garner\u2019s] removed perspective as a viewer, her portrait of [Singh] was absolutely the person that we knew at law school,\u201d Dounoukos says. </p> <p>Clinical psychologist Dr Kenneth Byrne gave evidence for the defence in Singh\u2019s trial that she had suffered \u201csevere borderline personality disorder\u201d since adolescence. </p> <p>\u201cWhat was driving her, I think, was a great deal of fear,\u201d Dounoukos says, \u201cand then very much the thing that drives people with borderline personality disorders: narcissism. People that are masters at entering and taking advantage of relationships, where there\u2019s the narcissist and the enabler. </p> <p>\u201cJoe\u2019s death sits within an extreme form of the kind of harm that those toxic relationships can lead to. Part of the tragedy is how oblivious he was to what was really happening.\u201d </p> <p>During her time in jail and since being released in 2001, Singh completed a <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/08/1091903447496.html\">masters in criminology</a> at Sydney University with a thesis on the causes of female crime, including abuse, mental illness and drug use. In 2004, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/joe-cinque-is-dead/3426180\">Radio National\u2019s Phillip Adams asked Singh</a> how she came to be the girl who killed Joe Cinque. \u201cI think it started two years prior to the event occurring,\u201d she answered. \u201cI went through a traumatic breakup with a long-term boyfriend and I went into a fairly deep state of depression ...

There\u2019s a way she wants the world to see her and the way she is inside that\u2019s very different.

Sotiris has a very poetic visual style and a very precise screenplay.\u201d </p> <p>But, as Garner noted in her reporting of the trial, Singh\u2019s story constantly hogged centre stage, at the expense of Cinque\u2019s own story.

  "<p>Western Australian police refused to use local Indigenous language interpreters to interview witnesses to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/04/second-indigenous-man-shot-by-australian-police-in-under-a-week\">police shooting of an Indigenous man in Broome</a> despite being told they did not speak English well enough to understand their legal rights, the Aboriginal Legal Service has said.</p> <p>Police shot the 66-year-old man in the stomach on Monday night after the man allegedly threatened a taxi driver and then police officers with a knife.</p> <p>He was flown to Perth for surgery on Tuesday and a spokeswoman from Royal Perth hospital said he was in a critical condition.</p> <p>Police claimed the man, who was from Balgo, a remote Indigenous community 926km from Broome, on the edge of the Tanami desert, had become agitated while sharing a taxi with two women from the same community. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/04/second-indigenous-man-shot-by-australian-police-in-under-a-week\">Second Indigenous man shot by Australian police in less than a week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those women were picked up by police and taken to Broome police station for interview about 10am on Tuesday.</p> <p>Paul Tobin, managing lawyer of the West Kimberley branch of the Aboriginal Legal Service of WA, said he advised the Kimberley district superintendent, Allan Adams, soon after that the women would require an interpreter. </p> <p>Tobin said the women spoke Kukatja, a language not widely spoken outside Balgo, as well as some English and some creole. He said their family had described their English skills as poor and that \u201cthey would not be able to tell any story without the assistance of an interpreter\u201d.</p> <p>Kimberley Interpreting Service, WA\u2019s only Aboriginal language interpreting service, had two registered Kukatja interpreters available in Broome.</p> <p>But Tobin said an officer investigating the shooting, who does not report to Adams, said he would not use anyone from Kimberley Interpreting Service.</p> <p>\u201cHe said, \u2018I won\u2019t deal with them, I won\u2019t deal with Kimberley Interpreting Service\u2019,\u201d Tobin told Guardian Australia. \u201cHe refused to explain. And then I essentially said you should delay speaking with them, and he said, \u2018we just want to have a little chat\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Tobin said the officer told him they had already spoken to one of the women, in a video-recorded interview, but had to cease the interview when she became unwell (for reasons unconnected to the investigation) and had to go to hospital. They then began speaking to the second woman.</p> <p>In a statement to Guardian Australia, WA police denied an interview took place, saying the women \u201cwere spoken to and arrangements made to conduct a formal interview with the aid of an interpreter at a later date\u201d.</p> <p>WA Police were<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/02/wa-police-stood-aside-over-arrest-of-aboriginal-man-charged-with\"> investigated by the Corruption and Crime Commission</a> (CCC) for their failure to use appropriate interpreters when speaking to Indigenous suspects and witnesses in a high-profile case involving a Pintupi-speaking man named Gene Gibson, who was convicted of killing non-Indigenous man Joshua Warneke in Broome in 2010.</p> <p>Gibson was originally charged with murder but the charge was downgraded to manslaughter after the supreme court ruled police interviews were inadmissible because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/02/wa-police-stood-aside-over-arrest-of-aboriginal-man-charged-with\">they violated his right to an interpreter under the Criminal Investigation Act 2006</a>.</p> <p>In June his lawyers <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-20/josh-warneke-killing-appeal-to-be-lodged-today/7525010\">lodged an appeal</a> with the supreme court, saying the manslaughter conviction, on the basis of a guilty plea, had been a miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>Eleven police officers were reprimanded for their role in the investigation and three received a commissioner\u2019s loss of confidence notice, the highest internal reprimand.</p> <p>In January the police commissioner, Karl O\u2019Callaghan, announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/07/wa-police-introduce-precorded-cautions-in-aboriginal-languages\">a suite of reforms</a>, including a pre-recorded Aboriginal language caution, in response to the CCC review.</p> <p>Tobin said he had not seen any improvement since the Gibson case.</p> <p>\u201cThe police have not used the Kimberley Interpreting Service [for any of my clients] in my four years here at the ALS,\u201d he said. \u201cNot once with any witness or any victim.\u201d</p> <p>He said the failure to do so \u201ccan leave gaping holes in versions of events\u201d and \u201cregularly led to injustice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe risk is that someone\u2019s version of events can be completely misinterpreted through two person\u2019s inability to speak the same language,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have people that think they do have experience with people from language groups that aren\u2019t spoken regularly, like Kukatja language, and you have police officers who don\u2019t speak Kukatja but think, \u2018oh, I can speak with Aboriginal people,\u2019 then the risk of misinterpretation is heightened.\u201d</p> <p>Police procedures in WA explicitly recommend the use of the Kimberley Interpreting Service when an Indigenous witness or suspect does not have sufficient English competency to understand their legal rights or provide an accurate statement.</p> <p>The Kimberley Interpreting Service chief executive, Dee Lightfoot, told Guardian Australia that police calls for assistance had increased markedly since the Gibson investigation, going from \u201cone call in 10 years\u201d to about 10 calls in the past two months.</p> <p>Lightfoot said the service contacted police in Broome on Tuesday and offered their services, and was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d witnesses were spoken to without an interpreter present.</p> <p>Police said they had made arrangements to use a Northern Territory service that \u201coffers qualified reliable interpreters who speak all the Western desert languages.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWA Police are aware a number of the Kimberley Interpreting Service staff have links to or live at Balgo and considered there may have been a conflict of interest to use this service,\u201d a police spokesman said.</p> <p>But Lightfoot said there was only one certified interpreter outside of Kimberley Interpreting Service that spoke the WA language, and as of Tuesday evening neither that person nor the NT\u2019s Aboriginal Interpreter Service had been contacted.</p> <p>She also said the language was not widely spoken outside of Balgo\u2019s 460 residents so all speakers had a level of familiarity with the community.</p> <p>She said the service had a good relationship with police and she did not understand why they would object to using local interpreters.</p> <p>The WA chief justice, Wayne Martin, has publicly advocated for the service, saying a failure to provide interpreters was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/aug/04/indigenous-advocate-jail-is-part-of-our-life-and-part-of-being-institutionalised\">an example of systemic discrimination</a> that contributed to WA having the highest Indigenous incarceration rate in the country.</p>"
