  "<p>One of the makeup industry\u2019s largest brands took a big step forward on Tuesday. CoverGirl announced its newest spokesperson is actually a cover boy. </p> <p>The brand announced that James Charles, a 17-year-old makeup artist from New York, is its newest model. The news was fittingly announced via Instagram, where Charles regularly posts his makeup looks and has nearly half a million followers after creating an account last year.</p> <p>Singer Katy Perry, another of the company\u2019s brand ambassadors and current CoverGirl, was the first to break the news. \u201cJust wrapped another great @COVERGIRL shoot.

Male genitalia is out there. It\u2019s dangly. Boys joke and talk about it all the time.</p> <p>But female genitals are still in the closet \u2013 despite some fabulous feminist attempts to get them out of our undies and proudly on display. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/vagina-dispatches\">The Guardian has recently posted a fabulous series on our VGs.</a> Vagina isn\u2019t technically a catch-all term but it\u2019s the best one we have for now, which shows us what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/sep/23/vagina-dispatches-part-one-what-vulvas-look-like\">many of us don\u2019t know about our downstairs bits. </a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/06/more-young-girls-asking-gp-genital-cosmetic-surgery-study-finds\">A disturbing new study</a> by Dr Magdalena Simonis from the University of Melbourne\u2019s department of general practice, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that there has been a threefold increase in women requesting labiaplasty \u2013 cosmetic surgery to their vaginas. </p> <p>She interviewed more than 400 GPs, most of them specialising women\u2019s health. They reported an alarming rise in the number of women requesting advice on labiaplasty.</p> <p>So what are we to make of this? Vaginas come in all sizes, shapes and colours. Like all good things. But do most women, particularly young women, know that?</p> <p>Simonis is concerned that fashion, online pornography and beauty ideals are playing into this new trend. And she\u2019s probably right. The reality is we don\u2019t really know. We need more interdisciplinary research across medical science and the humanities to understand this trend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many young women in my study told me how shamed they felt about their bodies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As someone who has done recent large-scale research into young people and online media, I\u2019m aware that most young people are not watching the Barbie Doll-style porn older generations associate with porn. You know \u2013 the 90s Hollywood porn where women called Bambi, Mandi and Candi pretend to be lesbians with fake breasts and nails? You can take the Fifth Amendment if you want but you do know.</p> <p>That\u2019s not the kind of sexually explicit material that most younger people look at. A lot of it they create themselves. Old people call it \u201csexting\u201d. Young people don\u2019t. They call it sharing images of their bodies, which suggest there are many kinds of vaginas involved.</p> <p>Young women don\u2019t go looking for online porn. On the other hand, they are drowning in a culture where perfecting their bodies is seen as paramount.</p> <p>Many young women in my study told me how shamed they felt about their bodies \u2013 if they flaunted their conventional attractiveness too much they were shamed for that. If they didn\u2019t stack up to male ideals of beauty they were shamed for that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/the_guardians_what_would_a_feminist_do/episode-seventeen\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F288307789&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>And when I asked young women, in an age-appropriate way, about whether they had access to information about how to have sexual pleasure, many of them averted their gaze. The young guys laughed it up when I asked the same question.</p> <p>There\u2019s a core issue here \u2013 we don\u2019t talk about vaginas. We don\u2019t talk about how they can be a source of pleasure for women. We don\u2019t talk about how they are all different. And we don\u2019t tell young women and men that there\u2019s no \u201cnormal\u201d vagina.</p> <p>I understand that young men are increasingly coming under pressure about their bodies and their genitalia too. But a good start in changing the relationship young women have to their bodies \u2013 and young men do too \u2013 might be to start talking more openly about women\u2019s vaginas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/26/female-genital-mutilation-is-alive-in-australia-its-just-called-labiaplasty\">Female genital mutilation is alive in Australia.

Then we could move on to talking about how fabulously multitasking vaginas are \u2013 a bit like breasts. Western society obsessively sexualises breasts and vaginas but ignores the wonderful work they also do in bringing children into this world and feeding them.</p> <p>In the meantime, we should applaud Simonis for her study. We need to know a lot more about young women and why they are so anxious about their bodies.</p> <p>Her research confirms a large study conducted in the UK in 2012, which found there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/30/girls-aged-five-worried-about-body-image?newsfeed=true\">growing trend for women to request cosmetic surgery</a> \u2013 for all areas of the body. Figures have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/03/cosmetic-surgery-operations-top-50000\">continued to increase since then</a> and the vast majority are still women. </p> <p>As a feminist I was hoping things would have changed by now.

  "<p>Gareth Southgate has admitted he inherited \u201ca mess\u201d but insisted England remain on track under his stewardship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovenia-england-world-cup-qualifying-match-report\">after watching his team lean heavily on their goalkeeper</a> to secure a point in Slovenia.</p> <p>Joe Hart, who maintained the recent encouraging form displayed while on loan at Torino, conjured fine saves from Jasmin Kurtic, Roman Bezjak and Josip Ilicic as England preserved their seven-year unbeaten record in qualifying tournaments at the Stozice Stadium. The interim manager put on his captain, Wayne Rooney, for the final 17 minutes in an effort to exert some control and pointed to individual errors as a cause for concern, but attempted to offer some context to his side\u2019s struggles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovenia-england-world-cup-qualifying-match-report\">Joe Hart\u2019s stunning saves earn sloppy England point in Slovenia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank the players and support team enough for the backing I have had,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted six points [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/08/england-malta-world-cup-qualifying-match-report\">from the two qualifiers</a>] but we have taken over a mess and had to steady the ship. We are on track. Qualifiers away from home have always been tense, and were when I was playing too. Very tight. Very few you romped away with. But when you start as [badly as] we did in the second half, that creates anxiety.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very much a work in progress as far as I can see. What was key that, in an incredibly difficult 10 days not only in terms of taking over [from Sam Allardyce] but with the withdrawals with injury, to get four points \u2026 We\u2019d have liked six, to have scored more goals and been more fluent with the ball, for sure, but we sit top of the group. The overall objective is to qualify so, long term, this could be an important point. Would I have been happy with a point if I\u2019d been offered it before the game? No. But it\u2019s ended up as a very important draw in the context of qualifying from the group.\u201d</p> <p>This was the first time England have failed to win a qualifier since September 2013 and a goalless draw with Ukraine ahead of the last World Cup, but the point gained ended up feeling like a minor triumph. \u201cWe owe our goalkeeper for that,\u201d Southgate said of Hart\u2019s fine display. \u201cHe was fantastic. I had a long chat with him in the week and asked him what he looks like when he\u2019s at his best. He started his answer with \u2018calm and composed\u2019. He\u2019s been that in the two matches we\u2019ve had.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/wayne-rooney-gareth-southgate-england-failings\">Not even Wayne Rooney\u2019s arrival can inspire Gareth Southgate\u2019s England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHis decision-making has been excellent, the use of the ball with his feet has been very good, and two or three of his saves were absolutely outstanding tonight. He showed the level he\u2019s capable of. He was top class.\u201d</p> <p>That was summed up by an outstanding double save to tip Kurtic\u2019s second-half header on to the woodwork and then claw the loose ball behind. \u201cIt was my best game for a while,\u201d said Hart, whose six-year spell as No1 at Manchester City was curtailed by Pep Guardiola just ahead of the transfer deadline. \u201cI was asked to do quite a bit, but that was down to a few errors by us. We are a young team and we will get better. It is a difficult result for us but we have to look at the bigger picture of qualification. My body is in pieces. I don\u2019t know what happened for the save but I landed on the frame of the goal. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get up in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>The game ended in acrimonious scenes with players clashing after Gary Cahill\u2019s foul on Ilicic.

The time has come to set out an ambitious plan for the delivery of problem-solving courts, over the course of the current parliament.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sir Oliver Heald QC, the minister at the MoJ responsible for courts, said: \u201cWe will be taking forward problem-solving courts and are exploring opportunities with the judiciary.</p> <p> \u201cThrough this work and by harnessing technology and innovation in our courts, we will ensure vulnerable offenders get the help they need to solve underlying problems and cut reoffending.</p> <p> \u201cThis government is determined to break the cycle of reoffending and spare more people the misery of being a victim of crime.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton used the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on Tuesday, enlisting the help of her husband\u2019s former vice-president Al Gore to urge America\u2019s voters not to risk sending a \u201cclimate change denier\u201d to the White House.</p> <p>In a joint address in Miami, Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global warming is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">hoax initiated by the Chinese</a>.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is real, it\u2019s urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it,\u201d Clinton said, promising investment in clean energy.</p> <p>\u201cWe can transform our economy, we can rally the world to cut carbon pollutions and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect the planet.

Instead, she stuck steadfastly to themes of climate change and her policy proposals to \u201caccelerate the transition\u201d towards clean energy in the US.</p> <p>\u201cI want to see 500 million more solar panels installed in America by the end of my first term,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s generate enough clean energy to power America.\u201d</p> <p>Building more energy-efficient buildings and cutting the country\u2019s reliance on oil by one-third would also bring massive economic benefits, the Democratic candidate said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do all of this and create millions of good paying jobs as we do. The clean energy solutions are being created right here in America. And while we do that, make sure communities are ready for the effects of climate change that are coming right at us,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That comment referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/hurricane-matthew-death-toll-shooting-north-carolina-florida-georgia\">the recent impact of Hurricane Matthew</a> on the Caribbean, where the storm killed hundreds, and in the US, which has seen more than 30 deaths, most of them in North Carolina, which is still suffering from significant flooding.</p> <p>Gore, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/12/climatechange.internationalnews\">who won the 2007 Nobel peace prize</a> for his efforts to tackle manmade climate change, highlighted in his movie An Inconvenient Truth, blamed the severity of recent hurricanes on global warming.</p> <p>\u201cMatthew went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane in just 36 hours, and that\u2019s unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Nowhere are the effects of global warming more evident than Florida, Gore said. </p> <p>Just yesterday there were six more cases of Zika in Miami-Dade County. Changing climate conditions shift the places where these diseases become endemic. Mosquitoes incubate faster and bite more often.</p> <p>\u201cThese and many other consequences are really wake-up calls for us.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton, too, referenced the threat to Florida, a key swing state. \u201cThe impact of climate change goes beyond severe events like hurricanes, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article70145652.html\">it\u2019s a daily reality in Miami</a>.

  "<p>Changes to pensions brought in since 2010 could cost the public purse about \u00a35bn annually by 2034-35 despite providing a small benefit in the medium term, the government\u2019s spending watchdog has found.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) found that changes to the way pensions and savings are taxed have made private pensions less attractive than other forms of savings to many workers \u2013 particularly those on high wages.</p> <p>A paper <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/private-pensions-and-savings-the-long-term-effect-of-recent-policy-measures/\">published by the OBR on Tuesday</a> examined a series of changes to taxation for private pensions and savings, along with freedoms given to workers to access their retirement nest eggs from the age of 55, that were introduced by former chancellor George Osborne.</p> <p>Other changes include lowering the amount workers can put into a pension each year without incurring tax to \u00a340,000, with a \u00a31m lifetime cap. At the same time, the maximum amount that can be put into a tax-free individual savings account (Isa) has been raised significantly to \u00a320,000 a year.</p> <p>The OBR said the government had made several \u201csignificant changes\u201d to the way private pensions and savings were taxed, as well as bringing in a variety of government top-ups on certain savings products. \u201cIt has generally shifted incentives in a way that makes pensions saving less attractive \u2013 particularly for higher earners \u2013 and non-pension savings more attractive, often in ways that can most readily be taken up by the same higher earners,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The OBR found that the \u201csmall net gain\u201d to the public finances from Osborne\u2019s changes over the medium-term becomes a net cost in the long term. The gains from the reforms would peak at \u00a32.3bn in 2018-19 before turning negative from 2021-22, rising in cash terms to hit \u00a35bn by 2034-35.</p> <p>As a share of GDP \u2013 a better way to determine whether that sum is affordable \u2013 the OBR expects the net cost to rise to just over 0.1% of GDP by that time. It warns that the \u201cseemingly small cost would add 3.7% of GDP to public sector net debt\u201d over a 50-year period.</p> <p>However, the report also points out that the relatively slow pace at which the changes would affect the public finances would let future governments tweak policy if necessary.</p> <p>A Treasury spokeswoman said: \u201cThe government wants to ensure people can save in a way that works for them, for both the short and the long term. That\u2019s why we continue to support pension saving and savers through new initiatives such as the personal savings allowance, the lifetime Isa and Help to Save.\u201d</p> <p>The findings were released on the same day that the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) and the Pensions Regulator called for increased powers to prevent companies from dodging their obligations to savers in the light of the BHS scandal.</p> <p>The call came in evidence to a parliamentary inquiry about the oversight of pension schemes, kicked off after BHS collapsed with a near \u00a3600m hole in the funding of its pensions scheme. The plight of the Tata Steel pension, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/fears-british-steel-pension-scheme-folded-pension-protection-fund-tata\">the future of which was thrown into doubt when its Indian owner decided to sell up</a>, and of the Bernard Matthews pension pot, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/bernard-matthews-pension-pot-to-receive-just-1p-in-the-pound\">expected to receive just 1p in the pound under a controversial rescue package for the poultry processor</a>, have also highlighted the limitations of pensions regulation.</p> <p>The PFF, which acts as a lifeboat for failing retirement schemes, said the Pensions Regulator should be given the power to fine employers who seek to dump pension scheme obligations.</p> <p>The regulator itself said it should be given enhanced investigatory powers, under which it could compel parties to give evidence with civil penalties for refusal to divulge information and the ability to \u201cseize and sift\u201d relevant documents.</p> <p>It said companies should be compelled to justify that their actions are in the interests of the pension fund, shifting the burden of proof that behaviour is prudent and appropriate to the companies rather than the watchdog. Such a move would make it easier for the regulator to step in.</p> <p>\u201cIn our view, the subjectivity in legislation, specifically around what \u2018prudence\u2019 or \u2018appropriate\u2019 mean, can be a barrier to the regulator achieving acceptable outcomes from our interventions,\u201d the watchdog wrote in evidence to the work and pensions select committee.</p> <p>It also wants mandatory clearance for certain corporate activities that might weaken the company, such as a sale, dividend payments, change of control, share buy-backs and loans. That idea has already been promoted by Barbara Judge, chair of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-of-directors\">Institute of Directors</a>.</p> <p>At present, companies involved in takeovers are able to approach the Pensions Regulator about their plans on a voluntary basis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/give-pensions-regulator-veto-over-takeovers-says-iod-chair-barbara-judge\">Judge said that in future the regulator should investigate sales of companies with turnovers of at least \u00a3200m </a>and where the pension fund covers more than 2,000 employees.</p> <p>The regulator noted that mandatory clearance should be handled with care: \u201cThis has the potential to be a significant burden on employers and impact on corporate activity. Therefore we believe any such a proposal would require further discussion and engagement with stakeholders and should only be taken forward in a targeted and proportionate way. Clear criteria as to when approval should be sought would be necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Frank Field, chair of the committee, said the latest evidence gave a \u201cuseful steer\u201d on potential reform. He has previously said: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/19/frank-field-condemns-plan-to-dump-bernard-matthews-pension-scheme\">We cannot have firms changing ownership at the price of pensions being dumped</a> with the Pension Protection Fund \u2013 such dumping involves promises being broken, and the cuts in benefit that result.\u201d</p>",

But on Monday, MGM and Burnett said in a joint statement to the Guardian, that they do \u201cnot have the ability nor the right\u201d to release the material, citing \u201cvarious contractual and legal requirements\u201d.</p> <p>MGM and Burnett also refuted allegations that staffers have been threatened with legal action for releasing the outtakes, stating that: \u201cthe recent claims that Mark Burnett has threatened anyone with litigation if they were to leak such material are completely and unequivocally false.\u201d Burnett \u201chas consistently supported Democratic campaigns\u201d, the statement said. In past presidential cycles, he has been a prominent donor to Democratic candidates and the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>But leaking The Apprentice tapes comes for an alleged asking price of $5.1m \u2013 needed to cover the potential penalty fee for breaking Burnett\u2019s non-disclosure agreement.</p> <p>With mounting interest surrounding The Apprentice footage, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-inside-story-of-donald-trumps-comedy-central-roast-is-everything-you-thought-it-would-be_us_57fbed42e4b0e655eab6c191\">the Huffington Post</a> on Tuesday published an in-depth report on how Comedy Central\u2019s 2011 Roast of Donald Trump came together, displaying yet more misogynistic remarks by Trump. </p> <p>Still, The Apprentice leak is sure to be more destructive.</p> <p>Rumors of the footage has spurred <a href=\"https://weareultraviolet.org/pressrel/30000-demand-mgm-nbc-stop-protecting-donald-trump-release-tapes-apprentice/\">UltraViolet Action</a>, a group committed to \u201cexpose and fight sexism\u201d, to post a petition calling on MGM and NBC to release the tapes and \u201cstop protecting Donald Trump\u201d.<br></p> <p>The form was signed by more than 30,000 people in less than four hours after it went live on Monday afternoon. By Tuesday morning, that number rose to 115,000 according to the organization.

He cuts inside and slaps a right footer against the inside of the post. The ball rebounds out and it\u2019s stabbed wide by Bezjak, who couldn\u2019t react quickly enough. Joe Hart winks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"892378f6350cbd503e26e3605f0f34df3a22952b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/892378f6350cbd503e26e3605f0f34df3a22952b/0_0_3887_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slovenia\u2019s Jasmin Kurtic hits the post.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"589\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A let off for England as Slovenia\u2019s Jasmin Kurtic hits the post.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T19:07:28.117Z\">at 8.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd352be4b03b22b4fb25e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T18:54:07.565Z\">7.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>9 min: </strong>The England fans have been heard chanting \u201cJustice for Allardyce\u201d and \u201cSammy, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy Allardyce\u201d.

Do not talk about WAYNE ROONEY until it\u2019s absolutely necessary to talk about WAYNE ROONEY. Let\u2019s talk about crazy clowns instead. Is WAYNE ROONEY a crazy clown? Or how about Brexit. How will Brexit affect WAYNE ROONEY? </p> <p>Not easy, is it? Because while it would be lovely not to talk about WAYNE ROONEY, it really is very difficult not to talk about WAYNE ROONEY, England\u2019s dethroned skipper. He\u2019s on the bench tonight, see. WAYNE ROONEY has been dropped by England for a competitive fixture for the first time since 1873 and it\u2019s No More Mr Nice Gareth who\u2019s done the benching, the caretaker manager doing what the last bloke in charge was too scared to do (whatever happened to the last bloke in charge, by the way, anyone heard from him lately?) and defying all the cliched predictions that he\u2019d be too sensitive to make the tough calls.<br></p> <p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t that much of a tough call Gareth Southgate had to make. In fact, he probably made up his mind that Wazziesta isn\u2019t the top midfielder he and his dwindling bunch of sycophants think he is when he gave the ball away twice in the first three minutes during Saturday\u2019s win over Malta. From a celebrity point of view, saying WAYNE ROONEY isn\u2019t quite what he was is tantamount to suggesting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFrpKJ-zZd0\">Beyonce should take dance tips from Mark Corrigan</a>. From a footballing point of view, it is confirmation that Southgate didn\u2019t sniff glue before England kicked off against Malta. </p> <p>England are moving on, the DeWaynification process has begun, and now they\u2019ve got to win a game of football in Ljubljana. So far they\u2019ve failed to inspire in Group F - imagine that! - and Slovenia, who surprised Slovakia on the weekend, should provide them with a tougher test than Slovakia and Malta managed. All that said, WAYNE ROONEY is on the bench. He\u2019s going to score the winner, isn\u2019t he. Then we\u2019ll talk about him a bit more. A lot more. We\u2019ll have a conversation about WAYNE ROONEY.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.45pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T19:03:15.794Z\">at 8.03pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

As with much else, Cookson was left to deal with the consequences. It is rapidly becoming apparent that any honeymoon is long since over. Where we may have expected leadership and transparency after the questions raised by the recent Fancy Bears hack, there has been only silence and more questions.</p> <p>For almost three weeks Cookson felt unable to respond to the furious debate that was raging about the ethics of TUE applications and the extent to which certain teams and riders may have pushed the limits of the existing rules.</p> <p>In Doha, Cycling News caught up with him. \u201cIt\u2019s clear, as far as I can see, that no rules have been broken here. If the rules have been followed and applied, that\u2019s the end of the matter, in effect,\u201d Cookson said, before adding that perhaps there could be a longer\u2011term debate over the rules but only if the World Anti-Doping Agency agreed.</p> <p>It was too little, too late. Cookson, a softly spoken Lancastrian who insists he is mending cycling\u2019s broken culture by consensus rather than conflict, was not so reticent when he was asked about the issue in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cI think we should take note of what is being told us by CIRC [the Cycling Independent Reform Commission]in respect of cortisone and potentially other medical and quasi-medical abuses,\u201d he told CyclingTips then. \u201cAgain, this ties up with our ethical processes and so on.\u201d</p> <p>He went on: \u201cI am anxious to look at the TUE regulations, for instance. TUEs are allowed under the Wada Code, as you know. If we have a set of particular circumstances that are facilitating the use of substances which are in the rules but perhaps ethically challenging, then I think we ought to try to exceed the Wada Code if we can.\u201d</p> <p>When asked in 2016 whether the TUE system should be looked at again, the UCI could only respond: \u201cThe management of therapeutic use exemptions in cycling is robust and fully safeguarded.\u201d It also indicated it would not be looking into past cases.</p> <p>Go back a little further to the interviews he gave before winning the top job in a closely fought and brutal contest and Cookson boasts of being instrumental in the setting up of Team&#xa0;Sky. \u201cWe had a very strong anti-doping ethos and a no-needles policy at British Cycling for 25 years. One of the things I wrote into Dave Brailsford\u2019s contract was that we should seek to develop our own professional team. OK, there have been some mistakes made with recruitment but, by and large, people have confidence in Team Sky,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/17/head-british-cycling-brian-cookson\" title=\"\">he told the Guardian then</a>.</p> <p>Until 2013 Cookson was not only president of British Cycling but also on the supervisory board that oversaw the new professional team, along with the current British Cycling chief executive, Ian Drake. None of this is to imply that he has dealt with the issue anything other than properly.</p> <p>But in not coming out strongly and considering whether that there has been a longstanding problem with the TUE system and other related issues around the use of substances that are not on the banned list but do confer an advantage \u2013 as many in the sport believe \u2013 he has allowed suspicion and cynicism to&#xa0;fester.</p> <p>On taking office, one of the first things that Cookson did was establish the Cycling Independent Reform Commission process. Raised from the ashes of the shambolic attempts at \u201ctruth and reconciliation\u201d that had gone before under McQuaid, the CIRC report was a serious attempt to come to terms with what had gone before.</p> <p>That CIRC report was at the time hailed as a brave new dawn for the sport when it was published in March 2015. A chance to face its troubled past in the face and confront its demons. It had some interesting things to say about the TUE system.</p> <p>\u201cOne team doctor stated that he believed the TUE system had been regularly abused, particularly as previously mentioned, in the area of corticoids. Today there appears to be concern among riders about the way in which TUEs are used for corticoids and insulin in particular, and the extent to which they are being abused,\u201d it said. One rider put the number of applications seeking to gain an advantage at an extraordinary 90%.</p> <p>In that Guardian interview before he became UCI president for a four year term that he will look to renew in 2017, Cookson also said: \u201cIf I look back at all of the history every time there has been an opportunity for something positive to have been done about doping in cycling it\u2019s been fudged. On every occasion when there\u2019s been an opportunity to do something about this and a real need to do something about it, the UCI has fudged it and lost the plot.\u201d</p> <p>Three years on, he must prove that he is not going to repeat those mistakes. On Wednesday afternoon, at a ceremony at one of Doha\u2019s many high-end hotels, Cookson is likely to announce the 2019 world road racing championships will come to Yorkshire, unlocking \u00a315m worth of facilities investment. It should be a another moment of triumph for British Cycling. In the current climate, the champagne may taste a little flat.</p>",
  "<p>The pound endured another day of pressure from investors on Tuesday after continued jitters on the foreign exchange markets pushed it down more than two cents to $1.21. <br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/11/pound-pressure-city-fears-hard-brexit-bank-of-england-business-live?page=with:block-57fcc0aee4b088a03a67d5ea#block-57fcc0aee4b088a03a67d5ea\">Sterling </a>recorded its worst four-day performance since the Brexit vote as a Bank of England official said he expected the pound to fall further in the coming weeks, driven by the referendum result and the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world.</p> <p>The exchange rate with the US dollar stood at $1.30 last week when Theresa May opened the Conservative party conference and appeared to put regaining control of immigration above staying inside the EU\u2019s single market free trade area.

If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well contained, I would expect the MPC to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p>Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the leave campaign, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: \u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook.

But that wasn\u2019t on the cards, and so I had to make a decision.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/10/jeremy-corbyn-labour-rehsuffle-continues-labour-reshuffle-politics-live\">Brexit statement: David Davis rejects calls for MPs to vote on negotiating terms  - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Believing that we should be able to throw out of office the people who make the rules, and knowing from my membership of the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/european-scrutiny-committee/\">European scrutiny committee</a> in the House of Commons that we couldn\u2019t, I exercised my own vote in favour of leave. I hated the campaign that leave ran. I disliked most of the people who ran it. What they said was divisive, xenophobic and untrue. But I persuaded myself that the sovereignty of the parliament in which I sat was more important than the tactics of a bunch of people I declined to have anything to do with. And then we got the result that we did.</p> <p>What no one who put their cross in the leave box voted for, however, was the form that Brexit should take. It wasn\u2019t on the ballot paper and no one knew, if that were to be the result, how matters would play out.</p> <p>Frankly, I didn\u2019t think leave stood much of a chance. But I also thought that if there were a vote to leave the EU, the outward-looking, internationalist face of modern multicultural Britain would win through: that although we would leave the EU, we would remain in the single market to which the manifesto of every major political party at the last election committed us \u2013 a market on which our prosperity as a nation, and our ability to raise the taxes to pay for public services, is founded.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hard Brexit, with all the damage it will do, has seemingly become the received wisdom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That, of course, was before the lurch to the right made possible by the absence of any centrist opposition to this government.

Principled opposition is coming from only a few, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/10/jeremy-corbyn-labour-rehsuffle-continues-labour-reshuffle-politics-live\">Ed Miliband and Anna Soubry</a>, who are prepared to point out that although the government may have a mandate for Brexit, it has no mandate at all for what it should look like.</p> <p>The campaign to give parliament the right to determine our future relationship with the EU is not about reversing the referendum result. Nor is it about subverting the will of the British people, or having a second bite of the cherry. It\u2019s about the sovereignty that I and others cherish, a sovereignty that resides principally in the House of Commons and in its ability, when given the opportunity, to inform and direct the government of the day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-how-britain-voted-for-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4mjmt\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2573253\"            data-video-name=\"EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Various\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-576cb4f7e4b0f430381097cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/24/160623nightunfolded2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-how-britain-voted-for-brexit-video\">EU referendum: how Britain voted for Brexit \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Not giving parliament the chance, before article 50 is invoked, to say where it thinks these negotiations should end up is, at its core, undemocratic, unconstitutional and likely to exacerbate the divisions in our society to which the referendum gave rise.

Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then.</p> <p>A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>Saunders told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>And that\u2019s all for tonight.

This week we have seen the first evidence from the Prime Minister that Britain is heading for a clean break from the EU \u2013traditionally the least desirable option for the economy \u2013which has been a major factor behind the pound\u2019s slump. </p> <p>As we get closer to Article 50 being invoked, I think we will see the pound continue to fall further. In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU. But once we overcome that, we should begin to see the trend reverse. Until then however, it will likely continue to a bumpy ride for the UK\u2019s currency.\u201d<em> </em></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T17:11:06.988Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd1957e4b05d915e423eed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:56:09.641Z\">5.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound is also suffering a late rout against the euro, as Brexit fears thump sterling again.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s fallen by one euro cent, or around 1%, to \u20ac1.098.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd1923e4b01d9dd2c8ffa1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:54:25.753Z\">5.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Crumbs, make that $1.2153 -- which means the pound has lost two cents against the US dollar today!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd1751e4b01d9dd2c8ff94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:47:08.713Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound is ploughing new lows, and is now down 1.75 cents at $1.2177.</strong></p> <p><strong>That\u2019s a new 31-year low, if you exclude the odd flash-crash last Friday...</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd13d8e4b05d915e423ecc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:32:19.284Z\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sterling is now at an eight-year low against a basket of major currencies.</strong></p> <p>And if it weakens much further, we could hit 40-year lows, according to <strong>Reuters journalist Jamie McGeever.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/785878953294716933\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Back to the 70s.<br>Trade-weighted sterling falls to 73.9 today.

First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21557494\">does not pay its way</a> in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them.</p> <p>That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\">the kindness of strangers</a>\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come.</p> <p>Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad. True, but that is to overestimate the bag of bones that is the British manufacturing sector 30 years after the Thatcher revolution.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/crash-pound-delusion-brexit-britain-flourish\">The crash in the pound punctures the delusion that Brexit Britain will flourish | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:38:44.324Z\">at 5.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd0f1ee4b03b22b4fb2534\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:14:18.870Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back over in Dublin, the Irish government has unveiled a series of measures designed to protect the economy from a Brexit shock. </strong></p> <p>It aims to protect foreign investment, boost tourism and reduce the exposure of farmers in the wake of the collapse of sterling.</p> <ul> <li>Under the \u201cGetting Ireland Brexit Ready\u201d programme, announced by the finance minister, a \u201crainy day fund\u201d will be built up from surplus budgets for use as a contingency for public services in the event of a shock to the economy after Brexit Day, expected in 2019.<br></li> <li>A special \u20ac150m loan fund to help farmers with cash flow and short term borrowings is to be established amid concern many are struggling to cope with the sharp decline in the value of their exports to the UK,<br></li> <li>A special tax relief programme designed to help foreign investors with the smooth movement of staff from the US and elsewhere is to be extended until the end of 2020. <br></li> <li>This programme will allow employers to relocate state from overseas offices with minimal tax complications.</li> <li>A reduced nine per cent VAT rate is to be retained in the tourist sector to assist the competitiveness of the hospitality sector which is heavily dependent on UK tourists. </li> </ul> <p>The government says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe measure acts to secure and embed investment, which can lead to sustainable growth and strengthens Ireland\u2019s innovative capabilities.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>At the same time the government has released a sector by sector analysis of the impact Brexit could have on trade with Britain, the country\u2019s biggest trading partner.</strong> Agri-food and computer services are among the most exposed sectors. </p> <p>The Revenue commissioners have also been asked to scope out how potential customs with the UK and with Northern Ireland would work. </p> <p>Unveiling the package, finance minister Michael Noonan said the Brexit vote posed \u201cimportant challenges for the Irish economy\u201d and it needed to \u201cprotect the progress\u201d made to the economy since the crash of 2010. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd07ace4b03b22b4fb2506\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:53:14.161Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 falls back from record highs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking: Britain\u2019s stock market has failed to hit a new closing high, as the City frets about the costs of a hard Brexit.</strong></p> <p>A late afternoon selloff sent the FTSE 100 down by 0.38%, or 26 points, to 7070 points.

The middle rung of the ladder has been painted a different colour on the side, so that we can see it when we look at the ladder from the side on. What shape does that middle rung trace out as the ladder falls to the floor?\u201d<br></p> <p>Cotton-Barratt\u2019s answer (yes, <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-10-11-why-do-older-siblings-do-better-iq-tests-their-younger-counterparts-oxford-interview\">sample answers are included</a>) mentions Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem, a hypothesis, some equations, a right-angled triangle and sketching on whiteboards, though not necessarily in that order.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a fun question,\u201d says Cotton-Barratt, \u201cbecause the answer is typically the opposite of what they expect because they think about the shape the ladder makes when it falls (which is a series of tangents to a curve centred away from the wall and the floor). A nice extension is what happens when we look at a point 1/3 or 2/3 up the ladder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis question is a great one,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marcus-du-sautoy\">Marcus du Sautoy</a>, Simonyi professor for the public understanding of science and professor of mathematics at Oxford. \u201cYou want to see the mathematical mind at work, taking the question and finding what\u2019s essential about the problem and working it into an equation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine to get stuck,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all get stuck. What we want to see is how you respond to a prompt. We are trying to make it a level playing field whatever their background. We are trying to see the way that they think rather than what they know.\u201d</p> <p>Du Sautoy remembers vividly his own interview for a place to study at Wadham College. \u201cI came from a comprehensive, so it was quite nerve-racking coming up to Oxford. I walked into this grand set of rooms and the tutor asked me, \u2018Can you change my light bulb?\u2019 </p> <p>\u201cAll I could think was, is this the beginning of a mathematical joke? \u2018How many mathematicians does it take to change a light bulb?\u2019 But his light bulb had blown and he wanted me to change it.\u201d Du Sautoy, who got the top mark in the entrance exam that year, was duly given a place.</p> <p>The sample questions \u2013 there are just five of them but they are genuine and have been posed by admissions tutors and answered with varying skill by prospective candidates in previous interview rounds \u2013 have been released just days before the 15 October deadline for applications for next year. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/12/oxford-university-admissions-interview-questions-and-answers-revealed\">similar sample releases</a> in previous years.<br></p> <p>Every year approximately 10,000 applicants will be invited for interview in December; 3,500 of them will be offered places in mid-January, then they just have to get the required A-level grades (usually a combination of As and A*s) to secure their place.</p> <p>Oxford is keen to remove some of the fear of the unknown which surrounds the interview, particularly for pupils from state schools that do not routinely send students to Oxford, where candidates are not as well drilled in Oxbridge interview techniques as their peers in the independent sector. Approximately six out of 10 who took up places this year were educated in the state sector.</p> <p> Samina Khan, director of admissions and outreach at Oxford, said: \u201cInterviews will be an entirely new experience for most students and we know many prospective applicants are already worried about being in an unfamiliar place and being questioned by people they have not met \u2013 so to help students to become familiar with the type of questions they might get asked we release these real examples.\u201d</p> <p>One earlier candidate for St Anne\u2019s was former Conservative minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/edwina-currie\">Edwina Currie </a>who remembers being asked \u201cDo you believe in anything absolute,\u201d when she applied to study chemistry in 1964 (she subsequently switched to PPE). \u201cI answered promptly, \u2018No \u2013 except absolute zero, of course\u2019. \u201d </p> <p>Then \u2013 a slightly less challenging question \u2013 she was asked what she had done during half-term. \u201cThe other applicants had gone skiing, or stayed home swotting. My answer, in a Liverpool accent: \u2018I organised a demo ...\u2019 </p> <p>\u201cLiverpool city council was trying to close our grammar school and its venerable boys\u2019 counterpart (Liverpool Institute) and merge them with Paddington Sec Mod to form a comprehensive.

There were also warnings that the entire post-war architecture of international relations had been placed in jeopardy.</p> <p>Johnson appeared to reject calls for a no-fly zone over areas of Syria, saying: \u201cWe cannot commit to a no-fly zone unless we are prepared to confront and perhaps shoot down planes or helicopters that violate that zone.

  "<p>In Poland mass protests have forced the government to drop plans to tighten its already draconian abortion laws.

Doctors also face harsh penalties if they do not fill in the correct forms before terminating a pregnancy.</p> <p>Back in 1967 our law was changed to allow the legal ending of pregnancies if certain conditions were met. Otherwise the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act remained in place; and so it still is today \u2013 nearly half a century later.</p> <p>Soon, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmagenda/fb161010.htm\">a ten-minute rule bill is to be introduced to the House of Commons</a> proposing that abortion in Britain is decriminalised.

Yet the views of the small but vociferous anti-abortion lobby garner most of the publicity and continue to dominate public argument.

I just came back from a week in Peru, where we have three Waterkeeper organizations fighting dam projects on three of the most important rivers in Latin America. A week before that, I was in the Himalayas and India, where we have seven Waterkeeper organizations protecting the major waterways that supply water to 40% of the planet.</p> <p>The first Waterkeeper organization was founded on the Hudson River in 1966 by a blue collar coalition of commercial and recreational fishermen who mobilized to reclaim the river from its polluters. Many of the people I represent come from families that have been fishing the river continuously since Dutch colonial times. These were people who had little expectation that they\u2019d ever see Yosemite or Yellowstone or the Everglades. They didn\u2019t have the resources to take those kinds of vacations. For them, like for most Americans, the environment was their backyard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies\">The troubling evolution of corporate greenwashing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the things I\u2019ve recognized in my 30 years of doing this work is that wherever you see large scale environmental injury, you\u2019ll also see the subversion of democracy. You\u2019ll see the corruption of public officials, and the capture of the agencies that are supposed to protect Americans from pollution \u2013 they become sock puppets for the industries they\u2019re supposed to regulate.</p> <p>You\u2019ll see the disappearance of transparency in government, the corruption of the press and the diminishment of local control. I\u2019ll give you an example: in the town where I live, Bedford, New York, somebody tried to build a quarry. We passed a zoning law to say, \u201cHey, you can\u2019t do that\u201d because it\u2019s going to diminish everyone else\u2019s property values. So yeah, you\u2019re going to make that one guy rich, but all the rest of us are going to pay for it.</p> <p>That law was upheld by the top appellate court in New York. In Kentucky and West Virginia, where I do a lot of my work, they don\u2019t have those laws. Those laws have been abolished constitutionally so that there is no way for localities to object to mountaintop removal mining, for example. In North Carolina, laws have been abolished that would allow localities to object to factory farms in their backyard. And the agencies in these states are really just mouthpieces for the industries which they\u2019re supposed to regulate.</p> <p>In North Carolina, Rick Dove, a 27-year veteran of the US marine corps [and one of the founding members of the Waterkeeper Alliance], owned a commercial fishing operation on the Neuse River. It was his dream job after he retired from the marines. Two years after he started that business, a billion fish died in the Neuse River with lesions on their bodies, and no one could explain why. Rick traced the pollution to the hog industry, which had happened below anybody\u2019s radar. Why? Because the hog factories were placed in poor communities that had no voice, and no access to public office.</p> <p>A [North Carolina] state senator named Wendell Murphy had looked at what happened to the chicken industry in this country. He\u2019d seen how three men \u2013 Tyson, Pilgrim and Perdue \u2013 had put a million independent chicken farmers out of business and changed the chicken industry from an agricultural one to an industrial one. They would shoehorn up to a million birds into a single facility and keep them in tiny battery cages where they could not turn around, and then dose them with drugs and hormones and manipulate them with light and cause them to literally lay their guts out over a short and miserable life.</p> <p>They made themselves billionaires. And Wendell Murphy said, \u201cI can do that with hogs\u201d. He passed laws that made it almost impossible for anyone to sue anyone who called themselves a hog farmer, even if it had nothing to do with farming. At that time, there were 28,000 independent hog farmers in the state, raising hogs sustainably, providing jobs. He <a href=\"http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/HOG-FARMERS-Ongoing-lawsuit-has-pushed-us-to-bankruptcy-319701941.html\">put every hog farmer in the state out of business</a>, except those who would sign a contract with him. That contract doomed those farmers to involuntary servitude. In 10 years, [the state] went from 28,000 hog farmers to 2,200 factories. And those factories were deliberately put in <a href=\"http://qz.com/433750/the-world-eats-cheap-bacon-at-the-expense-of-north-carolinas-rural-poor/\">areas of the state with minority populations</a> \u2013 blacks, Hispanics \u2013 where people wouldn\u2019t complain.</p> <p>Polluters always choose the soft targets of poverty. Four out of every five toxic waste dumps in this country are in a black neighborhood. The largest toxic waste dump in America is in Emelle, Alabama, where a third of the population is in poverty. The highest concentration of toxic waste dumps in America is on Chicago\u2019s South Side. The most contaminated zipcode in California is East LA.</p> <p>Navajo youths have a thousand times the rate of sexual organ cancer as other Americans because the thousands of tons of uranium tailings that have been dumped on their reservation lands. In North Carolina, we now have an air force that flies over the state every day filming these industries because they can\u2019t be photographed from the road. We are not only bringing the hog industry under control, but also one of the worst toxic polluters in the country: coal ash from utilities. There are now 1,400 uncontrolled coal ash pits leeching poisons into local waterways at every coal-burning power plant in the country. And again, the [plants] are almost always located in impoverished neighborhoods.</p> <p>This is one of the corollaries of the idea that the best measure of how democracy functions is how it distributes goods. Every person in the state of North Carolina should be able to go down to the Neuse River and pull in a fish and bring it home to feed it to their family with the security that they\u2019re not poisoning somebody. We have that right: the constitution guarantees it. But those rights have been stolen from us.</p> <p>You\u2019ll hear this a lot from the big polluters, the Koch brothers, from their indentured servants in Washington DC and their toadies on Fox News: \u201cOh we have to choose between economic prosperity on the one hand and environmental protection on the other.\u201d That is a false choice. In 100% of situations, good environmental policy is identical to good economic policy.</p> <p>We should be measuring our economy on how it produces jobs and how it preserves the value of the assets of our community. If, on the other hand, we want to do what the Koch brothers and the big polluters want us to do, which is to treat our country as if it were a business in liquidation, convert our natural resources to cash as quickly as possible, have a few years of pollution-based prosperity ... then we can generate an instantaneous cash flow and the illusion of a prosperous economy and make a few people billionaires by impoverishing the rest of us.</p> <p>But our children are going to pay for our joy ride. And they\u2019re going to pay for it with poor health and huge cleanup costs that are going to amplify and metastasize over time. Environmental injury is deficit spending. It\u2019s a way of loading the costs of our generation\u2019s prosperity onto the backs of our children. One of the things that I\u2019ve done over the past three decades as an environmental advocate is to constantly go around and confront this argument that an investment in our environment is a diminishment of our nation\u2019s wealth. But it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s an investment in infrastructure. It\u2019s the same as investing in telecommunications or road construction. It\u2019s an investment we have to make if we\u2019re going to ensure the economic vitality of future generations.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been asked the question: What\u2019s the most important environmental law that you\u2019d pass? And I\u2019ve always said the same thing: I\u2019d have true free market capitalism.</p> <p>But now, I\u2019d say something different: I would get rid of Citizens United. Because for capitalism to work, you need democracy to work. And right now we don\u2019t have democracy. We have what I would call a corporate kleptocracy, an oligarchy by the corporations and the wealthy. You can\u2019t have a clean environment when you have that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources\">Can our need for a carbon-free future override our fears of nuclear energy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fishermen on the Hudson had a business plan that worked. It worked for three and a half centuries. They wanted their children to be able to do the same thing. It didn\u2019t stop working because of a failure of their business model. It stopped working due to a failure of capitalism. A failure of democracy. General Electric had better lobbyists in Albany and they were able to persuade the governor to waive the law that made it illegal for GE to dump their PCBs into the Hudson. And GE dumped their PCBs in and all the fisheries were closed, and men and women were put out of work. It wasn\u2019t their fault the fisheries collapsed \u2013 it was GE\u2019s subversion of democracy.</p> <p>As long as we have Citizens United, the polluters are going to be in charge of our country. And that\u2019s going to happen every time we try and do something good for our children, or something sustainable. Our assets are going to be liquidated and turned into profit by the big shots who own our government.</p> <p>So we need to get right of Citizens United or nothing else works. The reason I believe that true free market capitalism is the best thing for the environment is because a rational marketplace promotes efficiency, which means the elimination of waste. And pollution is waste. In true free market capitalism, you can\u2019t make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich and without enriching your community.</p> <p>What polluters do is make themselves rich by making everyone else poor. They raise standards of living for themselves by lowering quality of life for everyone else. And they do that by escaping the discipline of the free market. You show me a polluter, and I will show you a subsidy. I will show you a fat cat using political clout to escape the discipline of the free market and force the public to pay for his production costs. That\u2019s what all pollution is.</p> <p>At Waterkeeper Alliance, we don\u2019t consider ourselves environmentalists anymore. We think of ourselves as free marketeers. We catch the cheaters and polluters and we say to them: \u201cWe\u2019re going to force you to internalize your costs the same way you internalize your profits.\u201d Because as long as somebody is cheating the free market, none of us get the advantages of the efficiency, the prosperity and the democracy of free market capitalism.</p> <p>What we have to understand as Americans is that there\u2019s a huge difference between free market capitalism, which makes a nation more efficient, more prosperous and more democratic, and the kind of corporate crony capitalism which we\u2019ve now embraced in this country. This is as antithetical to prosperity, democracy and efficiency in America as it is in Nigeria.</p> <p><em>This is an edited transcript of a keynote speech given by </em><em>Robert F Kennedy Jr at the SXSW Eco conference on 10 October 2016, in Austin, Texas.</em></p> <p><em>Robert F Kennedy Jr is president of <a href=\"http://waterkeeper.org/\">Waterkeeper Alliance,</a> a global movement for swimmable, drinkable and fishable water. </em><em>He is also a US radio host, environmental activist and attorney specializing in environmental law.</em></p>",
  "<p>The FTSE 100 rose to a new record high on Tuesday, bolstered by a continuing slump in the value of the pound, as concerns mounted about the UK economy after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>But the market could not sustain its initial rise and after touching the new peak of 7,129.83, it fell during the course of the afternoon as Wall Street opened sharply lower.

The blame for the general \u2018risk off\u2019 mood can be attributed partly to Alcoa, whose disappointing figures have put US markets on the defensive, but overall the equity rally is being knocked by a rising US dollar, as traders rush back to the greenback thanks to soaring expectations of a move by the Fed in December.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier the index climbed about 30 points, or 0.4%, to 7,129.83 , beating the previous intraday high of 7,122 in April last year and well above its highest close of 7,103, achieved on the same day. </p> <p>The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.22.

The richly illustrated cookbook is an updated version of a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FYZF42/braipick-20\">book</a> released in 1961 that featured contributions from Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Harper Lee, with an introduction written by Alice B Toklas.</p> <p>For the modern edition, the artist and writer <a href=\"http://natalieevegarrett.com/\">Natalie Eve Garrett </a>sourced stories (and actual recipes) from Marina Abramovi\u0107, James Franco and a set of literary celebrities. Original illustrations by <a href=\"http://www.amyjeanporter.com/\">Amy Jean Porter</a> animate vignettes about heartbreak, political violence and loss, and bring unusual recipes laden with offbeat ingredients (breast milk, a camel, a wooden toboggan) to life.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of fabulism and fairytales and surrealism,\u201d Garrett explains. In selecting contributors, she was drawn to recipes that \u201ccultivate whimsy\u201d, carry specific memories, and suggest \u201cimaginary foods\u201d, as she put it.</p> <p>Abramovi\u0107\u2019s recipes for \u201cessence drink\u201d, \u201cfire food\u201d and \u201cpain\u201d have a surreal, otherworldly charm. Abramovi\u0107 challenges the reader to \u201ckeep a small meteorite stone in your mouth\u201d, \u201cwait until your tongue becomes a flame\u201d, and perhaps most amusingly, \u201cmix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk\u201d. She also instructs the reader to drink the concoction on the night of an earthquake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"41f9c35b2ad3323d5a7f670a2f1a757a622914ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f9c35b2ad3323d5a7f670a2f1a757a622914ce/0_0_1260_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration by Amy Jean Porter for the Artists\u2019 and Writers\u2019 Cookbook.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration by Amy Jean Porter for the Artists\u2019 and Writers\u2019 Cookbook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Jean Porter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obviously, these commands are conceptual, not practical. In a similar vein to Yoko Ono\u2019s book of poems and drawings titled <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grapefruit-Book-Instructions-Drawings-Yoko/dp/0743201108\">Grapefruit</a>, Abramovi\u0107 treats the recipe like a literary form to inject with creative ruminations and existential quandaries. The corresponding illustration refers to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/12/marina-abramovic-ready-to-die-serpentine-gallery-512-hours\">The Artist is Present</a>, a performance Abramovi\u0107 did at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art in 2010 in which she stared at museum visitors who took turns sitting at an empty chair positioned across from her. Porter\u2019s drawing shows two clunky wooden chairs facing each other; in place of people, though, she positions two floating balls of cabbage. Below the illustration, it reads: \u201c13 leaves of uncut green cabbage \u2026 to be consumed on a solar eclipse.\u201d</p> <p>Conceptual or whimsical though its recipes may be, the book is, as Garrett put it to me, \u201canchored in the everyday physicality of cooking and eating\u201d. James Franco\u2019s approach to making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, for instance, is simple and utilitarian. Franco salts this \u201crecipe\u201d with personal information (for instance, in elementary school, Franco ate PB&amp;Js, not Sloppy Joes; he prefers ginger ale to Diet Coke) that feels pertinent to understanding his inner life in some inexplicable way. </p> <p>\u201cA PB&amp;J is the perfect thing to hold while you\u2019re doing other things,\u201d he writes, and Franco is well known for, if nothing else, being a multitasker. Calling a PB&amp;J \u201can artist\u2019s best friend\u201d, he then shares his mother\u2019s philosophy about food: \u201cIt\u2019s about the work, so don\u2019t let your food take time away from your writing or acting or film-making or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>The artist <a href=\"http://www.jessicamstoller.com/\">Jessica Stoller</a>\u2019s recipe for \u201cmale gaze macarons\u201d infuses a simple dessert with a sass-riddled call-back response to street harassment. Pert, appealing, and highly evocative, the treat is supposed to symbolize sexual desire. To make the dessert, Stoller instructs us to combine three egg whites, a quarter cup refined sugar and one cup finely ground almonds with \u201cyour best catcall\u201d and \u201ca pinch of straight porn\u201d. She instructs: \u201cWith rapt eyes, beat in refined sugar and continue mixing aggressively until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks for all to see.\u201d To drive home the point, she gives examples of true-to-life catcalls: \u201cLet me get some of that SUGAR!!

Forced into slavery, and surviving despite horrific conditions, her ancestors \u201cdreamed of shelter [and] food\u201d. She continues: \u201cThey dreamed what they left behind, but they also imagined us, who lay ahead. They envisioned us into existence.

  "<p>Media lawyers have warned that the next national newspaper found guilty of identifying the alleged victim of a sexual assault is likely to face a six-figure penalty, following the latest case, which has resulted in an \u00a380,000 fine for the Telegraph.</p> <p>The Telegraph\u2019s use of a pixelated image of the teenage victim of former England footballer Adam Johnson in March this year came after unlimited fines were introduced to stop newspapers flouting a law that has existed since at least 1976. </p> <p>One senior media lawyer, who declined to be named, described the Telegraph fine as being \u201cthree strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d for newspapers. He echoed others in saying that fines could easily go over six figures if the industry continues to ignore the aim of prosecutors and courts to protect anonymity for victims.</p> <p>In May this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/associated-newspapers\">Associated Newspapers</a>, publisher of the Daily Mail, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/12/daily-mail-publisher-fined-40000-over-pixelated-photograph\">fined \u00a340,000 </a>after pleading guilty to identifying a man who claims to be the victim of a VIP paedophile ring. </p> <p>In March 2015, the Sun used the same pixelated image of Johnson\u2019s 15-year-old victim. Its then editor, David Dinsmore, was ordered to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/07/adam-johnson-former-sun-editor-david-dinsmore-convicted-victim-picture\">pay \u00a32,300 in costs and compensation</a> to the young victim after a court ruled in March this year that he had broken the law. At that point fines were capped at \u00a35,000.</p> <p>Victim support groups are furious at the continued flouting of the law. Their argument that anonymity is more necessary than ever to encourage victims to come forward when so many sexual offences go unreported is gaining traction among prosecutors, as is evinced by the introduction of unlimited fines.</p> <p>Sarah Green, co-director of the End Violence against Women coalition, said: \u201cNewspaper editors know the difference between right and wrong [yet] there is a temptation for some media outlets to put the desire to tell a story above this. </p> <p>\u201cI am really disappointed that people who make these decisions don\u2019t exercise more restraint when covering an issue that causes such distress.\u201d</p> <p>Yvonne Traynor, chief executive of Rape Crisis South London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s vital the media understands and respects the severity of these cases and the damage that can be done to survivors who are already traumatised and have made a brave decision to speak out and give evidence at court. </p> <p>\u201cThe media needs to take a more responsible attitude, and the justice system needs to act quickly and forcefully when the laws protecting a survivor\u2019s anonymity are wilfully flouted by the press.\u201d</p> <p>The repeated use of this particular image of a 15-year-old girl shows how mainly male newspaper editors, faced with making a speedy decisions, are struggling to stay within the law in the era where private images are widespread on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33fde9091dda14e5399dc17d0a1b31b54af11324\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33fde9091dda14e5399dc17d0a1b31b54af11324/0_248_7380_4428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sun editor David Dinsmore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sun editor David Dinsmore argued unsuccessfully that the newspaper had done enough to obscure the girl\u2019s identity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the case against the Sun, the paper\u2019s then editor, David Dinsmore, argued that he and his team thought they had taken enough steps to protect the girl\u2019s anonymity by obscuring her face, changing the colour and length of her hair and altering the background.</p> <p>Yet, as the original picture of the victim had been widely disseminated on social media, it was possible to spot similarities between the original photo and the altered one published by the Sun with a story headlined \u201cSoccer ace and girl he bedded\u201d, with the subheading \u201cJohnson in pose with his 15-year-old fan\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>The detective in charge of the case, DI Aelfwynn Sampson, said: \u201cWhat Dinsmore did in the Sun was legally and morally wrong.\u201d </p> <p>Days before the verdict against Dinsmore, the Telegraph had taken a similar decision to publish the pixelated image of the same victim as part of its coverage of the end of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/02/adam-johnson-not-guilty-one-count-of-sex-with-schoolgirl\">Johnson case, in which the footballer had been found guilty of sexual activity with a child</a>.</p> <p>The Telegraph is understood to have argued in court that it took legal advice and was told to go ahead with publication as the girl\u2019s image was obscured. </p> <p>The paper also argued that as there were only four Telegraph readers in the victim\u2019s postcode, identification must have been minimal. However, the judge in the case threw out this argument, pointing out that the Telegraph has 4.7m average daily browsers and a far greater reach than many of the social media users.</p> <p>The reach and impact of newspapers is still cited by judges as a reason why fines are merited even though, as Judge Riddle acknowledged, \u201cmore distress was caused by social media\u201d. </p> <p>The Telegraph apologised unreservedly to the victim in a statement. \u201cThe picture should not have been published and we have put in place robust procedures to ensure that such an error can never happen again.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Telegraph Media Group, which admitted the charge and was fined \u00a380,000 and ordered to pay the teenager \u00a310,000 in compensation, as well as \u00a31,473 in prosecution costs and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120, declined to describe such procedures.</p> <p></p> <p>End Violence against Women\u2019s Sarah Green believes that the culture in newspapers as well as society needs to change if this behaviour is to stop. \u201cIf there had been a better outcome from the Leveson inquiry [into press standards] and we had a newsroom culture that we wanted, this might have changed. I hope this fine acts as a deterrent.\u201d</p>",

I think whatever you do on a serial basis like that, there\u2019s a standard you don\u2019t want to sink below so you can say, \u201cAt least there\u2019s some technical ability or craft I have and it\u2019ll be at that level.\u201d It may not be a great one, but it\u2019ll be good.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Your stuff doesn\u2019t look like anybody else\u2019s in comics.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s because I was looking at 17th-century draftspeople and not comics. <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pous/hd_pous.htm\">[Nicolas] Poussin</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2015/11/300-etchings-by-rembrandt-now-free-online-thanks-to-the-morgan-library-museum.html\">Rembrandt</a>, and the whole other world of anything but commercial art. I grew up reading comics, but then I discovered a whole other world of picture-making. They didn\u2019t all make comics, but they made heavily narrative pictures. Poussin was a philosopher-painter, he wasn\u2019t just a painter, so there was a big literary angle to these images. So I looked at that. That\u2019s what was always interesting work. </p> <p>You can\u2019t keep recycling what\u2019s happening. The critique was that I didn\u2019t like how most comics were drawn and I had to draw differently than they did. If you don\u2019t have a critique of what you\u2019re doing, you may as well not do it. Just go on and be an apprentice to somebody and do what they do. That\u2019s a pretty deadly direction to go in. Robert Crumb was looking at Albrecht D\u00fcrer, and looking at Dor\u00e9 and these incredible draftsmen of the 19th century. He was looking at early newspaper comics. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c30789cbd99e90ebd82745db262d533165c3a59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c30789cbd99e90ebd82745db262d533165c3a59/0_0_3206_2550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cover to Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures of Urban Decay by Ben Katchor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"795\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover to Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures of Urban Decay, by Ben Katchor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Katchor/Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What did you do when the strip was first starting out?</strong></p> <p>I had a typesetting company with a few friends. We did really low-level graphics downtown, and we did it just so we wouldn\u2019t have to have jobs. We started this company and we had our own weird hours.</p> <p><strong>Who else was in there with you?</strong></p> <p>Two friends of mine. We knew each other from comic fandom. I really saw the inside of small, desperate businesses because our customers were all small, desperate businesspeople. It was kinda fascinating to see that firsthand. I was living in one of these cheap, unoccupied loft buildings. My overhead was very low at that time. As soon as I could make enough money, I stopped doing that and did comics.</p> <p><strong>Who were your clients?</strong></p> <p>Local coffee shops. We did everything like that. These printers came to us with these little stickers that said \u201cgenuine 14-karat gold\u201d, probably to put on fake watches! Mainly for offset printing. This is all pre-digital technology \u2013 photo and typesetting just before digital typography. We did newspapers for small organizations \u2013 [it was also] pre-desktop publishing; people couldn\u2019t typeset their own newspapers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I really saw the inside of small, desperate businesses because our customers were all small, desperate businesspeople.</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Katchor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>So much of your work is about odd businesses. Has development hurt those kinds of businesses?</strong><br></p> <p>I did a strip about it, called the Committee for Architectural Neglect. It\u2019s about a group of people who should be put in control of buildings and not want to develop them and keep them at a certain level of development. Stop restoring them! Stop making them cheap places to live! But that\u2019s as far-fetched as a socialist utopia. I don\u2019t know if there is one that wasn\u2019t built on the ruins of something else. </p> <p>I have nothing against a centralized coffee distribution service in this country. Maybe they\u2019d let the government run it, and let each neighborhood run it the way they\u2019d like to run it. Starbucks, chains like that, it\u2019s just such a loss. It\u2019s such a whaddayoucallit, an absence of imagination, that you just duplicate the thing you\u2019re doing in another place. That\u2019s appalling. If there were state-run coffee bars, at least somebody would say well wait a minute, everything is different. Some neighborhoods would have cafe con leche and some neighborhoods would have Vietnamese drip. They would never just say \u201cit has to be the same\u201d. That would be unthinkable, but that\u2019s what we have. It\u2019s kind of standardized. </p> <p>It\u2019s beyond my understanding why anybody with money who wants to be in the coffee business wouldn\u2019t hire really inventive people. Then nobody would hate them!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76dd8d6f5da9c0db0d8af7ad457f15abce78e9c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76dd8d6f5da9c0db0d8af7ad457f15abce78e9c0/0_0_3361_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some macabre observations on tuxedo rental, from Cheap Novelties\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some macabre observations on tuxedo rental, from Cheap Novelties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Katchor/Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What was it like to be there in the beginning of the \u2018alternative comics\u2019 movement?</strong></p> <p>It seemed like it was career suicide to do comics! You\u2019re not in the world of painting, you\u2019re not in the world of literature, you\u2019re in the world of trashy things. It had such a bad connotation to most Americans. So the thing is, it needed to be critiqued as a form. You can say, \u201cI can talk about <em>this</em> in this form! It doesn\u2019t need to be this high-contrast, commercial art. It can look like an 18th-century wash drawing. It can be anything you like!\u201d It sounds pretty obvious now that you should do that, but no. As comics began to get this kind of notice in the literary world, all these people, painters, would say to me, \u201cI could have done comics too, but at the time it was suicide! I wanted to have a career. I didn\u2019t want to do comics, I wanted to be taken seriously as a painter.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s kind of a purity of mission to it, though, among guys who decided to do it when it was disreputable. Because you weren\u2019t doing it for recognition, you were doing it because it was interesting.</p> <p>I grew up reading comics, and then I went and studied painting and literature, and I knew what painting was about \u2013 you know, this kind of idea of purifying a medium \u2013 and I said, \u201cThis is a dead end,\u201d and I went back to this childhood interest of mine, this thing that predates modernist painting concerns.</p> <p><strong>What do you mean when you say painting is about purifying a medium?</strong></p> <p>Well, modernist concerns were to make paintings that were not about other things, they were just about pure, retinal painting, and it led to minimalism and it led to conceptual art. You know, we\u2019re now in some rethinking of that \u2013 postmodernism. That had a really heavy effect on people who make pictures, that there\u2019s such a thing as media specificity. I think it\u2019s a misreading of an early theorist called [Gotthold] Lessing, who said these things work in different ways: writing works in time and pictures work in space \u2013 don\u2019t confuse them. Don\u2019t try to do in pictures what you should be doing in writing.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",

Kardashian\u2019s bodyguard, Pascal Duvier, was reportedly in a nightclub guarding other members of the family when the heist took place.</p> <p>The theft \u2013 the latest in a string of high-profile breaches \u2013 has triggered a&#xa0;debate inside the booming security industry about the role of the bodyguard in the modern era of social media and random acts of terror. In August, an unnamed member of Saudi royalty <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/saudi-royal-family-member-robbed-of-1million-watch-while-walking-in-paris-a7173746.html\" title=\"\">claimed to have been robbed of belongings worth \u20ac1m on a Paris pavement</a>. Weeks earlier, Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s mother-in-law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/ecclestone-mother-in-law-rescued-after-hapless-kidnappers-made-series-of-errors\" title=\"\">was&#xa0;freed after being kidnapped in S\u00e3o&#xa0;Paulo</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWith the increase in domestic and international terrorism we have seen a big spike in requests for services,\u201d says Shamir Bolivar, a Miami-based bodyguard who has protected Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs and Gwyneth Paltrow as the founder and boss of <a href=\"http://theshadowgroups.com\" title=\"\">The Shadow Group</a>. Bolivar can bench press almost 500lbs (225kg) and can\u2019t help but talk like he is in a film; when I ask if he finds glamour in his work, he says he doesn\u2019t, adding: \u201cGlamour would be when we put a flag over our coffin and in the legacy we leave for our children, knowing that we&#xa0;did a good job.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c1aaea161466de86ce31b8551162aa76359ba3a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1aaea161466de86ce31b8551162aa76359ba3a6/3_3_1482_1853/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pascal Duvier with Kim Kardashian in Paris\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pascal Duvier with Kim Kardashian in Paris shortly before she was robbed in her apartment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Piasecki/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Duvier is \u201cone of the best agents in the game\u201d, Bolivar says. But he and almost a dozen other industry insiders I speak to agree that the game has changed. As threats \u2013 real and perceived \u2013 grow, celebrities haven\u2019t wised up. Moreover, they have taken to broadcasting their assets. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that the paparazzi are on our tail 24/7, but you don\u2019t want to make it so easy by updating your location every five minutes,\u201d Bolivar says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t withdraw $1m from the bank and say, \u2018Hi, I just took this money out and I\u2019ll be staying at the Waldorf Astoria should anyone want to come and find me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Phones have been ringing for days as top-tier celebrities begin investing in the kind of beefed-up security that has traditionally been the preserve of drug lords and oil executives visiting conflict zones. \u201cI\u2019m just about to have a meeting with a high-profile female client to discuss her security after Paris,\u201d says Shawn Engbrecht, a US Army special operations agent who founded <a href=\"http://www.cassglobalsecurity.com\" title=\"\">CASS Global Security</a> in 1998. \u201cA lot of these people are so adored they thought things wouldn\u2019t happen to them.\u201d</p> <p>When Engbrecht travels with a prominent client to, say, Paris, he takes no chances. He sends an advance team to hook up with local agents. They sweep the hotel, prepare routes and install their own cameras and motion sensors, wired to an operations room in a neighbouring suite. At least four bodyguards are deployed, including one or two off-duty Paris police officers with arresting power. The principal, as clients are known, carries a panic button at all times and is never allowed to be more than eight seconds from rescue. \u201cWhen you want to rob someone of $10m in jewellery and you realise you\u2019re gonna have to kill a French police officer and two security to get to it, that changes the equation a bit,\u201d Engbrecht says.</p> <p>James Glancy, a former Royal Marine and London-based security consultant, says the heavy who clears a path through a sea of fans should be the \u201ccherry on the cake\u201d of a close-protection detail. Another British close-protection officer, who did not want to be named but is a&#xa0;manager at <a href=\"http://www.closeprotectionworld.com\" title=\"\">Close Protection World</a>, a&#xa0;forum for bodyguards, compares that experience with war (he is a former military police officer). \u201cYou come out of a lift and it\u2019s silent, then \u2013 bang! \u2013 you\u2019re almost blinded by the lights,\u201d he&#xa0;says. \u201cYou have cheering, shouting fans fighting among each other. It\u2019s the same sensory overload, and the adrenaline courses through you.\u201d</p> <p>Glancy\u2019s firm, <a href=\"http://www.another-day.com\" title=\"\">AnotherDay</a>, concentrates on the prevention and planning required to back up the man on the ground. He vets staff and commissions duplicates of valuable objects. He advised one British client to make replicas of a pair of Purdey shotguns. The copies cost about \u00a35,000 \u2013 a fraction of the real guns\u2019 value \u2013 and stand inside a conspicuous cabinet; the antiques are stashed elsewhere. His team trains clients to be convincing while handing over the decoys. \u201cIf an organised crime network really wants to get an individual, they will, but imagine the psychological victory if Kardashian had given these guys a fake ring,\u201d Glancy says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a0d60b682fa149c25c662f40cffa94c997bdc18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a0d60b682fa149c25c662f40cffa94c997bdc18/0_41_1987_2484/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pascal Duvier deals with celebrity botherer Vitalii Sediuk\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pascal Duvier and a French security agent deal with celebrity botherer Vitalii Sediuk, who tried to kiss Kim Kardashian in Paris in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Piasecki/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mores of the super-rich are partly to blame for an explosion in the close-protection industry centred on London. A Mayfair car showroom that&#xa0;opened last year sells <a href=\"http://www.ares-performance.com/press/press-releases/ares-opens-the-doors-on-flagship-london-showroom/\" title=\"\">armoured Lamborghinis</a>. Paradoxically, a hulking bodyguard is sometimes deployed as a&#xa0;wealth-signalling accessory. The <a href=\"http://www.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Security Industry Authority</a>, which regulates the industry for the Home Office, reports that in 2007 there were 2,000 valid close-protection licences in&#xa0;circulation (anyone working as a bodyguard in the UK is legally required to undergo training before applying for one). There are now more than 15,000, each bodyguard charging anything from \u00a3300 a day up into four figures depending on their background (ex-special forces sit at the top of the tree).</p> <p>As Whitfield found with Michael Jackson, the trust required to preserve a life means the role can quickly expand to combine the duties of a confidante, gatekeeper, childminder, PA \u2013 and friend. \u201cWe\u2019ve had clients for whom we\u2019ve had to draw chalk marks on the street at the Cannes festival so they know where to&#xa0;stand,\u201d says Engbrecht. \u201cWe had a billionaire who only communicated by Post-it notes and once informed us there was too much dust under the toaster by writing on a Post-It \u2013 and putting it under the toaster. We had one of the most powerful women in the world, who wasn\u2019t known in America and would come to New York to be treated as a human. We\u2019d walk down Fifth Avenue and I\u2019d be&#xa0;thinking: \u2018You\u2019re worth umpteen billions and God knows how many heads of state you\u2019ve got on your cell&#xa0;phone.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Violence remains rare on the celebrity circuit, although Bolivar says he has had to \u201csuppress life\u201d while protecting a client (he declines to elaborate). Engbrecht says he has displayed his weapon twice, \u201cand it became apparent I was prepared to use&#xa0;it\u201d. Whitfield has never had to take action. \u201cAnyone who would have got close enough to steal anything from Mr&#xa0;Jackson would have broken the barrier and that\u2019s never gonna happen with me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sometimes sacrifices have to be made. Iain Robertson was a former para who became a bodyguard and road manager for bands including Oasis and Spandau Ballet. In the early 2000s, before he quit for a safer life as a firefighter, he was in a Moscow nightclub after a Marc Almond concert. \u201cHe&#xa0;had a particularly stylish and flamboyant fur coat that night,\u201d Robertson remembers at his one-engine fire station in Gloucestershire. \u201cWe\u2019d been in this club a couple of hours, with the&#xa0;beautiful people of Moscow and shitloads of gangsters, when I was approached by a couple of guys who had been sitting a few tables away.</p> <p>\u201cI introduced myself and they asked if they could buy me a beer. Then one said: \u2018My boss\u2019s wife would really like that coat.\u2019 I said I\u2019d speak to Marc but that I knew he was very attached to it. \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand,\u2019 they said. So I talked to Marc. He didn\u2019t want to give up the coat. \u2018OK, I\u2019ll take care of this,\u2019 I told him. \u2018You need to gather up the band and slip out of here&#xa0;back to the hotel.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Robertson, now 56, says he returned to the table to stall the men. But two of&#xa0;them spotted the band leaving and got up. \u201cI gave the first guy a sort of straight arm to the throat and the second got a sort of knuckle punch into&#xa0;the temple,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew what&#xa0;was going to happen next. I got the living shit kicked out of me, but the&#xa0;band were able to get out. Then the guys who had done the beating picked me up, dusted me down and bought me a beer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2188af83d5779faad46230f4992b24c276e625f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2188af83d5779faad46230f4992b24c276e625f/0_108_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson with his personal security in 2004\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson with his personal security during a visit to Washington in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask Whitfield how he felt after Jackson\u2019s death in the summer of 2009. The bodyguard had stayed in Las Vegas to prepare the security for the world tour that was due to start in London two weeks later. Jackson was in a rented mansion in Los Angeles with his&#xa0;physician, who would later be convicted of involuntary manslaughter for administering the fatal dose of surgical anaesthetic that Jackson demanded for his insomnia. Whitfield had become unfailingly loyal, even forgoing wages while Jackson\u2019s debts multiplied. He remembers carrying in a&#xa0;briefcase two Gone With the Wind Oscars statuettes that Jackson had bought in 1999 for $1.5m. They would be used as currency if the cash ran out.</p> <p>Whitfield had watched lawyers, promoters and family members circle while the tour took shape. \u201cMr Jackson said to me at the beginning: \u2018Bill, watch; now the vultures are going to start to show up.\u2019 And soon I knew exactly what he meant. I witnessed the heartache and stress. He expressed it to me.&#xa0;So when the word came out that Mr Jackson passed away? After what I&#xa0;had witnessed him go through, the first thing that came to my mind was: \u2018Now&#xa0;he\u2019ll rest.\u2019 He didn\u2019t die, he left this place and all of what he was going&#xa0;through.\u201d</p> <p>That loyalty endures and Whitfield dismisses the more lurid claims about Jackson\u2019s private life. He says the man&#xa0;under the mask was \u201cas normal as&#xa0;the rest of us\u201d. In 2014, he wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Remember-Time-protecting-Michael-Jackson/dp/1922247804\" title=\"\">Remembering the Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days</a> with Javon Beard, his fellow bodyguard. \u201cMr Jackson became my friend, someone I cared for and loved,\u201d Whitfield says, before putting down the phone and going to school. \u201cWriting the book&#xa0;was a way of continuing my protection of him.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We British are a sorry lot. Our apology-addiction is a point of national pride and one area in which we have always outstripped the rest of the world. According to a recent YouGov poll, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/07/01/oh-sorry-do-british-people-apologise-too-much/\" title=\"\">Brits say sorry up to 50% more than Americans</a>. But for a couple of hours on Sunday night, the contrition tables turned. As the presidential election moved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">from debate to debacle</a>, Americans flocked to Twitter to apologise to the world for Donald Trump. A parody Jill Biden account, for example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JillBidenVeep/status/785288664255434752\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSorry, rest of the World. We\u2019re embarrassed too. #debate\u201d, and got 45,000 likes.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long, however, before the UK was apologising back to the US about Nigel Farage. As if Trump hadn\u2019t ruined our Sunday evening enough, you see, the outgoing leader of Ukip decided to continue the damage. Farage appeared in the spin room following the debate to praise Trump\u2019s performance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\" title=\"\">Likening Trump to a silverback gorilla</a>, Farage said: \u201cHe looked like a big gorilla prowling the set. He is that big alpha male \u2013 that\u2019s who he is.\u201d At the end of this soliloquy, a bewildered reporter inquired, <a href=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/please-read-this-incredibly-horny-description-of-donald-1787618973\" title=\"\">\u201cSir, can I just ask: what are you doing here?\u201d</a></p> <p>The short answer to this is: continuing the damage. If Trump is a gorilla, then Farage is, as memorably described by the actor Christoph Waltz, \u201cthe head rat leaving the sinking ship\u201d. Having \u201cliberated\u201d Britain, Farage was quick to remove himself from the actual work of Brexiting. Rather, he headed over to the US to continue inspiring popular revolt alongside Trump. Farage has become something of a rock star to conservative Americans. The rightwing talkshow host Steve Deace called him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/nigel-farage-cpac-american-conservatives\" title=\"\">\u201cprobably the global politician not named Netanyahu most adored by American conservatives\u201d</a>. He makes regular appearances on Fox News. He also seems to have become Trump\u2019s personal fluffer. He was at the debate at Trump\u2019s request and also attended the Republican national convention as well as a Trump rally in Mississippi in August. While many in Trump\u2019s own party have distanced themselves from the increasingly indefensible nominee, Farage is resolutely standing by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/06/nigel-farage-donald-trump-calls-himself-mr-brexit-heres-why-hes-right/\" title=\"\">Donald \u201cJust Call Me Mr Brexit\u201d Trump</a>.</p> <p>Farage\u2019s stateside trumpeting may not seem like much of a big deal, but it is. Farage has an international platform; his animal analogies were written up by a number of American outlets, including Time, CNN, the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek. This reflects back on Britain. It doesn\u2019t just say to America: this is what Nigel Farage thinks. It says, to some degree: this is what the UK thinks. It aligns Brexit Britain with Trump\u2019s values (or dearth thereof). And this gets to the heart of what Farage is really doing in America: claiming Brexit as a victory for his brand of racism and intolerance. Telling the US that Britain feels just like him. Acting as a sort of anti-ambassador.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56z7a\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2792998\"            data-video-name=\"Nigel Farage: 'Donald Trump was like a big silverback gorilla' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb5465e4b05c2f1e953e4a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\">Nigel Farage: \u2018Donald Trump was like a big silverback gorilla\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In an August speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/brexit-vote-nigel-farage-making-uk-laughing-stock-abroad-tim-farron\" title=\"\">warned that the UK has become a \u201claughing stock abroad\u201d</a> and identified Farage as one of the \u201cmalevolent forces\u201d tarnishing the country\u2019s image after the EU referendum. Farron told the Guardian that the rest of the world was increasingly associating the UK with figures such as the interim Ukip leader and stressed that we mustn\u2019t allow the likes of Farage, Boris Johnson, David Davis, and Liam Fox to represent Britain. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>No, they don\u2019t. But if we\u2019re not careful then Farage and BoJo are going to become the smug, smirking faces of Britain to the outside world. So how does Britain wrest back control of its international image? What\u2019s needed, I think, is a squad of Brexit-busters. Celebrities who actually represent modern Britain and are tasked with working together to counterbalance malevolent forces such as Farage. A sort of 2016 Captain Planet, tasked with taking political pollution down to zero.</p> <p>First three spots on the squad go to Adele, JK Rowling and Zadie Smith. Obviously. The next goes to Zayn Malik. He may have broken a million hearts with his One Direxit but he is one of the most positive ambassadors of Britishness abroad. Indeed, the poor guy is routinely held up as Modern Muslim British Man Who is Good Role Model by the media. As well as helping to spread the message that not all Muslims are Isis, Malik is telling the world that not all British food is awful. Apparently he\u2019s working as the UK\u2019s unofficial cultural ambassador and helping his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, get \u201csuper into British foods\u201d. The model told ES magazine: <a href=\"http://www.elleuk.com/fashion/news/a31882/gigi-hadid/\" title=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m loving Heinz baked beans in the morning.\u201d</a> If Malik can get Hadid to wax lyrical about baked beans, then anything is possible.</p> <p>James Corden\u2019s recent runaway success in America is another example of overcoming the odds. While most British personalities presenting on American TV have played into the evil Brit trope (think: Gordon Ramsay, Simon Cowell, Piers Morgan), Corden has proved you can be genuinely nice and still get good ratings.</p> <p>The final opening goes to John Oliver. The host of HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight, watched by 4 million Americans, has become a cult figure in the US, where he is far more famous than he is at home. Oliver has turned British sarcasm into something of a superpower; his jokes are helping to change America for the better, something Time magazine termed the <a href=\"http://time.com/3674807/john-oliver-net-neutrality-civil-forfeiture-miss-america/\" title=\"\">\u201cJohn Oliver effect\u201d</a>. His takedown of proposed changes to net neutrality laws, for example, has been credited, in part, with pushing the Federal Communications Commission to vote for regulations against internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d. Who knows, Oliver\u2019s segment on the EU referendum, in which he pleaded with Brits to vote remain, might have had an effect on the British electorate. However, due to British media impartiality rules, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/eu-referendum/britain-television-john-oliver/\" title=\"\">it was never shown there on TV</a>.</p> <p>Which sums up 2016 in the UK: a British politician gushing about gorillas to show his support for a man who says he likes to grope women is just regular news. A British comedian making jokes about the referendum, however, is unsuitable for television. Sorry, rest of the world. We\u2019re embarrassed too.</p>",
  "<p>The former cabinet minister Francis Maude has taken a job advising an international law firm on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, six months after standing down from government. <br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/francis-maude\">Lord Maude</a>, who until April was a trade and investment minister, has joined <a href=\"https://www.cov.com/\">Covington and Burling LLP</a> as a senior adviser in its government affairs practice. </p> <p>Law firms and the finance industry have been setting up Brexit units to advise clients on how to understand and shape UK policy and how their commercial interests will be affected by leaving the EU. </p> <p>The appointment coincides with further pressure on the government to clamp down on former ministers who want to take up roles in the private sector that may allow them to exploit their contacts. </p> <p>Maude\u2019s roles in government have made him one of the best connected figures in Whitehall following a 30-year career in parliament as an MP and minister. <br></p> <p>He was the minister for trade and investment under David Cameron from 2015 to 2016. Before that he was minister for the Cabinet Office and paymaster general under the 2010-15 coalition government, which brought him into contact with a succession of permanent secretaries. </p> <p>Covington, which works extensively in Europe, employs more than 120 former government officials, diplomats and regulators. It does not disclose any clients on the UK\u2019s statutory lobbying registers.<br></p> <p>Maude has also has taken up a role as chairman of the advertising agency Cogent Elliott, months after accepting a job on the advisory board at the alternative investment firm Anvest Partners.</p> <p>His roles have been approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) as long as he does not personally lobby ministers or officials for two years after leaving office or draw on privileged information.

Johnson famously wrote a biography of Winston Churchill and at one point this afternoon the the ultra-hawkish Labour MP <strong>John Woodock </strong>urged Johnson to adopt a Churchillian approach to Russian aggression in Syria. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98#block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98\">2.56pm.)</a> As mayor of London and a Telegraph columnist Johnson generally tended to be on the more interventionist end of the scale, and so perhaps MPs were expecting him to adopt a rather more muscular approach to Syria policy than was adopted by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.</p> <p>If so, they will have been disappointed. Johnson\u2019s language was probably a bit more condemnatory than Hammond\u2019s would have been in a debate like this. But if you listened carefully to what he said, he was actually adopting a rather cautious, dovish stance. This may be more a reflection of May\u2019s views than Johnson\u2019s. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-the-chilcot-report-is-finally-coming-but-we-already-know-we-havent-learned-the-lessons-of-iraq.html\">(Nick Timothy, her co-chief of staff and philosophical alter ego, is on record as saying foreign policy should \u201cvalue stability, \u201crespect sovereignty\u201d and avoid ideological crusades.)</a> But it meant that if any MPs were hoping for Churchill, what they got instead was more Stanley Baldwin.</p> <p>Here are the key points from his speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson tentatively backed the call for Syria and Russia to be investigated for war crimes by the international criminal court</strong>. But he played down prospects of anything happening quickly, saying some ICC prosecutions only take place decades after the offences are committed. He told MPs that the targeting of hospitals in Aleppo amounted to a war crime.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every hospital in eastern Aleppo is believed to have been bombed, some of them more than once, and several have been put out of action. Hospitals have been targeted with such frequency and precision that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this must be deliberate policy. The House will know that intentionally attacking a hospital amounts to a war crime. It is time, I think, for all these incidents to be fully and properly investigated with a view to assembling the necessary evidence to ensure that justice is done. And yes, to answer the question that has been raised by several honourable and right honourable members, we do think there could be advantages in the [international criminal court] procedures. And I would remind this House that in recent history war criminals have been successfully prosecuted decades after their offences.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also expressed some support for <a href=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20161010084755-l2s3l/\">the French bid to get the ICC to launch an investigation into Syria and Russia,</a> saying he was \u201cpersonally very attracted to the idea of holding these people to account before the international criminal court\u201d. But later, at the Number 10 lobby briefing, Downing Street sounded a bit less keen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/785863360227250176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boris &#39;personally attracted&#39; to pursuing Syria war crimes through ICC.

Johnson said he had \u201cevery sympathy\u201d for what they were proposing and that he would consult allies on the idea. But he also signalled strongly that he would eventually say no. Pointing out that the Commons was opposed to sending troops to Syria, he added:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we cannot commit to a no-fly zone unless we are prepared to ... shoot down planes or helicopters that violate that zone. We need to think very carefully about the consequences.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Labour MP <strong>John Woodcock</strong> read his comments as a move towards no-fly zones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JWoodcockMP/status/785854359829700609\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Foreign sec says all options being considered in Syria bar UK boots on ground - including no-fly zone or no bombing zone. *some* progress</p>&mdash; John Woodcock (@JWoodcockMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JWoodcockMP/status/785854359829700609\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But the Independent\u2019s <strong>John Rentoul</strong> probably has a more realistic interpretation of Johnson\u2019s words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/785857246085414912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boris Johnson didn&#39;t use these precise words, but his message on Syria was: I am not going to start WW3 by shooting down Russian planes.</p>&mdash; John Rentoul (@JohnRentoul) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/785857246085414912\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he would like to see people protest about Syria outside the Russian embassy.</strong> The Labour MP <strong>Ann Clywd</strong> proposed this earlier (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fce82de4b03b22b4fb2444#block-57fce82de4b03b22b4fb2444\"> 2.27pm)</a> and Johnson said he agreed with her.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I agree with [Ann Clywd].

Where are they?</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was worried that \u201cthe wells of outrage [about events in Syria] are growing exhausted\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said Russia was in danger of becoming an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d because of what was happening in Syria.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Russia continues in it current path, then I believe that great county is in danger of becoming a pariah nation. If President Putin\u2019s strategy is to restore the greatness and the glory of Russia, then I believe he risks seeing his ambition turn to ashes in the face of international contempt for what is happening in Syria.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But he said the \u201cbest hope\u201d was to persuade Russia to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. </strong>Johnson said the UK had urged the EU to adopt a tough line on sanctions against Russia, but he pointedly refused to commit the UK to pushing for tougher sanctions. He also declined to back a call from Labour\u2019s <strong>Toby Perkins</strong> for the international community to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia because of what is happening in Syria. Summing up his position Johnson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the long term the only realistic solution is to persuade both sides to have a ceasefire and then to work through to a political solution ... </p> <p>Our best hope is to persuade the Russians that it is profoundly in the interests of Russia to take the initiative, to win the acclaim of the international community, do the right thing in Syria, call off their puppets in the Assad regime, stop the bombing and bring peace to Aleppo and have a genuine ceasefire. That is the way.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Aleppo siege was the worst in the civil war.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this moment the 275,000 inhabitants of eastern Aleppo are under siege. They are isolated from the outside world, subjected to constant bombardment and prevented from receiving humanitarian aid. Their power and water supplies have been cut off in what has become a signature tactic of the Assad killing machine, to besiege civilian populations. And what we are now seeing in eastern Aleppo is the biggest and potentially the deadliest siege since the outbreak of Syria\u2019s civil war over five years ago.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eeb26a160f2b96cc7602dbd4fdddff8a76341724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeb26a160f2b96cc7602dbd4fdddff8a76341724/66_0_662_397/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson in the Commons.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson in the Commons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/BBC Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:29:41.200Z\">at 5.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fcfedce4b01d9dd2c8ff08\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:10:09.982Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia defends its record in Syria</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Russian embassy in London has been using Twitter today to defend its record in Syria.

She is working on the assumption that the country voted for a hard, confrontational Brexit when there is no evidence to support this. In fact, it would seem that the opposite is true \u2013 a majority of people were against a hard Brexit.</p> <p>There is a big risk that her handling of these crucial talks could widen the divides in our country, not heal them. We need to open our eyes to these risks and ensure that all voices and perspectives are fully involved in shaping the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>Devolution in England was never conceived as part of the answer to Brexit but now it must be fully embraced as such. Brexit will have a differential impact on different parts of the country and a hard Brexit would hit the poorest areas hardest of all.

But Osborne did not explicitly say the Laws account was wrong. Osborne said that he and David Cameron always thought the \u201cbest of the Conservative tradition\u201d combined the interventionist views of people like Heseltine with the economic rationalism of people like Nigel Lawson. Heseltine said that if Osborne was initially opposed to his plans in 2012, that would not surprise him because \u201cthere has been a growing understanding of the potential [of decentralisation]\u201d. But he also said that he thought the Laws account was simplistic because Cameron and Osborne knew what to expect when they commissioned Heseltine to write his report.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Osborne played down claims that Theresa May was pursuing a new industrial policy, saying her approach was \u201cvery similar\u201d to the Cameron\u2019s government.</strong> When he was asked about May\u2019s claim that she wanted a proper industrial strategy, implying the last government did not have one, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whenever you get new politicians in post, they always want to announce new things. Broadly, the approach I can see them pursuing in energy, regional policy and the like is very similar. </p> <p>It is human nature that new people in new jobs want to do new things. But the key is to look at is what is essentially the agreed strategy adopted by the new team. </p> <p>The agreed strategy that has been adopted by the new team is that we should have an industrial strategy, that certain sectors should receive active government support, that government should be pro-business, that devolution should continue, that the Northern Powerhouse should be supported. </p> <p>I would look behind the blizzard of press releases to the continuity of the policy, and I see a lot of continuity.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said governments in the past had been too slow to build new airports.</strong> Asked if the last government should have acted more quickly to expand Heathrow, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our country has collectively over 60 years dragged its heels on airport expansion.

Laws was a Lib Dem minister in the coalition, and when he was writing the book he had access to Nick Clegg\u2019s private notes. As a result, the book is well-sourced.</p> <p>And the book reveals that Osborne was a) initially sceptical about devolving powers to the region and b) opposed to Heseltine\u2019s No Stone Unturned report.</p> <p>Here is the key extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of October [2012], the Heseltine report was published, urging the government to devolve more economic powers from the centre to the regions. George Osborne didn\u2019t seem very impressed. At a meeting, he described the Heseltine report as a \u2018very personal\u2019 report, and a \u2018bid to steal every department\u2019s capital budget\u2019.</p> <p>David Cameron joked that the whole thing sounded like a \u2018fourth-term priority\u2019. The ever-sharp George Osborne added: \u2018Yes, a fourth-term priority - but for a different government!\u2019</p> <p>The prime minister urged that we should be diplomatic in responding to the Heseltine report as \u2018Michael is a very big beast in the political jungle. Upsetting him over this would be as risky as interrupting a silverback while he\u2019s mating.\u2019 It was an interesting and vivid image.</p> <p>Later in the parliament, George Osborne seemed to become a belated supporter of more localism. For now, he certainly seemed rather sceptical. Even in early 2013, when the chancellor first started to advocate the devolving of money from central government to local areas, one seasoned government adviser told me: \u2018George\u2019s view is that the money will either be wasted by central government or by local government. He thinks the only advantage of devolution is that you can slice 10% off the money as you devolve it, so that the Treasury pays out less.\u2019</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fcb722e4b088a03a67d5ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T09:56:30.622Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Should you have gone quicker in government on airport expansion?</em></p> <p>Osborne says the country collective has dragged its feet on this.

When elevated to the altitude of ministers or heads of state, the culture of British politics \u2014 sectarian, raucous, aggressive \u2014 is inimical to the kind of painstaking, often painful, deliberation in Brussels.</p> <p>The centralised British state, with a weak legislature and strong executive, lends itself to intense public debate in an excitable national press, followed by last-minute decision-making and quick implementation. In the EU, the dispersed nature of power means policies have to trudge wearily between the commission, national capitals and, increasingly, the European and national parliaments before being adopted.</p> <p>Neither is necessarily superior. The eurozone\u2019s inept handling of its sovereign debt crisis was an object lesson in what happens when iterative processes do not match the realities of 21st-century capital markets.

Finally, and most importantly in this context, the United Kingdom must aim to maintain the best possible open access to European markets and vice versa. If we can achieve all that, there will be no downside to Brexit at all, and considerable upsides.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the Treasury is not so optimistic. This morning the Times is splashing on the leak of a Treasury paper saying that, if the UK leaves the EU without negotiating a trade deal, and has to rely on World Trade Organisation rules for trading with Europe, the government could lose up to \u00a366bn a year in tax revenue. This is based on forecasts in the Treasury paper on Brexit published before the EU referendum. But the Treasury reportedly is standing by its analysis from earlier this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/785590430712885248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tuesday&#39;s Times front page:<br>Hard Brexit could cost \u00a366bn a year<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jOb8RRZXAE\">pic.twitter.com/jOb8RRZXAE</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/785590430712885248\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Here is the Guardian\u2019s version of the story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/hard-brexit-treasury-66bn-eu-single-market\">Hard Brexit will cost Treasury up to \u00a366bn a year, ministers are told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By a happy coincidence George Osborne, the former chancellor, is giving evidence to a Commons committee this morning, and so we may find out what he has to say about this.

  "<p>Today\u2019s Republican party makes no sense.</p> <p>It spent decades as the party of national security before nominating a man who both defends Russia and pretends to know nothing about the place.</p> <p>If it is the party of small government and constitutional liberty, it\u2019s not clear why its members feel so good about locking up political opponents like Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>To cap it all, the party is currently led by a reality TV star who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-women-comments-groping-apology\">destroyed his own campaign</a> with a TV interview.</p> <p>But all those contradictions look simple compared to the pretzel shape that now passes for the strategy of its leadership.</p> <p>House speaker Paul Ryan was a reluctant endorser of Donald Trump. Now he is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">reluctant non-endorser</a> of the same.</p> <p>Ryan told his own Republican caucus on Monday that he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him. He urged all the rats to leave the sinking ship, telling them \u201cto do what\u2019s best for you\u201d to save their House majority. He said his own mission was to stop Clinton controlling the House and Senate, as well as the White House.</p> <p>But there is no escape from this shipwreck, as Trump himself made clear on Twitter. \u201cPaul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, job and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,\u201d said the same nominee.</p> <p>Ryan is indeed wasting his time. He and his House Republicans cannot run away from their own nominee. They have said too many nice things about a man who brags about sexual assault. Just one nice thing would be one too many for the suburban female voters who decide general elections.</p> <p>At the same time, Ryan and his crew cannot run away from their own Trump-loving base. If they do, they run the very real risk that Trump voters will mark their ballots for the presidential candidate and simply skip their down-ballot votes. Even a small protest vote would hand every battleground district to the Democrats.</p> <p>Those battlegrounds are already leaning a long way away from the GOP. According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-support-falls-in-wake-of-lewd-video-new-poll-says-1476115225\">poll</a>, Clinton enjoys an 11-point lead among likely voters. Barack Obama took control of the White House and Capitol Hill with a seven-point win in 2008. A mere defeat threatens to turn into a full-blown rout.</p> <p>To make matters worse for the Trump campaign, after squandering a year without a real organization, it has no voter turnout operations of its own. Instead it is reliant on the RNC\u2019s ground game, which is now either ambivalent about its presidential candidate or shifting decisively towards the House contests.</p> <p>That might help explain the ominous <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/kellyanne-conway-accuses-congressmen-of-lewd-behavior/?client=safari\">statements</a> issued by Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, who warned that Ryan was booed by Trump fans in his home state over the weekend. She went on to say that she knew of GOP lawmakers who forced themselves on young women and were hypocrites for shunning Trump.</p> <p>This Republican civil war is what you might call a lose-lose proposition. It might be a great reality TV show if it didn\u2019t affect the selection of the next leader of the free world.</p> <p>Of course, Paul Ryan and his fellow GOP leaders already know who the next president will be, and she\u2019s not colored orange. Their real contest is not about the House or the Senate. It\u2019s about the next Republican leader to guide the party out of the wilderness.</p> <p>That Moses vacancy is currently unfilled. Ted Cruz blew it with his perfectly timed endorsement just days before the Billy Bush video emerged. Mike Pence will forever be stained by putting his name on the Trump ticket. Jeb Bush will be 67 at the next election, trying to unseat another Clinton on behalf of his family.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Paul Ryan, a relatively youthful leader with not only impeccable conservative credentials but also an anti-poverty plan. Compared to Donald Trump, he is a Desmond Tutu of peace and reconciliation.</p> <p>That\u2019s where Ryan\u2019s current strategy buckles under its internal contradictions. If the Republican party is to return to power any time soon, it needs to clean house of the crazies who invaded it under the Tea Party banner in 2010.</p> <p>There is no hedging your way into the mainstream after so long on the fringes of birtherism, Islamophobia, nativism and sexism. There are no baby steps back from a flat tax and protectionism. There is nothing easy about erasing the cheap talk of undermining Nato and defending Russia. At this rate, the next Republican president has not yet been elected to a governorship or the US Congress.</p> <p>To one half of his own party, Ryan will forever be the man who betrayed Trump. To the other half, he will forever be the man who stood aside while Trump wrecked the place.</p> <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when Republicans lampooned a Democratic presidential candidate for taking both sides of the most important issue facing the country.</p> <p>His name was John Kerry, and he suggested, at one campaign rally, that he voted both for and against funding the war in Iraq. For that act of doublespeak, the man who is now secretary of state was pursued by giant flip-flops at every campaign event.</p> <p>The GOP united in its scorn for the Democrats, the party of cheese-eating surrender monkeys, who had nominated the French-speaking, windsurfing candidate who was clearly as unmanly as he was indecisive.</p> <p>Republicans have traveled a very long way in the last decade. They are both for and against their own nominee. They oppose his character but they favor his policies. Unless they think he can win, in which case his character is something they can live with. They surrendered their moral compass and now find themselves lost in a sea of indecision.</p> <p>The flip-flops are now on the other feet.</p>",
  "<p>When is a news story just a news story? And when does it become a \u201cdebate\u201d? It\u2019s a difficult question to answer, particularly for harried researchers and editors on tight budgets, and tighter deadlines. But the answer matters, because it dictates how any given topic is framed for an audience and, consequently, the way in which the public engages with it.</p> <p>When I first heard <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">Donald Trump\u2019s taped comments</a> that surfaced last week, I was most struck by the complacency with which he boasted about being able to commit sexual assault because of his status as a powerful, famous man. It was a hierarchy with which many women are familiar. So, too, are we horribly accustomed to the \u201charmless talk\u201d excuse he tried to use in the aftermath of the tapes\u2019 release. </p> <p>But, this time, the excuses didn\u2019t seem to be working. Even men famous for their own misogyny, men who had turned a blind eye while Trump made sexist, racist and Islamophobic comments in the past, seemed to have decided that his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/outrage-over-the-trump-tape-is-more-dangerous-and-repugnant_us_57fac20fe4b0d786aa52b6b7?\">words were indefensible</a>. </p> <p>So it was something of a surprise to be asked to take part in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07x2zcr#play\">conversation on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme</a> that ended up responding to the tapes by asking whether men need space to discuss women in sexual terms, and whether certain types of \u201ccompliments\u201d are acceptable. Those are valid questions in their own right. But to frame a discussion of Trump\u2019s remarks in those terms risks downplaying and mitigating the very serious nature of what he said, playing right into the hands of his own <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/oct/10/trumps-banter-what-is-locker-room-chat-really-like\">\u201clocker room\u201d banter</a> excuse. Indeed, it even required the presenter to ask at one point that we set aside the most serious element of Trump\u2019s words in order to focus on the rest:</p> <p>\u201cIf you put that on one side though, the specific part of what he was taped saying that was obviously to you about assault, and you take the rest of it, is the rest of it acceptable?\u201d I asked the presenter which bits he meant by \u201cthe rest of it\u201d \u2013 perhaps Trump\u2019s description of a woman as a bitch, or his graphic and misogynistic description of her breasts? He responded: \u201cSo it\u2019s all the same, any description that objectifies a woman is an assault?\u201d</p> <p>Later he said: \u201cThe serious issue \u2026 is whether or not in 2016 it\u2019s acceptable for men together to talk about women in a sexual manner without feeling guilty about it.\u201d It boiled down to the question: calling a woman sexy \u2013 acceptable or not? I would argue that perhaps that wasn\u2019t, in fact, the serious issue at hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a5e96e242d7f7acb624553410fb98cbae5cc67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a5e96e242d7f7acb624553410fb98cbae5cc67/0_0_2560_1068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Bates on the Today programme on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"417\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Bates on the Today programme on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Comments as shocking as Trump\u2019s require a less sympathetic media response, especially in light of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales\">reality of sexual violence </a>\u2013 400,000 women are sexually assaulted in the UK annually, with one in five women experiencing some form of sexual offence in their lifetime. And, in a country where <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales\">sexual violence is enormously underreported</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11409210/Drunk-or-flirty-rape-victims-often-to-blame-says-survey.html\">victim-blaming is rife</a>, the framing of debates such as these not only sends a strong message to survivors about how their experiences are viewed, but also risks inadvertently validating those who hold views like Trump\u2019s. Broadcasters have a power over public opinion, and presenting something as \u201cup for debate\u201d leads listeners to believe there are two equally valid sides to the story. Sometimes there aren\u2019t.</p> <p>This is not to suggest that debate isn\u2019t healthy, or that difficult topics shouldn\u2019t be openly tackled. Of course they should. But this can be done in a way that doesn\u2019t imply equal validation of those inciting and opposing something like sexual assault. There are certain serious events and issues simply reported as news stories, or condemned in the media without the need for a \u201cdevil\u2019s advocate\u201d argument. The question is, who decides what is \u201cbeyond debate\u201d? It often feels as if issues around sexism and sexual violence are presented as even, two-sided questions even when what is discussed is extreme. And sometimes \u201cdebate\u201d is artificially manufactured for the sake of creating a more controversial news item.</p> <p>In August, the Trades Union Congress and the Everyday Sexism Project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/half-of-women-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-at-work-tuc-study-everyday-sexism\">released a piece of research</a> revealing that more than half of all women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. About one in eight women reported unwanted sexual touching or attempts to kiss them \u2013 which could be defined as sexual assault under UK law.</p> <p>But the day the research came out, I was repeatedly asked to go on radio or television shows to \u201cdebate\u201d whether women were making a fuss about nothing, or whether the harassment and assault the report described was just \u201coffice banter\u201d. These discussions had little to do with the facts of the report, and risked undermining its message, giving audiences an inaccurate impression of the news story. Usually, I refuse these invitations and try to explain why I think it is problematic to frame the conversation in this way, but that invariably results in the \u201cdebate\u201d going ahead anyway while I listen in frustration at home, so this time I raised the issue when it arose on the programme instead.</p> <p>Such misinformation is similarly perpetuated by news outlets that frame issues such as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat/status/781496508613099530\">Is it OK to grab a woman on the street?</a>\u201d as questions, when <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/contents\">the law already tells us the answer</a>. This isn\u2019t a problem restricted to any one programme or media outlet \u2013 and it is complicated by the real need for balanced reporting. But there are many ways to achieve balance, such as debating the different ways to tackle a problem, which don\u2019t have to involve undermining the problem itself. And there are times when, at victims\u2019 expense, it feels as if \u201cbalance\u201d is a thinly veiled euphemism for controversy, clickbait or catfight.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s hard to say which was worse, the appetizer or the main course.</p> <p>I\u2019m talking, of course, about the second presidential debate and its prelude, that bizarre tableau of Donald Trump flanked by the Clintons\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">female accusers</a>. It was meant to distract voters from the killer tape of Trump\u2019s unspeakable misogyny and to distract Hillary Clinton. So far, it doesn\u2019t seem to have worked.</p> <p>Trump was attempting to take advantage of the false equivalencies that have riddled this presidential campaign, almost always to Hillary Clinton\u2019s detriment. Here are some of them: Donald Trump not releasing his tax returns is no worse than Clinton not releasing her Wall Street speeches; the Trump Foundation doesn\u2019t stretch the law as much as the Clinton Foundation; and, on display Sunday night, Hillary\u2019s intimidation of Bill\u2019s accusers from the 90s is just as unspeakable as the assault on women Trump described on that Access Hollywood tape.</p> <p>These casual and pernicious comparisons have been endlessly recycled and loudly echoed in what my friend, the journalist Robert Parry, has called the mighty wurlitzer of rightwing talk shows and social media.</p> <p>I\u2019ve previously reported in the Guardian that Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/09/hillary-clinton-enabler-bill-donald-trump-presidential-campaign\">cheerleaders for Trump</a> long before their canned, pre-debate endorsements of him, which, watched with bad sound on Facebook Live, resembled a Soviet show trial. (I haven\u2019t reported on the case of Kathy Shelton, whose allegations about Hillary Clinton stem from her legal work on a rape case in which Shelton, then 12, was the victim. They are different from the other three involving Hillary\u2019s supposed attempts to cover up for Bill in what Trump insists \u2013 but never proves \u2013 is \u201chorrible mistreatment\u201d of her husband\u2019s accusers by Hillary.)</p> <p>The facts that follow are somewhat tangled, so please be patient (facts are stubborn things). I am not judging the underlying accusations against Bill Clinton by the women, just Trump\u2019s insistence that Hillary Clinton has enabled and covered up her husband\u2019s sexual misconduct.</p> <p>I\u2019ll begin with Willey, who says Bill Clinton groped her in 1993. Before and after she testified in the Paula Jones case in 1998, she says, the Clintons have carried on a campaign of intimidation against her involving the vandalism of her car, the theft of her recent book manuscript and a cat skull on her porch. No evidence has surfaced linking either Clinton to these nefarious deeds.</p> <p>Nonetheless, she\u2019s a convenient weapon for Trump because of her ties to the alt-right. She\u2019s been featured on WND.com, headed by Joseph Farah, a radical rightwinger who embraced the birther movement and suggested secession if gay marriage was legalized. WND also published her book, which sells for 99 cents on its website. In January, Willey went on a popular Sunday radio show, Aaron Klein Investigative Radio, to demand that Hillary Clinton take a lie detector test to answer questions about whether she\u2019s tried to silence or intimidate her husband\u2019s female accusers. (Klein is also Breitbart News\u2019 Jerusalem bureau chief). Willey\u2019s also been spokesman for Rape Pac, a fundraising group set up by Trump adviser Roger Stone, author of The Clintons\u2019 War Against Women. (The Pac has raised $240.) These activities don\u2019t mean she\u2019s lying, and her supporters complain the leftwing media won\u2019t cover her. But they do show she\u2019s pretty deep in with Trumpworld.</p> <p>Juanita Broaddrick says Bill Clinton raped her when she was a volunteer in his Arkansas campaign. She interprets a brief encounter with Hillary Clinton 38 years ago at a state political event as an attempt to silence her. Their conversation, which Broaddrick says left her in shock, took place soon after the alleged rape. Here\u2019s what she told the Drudge Report in an interview in 1999: </p> <p>\u201cShe came directly to me as soon as she hit the door \u2026 She caught me and took my hand and said: \u2018I am so happy to meet you. I want you to know that we<br>appreciate everything you do for Bill.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Broaddrick says she found these comments \u201cscary\u201d, especially after Hillary repeated them a second time when her \u201csmile faded on the second thank you\u201d. The former nursing home worker said she was \u201cin state of shock ... nausea went all over me\u201d.</p> <p>It takes a lot of reading between the lines to interpret these words as a threat to stay quiet. It also assumes that Hillary Clinton knew about what her husband allegedly did to Broaddrick, something she has denied about his womanizing generally until he confessed to his affair with Monica Lewinsky.</p> <p>Jones has leveled no personal allegations of being threatened by Hillary. Also appearing on the Aaron Klein show, she said, \u201cShe don\u2019t care nothing about women. Because if she did she would believe what I had to say. She would believe what the other women had to say.\u201d Jones then said Hillary Clinton \u201ctried to discredit all of these women that her husband abused and sexually harassed\u201d.</p> <p>Seriously, this is the bill of particulars that prove Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201chorrible mistreatment\u201d of the three women.</p> <p>Their sudden appearance just an hour before the debate had to be jarring for Clinton, even though Trump had threatened to invite Jones to the first debate. Whether this, or Trump looming over her onstage like the Incredible Hulk, or something else rattled her, I don\u2019t know, but she was not at the top of her debate game.</p> <p>Looking back, Clinton herself may have helped lure these women on to the 2016 campaign stage by tweeting last fall that every victim of sexual assault or harassment deserved to be believed.</p> <p>That tweet represents the prevailing view these days, but not in the 1990s, when this history unfolded. (Think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/hbo-confirmation-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-jill-abramson\">Anita Hill</a>.)</p> <p>The assumption of truth-telling should extend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth</a>, whose allegations of sexual assault against Trump in 1993 were detailed in the Guardian in July. Trump has denied the charges.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that Bill Clinton assaulted Willey, Broaddrick and Jones during that same era. </p> <p>But that isn\u2019t the equivalent of wrongdoing by his wife.</p>",

The achieved result is more than double that. A factor may be the local popularity of the book, whose author moved from Zimbabwe to London in 1989. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/10/the-girl-on-the-train-relocating-movies\">The transposition of the story</a> to upstate New York does not seem to have dented the film\u2019s appeal in Hawkins\u2019 adopted home market.</p> <p>The sustained success of Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby this past month may have given eOne some concern, given the female skew on both titles. The flipside is that the distributor could hardly have hoped for a better trailering platform for its film. It\u2019s also the case that success can breed success: a big title can bring the audience back, and reignite enthusiasm for the cinema.</p> <h2><strong>The other winner: My Scientology Movie</strong></h2> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/06/my-scientology-movie-review-louis-theroux-gets-smart-with-the-cult-church\">My Scientology Movie</a>, starring and co-written by Louis Theroux, was beaten to the punch by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/28/alex-gibney-going-clear-scientology-and-the-prison-of-belief-interview-documentary-film\">Alex Gibney\u2019s documentary</a> Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, film-makers John Dower and Simon Chinn had reason to be despondent.

Any concerns about the fate of the documentary evaporated as soon as tickets went on sale, with key indie venues such as Bristol Watershed, Glasgow film theatre, Manchester Home and London ICA reporting rapid sellouts. My Scientology Movie has opened with a very encouraging \u00a393,000 from 26 cinemas, with previews taking the total up to \u00a3107,000.</p> <p>In addition, a special event screening with a Theroux Q&amp;A was beamed from London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall into 240 cinemas on Monday evening. Altitude reports more than \u00a3330,000 for this, including the host venue, taking the four-day total to \u00a3438,000.

Baby saw its steepest weekly decline to date \u2013 38% \u2013 at the weekend, but any drop under 40% is generally considered a decent hold, and the film faced formidable new competition with the arrival of The Girl on the Train. Including Monday\u2019s takings, Baby has now overtaken Deadpool (\u00a337.9m) to become the third biggest hit of 2016, behind only The Jungle Book (\u00a346.1m) and Finding Dory (\u00a342m)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/mar/23/bridget-joness-baby-watch-renee-zellweger-return-new-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4hzfd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2478289\"            data-video-name=\"Bridget Jones's Baby: watch Ren\u00e9e Zellweger return in new trailer \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Universal \"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56f2da09e4b03be67b95cae2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/mar/23/bridget-joness-baby-watch-renee-zellweger-return-new-trailer-video\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby: watch Ren\u00e9e Zellweger return in new trailer \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Of course, adjusted for inflation, Baby is still behind the Bridget franchise\u2019s previous entries.

McDonagh\u2019s previous film Calvary began its run in April 2014 with \u00a3571,000 from 150 venues, including previews of \u00a36,500. It\u2019s worth noting that \u00a3295,000 of that total came from Ireland, which is always included in the UK box office totals. Although McDonagh remains popular in Ireland, his new film\u2019s New Mexico setting means that it doesn\u2019t have the same particular local appeal there as his previous films.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/05/bridget-joness-baby-miss-peregrine-supersonic-free-state-of-jones-uk-box-office\">Bridget Jones's Baby continues growth spurt at UK box office</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In July 2011, McDonagh\u2019s The Guard opened first in Ireland, debuting with \u00a3474,000 from 71 cinemas, including \u00a372,000 in previews.

The UK and Ireland grosses, at least, suggest otherwise.</p> <p>War on Everyone\u2019s result looks positively muscular next to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/blood-father-review-cannes-mel-gibson\">Blood Father</a>, the latest action thriller starring Mel Gibson.

The film, which is available on Netflix, is playing an exclusive one-week engagement at the Bertha DocHouse at London\u2019s Curzon Bloomsbury \u2013 a run that qualifies it for the Bafta film awards \u2013 following its special presentation as part of the London film festival last Thursday. Other cinemas seeking to book it report having been rebuffed. The Selma director\u2019s acclaimed investigation into US mass incarceration of African Americans grossed \u00a3455 at the weekend. The film ends its run on Thursday.</p> <h2><strong>The personal milestone: The BFG</strong></h2> <p>Now in its 12th week of release, Steven Spielberg\u2019s The BFG passed the \u00a330m barrier at the weekend \u2013 the ninth film to do so this year, following The Jungle Book, Finding Dory, Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby, Deadpool, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, Captain America: Civil War, The Secret Life of Pets and Suicide Squad. The UK is the runaway winning territory for The BFG, relative to the size of its overall cinema market.

  "<p>Following an Atkins-style diet may make you thinner but it won\u2019t make you healthier, research suggests.</p> <p>A study found that when women lost excess weight by eating a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet they appeared to forgo some of the usual health benefits, including those linked to diabetes and heart disease.</p> <p>Bettina Mittendorfer, a professor of medicine, who led the research at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that the metabolic benefits of weight loss were diminished - they were completely abolished in women who consumed high-protein diets, even though they lost the same, substantial amounts of weight as women who ate the diet that was lower in protein.\u201d<br></p> <p>Swapping bread and potatoes for steaks and chicken breasts - as promoted by diets like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/series/alok-jhas-atkins-diet-experiment\">Atkins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/04/seven-days-seven-diets\">Dukan and Paleo</a> diets - is supposed to help people lose weight because protein-rich foods are believed to make you feel fuller quicker.</p> <p>The idea that a high-protein diet encourages fat loss rather than muscle loss has also entered dieting folklore - although the latest study suggests that it does not make much difference to this.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you lose weight, about two-thirds of it tends to be fat tissue, and the other third is lean tissue,\u201d Mittendorfer said. \u201cThe women who ate more protein did tend to lose a little bit less lean tissue, but the total difference was only about a pound. We question whether there\u2019s a significant clinical benefit to such a small difference.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(16)31286-4\">The study</a>, published on Tuesday in the journal Cell Reports, involved 34 women with obesity who were aged 50 to 65 years. Although all of the women had body mass indices (BMI) of at least 30 (30 or more indicates obesity) none had diabetes.</p> <p>The women were divided into three groups: a control group, who were asked to maintain their weight, a second group who followed a weight-loss diet with recommended daily protein intake (0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight) and a third group who ate a high protein weight-loss diet with 50% extra protein. By the end of the 28-week study all the women had lost roughly 10% of their body weight.</p> <p>\u201cWe found that women who lost weight eating a high-protein diet didn\u2019t experience any improvements in insulin sensitivity,\u201d said Mittendorfer. </p> <p>Insulin sensitivity is an important health measure because in many people who are overweight insulin becomes less effective at controlling blood-sugar levels, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.</p> <p>The women who ate the recommended amount of protein saw big benefits in metabolism, led by a 25 to 30% improvement in their insulin sensitivity. Such improvements lower the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>The scientists said it was not clear why insulin sensitivity didn\u2019t improve in the high-protein group, but suggested that it could be linked to the body essentially having to flush out \u201cexcess fuel\u201d.</p> <p>The scientists also said it was possible that the high protein group did improve on other health measures that they had not studied, such as joint pain. </p> <p>Mittendorfer said she was concerned about an increasing number of foods being marketed as high in protein. \u201cWe push protein into foods that are not traditionally high protein ... like cereals,\u201d she said. \u201cPotentially this could be harmful.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2016 because an earlier version said that a body mass index of 30 or more indicates significant obesity.<br></p>",

Thicke has just released his <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/68920-nas-addresses-police-violence-on-new-robin-thicke-track-deep-listen/\">latest single Deep</a>, which kicks off with a rap about police violence towards unarmed black men. Sadly, for fans of the worst possible moments in musical history, it\u2019s not Thicke himself who delivers this rap. It\u2019s actually Nas, whose ear-grabbing and heartfelt opening verse is partly addressed to his own seven-year-old son: \u201cCan\u2019t play with your water gun, son, \u2019cos the police see a seven-years-old as a threat.

  "<p>When you\u2019re given joint billing with Michael Heseltine, you know you\u2019ve finally made it to the status of grandee. Only a few months ago, an appearance before a Commons select committee for George Osborne would have meant a grilling on the Treasury\u2019s performance; now the former chancellor gets to do a double act before the business committee in the parliamentary equivalent of Desert Island Discs.</p> <p>\u201cTell me a little about your industrial strategy, George,\u201d asked the committee chair, Iain Wright. George was all smiles; if he\u2019s missing his place in the Conservatives\u2019 starting XI, he\u2019s concealing it well. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that my northern powerhouse was the stuff of legend,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say nothing of my Midlands engine. And for my first song I\u2019d like I Just Don\u2019t Know What to Do With Myself.</p> <p>As Dusty Springfield\u2019s voice faded out, Wright gently enquired why Theresa May was saying she needed a proper industrial strategy if George\u2019s own industrial strategy had been so good. \u201cArtistic differences,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen a band splits up there\u2019s always a falling out. But if you check out her setlist, you\u2019ll see she\u2019s basically playing all my greatest hits.\u201d George\u2019s next disc was The Song Remains the Same.</p> <p>While George took centre stage, Lord Heseltine sat sphinx-like, looking neither to his left or right. Eventually the Man with the Mane was called up for his solo. What everyone needed to remember was that though Britain\u2019s industrial strategy didn\u2019t match up to the industrial strategy of some other countries he had played with over the years, it had never been better than under the stewardship of Osborne and David Cameron. \u201cThey were the best,\u201d he said in a low, barely audible growl, as he patted George\u2019s hair affectionately. \u201cNo, no,\u201d George purred. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p> <p>The records came and went \u2013 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want and Everybody Hurts \u2013 but the inquisition never rose above the merely anodyne, despite, if you included Vince Cable, who had come on early as a warm-up act to say that May had never shown the slightest interest of even knowing the country had an industrial strategy when she was home secretary, dragging on for the best part of two and a half hours.</p> <p>We learned that even if you didn\u2019t have an industrial strategy you still had an industrial strategy \u2013 as your strategy was then not to have one. We learned it would be a good idea if the government made a decision on airport expansion as soon as possible. Though that might just have been an excuse for George to play Leaving on a Jet Plane.</p> <p>The one thing we didn\u2019t get to learn was why this committee hearing was taking place. Other than to let three former Westminster big beasts reprise some of their greatest hits. No one cared about the occasional wrong notes or that the voices could no longer hit the high notes; it was just enough for them all to be there. The closest we got to anything of more than archival interest was when they were asked for their thoughts on Britain remaining part of the single market after leaving the EU.</p> <p>What did they make of the three ministers May had put in charge of Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiations, asked the Conservative MP Richard Fuller. \u201cThey are a brilliant set of appointments,\u201d said Heseltine, his voice laced with acid, \u201cbecause they can come up with the answers that escape me.\u201d George was slightly more diplomatic. Though not much. \u201cThe country didn\u2019t vote to make itself poorer,\u201d he said, checking his phone to see if the pound had lost yet another cent against the dollar in the past quarter of an hour. Not being chancellor had its upsides. \u201cWe can\u2019t improve our trade with Australia at the expense of that with the EU.\u201d After all, there\u2019s only so much Foster\u2019s anyone can drink.</p> <p>The longer the session went on, the sleepier everyone became. A band reunion can go on for too long. Wright tried to wake people up by wondering why the north-east had been left out of the northern powerhouse, but George had that one covered. \u201cJust today it\u2019s been announced that Newcastle is to host the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/11/newcastle-and-gateshead-to-host-great-exhibition-of-the-north\">Great Exhibition of the North</a>.\u201d Great. The north-east is going to become a theme park.</p> <p>\u201cYou get to take a copy of the Bible and David Laws\u2019s Coalition: the Inside Story to your desert island,\u201d said Wright. \u201cWhat other book would you like to take?\u201d Both chose May\u2019s as-yet unwritten My Brexit Hell.</p>",

For more information on voter-registration deadlines, <a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/voter-registration-deadlines\">check here</a>.<br></p> <p><strong>What determines turnout?</strong></p> <p>Battleground states such as Florida and Ohio tend to see higher-than-average voter turnout because campaigns invest more time and money there, holding rallies and town halls, buying TV ads, and running extensive voter-mobilization drives.<br></p> <p>McDonald, who runs the United States Election Project, an online repository of election statistics and laws, said that residents of battleground states may also feel their votes matter more, which encourages them to turn out.<br></p> <p>The character of a state\u2019s electorate also influences participation; age, income, and especially education are good predictors of voter turnout. In short, \u201colder people tend to vote more, wealthier people tend to vote more, and more highly educated people tend to vote more\u201d, McDonald said.</p> <p>Such demographics help explain why some northern and midwestern states, which have higher educational attainment overall, have consistently high turnout rates. But McDonald noted that many of those states also have political climates that encourage voting in other ways.</p> <p>As McDonald put it: \u201cTurnout is higher in states that make it easier for people to vote than in states that make it harder for people to vote\u201d \u2013 which means that laws matter.</p> <p>Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have sought to make it easier for people to vote through <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx\">same-day voter registration</a>. Three more states \u2013 California, Hawaii and Vermont \u2013 have passed similar laws that are not yet in effect.</p> <p>Same-day registration helps boost voter participation by allowing residents to both register and vote on the day of the election. Most other states require voters to register at least seven to 30 days ahead of time in order to vote on election day. Same-day registration increases voter turnout by 5%-7% \u201cwithout any reported increase in voter fraud\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/election-day-registration\">according to</a> the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>In 2012, four out of the five states with highest turnout allowed same-day registration. Minnesota \u2013 which has topped the list of states with highest voter turnout in every presidential election but one since 1980 \u2013 has had same-day registration since 1974. (The state also has a <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-state-state-college-attainment-numbers-show-progress-toward-2020-goal\">highly educated</a> and <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/median-annual-income/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Median%20Annual%20Household%20Income%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">relatively wealthy</a> population.)</p> <p>More recently, several states have begun <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/automatic-voter-registration\">automatically registering residents to vote </a>when they interact with the department of motor vehicles, unless they specifically opt out.<br></p> <p>States that make it harder for people to vote \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/north-carolina-voter-id-law-struck-down\">or tried to</a> \u2013 include Mississippi and North Carolina, which enacted tough voter ID requirements and <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/expand-early-voting\">curtailed early voting</a>.</p> <p>Only a few studies have examined the effects of the most recent and onerous wave of voter restrictions, which began to gain momentum after the 2010 election. But such studies have found evidence that identification requirements suppress turnout.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-634\">analysis from the Government Accountability Office</a>, which examined the effects of new voter ID laws in Kentucky and Tennessee between 2008 and 2012, found that such requirements decreased voter participation by 2%-3%. Another <a href=\"http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/voterIDhajnaletal.pdf\">study, published in February by a team from the University of California, San Diego</a>, found larger effects.

  "<p>If there\u2019s anything we have learned this year, it\u2019s that somehow, some way, the race for the presidency and the Cleveland Browns can always get worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/10/nfl-antonio-brown-muhammad-ali-shoes\">NFL threatened to eject Antonio Brown for wearing Muhammad Ali shoes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Each time we think things can\u2019t possibly go lower, that surely Donald Trump couldn\u2019t do anything grosser than criticizing PoWs, that even the Browns couldn\u2019t suffer misfortune beyond losing their new starting quarterback to injury during the season opener, we are quickly reminded that this is no regular campaign and that the Browns are no regular losing football team.</p> <p>A season ago the Browns started a somewhat promising 2-3 before dropping to 2-10 and then finishing 3-13, one of those losses coming in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl champion Broncos, another coming to the hated Baltimore Ravens on a kick-six at the buzzer, and the 13th and final defeat coming via blowout to the even more hated Steelers that allowed Pittsburgh to slip into the playoffs. They lost Josh McCown to injury, they lost complete control of 2014 first-round pick Johnny Manziel and they fired yet another head coach. For most franchises, a season like that is rock bottom. It\u2019s a chance to reset, take a deep breath and step into the future with hope, knowing that things can only get better because they can\u2019t possibly get worse.</p> <p>But it always gets worse for the Browns. This week alone was a football tragedy. The Browns started rookie quarterback Cody Kessler for the third time due to Robert Griffin III and McCown being in slings, but he got knocked out with chest and rib injuries in the first half. That forced the team\u2019s best current receiver, Terrelle Pryor \u2013 a former quarterback for Ohio State and the Oakland Raiders \u2013 to play a few snaps under center before giving way to Charlie Whitehurst, an NFL journeyman signed less than three weeks ago \u2026 who was subsequently knocked out of the game with a leg injury in the fourth quarter, turning the quarterback position back over to a receiver. No, the football gods did not even spare Clipboard Jesus.</p> <p>That entire debacle was set against the beginning of Tom Brady\u2019s return/vengeance tour. Roger Goodell slapped Brady with a four-game suspension and then let the league scheduler hand the bloodthirsty Patriots a match-up against football\u2019s worst team for the comeback game? What kind of punishment is that, other than undeserved punishment for poor Cleveland? It\u2019s one thing if the universe is out to get the Browns, but they really don\u2019t need the league office ganging up on them, too. Per the eternal Browns misery script, Brady proceeded to throw for 406 yards and three touchdowns and FirstEnergy Stadium was filled with delighted cheers from thousands of Patriots fans who had scooped up tickets to witness the assured destruction.</p> <p>At least Barkevious Mingo and Jabaal Sheard didn\u2019t have huge days for the Patriots. They\u2019re both former Browns draft picks who are now living the good life in New England where they\u2019re being utilized by Bill Belichick, the former Browns head coach who has four Super Bowl titles in 17 seasons with the Patriots (whereas the Browns have just two wins in their last 17 games). The highlight of the game for Browns fans was probably when the local CBS feed cut out halfway through the broadcast and saved them from a few minutes of the Whitehurst era.</p> <p>Again, all that occurred in week five in a three-hour period. A beautiful, crisp, sunny October Sunday afternoon on the shores of Lake Erie where everything happened to go wrong, just as it always does. It was just as bad in week four when the Browns blew a fourth-quarter lead to Washington at home \u2013 giving Cleveland three consecutive half-time leads squandered. This defeat was highlighted by a Duke Johnson fumble/non-fumble that gave the ball away with nine minutes remaining and Cleveland driving ... even though Johnson clearly was in control of the ball as the ref signaled turnover. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCkI_KSoM0c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FCkI_KSoM0c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Cleveland\u2019s week three defeat to the woeful Miami Dolphins was almost entirely the fault of kicker Cody Parkey. After regular kicker Patrick Murray suffered a foot injury two days before the game, the Browns signed Parkey \u2013 who hadn\u2019t kicked in the NFL since last September with the Eagles \u2013 sight unseen. They should have seen. Parkey missed three of his six field goal attempts, including a 46-yard try that sent the game into overtime where the Browns would, of course, lose. What else? Oh, right. Three days before the loss, the Browns announced that first round pick Corey Coleman, who had two touchdowns and 104 receiving yards in week two, would miss up to six weeks with a broken hand. And then four days after the game, fellow receiver Josh Gordon announced he was checking himself back into rehab. Week three: fin.</p> <p>Week two delivered a five-point home loss the the Ravens after Cleveland was leading 20-0 in the first half. The Browns were driving in the final minute and picked up a first down at the 10-yard line on a great catch by Pryor with 21 seconds left. But the ball got sent back to the 30 due to offsetting penalties \u2013 Cleveland\u2019s coming on \u201ctaunting\u201d by Pryor. See if you can uncover the egregious taunt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DownWithDamon/status/777601529670832128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Taunting&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CLEvsBAL?src=hash\">#CLEvsBAL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/v0I3ON0ll6\">pic.twitter.com/v0I3ON0ll6</a></p>&mdash; Down With Damon (@DownWithDamon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DownWithDamon/status/777601529670832128\">September 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Regardless, the game essentially ended on the very next play when McCown, now desperate to pick up the yardage that was taken away, chucked an interception. But at least the bitter taste of that week two defeat helped wash away some of the awful taste of Cleveland\u2019s 2016 debut. That saw Griffin go to injured reserve and the Browns get torched by No2 overall pick Carson Wentz. You\u2019ll recall that Cleveland had the No2 spot but decided Wentz wasn\u2019t the quarterback for them, and traded the pick to Philadelphia. Wentz now has a 103.5 quarterback rating and is on pace to throw for 4,028 yards, 28 touchdowns and just four interceptions in his rookie season. We all should have seen it coming since the Browns passed him over. </p> <p>And so Cleveland is 0-5, the only winless team in the NFL, each loss special and unique in its own unbelievable (yet completely believable) way. They\u2019ve used five quarterbacks in five games and five bucks says they\u2019ll use five more. It always gets worse.</p> <p>While those who still back Donald Trump deserve a crushing defeat on 8 November, Browns fans don\u2019t deserve this. Sure, they have LeBron and the Cavaliers, and the Indians are on to the American League Championship series. But the success of those two teams has only seemed to make things worse for the Browns \u2013 as thought the city of Cleveland is only allowed so much sports joy, and with basketball and baseball at the highest of highs, the Browns must be pushed to the lowest of lows, lower than they\u2019ve ever been.</p> <p>We are all witnesses to what may be the worst season in Browns history. That may be hard to believe, but this is Believeland. For good or bad.</p>",
  "<h2>DOWN BY THE DANUBE</h2> <p>It seems only a few weeks ago that the Fiver\u2019s Scottish cousin, Shortbread McFiver, was effin\u2019 and blindin\u2019 with excitement at the news that his country would return to playing international football after a sabbatical of nearly two decades. And what a return it was, as Scotland shrugged off years of inactivity to smash five goals past a Malta side that would go on to frustrate England fans at Wembley almost as much as England regularly do. But good vibes were scattered when Lithuania rocked up at Hampden Park on Saturday and helped themselves to a 1-1 draw that left Scotland fans hitting the boos. So it is that Scotland need a big result in Slovakia tonight to keep themselves in contention to qualify from Group Z and possibly even to keep Wee Gordon Strachan in a job.</p> <p>The omens are mixed. On the dark side, the last time Wee Gordon was in the Slovakian capital he endured the worst night of his managerial career as his Queen\u2019s Celtic team were humiliated 5-0 by a polytechnic college, Artmedia Bratislava, and the disastrous nature of that defeat was symbolised by the fact the manager\u2019s watch stopped working (\u201cat five past David Marshall\u201d, as the Daily Record later quipped). On the bright side, today\u2019s game is not in Bratislava \u2013 it\u2019s a little further north, in Trnava \u2013 and, more to the point, Slovakia have suffered a worse start. They\u2019re bottom with no points and no goals after two matches. So the stage is set for an evening of heroism, drama and/or blanket farce.</p> <p>Wee Gordon has some interesting questions to ponder before the game \u2013 should Leigh Griffiths start up front? How about the gifted but raw Oliver Burke? And what way will Slovakia\u2019s captain, Martin Skrtel, find to get booked while missing the match through suspension? - but one thing on which Wee Gordon can definitely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/darren-fletcher-backs-gordon-strachan-scotland-slovakia\">count is the staunch support of his own captain, Darren Fletcher</a>, even though he will not know until after a late fitness test whether or not Fletcher can play. Fletcher, you see, says that Scotland\u2019s players have been so buoyed by the manager\u2019s willingness to refrain from criticising them in public for bad performances that they are going to try really hard to stop performing badly. \u201cIt definitely makes us more determined,\u201d thundered Fletcher. \u201cThe players are delighted with the manager. We are desperate to play for him and desperate to do well for him.\u201d So the question that remains for Scots only a few hours after Rod Stewart dropped into Buckingham Palace to pick up a knighthood is: is tonight the night it\u2019s gonna be all right for Wee Gordon? </p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Follow Slovenia 0-1 England with Jacob Steinberg and Slovakia 0-0 Scotland as well as other World Cup qualifying updates with Paul Doyle at 7.45pm UK time. </a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p> \u201cI\u2019m in the dressing room with the under-23s but I don\u2019t have a locker.

  "<p>Neil Heslop, the new chief executive of Leonard Cheshire Disability, welcomes the government announcement earlier this month that people with the most severe, lifetime conditions will no longer be assessed again and again to qualify for their out-of-work benefits. This was followed <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/151336048820/green-speech-to-conservative-party-conference\" title=\"\">by Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary,</a> promising to \u201cwork tirelessly to give disabled people better life chances\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/disability-and-illness-test-u-turn-is-a-small-victory-but-the-fight-goes-on\">Disability and illness test U-turn is a small victory but the fight goes on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen Green spoke about the philosophy of wanting to offer work to those who can \u2026 and care for those who can\u2019t, that feels like a more nuanced perspective than we\u2019ve seen previously,\u201d says Heslop, who took up his role at the second biggest disability charity last month. The government is \u201cgenuinely trying to set out an agenda about how to close the employment gap,\u201d he adds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/publications/disability-employment-gap/\" title=\"\">Less than half</a> of the 5.5 million working-age people in the UK with work-limiting health conditions or disabilities have jobs. And only 8% of sick and disabled people without a job move into work in any one year. Finding work for 1.2 million of them by 2020 is a \u201cbold\u201d target, Heslop concedes, but the right one. \u201cIt is absolutely imperative that the May government prioritises action to make this a reality and does not lose focus.\u201d</p> <p>Heslop, who lost his sight at 20, due to a degenerative condition, had a 20-year career in the telecoms industry, holding senior roles in North America and the UK, and co-founded <a href=\"http://www.blindinbusiness.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Blind in Business</a>, a charity that helps people who are blind or partially sighted into work. Before joining Leonard Cheshire, led RNIB Solutions, the sight-loss charity\u2019s consultancy service, advising firms on making goods and services more accessible.</p> <p>He says he feels \u201cpassionately\u201d about improving the job prospects of disabled people. Yet he is the only disabled leader of Leonard Cheshire in more than 25 years, and the charity\u2019s management systems don\u2019t accurately measure the number of disabled employees. (A Leonard Cheshire spokesman later tells me it is certainly \u201cnot less than 312\u201d out of more than 7,000 staff and promises that the employment of disabled people will be a \u201ckey\u201d target for Leonard Cheshire). \u201cI believe that our representation of disabled people isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d says Heslop.</p> <p>Its lack of disabled staff, coupled with a failure to involve service users in decision-making and to help them live more independently, has led to run-ins with <a href=\"https://www.kingqueen.org.uk/?s=leonard+cheshire&amp;searchsubmit=\" title=\"\">disability rights activists</a> who accuse the charity of institutionalising disabled people in crumbling mansions.</p> <p>Leonard Cheshire provides a wide range of services, from 107 residential care homes to 24 supported living centres, various day services and employment and skills support across the UK for 7,000 people. So how does Heslop respond to the criticism?</p> <p>\u201cWe need to modernise our organisation in a way and at a speed that takes the people who work for us and the people who use our services with us,\u201d he replies.</p> <p>It has certainly been a turbulent time for the charity. Both the former and acting chief executive left earlier this year, while the new chair, Sally Davis, has only been in post one year. A strategic review of all the charity\u2019s activities, to report in six months\u2019 time, will \u201censure the voice of disabled people is at the heart of all decision-making,\u201d says Heslop. He also wants to \u201crebalance\u201d the charity\u2019s social care activities. \u201cIn the UK we need to increase the proportion of our care services that are delivered through supported living activity, while remaining fully committed to high-quality care for those with the most complex care needs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He is looking at the viability of its 20 poorest-performing homes. \u201cIn such a diverse portfolio, you inevitably have to look at the long-term sustainability in terms of our ability to deliver quality of service,\u201d says Heslop. Yet on the issue of home closures, he stresses \u201cno major closure programme is envisaged\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If  the government is doing bad things to the people that we are here to serve, we will be loud and clear about that</p> <footer> <cite>Neil Heslop</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any closures would have to be handled sensitively. The charity was heavily criticised earlier this year by Rochdale council and local health bosses for showing \u201c<a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uncaring-charity-slammed-over-closure-10899106\" title=\"\">uncaring disregard</a>\u201d over the way it closed a local care home with just eight week\u2019s notice. He is also keen to improve the working conditions of employees, many of whom are not paid the \u00a38.25 <a href=\"http://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-living-wage\" title=\"\">living wage</a>, as opposed to the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d. \u201cPhilosophically and morally, and from the point of view of leading a large complex organisation with some of the poorest paid workers in society, I\u2019m absolutely committed to ensuring that the way we treat and reward all of our people is consistent with them having a financially appropriate return from us,\u201d he says.We want to be famous for how we treat and look after both our staff and volunteers, and people we work for [disabled people].. There are parts of what we do that are doing a fantastic job, but equally in my short time here, I\u2019ve seen that we have a great deal of work to do to live up to that aspiration,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Leonard Cheshire may also be more vocal about its role and legacy, as the charity celebrates the centenary of its founder\u2019s birth next year. With around 90% of Leonard Cheshire\u2019s \u00a3160m budget coming from government grants (the remainder from fundraising), Heslop is hopeful that good relations will continue, but vows to speak out if need be. \u201cIf we think that the government is doing bad things to the people that we are here to serve, then we will be very loud and clear about that,\u201d he says.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age</strong> 51.</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married, 18- and 20-year-old daughters.</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> Beaconsfield, Bucks</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Clark\u2019s College, Guildford; RNIB New College, Worcester; University of Newcastle, law degree; Cranfield School of Management, MBA.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> 2016-present: Chief executive, Leonard Cheshire Disability; 2013-16: managing director, Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) Solutions; 2012-13: interim CEO, KFX Technology; 2011-12: interim chief operating officer, JJB Sports plc; 2009-11: managing director, Kontrol Freax Ltd; 2004-08: divisional CEO, Cincinnati Bell Inc; 1996-2004: senior leadership roles including general manager retail operations, and head of strategy, Telefonica 02 (formerly BT Cellnet); 1994-96: co-founder/director; ChinaMedica Ltd; 1989-94: joined as a graduate trainee and had various roles including business planning manager for global access products, Nortel Networks.</p> <p><strong>Public life</strong> Co-founder/trustee, Blind in Business, OBE for services to BT and charity.</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> Sport, literature, education and employment.</p>",

Settlement clubs are due to be discussed at a Fifa meeting on Thursday and Friday.</p> <p>Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, said earlier this month that finding a solution to the dispute over Israeli clubs playing inside the West Bank was a priority before next year\u2019s football world congress.</p> <p>Six Israeli football clubs based in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank play in the lower Israeli leagues but on Palestinian land without the permission of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA). </p> <p>In his letter to Sexwale, Lemke said: \u201cIn light of the ongoing dispute between the IFA, PFA and Fifa on Israeli football clubs operating on the occupied Palestinian territories, and acknowledging the relevant United Nations resolutions, I condemn any actions that breach these regulations.\u201d</p> <p>Adding that he hoped the issue could be resolved through negotiation, Lemke said: \u201cThe United Nations security council has determined that Israeli settlements in occupied territory have no legal validity, as they are in breach of international law, and that such practices are an obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cThe UN recognises sport as a fundamental human right and, as such, it advocates and facilitates the realisation of such a right by everyone. Without undermining the right of Israeli and Palestinian people to sport, all teams playing in recognised Fifa competitions should abide by the laws of the game. </p> <p>\u201cI therefore urge a resolution of any disputes in line with the United Nations security council resolutions and Fifa statutes within a reasonable timeframe.\u201d</p> <p>Sexwale\u2019s committee was set up after the collapse of a Palestinian initiative at last year\u2019s Fifa congress to have Israeli football suspended over a variety of issues. </p> <p>The Israeli Football Association has been resisting efforts to have settlement clubs relocated to Israel or banned from competition. </p> <p>Last month Shlomi Barzel, an IFA official, told the Guardian he believed the UN should ultimately rule on the issue. \u201cIt is very simple \u2013 this has nothing to do with Fifa,\u201d Barzel said. \u201cThis is something the UN should decide.

It said financial documents it had reviewed showed the IFA was engaging in business activity that supported the settlements and that \u201cthe clubs provide services to Israelis but do not and cannot provide them to Palestinians, who are not allowed to enter settlements except as labourers bearing special permits\u201d.</p> <p>More than 150,000 people have signed an online petition calling on Fifa to act, and <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/eu-parliamentarians-urge-fifa-to-ban-israeli-settlement-clubs/\">dozens of European MEPs have signed an open letter</a> on the subject.</p> <p></p> <p>The IFA and the clubs involved say a ban on playing in settlements would punish children involved with the clubs, as well as the clubs themselves, and that Fifa has no authority to define what is Israeli territory.</p>",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/bradley-wiggins-world-anti-doping-agency-hackers-russian-leak\">revelations of Bradley Wiggins\u2019s TUEs</a> have quite rightly given rise to ethical discussions about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/bradley-wiggins-doping-rules-fancy-bears-tues\">use of legal substances to maximise performance</a>, but once again the sport is under the spotlight for the wrong reasons. Step forward Annemiek van Vleuten, who could lift everyone\u2019s spirits with a fairytale win in today\u2019s women\u2019s individual time trial.</p> <p>The dutch rider was on course for Olympic gold in the road race in Rio eight weeks ago when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race\">horrific crash on the final descent</a> shattered her hopes of victory and almost cost her her life. Van Vleuten was rushed to hospital and spent time in intensive care, having suffered severe concussion and three cracks in her spine. A long period of recovery may have been expected, but Van Vleuten won the Lotto Belgium Tour a month after Rio, and now has her sights firmly set on Doha. The flat course in the road race means her best shot of gold may come in today\u2019s time trial, the event in which she reclaimed her national title this year, but the competition is fierce. </p> <p>Kristin Armstrong, who claimed the time trial gold in Rio at the age of 43, and the reigning world champion Linda Villumsen are not here, but Anna van der Breggen of the Netherlands is in ominous form. Van der Bruggen profited from Van Vleuten\u2019s fall to win road race gold in Rio, and was second behind Villumsen in this event last year in Virginia. A third dutchwoman, Ellen van Dijk, also has a point to prove. Katrin Garfoot, the current Australian and Oceania time trial champion, is dangerous, while the Germans, Lisa Brennauer and Trixi Worrack, and Russia\u2019s Olga Zabelinskaya have some pedigree. Great Britain\u2019s Hayley Simmonds has been breaking all manner of national records recently.

  "<h2><strong>What to do about Syria</strong><br></h2> <p>The agony in Syria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/syria-obama-us-president-putin-russia\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a> is more complicated than comments on recent US-Russian negotiations suggest. The Obama government has also had to consider the conflicting interests of Turkey, the Kurds, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states and Israel.</p> <p>Turkey, a Nato ally, views the Kurds as a greater threat than the Assad government in Syria. The failed coup in Turkey has only exacerbated President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s crackdown on Kurds in Turkey. The US has agreed with Turkey to give military support to Syrian Kurds as long as they stayed east of the Euphrates.</p> <p>The US is also giving air and ground support to the Iraqi Peshmerga, Iraqi troops and Shia militias, in the buildup to retake Mosul from Sunni Islamic State. At the same time, this presents a threat to the unstable Mosul dam, which, if breached, could kill millions downstream.</p> <p>The successful US nuclear negotiations with Iran have led the US to reluctantly support the Saudi government in its war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Shia Iran is waging a proxy war against a range of Sunni opponents, including Isis and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly the Nusra Front), using the Alawite Assad regime and the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah, which Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard have armed.</p> <p>In view of these shifting alliances, it has been prudent of President Obama to consult carefully with his military and diplomatic staff before committing to further Middle East adventures. It is easy to forget that he was elected in 2008 by voters weary of protracted foreign wars.<br><strong>Linda Agerbak</strong><br>Arlington, Massachusetts, US</p> <p>\u2022 Almost every week Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de makes me nostalgic for the good old days of the cold war. Those were the days: one side 100% good, the other 100% bad. Just replace \u201cCommunist\u201d with \u201cRussian\u201d and her columns take me back to the sweet days of youth.</p> <p>Naturally, a black-and-white view of the world requires a short memory. So the fragmentation of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines advanced democracy and was good; the same process in Ukraine is a Russian conspiracy and is bad.</p> <p>Her latest war-horse is Syria \u2013 a tragedy, for which all sides share responsibility. Nougayr\u00e8de\u2019s proposed solution? A \u201ctougher approach to Russia\u2019s intervention\u201d. How? As an example, she quotes approvingly the \u201ctargeted strikes on Serbian forces\u201d that in her opinion helped solve the Yugoslavian crisis. But there are no Russian ground forces in Syria, and if I remember correctly Nato bombed Belgrade as well. So is she saying that the west should bomb Moscow? If only the US president\u2019s \u201creluctance to do more\u201d could be overcome.<br><strong>Giorgio Ranalli</strong><br>Ottawa, Ontario, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Please take our toys away </strong><br></h2> <p>George Monbiot is right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/roads-car-use-health-driving\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a> \u2013 the solution to carmageddon is fewer, and electric, cars. But there\u2019s a huge problem here. Electric vehicles will be major indirect polluters and contributors to climate change until the energy they use comes from renewable resources.</p> <p>Most electricity and nearly all hydrogen still come from fossil fuels. A battery-electric vehicle doesn\u2019t avoid the pollution from electricity production \u2013 it is released at the power station rather than on the motorway. Even worse, more battery-electric cars will increase the demand for electricity from a grid that already can\u2019t cope. Likewise, a fuel-cell-electric vehicle running on hydrogen only produces water, but the associated pollution is released at the hydrogen production plant.</p> <p>Solutions that ignore the connected nature of the problem never work. Yes, we must have electric vehicles, but hand-in-hand we must have sustainably produced electricity and hydrogen to power them.<br><strong>Evan Gray</strong><br>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/extinction-let-others-kill-albatross-gorilla-whale-shark-conumerism\" title=\"\">(23 September)</a> has written starkly about to what all the species of the world are heir: the age of the Earth inhabited by humankind. By focusing on contemporary consumerism in which we all are involved to one degree or another, his words remind of how civilisations are dredging everything and everywhere: lands, forests, lakes and rivers, the sky. Even our human species is affected by the degradation of what he calls \u201cuncontrolled consumerism\u201d.</p> <p>With respect to all animals, fishes, birds, plants and the smaller living things of the Earth: so much has sickened. Disappeared. Died. While so many do work on behalf of other species, we humans do not seem to have the nerve for doing what is required to show mercy toward them.</p> <p>We do not grieve enough. Mourn. And as Monbiot suggests, let each of us learn how to better live lightly.<br><strong>Vivian Darroch-Lozowski</strong><br>Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 Gutting a chicken is not enough: people who eat chicken should be prepared to kill it too. Monbiot also forgot to mention bees: some farmers are guilty, even if they don\u2019t kill bees directly; they spray their crops with chemicals that do the job nicely. Don\u2019t our poor bees have enough on their plate, being gobbled up by Asian hornets, without those who manage to get through being exterminated by lethal chemicals? No bees, no pollination. No pollination, no crops.<br><strong>Lea Yauner</strong><br>Pessac, France</p> <p>\u2022 I read both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/21/farewell-to-ice-peter-wadhams-review-climate-change\" title=\"\">Horatio Clare</a>\u2019s review of Peter Wadham\u2019s A Farewell to Ice and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/oceans-heating-big-problem-blue-planet-iucn-report\" title=\"\">Bill McKibben</a>\u2019s opinion on ocean warming (16 September) and both these pieces struck a chord with me. Indeed, if methane from melting permafrost is released then we really will have hit the point of no return and the consequences could be truly apocalyptic.</p> <p>In both pieces the use of renewables is discussed but only Clare mentions \u201cvoluntary\u201d steps such as giving up SUVs and budget flights. This is not unusual as many reports emphasise cosy, visible measures (eg wind and solar) but soft-pedal on any thoughts that our consumer excesses should be reined in.</p> <p>Surely we have gone beyond this and we need to give governments a mandate to \u201ctake our toys away\u201d with strong legislation against individual, private transport and cheap air-travel; against excessive trucking, excessive packaging and temperature-controlled retail palaces; and against market structures that encourage indulgent consumption.</p> <p>Only when we have recognised these connections and taken appropriate action do we stand any chance of preventing the coming \u201cmeltdown\u201d.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br>Cologne, Germany</p> <h2><strong>The problem with anger</strong><br></h2> <p>Oliver Burkeman\u2019s analysis of anger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/09/anger-does-it-need-managing\" title=\"\">(30&#xa0;September)</a> fails to draw a crucial distinction: the difference between the feeling of anger, or any of our feelings, and the freely chosen expression of the feeling.</p> <p>Feeling, experiencing and accepting our anger is an essential prerequisite to a free decision about what, if anything, to do with it. In the case of genuine self-defence, physical retaliation may be the correct response. A civil, verbal assertion of our disagreement may be a proper response to an abusive attack. Screaming and yelling and retaliation will never be appropriate.</p> <p>If we do not first recognise and accept our feelings, including anger, but sweep them under the carpet, they will inevitably break out in ways that are inappropriate.<br><strong>Greg McCarry</strong><br>Sydney, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Oliver Burkeman\u2019s thought-provoking column on the downside of anger reminded me of a quote by Mark Twain, which I saved as a reminder that \u201cAnger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.\u201d<br><strong>Richard Orlando</strong><br>Westmount, Quebec, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Decline of hitchhiking</strong></h2> <p>As someone who hitchhiked through New Zealand in the 60s with a friend, I mourn the decline of hitchhiking as does Anne Perkins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/death-of-hitchhiking-modern-tragedy-frenchman-new-zealand\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a>. Then, the ease and friendliness of the experience increased the more rural the countryside became. Drivers were interested in who we were and why we were travelling; several invited us to their homes, some became friends. I experienced similar treatment of the \u201cstranger\u201d riding horses through New South Wales in the 70s. Perhaps social media satiates the desire for human contact from afar? The test would be whether digitally savvy Indian villagers still offer yoghurt and a chat. If so it has more to do with being the owners of your land and having a code of hospitality.

Taken at face value, she is a less-than-mediocre rapper whose subpar performances have nevertheless lobbed her into the limelight.

In the case of the former, I\u2019d say that we\u2019ll know when we\u2019ve reached true equality when black and minority ethnic people can be successful on less-than-middling talent and effort.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Honey G\u2019s tinfoil gold tracksuit, shades and florid hand gestures betray what the whole act is about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If Honey isn\u2019t just another hapless X Factor stock character, the novelty act retained as watercooler fodder because \u201cshe\u2019s so terrible but people keep voting her in!\u201d, then this is about a significant section of the viewing public enjoying playing a role in demeaning black culture.

But then what is audible in his work is humility and respect for the music.

The parody continued, emphasising her level of wealth, not by showing us her Bugatti or Lamborghini, but instead her \u201ctwo kettles \u2026 and an electric bin\u201d. I now, at least, have a relatable example of bathos used for comedic effect to share with my literature students. Honey G or the show\u2019s producers may well want to ridicule the ostentatious show of wealth many rappers who graced <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv-cribs\">MTV Cribs</a> displayed, but perhaps they might think twice if they had <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jayz/99problems.html\">walked in their shoes as black men from the American underclass</a>.</p> <p>Last week Donald Trump defended his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">lewd comments</a>\u201d (what others not busy mincing their words call sexual harassment) by playing the \u201cit\u2019s only bantz\u201d card. \u201cJust a little bit of harmless fun\u201d is the go-to of those crossing a line predicated on the teller not being the butt of their own jokes.</p> <p>Honey G\u2019s tinfoil gold tracksuit, shades and florid hand gestures betray what the whole act is about: a caricature of blackness as stupid and illicit.

But what does this mean? And what evidence is there that we are, in fact, living in The Matrix?</p> <p>One popular argument for the simulation hypothesis, outside of acid trips, came from Oxford University\u2019s Nick Bostrom in 2003 (although the idea dates back as far as the 17th-century philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes). In a <a href=\"http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.pdf\">paper</a> titled \u201cAre You Living In a Simulation?\u201d, Bostrom suggested that members of an advanced \u201cposthuman\u201d civilization with vast computing power might choose to run simulations of their ancestors in the universe.</p> <p>This argument is extrapolated from observing current trends in technology, including the rise of virtual reality and efforts to map the human brain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Quite frankly if we are not living in a simulation it is an extraordinarily unlikely circumstance</p> <footer> <cite>Rich Terrile, scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If we believe that there is nothing supernatural about what causes consciousness and it\u2019s merely the product of a very complex architecture in the human brain, we\u2019ll be able to reproduce it. \u201cSoon there will be nothing technical standing in the way to making machines that have their own consciousness,\u201d said Rich Terrile, a scientist at Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p> <p>At the same time, videogames are becoming more and more sophisticated and in the future we\u2019ll be able to have simulations of conscious entities inside them.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVIlT-4xyrw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XVIlT-4xyrw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Elon Musk on simulation: \u2018The odds we\u2019re in base reality is one in billions\u2019 \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cForty years ago we had Pong \u2013 two rectangles and a dot.

As Terrile puts it: \u201cIf in the future there are more digital people living in simulated environments than there are today, then what is to say we are not part of that already?\u201d</p> <p>Reasons to believe that the universe is a simulation include the fact that it behaves mathematically and is broken up into pieces (subatomic particles) like a pixelated video game. \u201cEven things that we think of as continuous \u2013 time, energy, space, volume \u2013 all have a finite limit to their size. If that\u2019s the case, then our universe is both computable and finite. Those properties allow the universe to be simulated,\u201d Terrile said.</p> <p>\u201cQuite frankly, if we are not living in a simulation, it is an extraordinarily unlikely circumstance,\u201d he added.</p> <p>So who has created this simulation? \u201cOur future selves,\u201d said Terrile.</p> <p>Not everyone is so convinced by the hypothesis. \u201cIs it logically possible that we are in a simulation? Yes. Are we probably in a simulation? I would say no,\u201d said Max Tegmark, a professor of physics at MIT.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to make the argument in the first place, we need to know what the fundamental laws of physics are where the simulations are being made.

The simulation hypothesis also accounts for peculiarities in quantum mechanics, particularly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/27/physics-philosophy-quantum-relativity-einstein\">measurement problem</a>, whereby things only become defined when they are observed.</p> <p>\u201cFor decades it\u2019s been a problem.

On one hand, neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers can check whether it\u2019s possible to simulate the human mind.

As a Latin woman in science, I am interested in understanding the how these issues operate, how they manifest themselves on women of colour, and what the particular issues are in relation to palaeontology, my field of research. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/oct/11/promoting-equality-in-science-what-works-and-what-doesnt\">Promoting equality in science: what works, and what doesn't?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I consider myself lucky to have never faced \u201cserious\u201d gender-related issues, as all my male advisors/mentors/hosts have been amazingly supportive, and never made me feel less (or more) because I am a (Latin) woman. On the contrary, they constantly empowered me and provided me with the tools to build confidence to overcome other minor gender-related issues I have encountered during my career. </p> <p>These minor issues have been a handful of isolated cases of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining\">mansplaining</a> and sexist/racist attitudes from some colleagues. I admit that I find it hard to assess whether these cases have reflected their position on women\u2019s roles, or if they are trying to be funny. As a Colombian, I have learned to live with the common <a href=\"http://colombiareports.com/colombia-the-drug-consumer/\">uninformed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/23/colombia-farc-killed-mothers-justice\">insensitive</a> jokes about cocaine and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nickbrownxo/stereotypes-of-colombia-in-netflix-narcos-b29f7cbb48d3#.clms9vtx5\">Pablo Escobar</a>. I have developed a sort of flexible and understanding attitude towards sexist/racist comments, along the lines of: \u201cwow, that comment kind of hurts, but I know he is a good guy and didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way\u201d. However, I wonder to what extent such comments and attitudes are part of a bigger problem, in which case they shouldn\u2019t be ignored. </p> <p>In my search for a better understanding on how women\u2019s issues operate in my field, I found two explanations for the leaky pipeline, both rooted in complex biological and societal issues. One is that, in general, publication rates are <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534712002753\">lower</a> in women than men. Since number of publication is a metric for employment, this results in a systematic bias against women, because such a metric is not equitable. The second explanation I found is based on <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360\">experimental </a>evidence, and shows a 2:1<a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/04/women-preferred-21-over-men-stem-faculty-positions\">preference</a> in favour of women for tenure track positions, and that women\u2019s underrepresentation is actually a result of fewer women applying for jobs.</p> <p>In terms of the situation for women of colour, I found that <a href=\"http://www.uchastings.edu/news/articles/2015/01/double-jeopardy-report.pdf\">gender bias</a> acts differently depending on a woman\u2019s race. For <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/the-5-biases-pushing-women-out-of-stem\">example</a>, black women are more likely to deal with the constant requirement to prove themselves capable, Asian women have to deal with the stereotype of being the smartest one in the lab, and Latin women are more at risk of being seen as angry when expressing themselves in the workplace. This problem is reflected in the representation of women of colour in science: <a href=\"http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-sciences#footnote11_j1n3mnw\">only 3% of professorships in the US are given to women of colour</a>. Indeed, being a minority within a minority adds another layer of complexity to the gender-bias problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"488b768ad577dc045a4694c671e4cc32e18e03f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/488b768ad577dc045a4694c671e4cc32e18e03f6/0_0_768_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Catalina Pimiento collecting fossil shark teeth in the field.

First, I searched for the top 10 most cited papers in palaeontology journals to assess what percentage were led by women; I looked for reports on women\u2019s representation in professional conferences; finally, I asked all the palaeo-women I know to tell me the biggest gender-related problem they have faced as palaeontologists.</p> <p>Here is what I found.</p> <h2>Papers </h2> <p>Only 10% of the most cited papers in <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/most-cited\">Paleobiology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-paleontology/most-cited\">Journal of Paleontology</a>, <a href=\"http://www.palass.org/publications/palaeontology-journal\">Paleontology</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/palaeogeography-palaeoclimatology-palaeoecology\">Paleo3</a>, were lead by a woman. No women led any of the 10 most cited papers in the <a href=\"http://vertpaleo.org/publications/journal-of-vertebrate-paleontology.aspx\">Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</a>.</p> <h2>Conferences </h2> <p>Reports show that female representation in paleontological associations are <a href=\"http://vertpaleo.org/Society-News/Blog/Old-Bones-SVP-s-Blog/March-2016/Historic-Conference-Quite-Possibly-the-First-All-W.aspx\">close to 50%</a> in terms of students members. However, professional memberships are disproportionally <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/02/13/need-more-paleontological-women/\">low</a> relative to those of men (leaky pipeline in action). With regards to <a href=\"http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/24/11/pdf/i1052-5173-24-11-44.pdf\">meeting</a> participation, even though the number of abstracts with female authors has increased in the last 40 years, women are still underrepresented (more \u201ccold hard numbers\u201d can be found on blog <a href=\"http://thebeardedladyproject.com/about/the-cold-hard-numbers/\">The Bearded Lady Project</a>).</p> <h2>Testimonies </h2> <p>Around 20 palaeo-women (ranging from undergrads to senior professors, from different parts of the world including the US, Europe, Latin America and Africa) responded to my survey with their personal experiences. According to their responses (a diverse selection is presented at the end of this article), it seems like women in palaeontology are often assumed incompetent until proven otherwise. I realise, however, this is an issue not exclusively associated with being a palaeontologist. </p> <p>Fieldwork-related problems were commonly mentioned and range from attempts to police outfits (although this happens in labs/offices as well), to being ignored (or, as <a href=\"https://muellerlaboratory.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/sara-varela/\">one</a> of my friends puts it: having the super-power of being invisible) or patronised by their coworkers. Even when fieldwork-related issues are not exclusively linked to palaeo, the term <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Issues-Palaeobiology-Global-Interviews-Essays/dp/3905923173\">palaeontology</a> is often associated with macho behaviour related to fossil collecting. This perceived need for machismo of course clashes with the <a href=\"http://thebeardedladyproject.com/trailers/\">wrong-headed</a> perception of feminine identities being weaker and not well-suited to the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/526\">harsh conditions</a> associated with fieldwork. </p> <p>As gender bias against women in palaeontology could also occur to a member of any other minority, I asked (admittedly, only a few) male palaeontologists who are members of a minority, whether or not they have ever felt any kind of bias against them. Based on the responses of five Hispanic and three gay palaeontologists, it seems like they don\u2019t feel any particular bias, and if they do, that typically occurs only at the beginning of their careers. However, gay palaeontologists mentioned they feel they need to be particularly careful when doing fieldwork in the remote sites of certain countries (e.g. Latin America or the Middle East). Further, a transgender palaeontologist commented on the restrictions relating to health care provision when looking for jobs. Since mobility is expected in academia, this imposes a major problem for transgender scientists in all disciplines.</p> <p>The reason we should care about the situation of women and minorities in palaeontology is not simply because of social justice. Diversity is <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/diversity-in-stem-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/\">pivotal</a> to the achievement of scientific excellence, and therefore, providing an <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/diversity-in-science-why-it-is-essential-for-excellence/\">adequate working environment</a> to diversify the pool of scientists should be considered a crucial aspect of all research agendas. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2016/oct/11/ada-lovelace-day-celebrate-19th-century-renaissance-woman-agnes-clerke\">On Ada Lovelace Day, let's also celebrate 19th-century renaissance woman Agnes Clerke | Rebekah Higgitt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, everything I have found on my personal quest for a better understanding of the issues women and minorities face in my area of research would have to be systematically assessed to constitute sound scientific evidence. However, the fact is that even though evidence suggests that women are preferred for academic jobs, women are still underrepresented, endure pressure over our appearances and face a battle to have our ideas recognised and be credited to us, not to mention experiencing constant mansplaining.

I always felt bad about it, and I knew that it was because he never thought my work was worth it. When my PhD research got published, he claimed I had scooped him. I think that instead, his sexist approach to meetings attendance proved to him inefficient.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>When I competed for an open postdoc position, a very good friend and colleague who also applied and did not get it, sourly told me that I only got offered the position because I am female. I got very frustrated at the remark, because I know, that by all the common benchmarks, (publications, citation, grants) I am a much better candidate than him.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>While doing my PhD, advisers and collaborators used the following phrases: \u201cyou can share the computer that is in the corridor\u201d; \u201cyou might become a good secretary\u201d; \u201cwhy don\u2019t you accept the technician position? It fits you!\u201d; \u201cbetter you don\u2019t try there, it is a good journal, you know?\u201d; \u201cI am sure that you did not realise it, but the idea you just said is great!\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>On my first time doing fieldwork, I was told to pack light, so I did: one sweatshirt, only the boots I was wearing, and no extras. The temperature went down dramatically in 12 hours and I had to borrow a sweatshirt from each of the three men there (who all had plenty of clothes) to not freeze. We had to wade a river, and I had to do it barefoot and slashed my foot. I had to wear my boots on the way back through and then had to borrow an extra pair of shoes from one of the guys. I learned that I was the only one who was told to pack light, and none of the students had ever been in the field, so it wasn\u2019t because I was a newbie, it was clearly because there\u2019s a female stereotype of overpacking.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>A student [who] worked for me was told that she dressed \u2018like a librarian rather than a scientist\u2019 because she would frequently wear dresses and heels. She was told (often by other women) that she should dress more seriously if she wants to be taken seriously.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I couldn\u2019t count how many times I have made a point in a group discussion that seems to fall flat initially but when repeated later by a male colleague, magically becomes worthy of serious consideration.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>On the first day at a SVP meeting, as I was entering, a man stopped and asked what the convention was for. I told him and he shook his head. He told me that I was the only black person that he had seen attending the convention that didn\u2019t work there. I am used to being the only black woman in the room, but it has never been pointed out before. I was very aware of it for the rest of the conference. I felt proud to be breaking that wall.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>When I apply for jobs I have to seriously consider how friendly the state and city are given the current political climate. Most places in the US explicitly don\u2019t cover transgender related health care, and even if we pay out of pocket most doctors do not know our needs. I\u2019ve not applied to jobs I wanted because they\u2019re in states without health care and they\u2019re in an area where I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable living.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I was asking a senior colleague with a permanent research position advertised at his institution what kind of person they were looking to hire (I was thinking along the lines of areas of research emphasis - e.g. taxonomic group, geological time period, types of research questions addressed etc.) only to be told that they were looking to hire a man because women couldn\u2019t handle fieldwork.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I happened to be two months pregnant during a field season and no colleague was aware of my condition. The fieldwork was successful but upon my return, I developed some medical complications that got me admitted [to hospital]. I got well and life was back to normal again. But after my boss learnt what happened, he always asks whether there [is] anybody pregnant before we depart for a field trip, and even asked me whether he should seek permission from my husband.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>While working on palaeontological mitigation, three different workers asked me out, and while they were all respectful I started to hear scary stories from other female colleagues, so I became more guarded. Even so, one somehow found my phone number and started calling me in the middle of the night and showing up at talks I gave with gifts. One even tried to kiss me when I showed him a fossil I\u2019d found. Because of this, my behaviour changed to the point where I didn\u2019t talk to people, didn\u2019t wear makeup, and stayed in worn, baggy clothes. I remember even considering wearing a fake wedding ring.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>In a developing country, the main challenge I had while pursuing a graduate training and carrier in palaeontology was the lack of successful female role models in my country, who were born and raised in a similar cultural and educational background \u2026 simply, someone who I can easily relate to and look up to.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>The main body of this blog benefited from conversations with many palaeontologists, especially <a href=\"http://www.pim.uzh.ch/institut/mitarbeitende/index.php?show=34\">Marcelo S\u00e1nchez</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uwyo.edu/geolgeophys/faculty/ellen-currano.html\">Ellen Currano</a>, <a href=\"http://paleobiology.si.edu/staff/individuals/behrensmeyer.html\">Kay Behrensmeyer,</a> <a href=\"http://www.pim.uzh.ch/institut/mitarbeitende/index.php?show=996\">Kristof Veitschegger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaleoLagus\">April Carr</a>, although it should be noted that none of the testimonies above should be attributed to them.<br></li> </ul>",

But as the dad dancing of Balls confirmed, it doesn\u2019t always know how to get out. That\u2019s where the skill of the dancer comes in. Politicians pay attention to the words and image (any <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3724040/Cameron-s-OFFICIAL-resignation-honours-reveal-knighthood-spinner-gong-losing-Remain-campaign-chief-peerages-staff.html\">stylists</a> get a New Labour gong?) \u2013 but what about movement? Dance is the ultimate art of subtle non-verbal communication. And the non-verbal counts for more than we tend to allow. Professional dancers know this. Learn how to do exactly the right gesture in the perfect way at the right moment, and your message is subliminally strengthened.

Not as a politician locked in an argument, but as a partner unsure whether to wince or cheer.</p> <p>It helps Labour too, by giving the audience a glimpse of the party doing something other than fighting itself. But that help probably benefits most the wing of the party associated with Balls and Cooper. When Labour\u2019s public face these days is Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell , Balls\u2019s Strictly run is a weekly reminder that Labour used to look very different.</p> <p>Usually New Labour jogs itself back into the memory with an intervention by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/tony-blair-says-his-return-to-british-politics-is-an-open-question\">Tony Blair</a>, whose associations are \u2013 shall we say \u2013 not entirely positive in the public mind. But there is nothing contentious about the resurfacing of Ed Balls. He\u2019s a reminder that, in its heyday, New Labour was very good at presenting its leading figures as normal people, in touch with popular culture and the national mood. Indeed, the fact that Balls is still on the show \u2013 despite regularly scoring the lowest marks from the judges \u2013 is a weekly reminder of New Labour\u2019s greatest selling point: its uncanny knack of winning votes.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lyndseywinship\">Lyndsey Winship</a>: He is the Brexit of the Strictly world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d26ed64c5febe0fb7d349227a15094dfd67a372a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26ed64c5febe0fb7d349227a15094dfd67a372a/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Lyndsey Winship\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dance is a powerful art form.

He went all out on a Mask-themed samba routine this week, green facepaint and banana-hued suit only adding to the rather camp and slightly terrifying effect.

But you could argue the voting public seems to be warming to people who remind them of their own imperfect selves.</p> <p>And there is something strangely compelling about watching Balls dance. This is not someone who has given up the fight. He really goes for it, with maximum gusto. And for all the graceless execution, he\u2019s mostly on top of the steps.

When Barack Obama came out for gay marriage in 2012 the first question on cable television was not \u201cWhat will this mean for gay people?\u201d but \u201cWhat will this mean for Obama\u2019s re-election prospects?\u201d</p> <p>This new, twice-weekly series marks my sixth presidential election as a journalist and, as someone who prefers the road to the couch and ordinary people to TV pundits, I\u2019ve always found it tough to cover the process in a way that both satisfies the reader\u2019s need for a steer on the big picture and my desire to try to shift the framing of our coverage away from the horse race. Readers of course want to know who is likely to be the next president, and what headline issues they should look out for but I\u2019m also interested in what the whole thing can tell us about how American society is evolving \u2013 particularly in an election as extraordinary as this, where a character as bizarre as Donald Trump and another as experienced as Hillary Clinton are candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa1ac6732555681a6745c0560aee4e4cab184868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa1ac6732555681a6745c0560aee4e4cab184868/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge is reporting for a month from Muncie, Indiana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Younge is reporting for a month from Muncie, Indiana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>In 2004, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/02/uselections2004.usa4\">I drove from John Kerry\u2019s hometown</a> in Boston to George W Bush\u2019s former hometown in Midland, Texas, stopping in swing states along the way. I can\u2019t vouch for what it was like to read, but I found it enthralling to write. I found myself at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/23/uselections2004.gayrights\">a drag show</a> in a small town in Missouri, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/09/uselections2004.usa\">breaking bread with Christian fundamentalists</a> who\u2019d lost their son in Iraq in Pennsylvania, and watching the presidential debates with students in Iowa.</p> <p>In 2008 I went to Roanoke, Virginia \u2013 a swing town in a swing state with a sizeable enough African American population that I could gauge the excitement around the potential election of America\u2019s first black president. It was only by sticking around that I discovered that the town had a thriving arts scene that was politically engaged, or that the local courts set aside one whole day a week to deal with people with healthcare debts.</p> <p>This time I\u2019m going to Muncie, Indiana. Ahead of the election, I\u2019ll be publishing articles twice a week \u2013 on Tuesdays and Thursdays \u2013 about what I discover here, who I\u2019ve met, before writing an extended report after the vote. I chose Muncie, population 70,000, as my destination for two reasons. First of all it sits in Delaware County, <a href=\"http://www.delawarecountyelectionday.com/\">which voted for</a> both Donald Trump (53%) and Bernie Sanders (56%). In an election year when Americans appear to be enamored with neither of the nominees \u2013 Clinton has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">a net favourability rating</a> of -11 while <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">Trump\u2019s is -20</a> \u2013 I\u2019m hoping that this trip will give some insight into what Americans appear to find alienating about their political establishment. I also want to ask: what is peculiarly American about this moment? How many similarities are there between here and Brexit Britain, or a France where the Front National is a serious contender for the presidency?</p> <p>Indiana is a reliable Republican state \u2013 though Obama did win it in 2008 \u2013 but Delaware is a swing county. Both <a href=\"http://dcelectionday.com/20082General/Html/DelawareElecSumm.htm\">Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2000&amp;fips=18035&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">George W Bush</a> won it twice. Once <a href=\"http://dcelectionday.com/20122General/Html/DelawareElecSumm.htm\">narrowly</a> and once with <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2004&amp;fips=18035&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">double figures</a>. But I\u2019m also heading to Muncie because it has an iconic place in American social science as the subject of major sociological case study in the 1920s called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aRFcRFNUNQ\">Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/video/2016/oct/11/view-from-middletown-us-election-2016-presidential-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57xny\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2796357\"            data-video-name=\"The view from Middletown: get involved in this US election project \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fcbd19e4b0eaaafbc951fa\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/video/2016/oct/11/view-from-middletown-us-election-2016-presidential-election-video\">The view from Middletown: get involved in this US election project</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The authors, Helen Merrell Lynd and Robert Staughton Lynd, who were married, were seeking a fairly typical American town in which to conduct extensive field research. They described Muncie, which they only ever referred to as Middletown, as \u201ca community as small as thirty-odd thousand ... [in which] the field staff was enabled to concentrate on cultural change ... the interplay of a relatively constant ... American stock and its changing environment.\u201d Having first visited during a period of relative prosperity in the 1920s, they returned a decade later to write Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts during the Depression.</p> <p>I want to hear from people who live in Muncie or nearby in Indiana: we intend that this project should be guided by readers. Let me know if there are issues you think I am missing or questions I\u2019m not asking. Do you know smart people I should talk to? Put us in touch.</p> <p>The question of political alienation and political parties losing their grip on their bases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jan/06/dont-let-trump-fool-you-rightwing-populism-is-the-new-normal-video\">is not, however, unique to America</a>. Look across Europe and you will see that there is nothing uniquely American about the rise of Donald Trump. In Britain we\u2019ve seen the grassroots of the major parties rebel against their own leaderships with the double election of the leftwing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and the Conservative revolt over Brexit. So while I\u2019m staying in Muncie I hope readers from across America and elsewhere let me know if they are seeing similar themes emerge and if so how they are manifesting themselves. Every country has a Middletown \u2013 and most of them are hurting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"726521c763e8b2350c5b94c244e4df8ccf7efb8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726521c763e8b2350c5b94c244e4df8ccf7efb8f/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House in the downtown are of Muncie, Indiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houses in the downtown are of Muncie, Indiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have been to Muncie before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/11/september11.usa3\">13 years ago</a>, to write about the second anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. Back then, the political mood was tender with the political polarisation prompted by the Iraq war in particular and the Bush presidency in general. \u201cThe day when you would go out of your way to make a political statement are gone,\u201d Joseph Losco, chairman of the town\u2019s Ball State University political science department, told me at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gone for ever but it\u2019s gone for now.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call Muncie typical \u2013 what place truly is? \u2013 but it certainly showcased America as a complex place. True, the sign for the local mosque was destroyed and one local preacher held a memorial service in which he refused to share the pulpit with Muslims, Jews or any other religion. But following the mosque incident a local Muslim man held a barbecue and 200 neighbours showed up; an alternative interfaith service attracted twice the number of participants as the Christian-only one.</p> <p>So I\u2019m back in Middletown in the hope that I will once again find that level of complexity and nuance in this volatile moment. I want to visit the food banks, gun ranges, churches and gay bars to talk to its teachers, preachers, cops and kids. To find out not just how people will vote but what they are thinking, and not just who will win but what, if anything, might change. <br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 October 2016.

  "<p>There is something quite off-kilter about the idea of a Power Rangers movie with a budget of $150m, and starring \u2013 for goodness sake \u2013 Hollywood big hitters such as Breaking Bad\u2019s Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks. This could never have happened before the current explosion of comic-book movies, and the debut teaser trailer for Dean Israelite\u2019s 2017 movie leaves us wondering whether a big-budget take on the long-running TV show might be the worst idea since Josh Trank\u2019s dark and brooding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-four\">Fantastic Four</a> last year.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-C4qqsgs8w\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q-C4qqsgs8w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>For the original Power Rangers (often Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) series is oddly marvellous precisely thanks to its low budget and ersatz, exploitation-tinged qualities. In the early 1990s, creator Haim Saban hit on the idea of buying up footage from the completely insane Japanese show Super Sentai, which contributes most of the fight scenes in Power Rangers episodes to this day, and shooting new \u201cstory\u201d sequences with American-based actors. The result is a pseudo-psychedelic blend of cheesy narratives with superbly nutty martial arts sections, and an abiding, discombobulating sense that something has been lost in translation, that neither the viewer nor the series\u2019 creators really have much of a clue what is going on, and that both of us might have had something psychotropic put in our morning coffee. </p> <p>Those early Power Rangers TV shows were fabulously kitsch in the way that the terrible, out-of-sync dubbing somehow added to the eccentric thrill of Shaw Brothers martial arts movies. Machiko Soga\u2019s cackling, overcaffeinated Rita Repulsa came straight out of weirdsville because she\u2019s a straight lift from Super Sentai, but dubbed by an American voiceover artist (Barbara Goodson), who naturally hammed it up to high heaven. The creators of Super Sentai clearly had a wonderfully eccentric Japanese approach to character design, and some of the Rangers\u2019 other monstrous opponents were like nothing we would ever expect to see on western screens. My personal favourite from the current TV series is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Poisandra\">venomous sweetie Poisandra</a>, an evil alien who appears to have been constructed entirely out of cutesie pink candy wrappers and colourful helium balloons.</p> <p>With so much outrageous original material to draw from \u2013 there have been 23 TV seasons and two previous movies \u2013 plus a $150m budget, there\u2019s surely an opportunity here for Israelite and his team. By all rights, Power Rangers should be a hyperreal, bombastic and totally over-the-top riff on established superhero themes. The timing, especially given the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/deadpool\">Deadpool</a>, is perfect for a sharp and spiky, irreverent comic-book movie that plays on its Japanese roots and gives Cranston (who actually voiced monsters Twin Man and Snizard in the original series) and Banks the chance to chew furniture like two hungry goats trapped overnight in a branch of Ikea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143ab44f88ff05c28c01fced85e6075af426ff12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/143ab44f88ff05c28c01fced85e6075af426ff12/0_61_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Power Rangers (2017)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Troubled teens \u2026 (from left to right) Billy (RJ Cyler), Kimberly (Naomi Scott), Zack (Ludi Lin), Trini (Becky G) and Jason (Dacre Montgomery) in Power Rangers (2017).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kimberley French/Lionsgate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, at least according to the debut trailer, Israelite is planning to give us yet another grim and moody superhero epic about troubled teens who overcome their social detachment after gaining superpowers \u2013 via Power Rangers\u2019 usual energems. They even appear to have turned the famous Ranger suits into creeping Venom-style symbiotes, perhaps because a similar approach proved so incredibly popular on Spider-Man 3. Banks looks like she\u2019s channelling the unfortunate spirit of Cara Delevingne\u2019s grubby Enchantress from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/suicide-squad\">Suicide Squad</a>.</p> <p>The teaser\u2019s brooding look probably shouldn\u2019t be too much of a shock given Israelite, previously best-known for middling time travel-themed found-footage movie Project Almanac, <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/06/06/power-rangers-movie-will-be-mature-but-still-playful-says-director\">has told IGN</a> the film will be \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cjoyful\u201d but also \u201cone that feels completely grounded in a real world, with real characters going through real things\u201d. There has also been <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/05/power-rangers-reboot-new-suits-first-look\">talk of updating the series for a more mature audience</a> from the film\u2019s costume designers, which perhaps explains the suits.</p> <p>Screenwriter Max Landis, who worked on an early draft of Power Rangers but was fired, has pointed out how similar the teaser looks to Chronicle. And Landis should know, because he wrote the pioneering (but in my opinion pretty overrated) 2012 found-footage superhero movie. Perhaps efforts to drum up a Chronicle vibe also explain why the trailer reminds me of last year\u2019s dreary and listless Fantastic Four, another movie directed by one-time man-of-the-moment Trank. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Uptomyknees/status/784997076614524928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I wrote a silly, fun, goofy retro teen action adventure movie.<br><br>They fired me, and five or so writers later, it appears they made Chronicle.</p>&mdash; Max Landis (@Uptomyknees) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Uptomyknees/status/784997076614524928\">October 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Hollywood seems to be operating on some kind of extreme version of satellite delay at the moment when it comes to superhero films, because the last truly \u201cgritty and realistic\u201d comic-book movie to really resonate with both audiences and critics was surely Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight in 2008, or possibly the film\u2019s 2012 sequel The Dark Knight Rises. And yet the \u201cmature\u201d updates of popular kids\u2019 favourites, from Transformers to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, seem to keep on coming. </p> <p>Power Rangers is due out in March next year, just a month after next year\u2019s Lego Batman. Both are ostensibly superhero movies, but trailers for the two films suggest they might as well be operating in different dimensions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/the-lego-batman-movie-trailer\">Lego Batman seems irreverent, full of meta-inspired humour and playfulness</a>. It is completely aware of its own silliness, and will pick up the current huge audience for animated movies, because adults will be able to go and see it with pre-teen moviegoers. </p> <p>Power Rangers, on the other hand, is presumably aiming to convince older teens and twentysomethings that a thrillingly preposterous neon pantomime about school-age ninja-style superheroes and over-the-top invading space monsters has somehow morphed into something rather more furrow-browed and angsty \u2013 The Breakfast Club with superpowers. It\u2019s a big ask.<br></p>",

It delivered a point that Australia would have taken at half-time and one that Japan set out to achieve before kick-off. </p> <p>Japan were excellent in the first half, Australia poor. The Socceroos never got to grips with Japan\u2019s concession of territory and the Blue Samurai perhaps deserved to be more than a goal up after the break. Goalscorer Haraguchi then turned from hero to villain, conceding a needless penalty early in the second half to restore Australia\u2019s belief and shift the momentum. Thereafter, both sides probed but the clearest opportunities fell Japan\u2019s way, though Ryan only had one decent save to make. </p> <p>Much will be made of Ange Postecoglou\u2019s selections, in particular starting with two central strikers and a diamond midfield. The resulting lack of pace and width hurt Australia\u2019s chances. The Socceroos looked much more balanced and threatening after Robbie Kruse appeared. </p> <p>Brad Smith stood out all night, marauding down the left hand side and offering the best of the home side\u2019s attacking thrust.</p> <p>Unbeaten after four matches, and still to face whipping boys Thailand, this remains a strong start to the final World Cup qualifying phase for Australia.

The Asian Confederation has been whittled to 12 teams split evenly into two groups with Australia topping Pool B with seven points from their opening three matches. It\u2019s been a strong opening to this leg of the campaign by Ange Postecoglou and his crew, with a routine home victory over Iraq followed by a hard-earned away win in the UAE and a draw last Thursday in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The top four teams in the group (Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Japan) are separated by only one point, with Iraq and Thailand cast adrift and pointless. With only two automatic qualifiers and a third-place playoff on offer, every match carries plenty of meaning over the coming months.</p> <p>On paper at least Japan represent the toughest opposition to the Socceroos in the group, but their form so far has been patchy. They suffered a surprise defeat to the UAE in their opening group game and required a 96th minute winner to down Iraq a few nights ago. Coach Vahid Halilhodzic is under immense scrutiny and another disappointing performance tonight could spell the end of his tenure in charge of the Blue Samurai. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s rivalry with Japan has been one of the highlights of the move into the AFC. The Tim Cahill inspired 2006 World Cup comeback remains the highlight, but whenever these countries meet there\u2019s a sense continental supremacy is at stake. This is especially so at present with the Socceroos the reigning Asian Cup champions but without a win over Japan since 2009.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"554ddf2143e59151f23c017345212a7584882e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/554ddf2143e59151f23c017345212a7584882e79/0_419_1961_1047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Tim Cahill repeat his heroics of Kaiserslautern 2006 when Australia host Japan in a World Cup qualifier in Melbourne?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"534\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Tim Cahill repeat his heroics of Kaiserslautern 2006 when Australia host Japan in a World Cup qualifier in Melbourne?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fc7251e4b0eaaafbc950e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T05:34:13.512Z\">6.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jonathan will be here shortly to guide you through proceedings at Etihad, where Australia face their traditional Asian rivals hoping to consolidate top spot in Group B.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/08/socceroos-big-atmosphere-world-cup-clash-japan\">Socceroos keen for massive crowd in key Japan World Cup clash</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T05:36:21.359Z\">at 6.36am BST</time></p>  </div>",

I still believe that at the end of the day we\u2019re a government of laws, not a government of men.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton has already been investigated by the FBI, which found her handling of classified information to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">careless but not criminal</a>.</p> <p>Should Trump pull off a dramatic win, he might, for example, name Chris Christie as attorney general. Christie has been an aggressive critic of Clinton and even used his Republican national convention speech to play prosecutor and put her \u201con trial\u201d for endangering national security.</p> <p>He might therefore appoint a special prosecutor with some relish. \u201cThe FBI decision does not preclude reopening the investigation into Clinton,\u201d said a former government lawyer, who did not wish to be named. \u201cIt\u2019s not like double jeopardy. James Comey of the FBI has already looked at it and decided it is not a criminal matter \u2013 but of course, under a different administration, there might be new pressure from on high.\u201d</p> <p>If the special prosecutor found sufficient evidence to bring an indictment, Clinton could in theory go on trial before a jury and, if convicted, the judge would determine her sentence. But such a scenario for a high-profile politician is highly unlikely, the lawyer said.

He seemed to have no understanding of the constitution or rule of law.</p> <p>\u201cAs shocking as his debate statements were, they were of a piece with his earlier threats to use executive power to go after the media, set immigration restrictions based on religious affiliation, and declare the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">Central Park Five</a> guilty long after scientific evidence found them innocent.

  "<p>One of the most brilliant and unexpected treats of recent years was Konami\u2019s PT, a \u201cplayable teaser\u201d for an unreleased and possibly cancelled reboot of the horror series Silent Hill. Directed by the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/18/can-metal-gear-survive-without-hideo-kojima-konami\">Hideo Kojima</a>, alongside the film maker Guillermo del Toro, PT is notable not just for moving a third-person series into a first-person perspective, but also for offering an ingenious solution to a problem that faces every high-end developer of video games. As game assets become even more expensive and time-consuming to produce, how do you squeeze the most out of them?</p> <p>PT\u2019s solution was a small but detailed house interior which plays out repeatedly, a snack-sized Groundhog Day. The player wakes afresh in the same room, explores the house and, depending on their actions, small details change. If you experiment enough, mysteries are solved and new secrets are uncovered. As an experience it has issues, primarily that it\u2019s too obtuse, but as a proof-of-concept, PT is exceptional, even if Konami\u2019s may never follow it up.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXVx2bPgBp8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HXVx2bPgBp8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Konami\u2019s PT \u2018playable teaser\u2019</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Video game history loves a coincidence, and so we come to the new Resident Evil. Resi and Silent Hill share very little in terms of tone or structure, but as both are third-person survival horror games made by Japanese studios, they have been viewed as competitors since the days of the original Playstation. Announced this summer and due for release in January 2017, Resi 7 is a dramatic reinvention for Capcom\u2019s biggest-selling series of all time that \u2013 though having been in development for many years before PT saw release \u2013 it is toying with very similar concepts.</p> <p>Subtitled \u201cBeginning Hour\u201d, Resident Evil 7\u2019s Playstation-only playable teaser stars a spooky house, a switch to a first-person perspective and a total absence of combat. It was recently Resident Evil\u2019s 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and such a drastic reinvention was sorely-needed \u2013 these two decades saw dozens of individual Resi titles, but almost all were based on just two templates: the original game and 2004\u2019s Resident Evil 4 (itself a reinvention). That repetition \u2013 and the need to ensure mainstream success in an era of rapidly escalating budgets \u2013 led to an identity crisis, as \u201csurvival horror\u201d inexorably gravitated towards \u201caction horror\u201d and then just \u201caction with a few blobby monsters\u201d. </p> <p>In that context, Resident Evil 7 is one hell of a bet. Not only does it rip the series free from the defining third-person perspective, but it also doubles-down with VR implementation. Such a radical shift is accompanied by, in the teaser at least, a new focus on scares over combat, and the creation of a claustrophobic, shifting environment. What remains of Resident Evil is simple: the house.</p> <p>Because, in the very first game, the star character was not one of those panicking STARS operatives \u2013 it was the Arklay Mansion, a byzantine architectural masterpiece designed for re-use: players would criss-cross the layout several times during the game, unlocking and discovering new rooms and nightmares. This design solved a technical problem at a time when 3D environments were relatively new (polygonal structures are computational expensive), but the parallel to Resident Evil 7\u2019s environment is spookily close.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a182fb004b37420114a31bfb2f9307bc4390fbf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a182fb004b37420114a31bfb2f9307bc4390fbf4/121_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The environment in Resident Evil 7 is unsettlingly naturalistic.

This could be a real house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The teaser\u2019s dilapidated house is cramped, but packed. It\u2019s designed like a house, for a start, with a believable layout and dimensions. The wall and furniture textures are beautifully detailed, with the kind of worn leather chairs you can imagine feeling raggedy on your fingertips. Minor objects such as photographs withstand and repay examination.</p> <p>This grounded setting establishes a new tone for Resident Evil, which has always had as much schlock as shock. It has an effect that resonates, powerfully, through how this game works. You still move like a video game character, and understand you\u2019re in a video game horror house, but in the moment-to-moment experience this character feels convincingly flesh-and-blood. One of the strangest things was noticing that, when hiding, I was holding my breath.</p> <p>This would be promising enough, but Beginning Hour has even more unusual elements. What makes this house special is that, as you explore, creepy things start happening \u2013 and when you play again, it\u2019s not quite the same. In a first-floor room there are three mannequins. While checking a corner I heard a shuffle, turned around \u2013 and there was a fourth, at the top of the stairs I\u2019d just walked up. Subsequently I\u2019ve been to the same room, done the same things, and nothing\u2019s happened. On those same stairs, I saw the apparition of a girl for a split-second before she vanished. Never again.</p> <p>The short playtime (it should really be called \u201cBeginning 20 minutes\u201d) combines very well with tricks like this, in not only encouraging but rewarding multiple playthroughs \u2013 the potential of seeing something new maintains the atmosphere\u2019s tension. Even when you become familiar with the interior, and some of the more frequent scares, the tiniest event can set you on edge.</p> <p>The biggest part of this is the spectacularly creepy audio design, with its disturbing creaks and shuffles. Was that someone upstairs, or just an old timber settling? You\u2019re in an empty room, and something rustles in a corner that, now you look, is empty. The squeaks of old pipework lengthen into moans. Are those footsteps fading away?</p> <p>The puzzles are simple \u2013 a fuse box is missing a fuse, a mechanism needs power, a door is locked \u2013 but as with the original game, the point is more to make the player take journeys around the interior. Here we come to a unique characteristic of Beginning Hour, because there\u2019s never been a demo quite like this. For all it says about Resident Evil 7, there\u2019s a strange relationship with what\u2019s to come \u2013 Beginning Hour is not part of the main game, but a self-contained taster.</p> <p>This in itself is not unheard-of, but since release Capcom has been changing Beginning Hour with updates \u2013 adding items and allowing players to access new parts of the house. This is not only in-keeping with the shifting experience of Beginning Hour, but taps into that obsessive element of large fanbases to create an on-running mystery leading up to the full game\u2019s release. As marketing it\u2019s a stroke of design-led genius: Beginning Hour works both as a (free!) standalone miniature for any player, and by parcelling out its mysteries to build and maintain interest among more dedicated players.</p> <p>It also means, in this age of pre-release over-exposure, Resident Evil 7 is still something of an unknown quantity. We know the specifics of some nastier incidents, thanks to a spoiler-tastic age rating \u2013 don\u2019t look it up if you\u2019re interested in the game. We know there will be a combat system, and enemies to fight \u2013 though clearly the days of Resi 4 crowd control are long-gone. We know, thanks to the \u201clantern\u201d demo of in-game content, the hints of being hunted in Beginning Hour will become virtual reality. And this last point, along with the whole horror and scares thing, has a predictable effect.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8daUsjQj2ko\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8daUsjQj2ko?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>VR may be an obviously appropriate fit for horror, but that doesn\u2019t mean people will necessarily like it. There\u2019s a level of abstraction in \u201ctraditional\u201d horror video games that allows a mass audience to enjoy feeling threatened in a very obviously virtual world. Resident Evil 7 won\u2019t be the first or last VR horror game, and VR-ready consumers will likely make up a small part of its audience, but this is a big leap in the dark.<br></p> <p>Beginning Hour is full of promise, but answers none of these questions. It offers tempting glimpses, too, of an even more radical approach than expected \u2013 using the great big brand behind it to deliver a new horror experience, one where the moment-to-moment experience is prized above deadening requirements such as campaign length. Midway through Beginning Hour the protagonist changes. We watch a videotape and inhabit the cameraman filming it, as a small TV crew reccy the house you\u2019re in for a low-budget horror series. Everything\u2019s fine and dandy until, unseen, the producer goes missing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf2c128d3a22d8c49fcf9b8235e54a9c809620fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf2c128d3a22d8c49fcf9b8235e54a9c809620fa/72_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first-person perspective puts players right inside the horror, changing the feel of the experience\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first-person perspective puts players right inside the horror, changing the feel of the experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1989 film Sweet Home, a documentary crew visit an old mansion \u2013 and find a paranormal terror rooted in domestic tragedy. Capcom\u2019s Tokuro Fujiwara directed a video game adaptation on the NES so good, an historical classic, that the original Resident Evil is widely-acknowledged as a 3D adaptation of his design (Chris and Jill\u2019s \u201cspecial items\u201d of a lighter and lock pick are the most obvious tribute). How you crisscross the map, the puzzle design, the way characters can die if you make the wrong decisions \u2013 all of this became Resident Evil. Sweet Home is no zombie horror, though \u2013 it\u2019s a supernatural tale of human tragedy. </p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/v8m2YJaidbc\">\u201cMeet the Baker family\u201d</a> ran Capcom\u2019s press line last month while premiering a new trailer \u2013 though you\u2019ll have met Pa Baker when he knocks you out in either one of Beginning Hours\u2019 endings. Many game series remain in a state of perpetual adolescence, convinced that their audience is doing the same \u2013 and if not, the next generation\u2019s coming along. When you look at Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, there\u2019s a sense of a studio maybe \u2013 maybe \u2013 ageing a little with its audience. Understanding there are more horrible things that can happen to characters than just being killed by a bio-weapon.</p> <p>Perhaps the most tantalising possibility is that Resident Evil 7 augurs a future for video gaming\u2019s blockbuster franchises where horror is not simply a synonym for violence. At the very least, we may get less gore and more brains. At most it\u2019ll feel like home, Sweet Home. </p>",

  "<p>Squinting so he could drive through the vodka and the pills, Heath Phillips searched for a tree he could wrap his truck around.<br></p> <p>It was a frigid February day in 2009, some 200 miles north-west of New York City, on a road Phillips drove every day to get to work. He describes this moment as his rock bottom, but it was not his first suicide attempt. Twenty-one years earlier, Phillips had first tried to kill himself aboard the ammunition ship USS Butte after his shipmates repeatedly raped him.</p> <p>Phillips enlisted in the navy days before his 17th birthday. He had dreamed of serving since he was a little boy and looked forward to a 20-year career in the military. Instead, the trauma of his repeated sexual assault shattered him and forced him to leave after barely a year.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong></p> <p>If he could have stayed, Phillips would have been retired with a military pension by the time he drove his Nissan Pathfinder for what he thought would be the final time. </p> <p>Phillips says he \u201cwas not a good person\u201d in the aftermath of his assault. \u201cI\u2019ve been in and out of jail. I\u2019ve been arrested. I have been homeless. I have older sons who know me but we\u2019re not close, because I don\u2019t know how to be close to them.\u201d He continues: \u201cI did what I knew how to do: I drank. From drinking, I started popping pills. I couldn\u2019t hold a job because I couldn\u2019t handle being near anybody. I couldn\u2019t be near men. If they reminded me of something, I\u2019d walk off a job \u2026 All I cared about is: I want to be drunk, I don\u2019t want to remember this,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Phillips never found the tree. The next thing he remembers is waking up in his truck. That day, he dumped out all of his drugs and alcohol \u2013 even his cigarettes \u2013 and began a long struggle to reclaim his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa7af54ea16fe6bf3515dd83d5faf3191ffb70f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa7af54ea16fe6bf3515dd83d5faf3191ffb70f9/0_103_4215_5073/831.jpg\" alt=\"Heath Phillips holding a photo of himself when he was in the Navy.\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heath Phillips holding a photo of himself when he was in the navy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shane Lavalette/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Phillips is closer to the typical survivor of sexual assault in the US military than he is a deviation from it. According to the most recent <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/607047/department-of-defense-press-briefing-on-sexual-assault-in-the-military-in-the-p\">statistics</a> from the Pentagon, of the 20,300 service members sexually assaulted in 2014, 10,600 were men \u2013 a rate over 52%. </p> <p>Sexual assault within the military has reached shocking levels.<strong> </strong>In 2013, one in four women using the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 healthcare screened positive<strong> </strong>for military sexual assault. While awareness around female service members\u2019 ordeal lags far behind solutions, it has belatedly begun, in part due to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/11/gillibrands-military-sexual-assault_n_6309108.html\">efforts</a> from US senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Claire McCaskill and the award-winning documentary <a href=\"http://invisiblewarmovie.com/\">The Invisible War</a>. </p> <p>Yet male service members who experience military sexual assault remain even less visible. Studies by the Rand Corporation and the Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019 research arm, indicate that only <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-284\">40%</a> of women service members report their sexual assaults, compared with just 13% of men.</p> <p>This lack of visibility can be partly blamed on common narratives within the military, which often diminish the threat to female service members and erase the threat to male ones outright. </p> <p>One of those faulty narratives was reaffirmed by someone seeking to be their commander-in-chief. During a presidential forum last month, Donald Trump defended a 2013 tweet asking: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/331907383771148288?lang=en\">what did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?</a>\u201d, adding \u201cthe best thing we could do is set up a court system within the military\u201d (and, in doing so, described the system already in place).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to walk a mile in my shoes</p> <footer> <cite>Heath Phillips</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nearly eight years after he nearly ended his own life, Phillips laughs when asked what he would say to Trump should they be face to face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have to regroup my composure,\u201d he begins.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very, very ill-informed. He doesn\u2019t know more than the commanders know. He doesn\u2019t know more than the sexual assault survivors know. He wouldn\u2019t be able to walk a mile in my shoes.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In the affluent Dallas suburb of Southlake, Annie Kendzior, 26, sips an iced coffee as she recounts the multiple times her fellow midshipmen at the US Naval Academy raped her. We sit on the patio overlooking her family\u2019s huge backyard, with her loquacious and passionate father, Russ, beside her. At times seething as she shares her story, he interjects and vows to shame the US military into reform. </p> <p>Kendzior was a star high-school soccer player with a 3.8 grade point average. The Naval Academy, incubator of the officer corps of the navy and marines, recruited her in her junior year. Steeped in pro-military Texas culture and her grandfathers\u2019 second world war service, Kendzior figured an education at the academy, followed by a commission in the navy, would prepare her for the challenging life in the business world she ultimately sought.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3670a490238ea0fbdf738653ee3a89f6b8c0eed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3670a490238ea0fbdf738653ee3a89f6b8c0eed/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Kendzior and her father Russ.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Kendzior and her father Russ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison V Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kendzior entered the Annapolis, Maryland-based academy in 2008 and immediately encountered an atmosphere of machismo. She overheard still-juvenile young men refer to certain women as \u201cdubs\u201d, an acronym for dumb ugly bitches. At her first off-campus house party, Kendzior got drunk faster than she expected as a result of boot camp and her soccer regimen. She didn\u2019t want to pass out on a puke-covered floor, so when a second-year midshipman told her there was a bed she could sleep in, she took the chance. </p> <p>\u201cI woke up to it happening,\u201d she remembered. </p> <p>Later, still in shock, Kendzior messaged the man on Facebook. He elided what he had done to Kendzior and, since he was a year above her, made it an issue of fraternization, a punishable offense. \u201cKeep your mouth shut, don\u2019t say anything, or we\u2019ll both get in trouble,\u201d he said. She dealt with it by putting it out of her mind as best she could. \u201cThere was a lot of that shame built in, like I shouldn\u2019t have been drinking,\u201d she says. Because he was in her company, she had to see him at every meal for weeks on end.</p> <p>A month later, she was raped for a second time by two different midshipmen on the varsity basketball team.<br></p> <p>Thinking an upperclass midshipman was trying to hook her up with a classmate she considered a friend, Kendzior went to hang out with them at a nearby hotel (something midshipmen do to drink away from prying eyes). Less than halfway through a red cup full of a drink they had mixed for her, Kendzior blacked out. </p> <p>\u201cThe next thing I know, I realized I was being raped by this upperclassman,\u201d she said. She was only awake for a few seconds before passing out again, and would later learn the man she thought was her friend joined in. </p> <p>For two and a half years, Kendzior did not report the incidents. She encountered what appeared to be studious avoidance at the academy. When doctors asked her if she had ever been assaulted, she answered affirmatively, but they did not ask follow-up questions. </p> <p>Her depression compounded until she had a breakdown in March 2011, complete with thoughts of suicide. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, something that would be brought up when she ultimately decided that year to report her rape. </p> <p>The navy convened a panel in the summer of 2011, attended by approximately 25 naval officers, and, extraordinarily, put her medical file on a screen. It exposed her struggles with depression, the antidepressants the navy doctors prescribed her, and her suicidal ideations (such carelessness for her privacy would be <a href=\"http://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Privacy-and-Civil-Liberties/HIPAA-Compliance-within-the-MHS/Military-Command-Exception\">clearly illegal</a> for a civilian organization). In other words, the navy was calling her crazy.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The panel lasted approximately an hour and concluded she was unfit to continue. Kendzior\u2019s military career was over before she was ever even commissioned. The three men who raped her, as far as she knows, became navy officers.</p> <p>A family friend, retired navy captain and Naval Academy alum Jack Reape, considers the hearing a disgrace, calling the assembled navy officers \u201ccowards\u201d and growing emotional when recounting it.</p> <p>In an interview, Reape told the Guardian:<strong> </strong>\u201cIt is one of my great regrets in the navy that I didn\u2019t get on an airplane, fly up there and tell those sons of bitches, \u2018You think you\u2019re going to take on a 20-year old girl?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A lawsuit against the navy and the defense department leadership went nowhere. Kendzior decided against suing her rapists directly, as \u201conce you do that, you give them the microphone\u201d. Instead, she has crusaded against military sexual assault in a high-profile fashion \u2013 ESPN even ran <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/e60/story/_/id/9754343/the-us-military-enemy-within\">a story in 2013</a> on her fight against the Naval Academy \u2013 while serving as a project manager for a Dallas-area IT company and working toward her MBA.</p> <p>\u201cI know I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If I leave without a fight, that\u2019s me giving up and then they win. You have to fight back,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Yet this is how the Naval Academy described Kendzior in her official separation papers: \u201c[S]he does not display leadership or maturity expected of a [senior midshipman] and I do not believe she is capable of reaching \u2018officer-level\u2019 maturity without professional psychological treatment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Rape prosecutions within the military are rare, and convictions rarer still. The survivors advocacy network Protect Our Defenders found that in 2015 only 20% of eligible cases made it to prosecution. Of those, 9% yielded a conviction. </p> <p>\u201cNo one ever tells you what you would feel if you went through the whole process and then didn\u2019t get the result,\u201d said a woman the Guardian will call Sara. </p> <p>In 2012, Sara was at a friend\u2019s house not far from Fort Hood, Texas, where she was stationed. She had drunk some recreational Robitussin and, high, didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the male strangers hitting on her. To get home, she did as she was instructed during the pre-weekend safety briefs and called her squad leader. The squad leader took her back to his apartment and raped her. </p> <p>For months, Sara told hardly anyone what had happened. Her unit had gone through a previous sexual assault episode and she remembered everyone, \u201cmyself included\u201d, refusing to believe the victim out of a sense of camaraderie. The anxiety she developed gave way to panic attacks she didn\u2019t want to explain, and the army assigned her the sedative Klonopin. </p> <p>Sara transferred out of her battalion to avoid seeing her attacker. Her future husband, who encouraged Sara to report the rape, ended up deploying with him. His increasing anger toward the attacker led to the end of his deployment, and at that point, Sara felt she had to come forward for his sake. Without counsel and \u201czombied out\u201d from the Klonopin, she gave a hazy statement to the army\u2019s criminal investigation division that would end up significantly different from a subsequent statement that wasn\u2019t influenced by the drug. </p> <p>Prosecutors, friends and others encouraged Sara to proceed with court-martialing her attacker. They told her that unless she came forward, he would be free to hurt others. Yet the trial featured techniques familiar to civilian women who do the same. \u201cThey said I was mentally ill,\u201d Sara recalled, even using her father\u2019s mental-health history to sow doubt among the jurors. </p> <p>Worse, her former friends lined up as character witnesses for her assailant, an unanticipated consequence of Sara leaving the bond of her old unit. </p> <p>Over a year after her attacker\u2019s acquittal, Sara regrets coming forward. \u201cA huge part of the hurt I still feel from what had happened is now related to what had happened through the court martial and the whole reporting process,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd291cec30e8345c71e1ea2f75ab3012b250f4b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd291cec30e8345c71e1ea2f75ab3012b250f4b8/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former US Navy Petty Officer Third Class Brian Lewis testified before Congress in 2013 about being sexually assaulted by a superior officer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former US navy petty officer third class Brian Lewis testified before Congress in 2013 about being sexually assaulted by a superior officer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtney Perry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Brian Lewis\u2019s case, reporting his own assault to command led to reprisals. </p> <p>Lewis, 36, joined the navy in 1997 and became a submariner. He recalls his days aboard subs with pride. Only when he was moved to the USS Frank Cable, a submarine tender, was he raped, pierside, aboard the ship.</p> <p>For over two weeks while their ship was under way, Brian Lewis had nowhere to escape from his attacker, a senior noncommissioned officer. They were in the Pacific Ocean, steaming away from their Guam homeport. Lewis became fearful of going to sections of the USS Frank Cable required for his job. He began cutting himself and ended up needing medical evacuation to Japan. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to hide when you only have 600 feet or so to run from somebody,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lewis, who was 20 in 2000, took the attack to his command. He was told to let it drop. It was the era of don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell, and the infamous policy of closeting LGBT service members had a perverse effect on sexual assault victims. \u201cYou know,\u201d Lewis remembers an officer telling him, \u201chomosexual activity is grounds for discharge.\u201d Out of fear, Lewis followed his command\u2019s advice not to report the rape.</p> <p>Lewis had no prior psychiatric problems, but the PTSD resulting from the rape \u201csavaged my life\u201d. When he complained about receiving no medical treatment other than a perfunctory pill prescription \u2013 a situation echoing the heavy medication given to Kendzior and Sara \u2013 Lewis received a diagnosis of a personality disorder, followed by a discharge from service. </p> <p>\u201cIf the military has to medically retire you, they\u2019re on the hook for payouts for potentially the remainder of your life, as well as healthcare. So there\u2019s a monetary savings there,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my case, it was retaliation for complaining about the lack of medical treatment I was receiving at the time \u2026 the fact that I had talked to my command about being a victim and then for saying, \u2018Look, you need to do more than simply give me pills.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1aaeffcbe07f834dc83bfdccfd37741f5530822b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1aaeffcbe07f834dc83bfdccfd37741f5530822b/0_286_5898_3538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heath Phillips: \u2018There are still things that spark my memory, and I\u2019m shaking and I\u2019m scared.\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillips: \u2018He told me I needed to buck up and become a man and fight back.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shane Lavalette/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lewis joined the military so he would have money for college. Phillips also came from a working-class background, but while he wanted to help his family financially \u2013 even dropping out of school to enlist early so his mother would have one fewer mouth to feed \u2013 serving had always been his dream.</p> <p>Phillips\u2019s father and stepfather were both Vietnam veterans, and as he grew up in the 1980s steeped in pro-military pop culture, he worked out a plan. First he\u2019d join the navy and then he\u2019d transition to the army, like his father and stepdad. Even boot camp in 1988 was a dream come true: \u201cIt was like family. We worked together, these people helped me, I was pampered.\u201d </p> <p>So when his shipmates from the ammunition ship USS Butte invited him to hang out in New York City, Phillips didn\u2019t hesitate. It was his first time in the city and Times Square wowed him, especially when the men he wanted to be like started pouring him drinks back at their hotel. Phillips was no novice to drinking, but something in his beer made him groggy. </p> <p>\u201cThe next thing you know, I\u2019m waking up, I\u2019m on the floor, and what\u2019s waking me up was the tug of my pants. Soon as I open up my eyes \u2013 I was laying on my back \u2013 I open up my eyes and there\u2019s this guy standing above me with his genitals in his hand,\u201d Phillips remembered, while another man had a hand on Phillips\u2019s own genitals. When he ran to the bathroom to escape them, he heard his shipmates laughing at him. </p> <p>When Phillips got back to the Butte, he immediately told the master-at-arms what had happened. The master-at-arms asked if Phillips was homesick. He denied it. \u201cI think you\u2019re lying. I think you just want to go back home,\u201d Phillips remembers being told. </p> <p>The New York assault was a prologue of what Phillips was in for aboard ship. His shipmates threw urine on him, stuffed his pillow with feces, threw him out of his bunk and pulled his mouth open. They would force their genitals inside, telling Phillips that if he bit down, they would kill him. No one interfered to protect him.</p> <p>\u201cThese guys were not doing this to sexually be gratified,\u201d but rather to dominate him, Phillips said. \u201cI\u2019m 45 years old and I still have nightmares from this. I\u2019m 45 and there are still things that spark my memory, and I\u2019m shaking and I\u2019m scared.\u201d </p> <p>After weeks of escalating attacks, Phillips walked to a storage area and tried to hang himself. It didn\u2019t work. A petty officer came across him and helped him down before \u201csmacking the crap out of me. He told me I needed to buck up and become a man and fight back.\u201d The rape was anything but a secret aboard the ship. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m 45 years old, and I still have nightmares from this</p> <footer> <cite>Heath Phillips</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Suicidal, humiliated and alone, Phillips went Awol. He returned to his upstate New York home, living in abandoned cars or on the streets to dodge the police knocking on his parents\u2019 doors to find him. That didn\u2019t work either: Phillips ended up jailed, and from there, transferred to a naval brig.</p> <p>Soon, he was back aboard the Butte, where the attacks got worse. He was now known as a snitch. When his shipmates raped him in the shower with a shampoo bottle and a toilet brush, the infirmary informed him that he had suffered a hemorrhoid rupture.</p> <p>Phillips would never have the military career of his boyhood dreams. His navy service was a cycle of rape and incarceration until he received an other-than-honorable discharge. He was back home at just 18 years old, where he turned to drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>It took Phillips two decades to reach his rock bottom, that night on the road. His recovery has seen him extensively research sexual assault in the military; fight a veterans affairs department that maintains his trauma is not related to his service; and try to help others who went through what he did. </p> <p>Now, Phillips is the executive director of Mr MST, or <a href=\"http://mrmst.org/\">Men Recovering from Military Sexual Trauma</a>, a group Lewis co-founded. On 21 September, they spoke at a briefing in Washington hosted by the bipartisan chairs of the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus. </p> <p>A report last year from the Government Accountability Office raised alarms about the military addressing male sexual assault. The Pentagon\u2019s health affairs office has not \u201csystematically identified whether male victims have any gender-specific needs\u201d, it <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-284\">found</a>, nor has it \u201cestablished goals or metrics to gauge sexual assault-related issues for male servicemembers.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe perception in DC is that they understand military sexual trauma,\u201d Phillips said, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s a man\u2019s issue.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Men and women who have survived military sexual assault have concrete ideas for the Pentagon on how to fix this crisis. Many back a measure championed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, to take prosecuting rape out of the chain of command, an effort at removing a conflict of interest for commanders who have to weigh a servicemember\u2019s value to a mission or unit against an accusation of assault. </p> <p>But the Pentagon is wary of any measure changing the chain of command, the backbone of military discipline and effectiveness, and Gillibrand\u2019s effort was defeated in June. </p> <p>Kendzior said she doesn\u2019t understand why the services will undergo extensive testing for changes in uniform camouflage patterns but won\u2019t pilot a sexual assault prevention program free of the influence of command in a non-deployment atmosphere, like a service academy. </p> <p>\u201cThis epidemic is undermining our military and its ability to attract our nation\u2019s best,\u201d Kendzior said. She said she has heard from talented young women who are ruling out military service to avoid being sexually harassed or assaulted. </p> <p>Kendzior and her father Russ back Gillibrand\u2019s bill. So does Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. </p> <p>Kendzior\u2019s father, Russ, has a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN sign in one of the rooms of his house. He doesn\u2019t trust Clinton \u2013 \u201cher husband is a predator,\u201d he said \u2013 and supports Trump. Although he concedes Trump has \u201csexist views\u201d, he hopes that Trump\u2019s mantra of change will extend to stopping military rape.</p> <p>\u201cDammit, he better put up. I want to put him on the spot: Mr Trump, I\u2019m leaning in your direction. You prove to me and my daughter, who is a victim of sexual assault, and all the Annies and Andys out there, that you are going to make a change,\u201d said Russ Kendzior.</p> <p>Other sexual assault survivors do not share the same faith in the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Lewis finds Trump\u2019s statements abhorrent. \u201cMr Trump demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge on the issue of military sexual assault in particular and on sexual assault generally,\u201d he says. \u201cThe issue of military sexual assault is not one that\u2019s gender-specific, and the integration of men and women together in the units is not the primary cause or any cause of sexual assault in our military.\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201cWe still contend with a stigma. Whether true or not for an individual, we [male survivors] are still seen in some quarters as homosexual. Unfortunately, that\u2019s a societal stigma as a whole, but still, that perception adds to the sense of isolation and vulnerability that exists as part of the American definition of masculinity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy failing to acknowledge that 53% of victims are men in our armed forces, Mr Trump has effectively excluded a majority of victims \u2013 men \u2013 from the conversation regarding how to address this particular issue.\u201d</p> <p>After Trump <a href=\"http://www.protectourdefenders.com/statement-protect-our-defenders-responds-to-donald-trumps-clueless-and-incomprehensible-comments-on-military-sexual-assault/\">stood his ground</a> during a forum in September, retired air force colonel Don Christensen, the president of Protect Our Defenders, said: \u201cMr Trump\u2019s destructive victim blaming shows he fundamentally misunderstands the problem. It diminishes women\u2019s enormous contributions to our nation\u2019s defense and ignores the fact that more than 50% of the victims are male.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis tweet was despicable. What can you say?\u201d added Susan Burke, a prominent lawyer who has represented military sexual assault survivors, including Kendzior. \u201cWe were all quite disappointed that President Obama did not support the [Gillibrand] legislative fix. We are hopeful that President Clinton will.\u201d</p> <p><em> In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

  "<p>This month we\u2019ll be reading Beryl Bainbridge\u2019s novel The Bottle Factory Outing, which won our public vote by a significant margin. </p> <p>This work comes from the first successful part of the writer\u2019s career when she specialised in \u201cdeftly distorted biography\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/04/beryl-bainbridge-obituary-an-wilson\">as AN Wilson put it</a>. It\u2019s partly inspired by a period in 1970 when Bainbridge and a friend worked in Belloni\u2019s wine warehouse in London. This was a pretty miserable job, sticking labels on to bottles in conditions so cold that the writer claimed she tried to keep warm by wrapping herself up in newspaper. It wasn\u2019t well paid either \u2013 although it came with the dubious perk of an unlimited wine allowance. Bainbridge would later claim she often had to be wheeled home by 3pm. Or sometimes even 10.30am.<br></p> <p>You can see her talking about it in<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h73r3\"> this charming clip from the 1976 BBC Books programme</a>. The clip also contains some footage from her publisher Duckworth, during its eccentric pomp, when Bainbridge appears to have had a writing desk inside the office. She also claims to have mainly written the book between the hours of 11pm and 5am.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a43c0da8c057f53b98c979f687f8c840c40c50ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a43c0da8c057f53b98c979f687f8c840c40c50ee/0_0_3592_2155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Bainbridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beryl Bainbridge\u2019s novel is semi-autobiographical.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if that isn\u2019t intriguing enough, how about some of the praise it received when it came out? Writing in the Sunday Times, the respected critic Ronald Blythe blew his entire annual adjective allowance in one glorious paragraph:<br></p> <p><em>\u201cAfter turning the final page of The Bottle Factory Outing one can only gasp, and grope for the right phrase. What a talent, if that is not too mild a word. Such an atmosphere of impending doom has not been created since Brighton Rock \u2013 except that Beryl Bainbridge is mercilessly comic instead of mercilessly vicious. Specialising in successive denouements, and with her gift for collecting the most amazing detail, she is so in control of her marvellous little story that one hangs on her words from first to last. What originality, what pleasure.\u201d</em></p> <p>The author of the aforementioned Brighton Rock was also impressed. Graham Greene called The Bottle Factory Outing \u201can outrageously funny and horrifying novel\u201d in the Observer.<br></p> <p> High praise.

  "<p>Each time a new faction of British politicians find their way to power, they make the same mistakes. They start with grand promises that cheer party activists. But these promises often end up in a morass of mistakes. It is time the public demanded an end to the stupidity that is structured into politics before we are forced to suffer another round of costly cock-ups.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, we have seen new faces take to the stage at party conferences to make new promises. Theresa May bought an end the era of Notting Hill neoliberalism and unveiled <a href=\"http://www.perc.org.uk/project_posts/the-protective-state/\" title=\"\">Erdington Conservativism</a>. Out went austerity, level playing fields and globalisation. In came infrastructure development, industrial policy and nationalism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/amber-rudd-hate-foreigners-foreign-workers-companies-racist\">Does Amber Rudd hate foreigners, or does she hate us? | David Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Big ideas make excellent headlines but they rarely make good policy. This is because radical new ideas are often created by small groups of like-minded individuals. These bands of radicals can drive political innovation, but they also fall prey to groupthink. Psychologists have repeatedly found that many great screw-ups are driven by small groups of like-minded individuals who come together and end up <a href=\"http://liquidbriefing.com/twiki/pub/Dev/RefEsser1998/alive_and_well_after_25_years.pdf\" title=\"\">making stupid decisions</a>. These groups are often more concerned with agreeing with each other than making the right decision. In a tight-knit group, challenging dominant ideas is seen as a sign of disloyalty. This is particularly potent in politics, where loyalty is a vital currency. One act of dissent can be enough to end your career.</p> <p>People with big ideas rarely have much real-life experience of the policy area they are so set on shaking up. They often have a grand vision but little idea about how their fine ideas should be implemented. This is what happened when ministers in Tony Blair\u2019s government, with no real understanding of IT or health, pursued their grand vision of patient choice in health-care by commissioning the world\u2019s biggest civilian IT project. Unsurprisingly, the National Programme for IT proved to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/18/nhs-records-system-10bn\" title=\"\">\u00a310bn onmishambles</a>. The same thing could be happening all over again as Amber Rudd \u2013 an ex-investment banker and minister for energy \u2013 sets about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\" title=\"\">shaking up the immigration system</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96020b97e2ed7495f496aaf0bedcb003654ee169\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96020b97e2ed7495f496aaf0bedcb003654ee169/0_115_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Home secretary Amber Rudd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home secretary Amber Rudd, who\u2019s intent on shaking up the immigration system</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the past, civil servants took their job of saving politicians from their own stupidity seriously. Today, civil servants rapidly move around departments. They are encouraged to have a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude, so they rarely say no to politicians. What\u2019s more, today\u2019s civil servant often has as little expertise in their policy area as their clueless minister. I know of a case where a postgraduate student was asked to develop a new policy area during a three-month internship. When she asked \u201cWhat is important?\u201d, she was told by her twentysomething boss, \u201cOne or two good PowerPoint slides\u201d. At the end of her time she delivered her PowerPoint slides, and now this is a major area of government policy.</p> <p>When politicians with grand ideas end up making grand mistakes, they often move onwards and upwards within a year or two. Far from mistakes being punished, in politics they seem to be rewarded. This is what happened when Jeremy Hunt presided over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/12/rebekah-brooks-jeremy-hunt-email\" title=\"\">phone-hacking affair</a> as minister of culture, media and sport. He was then \u201cpunished\u201d by being handed an even bigger portfolio at the Ministry of Health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/liam-fox-cabinet-speeches-trade\">Liam Fox has risen from the undead to the cabinet.

After overseeing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/29/liam-fox-ministry-of-defence\" title=\"\">increasingly dire situation</a> in the defence forces as minister of defence, he has just been rewarded with the vital position of trade minister. One wonders whether Dr Fox\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d in defence bodes well for the UK\u2019s mission to do trade deals around the world.</p> <p>In my search for solutions, I found some inspiration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/04/blunders-government-king-crewe-review\" title=\"\">Ivor Crewe and Anthony King\u2019s depressingly insightful</a> study of blunders in British politics. Policies should be created by groups hailing from a range of backgrounds and ideologies. All studies of group decision making shows that increasing diversity means decisions taken tend to be better quality, even though they take longer. This might mean cross-party groups should work through the details of new policy before it is released on the world.</p> <p>Politicians who want to make one of their big ideas into law should have at least some experience with the policy area. If they hope to shake up the energy sector, maybe they should spend some time in a power plant, a electricity distribution centre, or a customer service centre. They also might want to gain an understanding of the intricacies of implementing their favoured ideas. Maybe ministers should be banned from implementing any new idea until they can demonstrate a level of competence in their policy area.</p> <p>Finally, we should hold ministers to account by insisting they deliver their own stupid ideas, and clear up the mess which they will inevitably leave behind them. If a minister starts out on a new initiative, then they should stick around to see if though. Perhaps we might also insist on the kind of reward by results system they have implemented on everyone else in the public sector \u2013 if your policy screws up, then you don\u2019t get rewarded with another portfolio.</p> <p>Making these relatively minor changes to the way ministers work is one way we might try to save ourselves from the stupidity of a smart politician with a big idea.</p>",

  "<h2><br></h2> <h2>An ambulance is called for someone who has fallen over and grazed their knees</h2> <p>We get inappropriate calls from the public who seem to be too scared to get people to stand up after falling over. For example, a person trips in the street and grazes their knees. A crowd gathers and persuades the person to stay on the floor until the ambulance comes. People look on in wonderment as the ambulance crew ask the person if they can stand. The person stands and is full of gratitude but 30 to 40 minutes is spent on the scene doing basic checks that we have to do before discharging patients and paperwork. The person could have got themselves up and gone to the chemist for wipes and a plaster.</p> <p><em>Paramedic, ambulance service, Wales</em></p> <h2>Clunky IT systems detract from my work in A&amp;E</h2> <p>Once I have assessed people in A&amp;E, I have to write up the medical notes by hand or on a computer system.

After angrily berating me for not arranging him a same-day MRI scan, he stormed out of the A&amp;E department walking on said ankle.The patient wasted both my and the ambulance service\u2019s time which should have been spent looking after genuinely acutely unwell patients. It is so frustrating and demoralising to then be abused by patients like this on a daily basis. The public\u2019s expectations and understanding of different healthcare services is central to this problem.

One particular example is in the ongoing battle for charging, taking place between the trust and the commissioning support unit (CSU).</p> <p>Each month, our team is sent spreadsheets listing thousands of instances of patient care that the CSU is challenging as being incorrect or inappropriate \u2013 so called SLA (service level agreement) challenges.

Unfortunately, in the current climate, the attitude seems to have changed from this being a check and balance, to being a significant cost saving opportunity for the CSU. As such, they apply more staff resource to scrutinise and challenge trusts \u2013 using more inventive thinking to claw back money from providers. I have heard anecdotally that CSU analysts are incentivised based on how much they can claim back from trusts.</p> <p>We, on the other hand, are not in a position to hire more staff to scrutinise and check and to answer to these sorts of overheads (in fact we tend to pay equivalent staff less) \u2013 instead redirecting resources that would otherwise be spent on trying to improve how we run the organisation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/sep/18/death-helicopter-crashes-tears-nurses-career-defining-moments\">Death, helicopter crashes and tears: nurses' career-defining moments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, we still continue to accept and treat patients as we always have. The actual cost of seeing the patient stays the same. The administrative burden, however, inflates the more we bicker about whether CSUs should or shouldn\u2019t pay.

It is a habit formed by oil, which warps price perceptions like a pyschotropic drug.</p> <p>Historically, abundant supplies have made Venezuelans regard cheap petrol as a birthright, so for political reasons \u2013 and despite hyperinflation, collapsing government revenues, global markets and climate change \u2013 the current price for a litre of high-grade gasoline is just 6 bolivars (less than a penny or a cent) \u2013 more than 100 times cheaper than the same volume of mineral water. This meant the fuel bill for the entire 1,400km journey was less than a pound or dollar.<br></p> <p>When Hugo Ch\u00e1vez came to power in 1999, he took this way of thinking a step further and used petrol dollars to subsidise essential products such as rice, sugar, toilet paper, sanitary towels and medicine.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38fc336680ebb09322a27fe7bf7f64ceacf3f105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38fc336680ebb09322a27fe7bf7f64ceacf3f105/0_101_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 100 bolivar note is the highest denomination.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 100 bolivar note is the highest denomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was an altruistic, populist move that allowed the poor to finally share in the nation\u2019s oil wealth.

Almost all have been run down. Output at the PDVSA state oil company has fallen by 450,000 barrels a day from its 2014 level of 2.7m barrels. Given that each barrel is also worth less than half its value two years ago, this has created an enormous hole in the state\u2019s finances.</p> <p>Compared to agriculture, however, that is a relatively small decline. On the roadside are miles and miles of empty, fertile land, and relatively few crops. With prices of many vegetables kept low, there is little incentive for farmers. Between 2012 and 2015, domestic grain production fell by 80%, meat by 40% and vegetables by 18%, according to private sector analysts. Shortfalls were once covered by imports, but the state has to use its remaining petrodollars to service debts. </p> <p>Private companies are also struggling as a result of the weak bolivar.

While Brazil and Argentina suffered appalling hyperinflation in the 1980s and 1990s, he said the current situation in Venezuela was harsher because \u2013 unlike in those two countries \u2013 wages are not index linked, so people are experiencing a devastating collapse in their ability to pay for goods.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As a result, demand is collapsing.

  "<p>When turkey farmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/26/bernard-matthews-obituary\" title=\"\">Bernard Matthews died in 2010</a>, the company bearing his name was in a bad way. The avian flu of 2007 led to a cull of turkeys and undermined confidence in the business. Despite the best efforts of advertisers, turkey meat had failed to displace the popularity of chicken and pork. In 2013 the Matthews family secured \u00a325m in investment from private equity firm Rutland Partners, and gave up control of Bernard Matthews Limited. The new controllers hoped to revive the business; but that is not how it turned out and they were soon <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/11610426/Bernard-Matthews-in-fresh-search-for-funds-as-turnaround-battle-rages-on.html\" title=\"\">looking for buyers</a>.</p> <p>In July this year the company\u2019s German subsidiary was sold for \u00a311.9m, but its fortunes continued to decline and accountancy firm Deloitte was hired as an adviser. The course of action chosen by the directors \u2013 a \u201cpre-pack\u201d administration \u2013 is controversial because of the secrecy involved, and because buyers can cherry-pick assets while dumping liabilities. Today I delivered <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/news-parliament-2015/pre-pack-bernard-matthews-briefing-16-17/\" title=\"\">my report on this arrangement </a>to the work and pensions committee.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once again, pensioners find themselves at the back of the queue when things go wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In September Deloitte was appointed administrator, and on the same day the assets of the business \u2013 which included farms, land and buildings \u2013 were sold for \u00a387.5m to two property companies in the Boparan Private Office, a private investment vehicle. This was good news for employees as most of the 2,000 jobs were saved, at least for the time being, and for secured creditors Wells Fargo and PNC Financial Services, who are set to be paid \u00a346.6m. Rutland has already received \u00a334m. But the big losers here, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sir-philip-green-i-am-working-every-day-on-the-bhs-pension-crisis\" title=\"\">as at BHS</a>, are the pensioners and the unsecured creditors.</p> <p>The Bernard Matthews pension scheme had a deficit of \u00a317.5m, rising to \u00a320m, but is unlikely to receive anything. Unsecured creditors, who between them are owed \u00a339m (including more than \u00a31m owed to HMRC), will be lucky to receive 1p in the pound, which is likely to have a devastating effect on the local economy in Norfolk and Suffolk.</p> <p>Deloitte has charged a fee of \u00a3790,000 and its advisers have run up another \u00a3668,000. Meanwhile, pension scheme members and trustees can do little to challenge this outcome. Administrators generally do not owe a \u201cduty of care\u201d to all parties.</p> <p>The poor state of UK regulation is captured by a letter from the pensions regulator to the work and pension committee last month. The letter notes that there is no compulsion to inform the regulator when such a deal is made. The Bernard Matthews pension scheme may eventually be rescued by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), but employees may not be entitled to 100% of their accrued pensions. We are still waiting to learn how much of BHS\u2019s \u00a3700m pension scheme liability is to be absorbed by the PPF.</p> <p>So once again, pensioners find themselves at the back of the queue when things go wrong, as shareholders\u2019 interests are prioritised over theirs. Despite reporting pension scheme deficits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/01/uk-defined-benefit-pension-fund-deficit-grows-100bn-one-month-pwc\" title=\"\">nearly \u00a3710bn</a>, companies do not prioritise deficit reduction. <a href=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/news/ftse-100-companies-pension-deficits-paid-out-%C2%A348-billion-dividends\" title=\"\">One recent study </a>notes that over the past two years, FTSE100 companies paid at least \u00a348bn in annual dividends while leaving \u00a352bn in pension scheme deficits. Another study noted that FTSE100 directors paid \u00a313.3bn to reduce their pension scheme deficits, compared with \u00a371.8bn in payments to shareholders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/bernard-matthews-pension-pot-to-receive-just-1p-in-the-pound\">Bernard Matthews pension pot to receive just 1p in the pound</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The following steps would help stamp out such practices. All large companies \u2013 say with more than 500 employees \u2013 should have significant employee representation on their boards. These representatives could be expected to stand up for the rights of employees. Second, no company should be able to pay dividends without a plan to reduce pension scheme deficit. Third, for companies in administration or liquidation, the pension scheme should be a priority creditor. Fourth, the regulator\u2019s permission should be needed before any sale can go ahead.</p> <p>The dumping of pension liabilities is a public matter. Sales and agreements like this one, affecting thousands of lives, should not remain confidential. This is not to say that openness is a panacea. The problems of corporate governance and capitalism more widely are deep-rooted. But some new rules and a greater degree of transparency could help prevent companies from playing fast and loose with pension liabilities.</p>",

He has not said publicly why he might be targeted, or why he is the subject of what what his German lawyer describes as \u201ca hate campaign\u201d. \u201cTypically, people who come forward with these kinds of allegations are said to be doing it for money or fame,\u201d says Anne Roth, psychologist at Berlin\u2019s Lara Rape Crisis and Counselling Center. \u201cIn fact they gain nothing but negative attention.\u201d</p> <p>Roth says Berlin\u2019s close-knit cyberactivist community is likely to be no different to any other dysfunctional organisation or business that fails to properly address allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Sexual violence, she explains, is about the exertion of power, whether the power is defined by official rank or by social status, and in both cases it is <a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\">difficult for the victims to speak up</a>. \u201cThat relies on the goodwill of the aggressor, so without a formal allegation, victims often prefer to remain silent.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">The Tor Project</a> began in the mid-1990s at the <a href=\"http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/chacs/dingledine-tor-second-generation-onion-router\">US navy research lab</a>, which was exploring ways to protect military communications online. Short for \u201cThe Onion Router\u201d, which describes the layers of anonymity it is able to pile on top of a user\u2019s online activity, Tor was spun out into a non-profit company in 2006 led by<a href=\"http://www.freehaven.net/~arma/cv.html\"> Roger Dingledine</a>,<a href=\"http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/\"> Nick Mathewson</a> and <a href=\"http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx\">six others</a> from its base in Massachusetts. By 2014 it had <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2014-TorProject-combined-Form990_PC_Audit_Results.pdf\">annual revenue of $2.5m</a>. Appelbaum began as a volunteer and joined the staff in 2008. </p> <p>Dingledine and Appelbaum began to work closely together, with Appelbaum encouraged to speak as Tor\u2019s public evangelist \u2013 marking the beginning of Appelbaum\u2019s ascendency into an influential figure in the tech community. He was one of only a handful of activists with the confidence and technical knowledge to publicly challenge the US government\u2019s pervasive surveillance regime. In August 2013, he even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW8lRCqYI6U\">accepted a Whistleblower Award</a> on behalf of Edward Snowden. \u201cHe asked me to speak about individuals and about the hope for change,\u201d Appelbaum, according to <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/snowden-did-it-for-all-of-us/a-17057251\">Deutsche Welle</a>. \u201cHe said everyone had the strength to stand up against corruption, war crimes and lies \u2013 every day and at any time.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"116e4127aaa512a71563000e5c162554cc520ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/116e4127aaa512a71563000e5c162554cc520ed1/0_245_3875_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Appelbaum at the Chaos Computer Club, a European hacker gathering, during a video conference with Julian Assange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacob Appelbaum at the Chaos Computer Club, a European hacker gathering, during a video conference with Julian Assange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Allegations against Appelbaum were first brought before the Tor board in March 2015, when a female employee <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/sources-tor-project-board-knew-about-allegations-against-jac?utm_term=.pcByo997r#.wq1DAoo0L\">approached her bosses</a> with concerns about sexual misconduct and bullying. Tor suspended her and Appelbaum for 10 days but, sources say, the employee was unable to present any evidence to support the claim. The employee then left the company.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/shari-steele-legacy-digital-rights\">Shari Steele</a> came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/11/shari-steele-tor-encryption-online-anonymity-censorship\">on board as Tor\u2019s executive director</a> in <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/announcing-shari-steele-our-new-executive-director\">December 2015</a>, one of her priorities was to deal with the allegations, Dingledine wrote in an<a href=\"https://cryptome.org/2016/06/dingledine-appelbaum-16-0602.pdf\"> internal email</a>. Steele, a trained lawyer, had worked at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) since 1992 and has a reputation for being fair and effective \u2013 if a little prone to impatience and threats when under pressure, according to former colleagues. \u201cShari\u2019s original plan was to develop a process that we could use for these situations: we\u2019d put the new process in place, ask everyone to start fresh, and then follow the process moving forward. In the meantime, we have been sending concerned people to her, so she can keep track of the big picture,\u201d Dingledine told Tor\u2019s inner circle just after the allegations were published on jacobappelbaum.net. \u201cUnfortunately, events have overtaken us.\u201d </p> <p>In February 2016, Lovecruft sent an encrypted email to Tor executives detailing more allegations of sexual abuse and harassment she had gathered from multiple victims. Tor is said to have consequently banned Appelbaum from its developer meeting at the Internet Freedom Festival in Valencia. Appelbaum claims that Steele asked him to resign on 25 <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blogs/ssteele\">May</a>, and later sent him \u201c<a href=\"https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf\">separation agreement</a>\u201d which would remove any liability from Tor. Appelbaum didn\u2019t sign. He says that he had also agreed to undertake anti-harassment training, but left Tor before that could happen. </p> <p>Tor <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project\">announced</a> his departure on 2 June and began an internal investigation. When it concluded on 27 July, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/statement-0\">Steele</a> thanked those who had come forward to report Appelbaum\u2019s behaviour. \u201cMany people inside and outside the Tor Project have reported incidents of being humiliated, intimidated, bullied and frightened by Jacob, and several experienced unwanted sexually aggressive behavior from him \u2026 I am grateful you spoke up, and I acknowledge and appreciate your courage.\u201d</p> <p>The claims against Appelbaum, as well as Tor\u2019s treatment both of him and of the alleged victims, have thrown Tor and its network of staff and dedicated volunteers into chaos. Tor has been accused of mishandling the investigation and of failing to give information about their process, and of failing to protect and support victims as well as some who say they have been unfairly implicated as accomplices of Appelbaum. Tor, a small organisation with a laser focus on internet anonymity and privacy, seems overwhelmed by the intensity of the infighting and lacking the skills to handle the severity of the accusations among its staff and volunteers. </p> <p>Appelbaum told the Guardian that Tor did not speak to him to ask his version of events during its internal investigation, while Tor claims he declined to be interviewed over the encrypted channels its investigator proposed. Another witness to the rape allegation also <a href=\"https://yawnbox.com/static/The-Tor-Project-has-lied-to-its-community.html\">claims</a> not to have been interviewed by Tor. Some of Appelbaum\u2019s <a href=\"https://shiromarieke.github.io/tor\">supporters</a> feel he was not treated fairly by the organisation, and have <a href=\"https://www.oneeyedman.net/?p=2589\">called for a boycott</a> or <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/19690\">stopped</a> working with the organisation. \u201cTor has changed from being an organization run by cypherpunks to being run by American professional activists, who care more about securing funding and their job security than the cause,\u201d says one longstanding community member. \u201cPeople are afraid to speak up in case they are ousted like the people interviewed in the investigation,\u201d says another insider. \u201cWe have very little information from Tor\u2019s leadership about the investigation and the nature of the allegations. Rather ironic for an organization promoting free speech.\u201d</p> <p>Long-term community member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/01/wikileaks-john-gilmore-guardian-internet\">John Gilmore</a>, who also co-founded EFF, claimed on an internal mailing list that Appelbaum had been put through \u201ctrial-by-rumour\u201d. \u201cThe numerous victims that this process creates are not helped at all; the innocent along with the allegedly guilty are savaged and rejected without ever getting a chance to defend themselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db23da7f09a7d3e63b8cd8cb8841eb1e948c7b46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db23da7f09a7d3e63b8cd8cb8841eb1e948c7b46/0_133_3712_2227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Appelbaum at a Berlin demonstration in support of press freedom in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacob Appelbaum at a Berlin demonstration in support of press freedom in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Britta Pedersen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In July 2016, shortly before the internal investigation concluded, Dingledine and the six other members of Tor\u2019s board of directors <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-project-elects-new-board%C2%A0-directors\">all stepped down</a>. They did not acknowledge the Appelbaum controversy, saying only that Tor deserved \u201cthe best possible leadership\u201d. \u201cIt is time that we pass the baton of board oversight as the Tor Project moves into its second decade of operations,\u201d Tor wrote on its blog. </p> <p>In a statement released to the Guardian, Tor said that the investigation had been handled \u201cthoroughly and professionally\u201d. \u201cThe board\u2019s resignation was part of a larger effort on their part to bring more professional leadership to the organization. This included hiring Shari Steele to the executive director role and bringing on a board with more nonprofit oversight experience.\u201d</p> <p>When the employee came forward with concerns in March 2015, Tor conducted an internal investigation and took action, it says, yet there were no formal procedures in place to deal with allegations of sexual harassment among staff or volunteers. Tor has since introduced an anti-harassment policy, a conflicts of interest policy, procedures for submitting complaints and an internal complaint review process.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many saw the way he treated me and did nothing about it ... so it took me years before I realized how abusive he was</p> <footer> <cite>Leigh Honeywell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tor defended its handling of the second investigation in 2016. \u201cTor handled the investigation carefully and ethically.

He hopes to focus on his doctoral work on cryptography in the Netherlands, claiming he can\u2019t return to America because he could be investigated over <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/20/wikileaks-jacob-appelbaum-google-investigation/\">his work with WikiLeaks</a> and Der Spiegel about <a href=\"http://www.cicero.de/berliner-republik/jacob-appelbaum-der-hacker-der-merkels-handy-ueberwachung-aufdeckte/57465\">classified US surveillance</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve dedicated my life as a journalist, activist, and longtime member of the Tor Project to advocating for the transparency of public processes and to speaking out about the necessity of privacy, security, and anonymity.

The definition of marriage would change: The definition of marriage in s5 of the Marriage Act would be changed to replace \u201ca man and a woman\u201d with \u201ctwo people\u201d.</p> <p>2. The conditions for a valid marriage would stay the same: It will continue to be the case that a marriage would be void if, for example, the parties are in a \u2018prohibited relationship\u2019, consent was not real, or one or both parties are not of marriageable age.</p> <p>3. Foreign same-sex marriages would be recognised in Australia: All valid marriage solemnised under the law of a foreign country, including same-sex marriages, would be recognised in Australia if they are consistent with Australian law. A foreign marriage would not be valid in Australia if the marriage would be unlawful in Australia, for example, if the parties are siblings, in a parent-child relationship, or are polygamous.</p> <p>4. Existing protections for ministers of religion would be retained and strengthened: ministers of religion would be able to refuse to solemnise a marriage on the grounds that the marriage is not the union of a man and a woman, if that refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the minister\u2019s religion, or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of the religion, or if (irrespective of the teachings of his or her church) the minister has a conscientious objection to same-sex marriage.</p> <p>5. Marriage celebrants (including those who are not ministers of religion) would be able to refuse to marry a same-sex couple: In addition to the existing law whereby marriage celebrants are under no obligation to solemnise marriage, the Marriage Act would be amended to allow marriage celebrants who are not ministers of religion to refuse, on the basis of conscientious or religious beliefs, to solemnise a marriage on the grounds that the marriage is not the union of a man or a woman. Religious bodies and religious organisations would also be able to refuse to provide facilities, goods or services for the purpose of solemnisation of a same-sex marriage, or for purposes reasonably incidental thereto, if the refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the religion, or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents to that religion.<br></p> <p>In the event that the parliament passes the plebiscite bill, the government proposes the establishment of a joint select committee to review and report on the exposure draft. The composition of the committee would be as agreed by the government, the opposition, and crossbench parties.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T22:26:18.723Z\">at 11.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fc0992e4b0a043a4c24335\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T21:36:54.900Z\">10.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stephanieando/status/785592427570606081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nats MP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/broad4mallee\">@broad4mallee</a> indicates he&#39;ll withdraw support for government if there is a vote on same-sex marriage without plebiscite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash\">#auspol</a></p>&mdash; Stephanie Anderson (@stephanieando) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephanieando/status/785592427570606081\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I am not sure whether National MP <strong>Andrew Broad</strong> means total withdrawal of support or just on this issue.

The political weather is cool with a lot of bluster this morning but let\u2019s separate out what is real and what is rhetoric.</p> <p>The concrete points:</p> <ol> <li>The <strong>attorney general, George Brandis,</strong> has released draft amendments to the Marriage Act that would go to parliament if the plebiscite passes.</li> <li>Under the amendments, the definition of marriage would be changed to replace \u201ca man and a woman\u201d with \u201ctwo people\u201d. Protections would be offered for religious organisations and celebrants involved in the marriage ceremony but not small businesses.</li> <li>Labor will meet this morning to decide their final position on the plebiscite bill that needs to pass for the plebiscite to be conducted. </li> </ol> <p>Apart from those points, these are the political points:</p> <ol> <li>Conservatives are unhappy that the amendments do not go far enough because small businesses are not offered protection on the grounds of freedom of speech \u2013 the so-called wedding cake clause.</li> <li>The LGBTI community say the amendments do not go far enough to force religious organisations to comply with the law. </li> <li>LGBTI community representatives are pushing the Labor party to oppose the plebiscite due to the fear of hate speech and the argument that no other human rights issues need to go to a plebiscite.</li> <li><strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong> said this morning that Brandis released the draft marriage amendments at 11pm last night and expected Labor to decide overnight.</li> <li>Plibersek also said \u201cmeh\u201d to the changes, given the draft bill still doesn\u2019t answer the mental health concerns of a divisive debate, nor the $200m cost of the plebiscite.</li> <li>Brandis said while Labor may complain, in his meeting with his shadow minister <strong>Mark Dreyfus</strong> and <strong>Terri Butler</strong>, Labor refused nine times to suggest what changes they would like to the plebiscite bill. They are not serious, says Brandis.</li> </ol> <p>He argued on Sky that the amendments set out the general rules of the act \u2013 the rest is up to the courts. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People will always be able to dream up borderline cases, I mean that is what courts are for to interpret acts of parliament. All we can do in acts of parliament is to explain a general rule. And the general rule we have created is an absolute exemption for ministers of religion. An absolute exemption on conscientious grounds for civil celebrants and an absolute exemption for churches and religious bodies in relation to the provision of facilities or the sale of goods or services reasonably incidental to a same-sex marriage ceremony.</p> </blockquote> <p>OK there is a whole lot more in Brandis\u2019s remarks, which I will bring you in the minute.

Noah and Josiah, 10 and 13, are carefully shaping flippers. A book about seals lies open on the sofa. This morning\u2019s activity was Zephan\u2019s idea, inspired by the boys\u2019 term-time holiday to see seal cubs on the Pembrokeshire coast.</p> <p>While other children may be fidgeting at their desks in school, these boys can take the day in whichever direction they choose. Zephan goes off to make a den; Noah picks up his Lego; Josiah decides the seal activity has more life in it and starts a&#xa0;painting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/16/councils-seek-new-powers-to-check-on-home-schooled-children\">Councils seek new powers to check on home-schooled children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is \u201cunschooling\u201d in action, a step beyond home education because children decide what they\u2019d like to learn and when. Unlike school, or more traditional types of home education, there\u2019s no curriculum, no imposed learning, no testing. The children set the agenda and pace; the aim is to learn through living.</p> <p>For Alice Khimasia, mother to Zephan, Noah, Josiah and their 14-year-old brother, Elias, this is an antidote to school. \u201cIn year 3 I started to be concerned about Elias,\u201d she says. \u201cHe seemed to lose his spark, almost like the light in his eyes went out. He seemed downcast. He stopped looking at people. He exhibited anxious behaviour.\u201d Khimasia had written off home education as \u201cweird\u201d but she and her husband, Kaushil, a supply teacher, started to research it. Then came a snowy day in January 2010: \u201cIt was the most beautiful day, clear and bright,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe boys were so excited when they woke up. So I rang school and said: \u2018The boys won\u2019t be in today, we want to play in the snow!\u2019 And we didn\u2019t go back.\u201d</p> <p>Unschooling, also known as autonomous, child-led or delight-directed learning, has spread across the world from its inception in the counter culture of 1970s America. There are no firm figures for how many children are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/12/home-schooling-parents-education-children-england\" title=\"\">home educated in the UK</a>, let alone unschooled, as there is no legal obligation for parents to register their children, but a 2015 survey put the figure at 36,609 home-educated children. The real number is likely to be much higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ef80c66f86ca59daba0002bc1b7edbb1c2368b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ef80c66f86ca59daba0002bc1b7edbb1c2368b1/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zephan, four, makes a cardboard model\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Today Zephan, four, has decided to do crafts \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anecdotally unschoolers appear to be increasing. \u201cIf you mean people taking their kids out of school and not teaching them in a structured way, that\u2019s definitely on the rise,\u201d says Simon Webb, author of Elective Home Education in the UK. \u201cOn most of the lists and the Facebook sites you can see that\u2019s the trend, to not have to teach them as they do in school.\u201d</p> <p>Khimasia\u2019s sons spend their days exploring their world. In addition to Zephan\u2019s interest in ancient Egypt, Noah\u2019s fondness for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/13/bloodhound-ssc-cockpit-1000mph-car-unveiled\" title=\"\">Bloodhound land speed record car</a>, Josiah\u2019s art and Elias\u2019s engineering, they tend an allotment, attend a woodwork class with a group of pensioners and swim with other home-educated children. For Khimasia, who trained as a teacher, unschooling has required a shift in her mindset. \u201cI\u2019ve had to let go of a lot of my thinking. I\u2019m more of a mentor, encouraging the boys to have a vision and to undertake their own projects.\u201d</p> <p>According to a 2013 study by <a href=\"http://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web.html\" title=\"\">Boston College</a> professor Peter Gray, which looked at the outcomes of 75 adults who had been unschooled as children: \u201cUnschooling benefited them for higher education and careers by promoting their sense of personal responsibility, self-motivation and desire to learn.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b06e9f5dd06dae9ed11aa6cf5d22e6b621fd059\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b06e9f5dd06dae9ed11aa6cf5d22e6b621fd059/0_279_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elias, 14, works on an engine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2026 while Elias, 14, works on an engine and plans for a future in the automotive industry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khimasia\u2019s eldest son, Elias, standing in his workshop in the back garden tinkering with the hydrogen generator he\u2019s just built, appears a particularly self-reliant young man.

He feels unschooling\u2019s emphasis on self-directed learning has made him a problem solver and given him time and space to follow his passions. \u201cMy teacher described me as the \u2018Google of engineering\u2019 because I\u2019ve had experience actually building, designing and inventing things.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/12/home-schooling-parents-education-children-england\">DIY schooling on the rise as more parents opt for home education</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet unschooling has its detractors. \u201cIf a child is really curious about the world and enthusiastic about learning, he or she can spend as long as needed to explore various topics and pick up valuable life skills,\u201d says Webb. \u201cBut some parents might not understand this method, so the child drifts, not doing much.\u201d</p> <p>Although the majority of respondents in Gray\u2019s study were positive about their unschooling experience, three were unhappy, stating they came from dysfunctional, socially isolating families. One, who grew up in the UK, wrote: \u201cI actively disagree with unschooling because I believe that it is a very easy way for unwell parents to bring their children up without needing to actively participate/integrate into society.\u201d She didn\u2019t study anything or develop a satisfactory plan for her own life, she said.</p> <p>Although the responsibility in law for children\u2019s education is with their parents, local authorities have a statutory duty to make sure all children get a suitable education. In an effort to do this the Local Government Association has called for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/16/councils-seek-new-powers-to-check-on-home-schooled-children\" title=\"\">power to compel parents to register home-educated children</a> and for the right to enter premises to see children and check the suitability of education being provided.

  "<p>In the mid-2000s, the Stung Meanchey landfill in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, had the dubious distinction of being one of the world\u2019s most famous rubbish dumps. It was, in the words of one resident, \u201chell on earth\u201d.</p> <p>Night and day, thousands of waste pickers \u2013 people who gather, sort, reuse and sell the materials others throw away \u2013 toiled on the 100-acre mound of festering rubbish. Families fashioned homes from rubbish, on top of rubbish. They ate rubbish, fought over it \u2013 and even died over it.</p> <p>Children grew up there. Now in his early 30s, Suon Vy was 10 years old when he first saw someone fatally injured. He was helping his parents rummage on the precarious heap when a dump truck careened into a neighbour from a nearby village. The man\u2019s leg was sliced off. \u201cThe older people took him to hospital but finally he died,\u201d says Suon. \u201cI saw many other accidents happen.\u201d</p> <p>There were numerous other hazards. Putrid smoke seeped from the pile and residents had to step over broken glass and medical waste \u2013 one woman even said she stumbled on aborted foetuses among the rubbish. Researchers who studied the dump found dangerous levels of cancer-causing dioxins in the soil and heavy metals in the metabolisms of children working there. People reported the afflictions common to dump life worldwide: diarrhoea, headaches, chest and stomach pain, typhoid and irritation of the skin, nose and eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/50dumps-zip/giv-1406eKsQrpDnnHLR/\" data-alt=\"World's biggest rubbish dumps\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/50dumps-zip/giv-1406eKsQrpDnnHLR/\">World's biggest rubbish dumps</a> </figure>  <p>Ry Mom, an elderly woman with thick black hair, and whose eye has turned red, put it like this: \u201cWe lived in hell because we had no choice.\u201d</p> <p>Around the world, millions of people make a living by waste picking. Some work on the city streets, pushing their carts along the pavement, often at night when there are fewer cars on the roads. Others are drawn to open dumps, where there is an abundant, concentrated supply of sellable material.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe first thing that drives people to work with waste, wherever it is, is destitution \u2013 it\u2019s poverty,\u201d explains Sonia Dias, a leading Brazilian waste expert. Another is bad governance. \u201cIf there are open dumps in a city, it is because the municipality has a lot of issues, including its ability to manage solid waste,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>In October, city leaders and development experts from around the world will convene in Quito, Ecuador, for <a href=\"https://habitat3.org/\">Habitat III</a>, a UN conference held every 20 years. The idea is for governments to share their insights into the challenges of urbanisation and sign up to a new urban agenda intended to guide policymaking over the next two decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e446419930f2ed1b30963733807ba23ff7e48c04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e446419930f2ed1b30963733807ba23ff7e48c04/317_665_5553_3331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child plays among rubbish in the slums of Stung Meanchey, Phnom Penh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Researchers found that children living in the Stung Meanchey dump had dangerous heavy metals in their metabolisms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Poppy McPherson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People like Dias, who works with the global action network <a href=\"http://wiego.org/\">Women in Informal Employment: Globalising and Organising</a>, are hoping the conference will formally recognise the value of informal workers like waste pickers. \u201cYou need to have a framework that gives people access to waste,\u201d says Dias. \u201cSo that they are not penalised for being outside the system.\u201d</p> <p>For many pickers, the labour is made worse by public scorn and punishment from the authorities who have failed to create a functioning recycling system. In Myanmar\u2019s commercial capital, Yangon, a picker who goes by the nickname Ba Ley recently described how municipal workers sometimes confiscate his cart, demanding cash to return it. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We lived in hell\u200b,\u200b because we had no choice</p> <footer> <cite>Ry Mom</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, the support often comes from NGOs. Though in some cases, charitable intentions have had unintended consequences. By 2009, the dump at Stung Meanchey had mushroomed into a full-blown slum city. \u201cBecause dump sites are very sexy, very visual, the more people know about it the more they want to go and see,\u201d explains Sebastien Marot, the founder of the not-for-profit <a href=\"http://www.friends-international.org/\">Friends International</a>. \u201cYou have TV and film crews who make a make big deal about it, then it\u2019ll attract NGOs and visitors and then it becomes hyper dysfunctional.\u201d</p> <p>As more pickers showed up, along came do-gooders of all kinds \u2013 from missionaries to sightseers on \u201cpoorism\u201d tours. \u201cIt was completely out of control,\u201d recalls Amy Hanson, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.smallstepsproject.org/about/what-we-do/\">Small Steps Project</a>, which supports children living on dumps worldwide. \u201cIt was infamous and that\u2019s not what [the government] wanted to be famous for,\u201d she adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcdd3a8b0628d0d87c644350c16c5a99d50ac5f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcdd3a8b0628d0d87c644350c16c5a99d50ac5f5/0_392_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Stung Meanchey dump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Stung Meanchey dump was closed several years ago, but many still live and work there.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Poppy McPherson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, in 2009, the Cambodian government tried to close the dump, opening another on the other side of the city. Some of the pickers migrated there. But if the authorities were expecting the others to abandon Stung Meanchey, they were wrong. In fact, more people showed up. </p> <p>The old dump is still a desperate place. Most people there continue to work as waste pickers. In the evenings, groups sit amid trampled clothes, shoes and children\u2019s toys to smoke and drink. </p> <p>Sok Phea\u2019s three-by-four-foot shack is little more than a tent; its flimsy tarp roof is propped up with bamboo poles, open to the elements on three sides. Phea, a waste picker, is raising her family here, less than 20ft from the defunct dump. \u201cThe reason I came here was so that my son and daughter could study in school,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If no one worked like us then the\u200b\u200bre would be trash everywhere.

Neeson moved to Cambodia from Hollywood after visiting the dump more than a decade ago, and says he is trying to transform the community.</p> <p>Amid makeshift shacks built from tin and wood next to or on top of the old, now moss-covered, dump, there are clusters of sturdy melded steel houses, built over the past couple of years and rented at a low cost by CCF to house some of the families. </p> <p>Click \u201csponsor a child\u201d on CCF\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cambodianchildrensfund.org/meet-the-children/\">website</a> and you can choose between a host of smiling faces; or you can even sponsor a granny. \u201cThese grannies deserve to live in dignity,\u201d the text reads.

In Manila, the gritty capital of the Philippines, the notorious Smokey Mountain rubbish dump became a magnet for poor families after an NGO established a school there, according to author Andy Mulligan.</p> <p>He wrote his novel Trash based on his experiences there. \u201cThe slum around the dumpsite started to grow as the news spread: \u2018move to Tondo \u2013 there\u2019s free food and even a school\u2019,\u201d he wrote in an email.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0da9e8ac665f241b588661be6b02000cab4d0a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0da9e8ac665f241b588661be6b02000cab4d0a8/0_119_1983_1190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children scavenge through rubbish in the notorious Smokey Mountain dump in Manila.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children scavenge through rubbish in the notorious Smokey Mountain dump in Manila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Nito/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI often say that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s humane to have people working in an open dump,\u201d says Dias. \u201cIt\u2019s a violation of human rights. But, at the same time, you also have to consider that people have to earn a livelihood. You cannot adapt without providing some source of income for people.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1990s, Dias was working with local government in Belo Horizonte, her home city. Back then, about 72% of the country\u2019s municipalities tipped their waste into open dumps \u2013 defined as places where rubbish is simply left to rot \u2013 as opposed to sanitary landfills, which are planned and by definition cannot house waste pickers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My fear is that charity closes down intelligent thinking about injustice</p> <footer> <cite>Andy Mulligan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By 2010, the percentage of municipalities tipping waste into open dumps had fallen to 50% following a mandatory closure order. For some of the waste pickers and recycling collectors, suddenly deprived of their sole source of income, life became harder. The government offered some compensation, but it was hardly a match for their jobs on the dump. Some migrated to smaller, less lucrative \u201cmini-dumps\u201d while others worked on the streets. The same year, the government passed a law ordering cities and private businesses to work with the recycling cooperatives.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s recycling collectors, known as <em>catadores</em>, have a long history of organising. There are more than 1,500 cooperatives spread across the country, together forming a national movement with powerful political force. In S\u00e3o Paolo alone, catadores pick up an estimated 90% of recyclable material.</p> <p>It started, in part, with work done by the Catholic church in the 1980s and 90s. \u201cUsually cooperatives in Brazil \u2013 the initial ones, not now \u2013 were formed by the social work that NGOs from the Catholic church did with informal recyclers,\u201d explains Dias. By 2001, the national movement was formed. As well as lobbying and securing contracts, the cooperatives attempted to help shed the stigma that surrounds their work, staging PR campaigns. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0374cac49296865e9c910415383919bbfe077b15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0374cac49296865e9c910415383919bbfe077b15/0_275_4852_2911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catadores dig through waste at the Jardim Gramacho landfill in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 before it was permanently closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catadores dig through waste at the Jardim Gramacho landfill in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 before it was permanently closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Catadores were charged with the clean-up after this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Rio. \u201cWaste pickers here, they carried the Olympic torch,\u201d says Dias. \u201cThis gives you an idea of how their profile is changing. Usually, it\u2019s politicians and athletes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of being a waste picker,\u201d says Poliana Inacio, a Brazilian woman who endured a violent past and worked at varying stages of the recycling chain on a rubbish dump before becoming a catadore leader. \u201cIt\u2019s the best job I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201d</p> <p>But the movement can\u2019t solve all Inacio\u2019s problems. The cooperative she belonged to is family-run and recently they sided with an ex-partner who abuses her, she said. Forced to leave the cooperative, she now works independently on the street, bringing the recyclables to her home and sorting them there. She squats in a shared house with no electricity and no running water. </p> <p>While the cooperative movement in Brazil has not completely spared waste pickers the hardship endured by their peers around the world, getting organised has granted the catadores a measure of something people in their line of work are often denied: dignity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2014/oct/06/world-biggest-most-dangerous-dump-sites-interactive\">The world's biggest and most dangerous dump sites \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Movements similar to Brazil\u2019s have worked \u2013 to an extent \u2013 in other vastly different cultural contexts. Cairo\u2019s <em>zabaleen</em> have gone door to door gathering waste and recyclables from households in the city for more than half a century. That long chapter might have come to an end after 2004 when the Mubarak government brought in multinational corporations to do the work. But following the revolution, they were able to form a union and successfully petitioned the authorities to bring them back into the official system in 2014.</p> <p>And in Pune, India, a worker-owned cooperative called Solid Waste Collection and Handling, born from the Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat trade union, was hired by the government in 2008. </p> <p>In Lagos, Nigeria, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/21/money-lying-streets-meet-woman-transforming-recycling-lagos-wecyclers\">the social enterprise Wecyclers works with low-income households to tackle the city\u2019s widespread waste problems</a>, collecting residents\u2019 recyclable waste in exchange for incentives.

I think the latter is more likely and that the number will continue to grow as the total of people overstaying visas, being concealed through ports, entering on forged documents or absconding from contact will exceed the number leaving voluntarily or deported.</p> <p>Tackling this caseload is massive. Scant resources are rightly focused on higher risk individuals, such as foreign-national offenders who are deported on expiry of their sentence. Over the past six years, the government has made real progress on reducing abuse, including closing the loophole of bogus colleges that saw thousands admitted without really studying. But better control now cannot reverse the fact that the system has been abused and some people are still here after many years. The vast majority of cases of illegal migration are not active and staff resources could not cope if they were.</p> <p>An appropriate amnesty would make our post-Brexit system manageable, optimise resources to focus on new cases and also strengthen border control around our lengthy coastline.

Arguments against include that it may send the wrong signal to future would-be illegal entrants, and regularising through visas many people here may lead to their dependents overseas then applying too, if the rules allow, thus increasing net migration.

As the PM headed off to Denmark and the Netherlands (for talks, not negotiations) to try to persuade two traditional EU allies of the virtues of a hard Brexit, resistance is starting to stir at home. </p> <p>First to open fire after the Conservative party conference, at which Theresa May gave the firm impression she will prioritise sovereignty and immigration controls over single market membership, was Britain\u2019s business community.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/business-leaders-urge-theresa-may-to-avoid-hard-brexit\">In an open letter to the prime minister,</a> the heads of four major business groups, including the Confederation of British Industry, said any Brexit model that denied UK firms full access to the single market should be ruled out immediately:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Leaving the EU without any preferential trade arrangement and defaulting to standard WTO rules would \u2026 do serious and lasting damage to the UK economy. The UK voted to leave the EU but not to cause living standards to decline.

Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general, said MPs should be given the chance to vote on triggering article 50.

I think there\u2019s a majority in parliament for doing that. </p> </blockquote> <p>Across the green benches, one of the most notable appointments in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s lengthy reshuffle was the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions. Starmer, touted as a future Labour leader, said his first priority would be to push for more parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has to be democratic grip of the process. At the moment, the PM is trying to manoeuvre without any scrutiny. That is why the terms on which we are going to negotiate absolutely have to be put to a vote in the house.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also put some clear water between his own views on immigration and those of the Labour leadership, which has refused to put a cap on numbers:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It should be reduced by making sure we have the skills in this country that are needed for the jobs that need to be done.

Why? Because of jobs. Millions of jobs have been created because European companies have been able to buy and sell freely to the richest consumers in the world, in the largest market in the world. Creating the single market was a painful process \u2026 A lot of politicians had to return home to their voters and admit that things would have to change. Allowing one country today to dictate its own conditions while being part of this market would probably lead to the unravelling of the whole package of hard-won compromises.

Now, says Eaton, it has, under Theresa May\u2019s government, become a statist one:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the prime minister, the leave vote was not merely a mandate to exit from the EU but to reshape domestic policy ... The UK will now acquire the control that Thatcher craved. But Brussels\u2019 social frontiers will be reimposed domestically. Free marketeers can lament their failure. But they know the tide of ideas is against them. The referendum would never have been won on a platform of open markets and open borders.

If you\u2019re not doing superhuman stints at the office, something is wrong with you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://behavioralpolicy.org/article/workplace-stressors-health-outcomes/\">Overwork has become an epidemic</a> in the western world; health officials put it in the same league as cigarette smoking regarding the damage it does to people\u2019s health. The social damage incurred by loved ones and friends can be just as bad. What can we do about it?</p> <p>It is important to realise that the problem of having a mismatched work-life relationship is not new. When work and private life was separated during the industrial revolution, the first struggle fought by employees was to reduce the length of the official working day. Life trapped inside a factory for 17 hours a day, six days a week was no life at all. <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm\">According to Karl Marx</a>, the battle over exactly when one was checked in (or not) would come to define the capitalist system, and he wasn\u2019t wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89a3c1ef64b6a403bd55844605cf7e74a477bd4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89a3c1ef64b6a403bd55844605cf7e74a477bd4a/765_0_1398_1747/800.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Marx\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">According to Karl Marx, the battle over when one checked in would come to define the capitalist system.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger-Viollet/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Certain trends are emerging which are starting to unofficially lengthen the working day once again. Now it\u2019s often impossible to distinguish between work and non-work. Take the case of spending Sunday night preparing for Monday morning. Is it work? Kind of, but I\u2019m not being paid for it and there are no bosses around. So who knows?</p> <p>With this ambiguity we see the rise of 24/7 capitalism, in which <a href=\"https://newleftreview.org/II/62/rob-lucas-dreaming-in-code\">some people even find themselves working in their dreams</a>. No, not simply dreaming about work but actually figuring out code and algorithms while asleep.</p> <p>We often think that everyone works so much because we need the money. This may well be true, given how incomes have stagnated and living costs skyrocketed in much of the western world. But several other changes have also aided this creeping colonisation of life by our jobs.</p> <p>First, it must be noted that not everybody is participating in the paid workforce, since there are still high levels of unemployment in many countries. What appears to have happened is that jobs are very unevenly distributed across society, meaning fewer people are doing more work. Those caught in the inevitable bottleneck are starting to feel the heat.</p> <p>Second, mobile technology certainly plays a role since we are always connected \u2013 sometimes obsessively so, checking emails even when unnecessary. Studies have calculated the unpaid overtime as a result, discovering that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/12094025/Workers-after-hours-emails-cancel-out-entire-annual-leave-allowance.html\">some employees cancel out their entire annual leave</a> given the extra work done online at home.</p> <p>Third, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/05/self-employed-freedom-underpaid-contractors\">the popular trend</a> of reclassifying people as self-employed and contractors encourages overwork, because you only get paid for the direct hours you put in. Since that income is typically lower than regular jobs (which is the main objective of the reclassification) people find themselves working non-stop to make ends meet. Flexible employment systems were once sold to us as a path to more time off and greater autonomy. We would all become wealthy entrepreneurs like Richard Branson. What a cruel joke that turned out to be.<br></p> <p>And fourth, our society is currently gripped by a pervasive ideology of work. It is continuously preached to us as the pinnacle of human virtue. If you\u2019re not doing superhuman stints at the office then something is wrong with you. And don\u2019t even mention the word unemployed \u2026 that\u2019s blasphemy.</p> <p>The most worrying facet about the ideology of work is this: we are obliged to toil even when it\u2019s not really necessary in concrete, economic terms. Appearing super-busy becomes more about fulfilling a societal expectation than doing something useful to society. This can result in major dysfunctions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/jan/26/seven-ways-improve-work-life-balance\">Work less, do more: seven ways to improve your work-life balance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People encouraged to look as if they are always doing something ironically become less productive. Recent research <a href=\"http://www.deliberate.rest/?page_id=2 \">has convincingly demonstrated</a> that rest and shorter work-days can allow us to work much faster and smarter compared with the excruciating and ultimately needless marathons that are currently the norm.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, some employees invariably begin to fake these long hours given how difficult it is to pull off in reality. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-some-men-pretend-to-work-80-hour-weeks\">A study of management consultants</a> in the US discovered that some workers devised ingenious ways to give the impression that they were following the 80-hour rule.</p> <p>Sure, this corporate camouflage allowed the consultants to pick up their kids from football and eat a meal. But maybe it also helped get the work done successfully and on time. Here we see productivity (performing a task well) and the culture of work (staying in the office till late) strangely diverge.</p> <p>Most employers realise that something is amiss, but the ideology of work seems stronger now than ever. Some people have even convinced themselves that they love being wedded to their job 24/7, what researchers label <a href=\"https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-10/workaholism-%E2%80%93-21st-century-addiction\">\u201centhusiastic workaholics\u201d</a>.

They can\u2019t even think about a vacation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/sep/07/america-vacation-workaholic-culture-labor-day\">without having a panic attack</a>.</p> <p>The trouble with much work-life balance advice is that it\u2019s been captured by the self-help movement. It all centres on the individual. If you want to rekindle your wellbeing and discover your inner potential, then take control of your choices, find a job that better fits your temperament, erect firm boundaries between work and leisure and learn to say no.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Confronting work-mania as an individual is pointless. We need to come together</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This gives an unrealistic picture of what is possible in most jobs, and would probably end with an untimely trip to the Jobcentre if taken seriously. In other words, work-life balance gurus assume that everyone is a middle-aged creative type, living in London with family money to fall back on, and firmly within their rights to tell the boss to bother off. Yeah, right.</p> <p>The trick is to see the ritual of overwork as a societal pressure, not an individual fault. And much of this pressure stems from the disempowerment of the workforce that has occurred over the last 20 years. Insecurity \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 naturally makes it more likely that people will sacrifice everything for their job. That\u2019s why confronting work-mania as an individual is pointless. We need to come together as a group to voice these concerns if progressive policy and legislation are to be forged. Otherwise little will change.</p> <p>Want a heathier work-life balance? Join a union. Or better still, create your own. But steer clear of that self-help section at the airport bookshop. It pretends the ideology of work might still be tamed by individual willpower.

Added to that, more than 2,500 black-on-black shootings last year, more than 350 of them fatal.</p> <p>As ever with a war, the cause \u2013 or causes \u2013 are disputed. <strong>Reggie Yates: Life and Death in Chicago</strong> (BBC1) set out to discover who is responsible for the carnage. Truth be told, it did a less than stellar job at providing more that the barest outline of America\u2019s ongoing and apparently increasingly (or possibly just increasingly filmed, which is about all we\u2019ve got left to hope for in this godforsaken world) police brutality problem. Yates\u2019s skill is in his unforced interest in his subjects and his absolute honesty and naturalness as a presenter, rather than in delineating arguments or setting out a sociological stall. But if it failed to unpick the problem, it at least provided a wealth of valuable stories from victims\u2019 families, who have historically gone unheard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">The Counted: people killed by police in the United States \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the stories are unbelievable.

No matter. The deal is: a tenement still standing in the East End has been got up with grime, straw pallets and every other slumcoutrement short of cholera.

  "<p>It\u2019s a tale of first contact: in the autumn of 1770, two members of the Gweagal people stood on the shore of the place that would come to be called Botany Bay and watched warily while a boat paid for by the British navy approached the shore.</p> <p>One of the men on the boat was Captain James Cook, who would soon be credited with discovering the place where the Gweagal people and people from more than 200 other nations had lived for millennia.</p> <p>Both men on the shore carried shields and spears and used them to warn the intruders to stay away.

  "<h2><strong>Ambulance </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>This week on the medical documentary series, paramedic Rich is called to Brixton, where a man who has taken an overdose has become violent. It\u2019s just one of the incidents taking place when the pubs and bars start to either fill up or kick out on a Saturday night. But the service is stretched thin, with five babies being delivered by cool-headed call handlers across the city. When a call to attend a miscarriage comes in, it takes an emotional toll on all involved. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>National Treasure </strong><br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Along with the superb performances from Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and Andrea Riseborough, the key to the success of Jack Thorne\u2019s drama has been the carefully sustained ambiguity of Paul Finchley\u2019s position. Even if Finchley is found innocent in the eyes of the law, what does his behaviour say about the entitlement and impunity of celebrity culture? In tonight\u2019s final episode, will we be offered some answers as Finchley takes to the witness stand? <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Damned </strong><br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Jo Brand co-writes and stars in this downbeat but lovely social workers comedy. The third episode sees Al (Alan Davies) being sent to help a gay couple who are being hassled by locals, and Nitin (Himesh Patel) managing to get stuck in an air vent while trying to handle a hostage situation. The subject matter allows the scattering of some very real-world grit in among the frequent laughs, with Isy Suttie\u2019s jarring temp a particular highlight. <em>Grace Rahman</em></p> <h2><strong>Divorce </strong><br>10.10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Frances, a woman on the verge of divorce, in this new series written by Sharon Horgan. Frances lives in a world where the women are wicked and the men are 50 shades of boring. As an eventful birthday party provides a catalyst for change, her husband Robert (Thomas Haden Church) emerges as the real star. The couples\u2019 small moments of hatred are so sharply observed it hurts, and the whole thing is uncomfortably funny. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2><strong>Great Continental Railway Journeys</strong> <br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Another outing with Michael Portillo, who has pretty much completed his transformation from rightwing bruiser to Joanna Lumley\u2019s understudy. Tonight he travels from Genoa to the Austrian Alps, learning how football was introduced to the port city by a Brit. After that, he takes a clifftop train ride along the Riviera Di Levante and winds up in Brenner Pass, where one of the world\u2019s longest railway tunnels is being constructed. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>Eamonn &amp; Ruth: How The Other Half Lives</strong> <br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The breakfast telly favourites continue their exploration of the richest people on the planet, seeming overly awestruck by supercars, properties and even pricey ice-cream. That said, this is not a programme exploring the world\u2019s disquieting wealth gap, but rather a look at what those kajillions can get you. This week, they\u2019re in the company of poker pro Liv Boeree and Michael Acton Smith, creator of kids\u2019 franchise Moshi Monsters. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Feed the Beast</strong> <br>9pm, AMC</h2> <p>Even the appearance of The Wire\u2019s John Doman as a racist businessman can\u2019t enliven this David Schwimmer vehicle about two friends looking to open a Greek restaurant in the Bronx. They were hoping to spin this premise out for several seasons, but it was cancelled after one. In this opener, Schwimmer\u2019s Tommy struggles to raise his traumatised son, while cocky buddy Dion (Jim Sturgess) is released from jail but now has to dodge the Polish mafia. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Body of Lies</strong> (Ridley Scott, 2008), 10.05pm, ITV4</p> <p>Not one of Ridley Scott\u2019s best, but an absorbing excursion into Jason Bourne territory. Leonardo DiCaprio is a CIA operative sent to the Middle East by his handler Russell Crowe to track down a terrorist leader (read: Bin Laden), but getting involved in turf wars with suave Jordanian intelligence chief Mark Strong. The acting convinces, even if the plot doesn\u2019t, although it serves as a peg for some sweaty tension and action. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Wuthering Heights</strong> (Andrea Arnold, 2011), 1.10am, Film4</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a1ff552d021a793e50583f33a1ed1d75f3349ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a1ff552d021a793e50583f33a1ed1d75f3349ac/0_112_3563_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wuthering Heights.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wuthering Heights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artificial Eye</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrea Arnold brings real conviction to her adaptation of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s classic. This is the first version that makes overt the latent suggestion that Heathcliff is African Caribbean (he\u2019s played by Solomon Glave as a youth and James Howson when older), emphasising the transgressive nature of his love for Catherine (Shannon Beer and Kaya Scodelario).

The new home secretary, Amber Rudd, went to Heathrow in July to see how her Border Force performs. She might have expected our biggest port to be the best run, and on her visit she saw all the desks fully manned, with minimal queues at passport control and plenty of smiles.</p> <p>What she probably wasn\u2019t told was how many of those desks were staffed by people pulled in from everywhere else, including HMRC tax officers from Newcastle, who were put up in hotels. (Can HMRC spare them, when they are only <a href=\"%EB%BC%8A\">checking 4%</a> of self-assessment tax forms?)</p> <p>Had she asked staff about their workloads, they probably wouldn\u2019t have told the truth, governed as they are by a regime of terror and targets. I spoke to some Border Force staff, on condition of strictest anonymity, meeting them miles away from Heathrow for fear of disciplinary action if they were caught talking to a journalist. With no culture of transparency, this service punishes whistleblowers.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what they told me: after the public row over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/09/heathrow-passport-queues-london-olympics\">gigantic queues</a> before the 2012 Olympics, strict targets were set: non-EU passengers must queue for no more than 45 minutes, EU for 25 minutes, and fast-track first class just 15 minutes. These targets must be met 95% of the time.</p> <p>At present, they are met 70% of the time, and staff shortages mean that civil servants brought in from elsewhere get just a few days\u2019 training. \u201cAll they can do is a basic passport scan,\u201d say these whistleblowers. \u201cTraining and experience matter. We can feel whether something is wrong about who they say they are, where they\u2019ve been, for how long and how often.

Many more passengers are coming through and we don\u2019t have time to scrutinise them. Sorry. Did you vote for these cuts?\u201d</p> <p>With everyone manning the desks, paperwork piles up behind the scenes: asylum claims are rising again and people stopped can wait hours to be checked. Staff are taken off customs: \u201cGuns and drugs don\u2019t matter as much as queues,\u201d one officer says. They sometimes fail to claim the \u00a32,000 fines from airlines that bring people in with inadequate documentation because they miss a five-day deadline for claims.</p> <p>Staff hired now are on new contracts, with flexible annualised hours so they can be made to work overtime, extra days or to cancel holidays at short notice, \u201ca nightmare for parents with childcare\u201d, I was told.

  "<p>It\u2019s not often Margaret Thatcher is quoted in support of structural feminist arguments for fairness. She wasn\u2019t actually talking about women when she said \u201cthere is no liberty without economic liberty\u201d.<br></p> <p> But when it comes to explaining gender inequality in Australia, the words, at least, are right. Two alarming reports that have surfaced in the past fortnight expose the economic bedrock on which the material disadvantage of Australian women is perpetuated.</p> <p> The first? Last week we learned that single women on average pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/04/apartment-rent-in-sydney-and-melbourne-beyond-reach-of-many-women\">can\u2019t afford to live alone</a> in Sydney or in most Melbourne suburbs, the two most populous cities in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/04/apartment-rent-in-sydney-and-melbourne-beyond-reach-of-many-women\">Apartment rent in Sydney and Melbourne beyond reach of many women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second? That the industry that educates children in early childhood \u2013 and which in Australia just happens to be 95% female \u2013 employs workers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/07/childcare-employee-pay-too-low-to-be-able-to-start-family-union-says\">\u201con such low pay that they can not start a family, travel, or successfully apply for a mortgage\u201d.</a></p> <p>These workers are not alone. Australian law has obliged employers to pay women and men equally for the same work<a href=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/content/pdf/sex_discrim/equal_pay.pdf\"> since 1969</a>, yet the disparities in what we pay industries dominated by female workers compared to those employing male ones exposes how deeply the gendered structural inequalities remain. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-16/young-gender-pay-gap/5026096\">Nareen Young wrote in 2013</a> that \u201cwomen\u2019s work has never been seen as meritorious or valuable as men\u2019s\u201d. It\u2019s now 2016, and the traditionally female-dominated professions of care work, community work, healthcare, human services, education, retail, food services and accommodation work pay less than male dominated fields of construction, engineering, mining and finance.</p> <p> Some people insist that the pay disparity results from a somewhat incredible worldwide coincidence that statistically significant numbers of women pursue work with low pay. Gendered stereotypes excuse the poor pay of female-dominated industries on the fanciful basis that women don\u2019t seek work for money so much as for the happy, positive feelings aroused by underpaid industrial servitude. Evidence, alas, demonstrates that devaluing stereotypes follow women into the workplace \u2013 because once women enter an industry, the pay drops. </p> <p>Equal rights to education and opportunity remain gestures towards equality and not outcomes while <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/Gender_Pay_Gap_Factsheet.pdf\">women continue to earn less</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/05/low-paid-women-have-42-less-super-than-men-on-same-income-data-shows\">retire with less</a>. This confluence of circumstances denies women the means to live independently, almost 90 years after Virginia Woolf wrote A Room of One\u2019s Own. And it encourages economic dependencies that can compromise gender equality in debilitating \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 ways.</p> <p>The ongoing underpayment of early childhood educators illustrates two simultaneous disadvantages felt by Australian women. Arguments against raising pay in this industry to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/04/dog-groomers-make-more-per-hour-than-women-who-educate-children\">comparable standard enjoyed by men with similar qualifications</a>, such as construction workers or plasterers, are made by the private childcare operators who complain of limitations on profit opportunities in an industry where <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/04/28/childs-play-is-there-a-sustainable-business-in-kids-care/\">wages account for two-thirds of operating costs</a>. </p> <p> But this argument itself is proof of the structural inequity that overburdens Australian women \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/07/a-childcare-announcement-is-sexist-must-be-opposite-day\">yes, women</a> \u2013 with responsibility for integrating their working lives \u2013 the hours they can work and the kind of jobs they can commit to doing \u2013 around care obligations. Running childcare as profit-making businesses restricts the service to those who can meet its costs, denying the community universal gains of the better education for all children. </p> <p>It also impacts women\u2019s productivity. In nations with childcare that\u2019s affordable, well-organised and supported by the state, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/21/france-population-europe-fertility-rate\">such as France and the the Scandinavian nations</a>, the female workforce participation rate is higher, and incidentally, so is the birth rate. According to the Grattan Institute, increasing the female workforce participation rate by a mere <a href=\"https://www.acci.asn.au/news/women-s-participation-helps-businesses-and-economy-thrive\">6 percentage points is enough to add $25bn of value</a> to Australia\u2019s GDP. </p> <p>There are few working Australian women unfamiliar with the <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/Opinion/Childlessness-the-revolution-we-had-to-have/2005/05/08/1115491042240.html  http://www.theage.com.au/news/Opinion/Childlessness-the-revolution-we-had-to-have/2005/05/08/1115491042240.html\">\u201cjuggle struggle\u201d</a> of managing their jobs with family responsibilities \u2013 the term itself has been a feature of the national discourse for more than a decade. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/25/the-tampon-tax-is-not-a-marginal-issue-its-the-force-of-structural-sexism-at-work\">The 'tampon tax' is not a marginal issue - it's the force of structural sexism at work | Gabrielle Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as we try to unpick the social threads that facilitate female vulnerability to family violence, we have to recognise that these restrictions on women\u2019s economic liberty \u2013 low pay, lack of housing options and care obligations \u2013 coalesce into situations that structurally diminish women\u2019s social status and oblige women into vulnerable living situations. </p> <p>The University of Wisconsin revealed in research from 2012 that women who are financially dependent on their partners are more likely to be abused by them, that they\u2019re less likely to leave these abusers, and even \u201c<a href=\"http://fyi.uwex.edu/financialseries/files/2012/02/Financial-Capability-and-Domestic-Violence.pdf\">the degree of women\u2019s economic dependence on an abuser is associated with the severity of the abuse they suffer</a>\u201d. Economic abuse and enforced poverty is, of course, a form of controlling cruelty in itself.</p> <p> It\u2019s necessary for feminism to promote the ascendancy of women to equal positions of power and influence as enjoyed by men \u2013 but electing Margaret Thatcher prime minister hardly ended gender inequality in Britain. The only meaningful redress is comprehensive structural change to create material parity. This is what will allow women to enjoy the same independence as men. </p> <p> And right now, we don\u2019t have it. Single working women on average wages in Sydney and most of Melbourne cannot afford to live alone. Men can. Does that look anything like fairness to you? </p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 12 October 2016 to correctly attribute the figures regarding the boost to the economy of increasing female workforce participation rates to the Grattan Institute. </em><br></li> </ul>",
