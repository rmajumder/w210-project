  "<p>Almost every group with a financial, intellectual or ethical interest in salvaging a workable climate policy is now deep in an urgent debate about how Australia can break a decade of policy paralysis. Everyone except the Turnbull government, that is.<br></p> <p>The debate, involving big business, small business, investors, the government\u2019s own independent climate advisers, academics, environmentalists, the welfare lobby and the unions, is predicated on the obvious conclusion that our policy \u2013 as it stands \u2013 cannot deliver the cuts to greenhouse emissions that are domestically necessary and which Australia has promised internationally. </p> <p>But like the emperor with no clothes, continuing with the grand parade even after the whole crowd has finally declared him naked, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/australia-needs-two-emissions-trading-schemes-climate-change-authority-says\">new environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, still insists Australia is \u201ctransitioning successfully with the policies we already have in place\u201d. </a></p> <p>Every stakeholder is hoping \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-greg-hunt-coalition-emissions-trading-scheme\">based on plenty of nudges and winks from Frydenberg\u2019s predecessor Greg Hunt</a> \u2013 that a review scheduled for next year will turn the existing Direct Action policy into a workable policy, probably a type of emissions trading scheme. Labor\u2019s election policy edged closer to what the Coalition\u2019s policy could eventually become, offering, according to the Business Council of Australia, a \u201cbridge to bipartisanship\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/australia-needs-two-emissions-trading-schemes-climate-change-authority-says\">Australia needs two emissions trading schemes, Climate Change Authority says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Frydenberg has now described the 2017 review as a \u201csit rep\u201d (situation report), insisting no major changes are under consideration. His language is stuck back in the \u201cclimate wars\u201d, like the late night rerun of a particularly bad movie. This week he revived the long-discredited claim that Labor\u2019s proposed higher greenhouse gas reduction target would increase electricity prices by 78%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/27/why-coalition-climate-scare-campaign-is-not-credible-and-makes-no-sense\">The supposed authors have described that calculation as \u201cincorrect\u201d and \u201cweird and misleading\u201d.</a></p> <p>It was just another example of the gaping chasm between the government\u2019s lines and the argument everyone else is having. </p> <p>The government\u2019s own independent advisory body, the Climate Change Authority, released a report on Thursday, which was also based on the premise that policy will have to change very significantly, and it has recommended a version of emissions trading for the electricity sector and a much more rigorous \u201cDirect Action\u201d style policy for high-polluting industry.</p> <p>This was not the musing of what conservative warriors like to deride as the \u201cgreen left\u201d but rather the first report from the authority since Tony Abbott made several appointments to its board, including John Sharp, a former Nationals minister; Wendy Craik, a former National Farmers Federation executive director; Kate Carnell, a former chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Danny Price, the economist who modelled Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s old climate policy and was on Greg Hunt\u2019s advisory panel.</p> <p>In the real world, the report sparked a furious discussion about whether the recommendations were aiming for sufficiently ambitious targets. The Business Council of Australia (BCA) and other business groups welcomed it, but as Guardian Australia revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/climate-change-authority-splits-over-ets-report-commissioned-by-coalition\">two CCA board members, Clive Hamilton and David Karoly, will release</a> a dissenting report arguing that its recommendations were inadequate to meet Australia\u2019s international obligations. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-climate-change-authoritys-gamble-on-political-pragmatism-64745?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20September%202%202016%20-%205533&amp;utm_content=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20September%202%202016%20-%205533+CID_6557c80e56cf4887f5662e7a7c065ff8&amp;utm_source=campaign_monitor&amp;utm_term=The%20Climate%20Change%20Authoritys%20gamble%20on%20political%20pragmatism\">Many other respected analysts and some environment groups made similar criticisms.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-greg-hunt-coalition-emissions-trading-scheme\">Hunt plays the long game on his glaringly obvious emissions trading scheme | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while this argument raged, Frydenberg implied there was no need for any change at all, insisting the report was just something the government had been forced to commission to get the votes of the Palmer United party for its \u201cDirect Action\u201d, a policy that was working just swimmingly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the \u201cclimate roundtable\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/29/australian-climate-policy-paralysis-has-to-end-business-roundtable-says\">an unprecedented alliance of business, welfare and environmental groups, and trade unions, which began secret meetings in 2014 </a>to try to break the political impasse over climate policy and emerged publicly in 2015 \u2013 is again actively lobbying both major parties.</p> <p>The group, which includes the BCA, the AI group, the Australian Aluminium Council, the Climate Institute, the Australian Council on Social Service, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Australian Conservation Foundation, WWF, the Australian Energy Council and the ACTU, has recently written to Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten, reminding the leaders that a bipartisan workable policy is more urgent than ever, and that they will not give up their efforts.</p> <p>That line-up would provide pretty useful backing (and cover) for both big parties if they wanted to reach a compromise \u2013 if, of course, the impediment to that compromise was actually public opinion.</p> <p>But, as with so many policy areas flummoxing this government, the real impediment to reaching what Turnbull calls the \u201csensible centre\u201d is the rightwing of his own party.</p> <p>With so many voices telling them, Turnbull and Frydenberg obviously know that Direct Action in its current form is no longer even passable as a fig leaf. </p> <p>But on this, above all other issues, Turnbull also understands the threat from the conservative right.</p> <p>And in case the horrors of 2009 were fading in his memory, Tony Abbott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/tony-abbott-urges-turnbull-to-pursue-reform-to-counter-populist-politics\">emerged last week</a> with a speech reminding Turnbull what was expected.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the government will strongly support the coal industry which will provide base load power here and abroad for decades to come \u2013 and continue to employ tens of thousands of Australians.

  "<p>In the premier\u2019s room of the Queensland parliament, under the gaze of a portrait of Joh Bjelke-Petersen, a once unthinkable spectacle took place this week.</p> <p>An audience that included pillars of the establishment \u2013 a supreme court judge, a top bureaucrat, government ministers \u2013 burst into applause at words that cut to the quick on a passage of history barely known by most Queenslanders, the role of the Native Police in the state\u2019s \u201csettlement\u201d.</p> <p>The words came from Sam Watson, an Indigenous activist who spent his youth fighting to get through parliament\u2019s gates in protest clashes with the ultra-conservative state premier\u2019s police.</p> <p>Watson \u201cnever dreamed we\u2019d be sitting on the inside\u201d facing the first Indigenous woman in parliament, Leeane Enoch, let alone holding court on the state-sanctioned killing that underpinned the whole Queensland enterprise.</p> <p>Chastising fellow panel members for using \u201cwords like colonisation and settlement\u201d, Watson was emphatic.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s blatant war and genocide.

ambushes and reprisals alongside waves of land-stealing pastoralists over the last third of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. </p> <p>Estimates of the numbers of Aboriginal men, women and children they killed ranged from 10,000 to 60,000, Mark Finnane, a Griffith university professor of history, said.</p> <p>It was widely agreed among historians that the \u201cintensity of the killing\u201d of Aboriginal people on the Queensland frontier was worse than anywhere else in Australia, Finnane said \u2013 in part due to the timing and rapid expansion of the \u201csettlement\u201d.</p> <p>Curtis

occur in our communities is the nation doesn\u2019t actually understand what happened,\u201d Davis said.</p> <p>It was widely accepted internationally that the path to moving forward with reconciliation after gross national trauma was based on two \u201cpillars \u2026 truth and justice\u201d.</p> <p>The very first step towards this involved the \u201cventilation\u201d of this history

denial and resistance to having conversations about our history.\u201d</p> <p>Davis questioned the lack of \u201ctraction\u201d on the discussion despite the fading of the so-called history wars, in which conservatives sought to contest a \u201cblack armband\u201d view of history. </p> <p>Finanne said in the wake of the history wars, research into mass killings of Indigenous people on the Australian frontier had accelerated. </p> <p>He said \u201cmajor cultural institutions, especially museums\u201d had a leading role to play in bringing these stories into public consciousness.</p> <p>The question of whether Indigenous people were the victims of genocide was one that \u201chistorians shy away from, lawyers say it probably wasn\u2019t, but always gets bogged down in a debate around intent\u201d, Davis said.</p> <p>She believed there was \u201csufficient evidence to suggest in theatres of war on the continent the intent was there\u201d and that \u201cmost Aboriginal people would agree that it was genocide\u201d.</p> <p>But until there was a formal mechanism in place to \u201cproperly deal with the history and evidence\u201d \u2013 something like a truth and reconciliation commission \u2013 \u201cthis debate just goes round in circles\u201d, Davis said.</p> <p>The establishment of such a body was seen as an almost \u201cpedestrian\u201d move towards

said he was surprised this formal process of reckoning had not already been taken up in Queensland by the very body under whose authority the Native Police originally carried out mass murder: state parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be warranted because this [the Native Police] was not a secret body, it was established by law and by Queensland parliament. There\u2019s an important role for parliament and government to play,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A Queensland university of technology law review article last year argued that the very least the Palaszczuk government should do is apologise formally for genocide, better detail its history in school curriculums, and place monuments at massacre sites.</p> <p>Watson went further, saying not only should the government acknowledge the past, it should appoint \u201ca panel of Aboriginal elders to review all material and issue indictments against those responsible for those massacres\u201d.</p> <p>As the portrait of Watson\u2019s onetime adversary Bjelke-Petersen looked on, these words from the Indigenous activist brought the night\u2019s loudest applause: \u201cUntil white Australia acknowledges that fact that they\u2019re on this country [that\u2019s] drenched with the blood and suffering of our mob, and this land is stolen \u2026 then don\u2019t even bother having reconciliation marches.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The local policeman who first investigated the suspected \u201chonour\u201d killing of a British woman in Pakistan has been arrested on suspicion of suppressing evidence and allowing key suspects to flee the country. <br></p> <p>Abubakar Khuda Bakhsh, the head of a special team set up to investigate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/03/alleged-honour-killing-victim-samia-shahid-murdered-pakistani-police-confirm\">the death of Bradford-born Samia Shahid</a>, said Aqeel Abbas, the station house officer of Mangla police station, was detained on \u201chard evidence of obstructing justice\u201d. \u201cHe helped people escape the country who were wanted in the case of Samia,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite clear instructions, he let them go.\u201d</p> <p>The police are seeking the return of Shahid\u2019s mother and sister to Pakistan for questioning. Bakhsh said his report alleges that Shahid was first raped by her former husband Chaudhry Shakeel and then strangled to death with the assistance of her father Muhammad Shahid on 20 July.</p> <p>Several family members are accused of conspiring to trick Shahid into travelling to Pandori, their ancestral village in Punjab province, on the pretext that her father was gravely ill. It is alleged that the family felt that Bradford-born Shahid had flouted the patriarchal culture and religious mores of small-town Punjab.</p> <p>Not only did she divorce Shakeel, a cousin she had been pressured into marrying, but she proceeded to marry Mukhtar Syed Kazam, a man who belonged to both a different clan and, as a Shia, a different Islamic sect. Kazam, fearing for her safety, had begged her not to travel from their home in Dubai to Pakistan, but she went on 14 July.</p> <p>Both Shakeel and Muhammad Shahid are currently being held on judicial remand and are likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/samia-shahid-killing-father-and-ex-husband-appear-in-pakistan-court\">to be formally charged at their next court hearing on September 8</a>.</p> <p>In a country where a huge number of \u201chonour\u201d killings are thought to go unreported or unpunished, Shahid\u2019s case is unusual for attracting high-powered scrutiny. A special investigation team led by Bakhsh was set up by the chief minister of Punjab after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/naz-shah-bradford-mp-accuses-pakistani-officials-of-samia-shahid-cover-up\">Bradford MP Naz Shah raised her concerns</a> with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister.</p> <p>Initially, local police had accepted the family\u2019s claims that the healthy 28-year-old had died of unknown causes on the stairs of her former husband\u2019s house in Pandori where her father, a Bradford businessman, holds influence.</p> <p>Abbas, the station house officer, initially told the Guardian and other media that there were no signs of physical injury on Shahid\u2019s body when it was discovered, but photos of her body and a leaked autopsy report later showed she was found with vivid bruising around her neck.</p> <p>\u201cFrom physical signs, it was clear she was strangled,\u201d said Bakhsh. \u201cA person like [Abbas], with 20 years\u2019 service, must have known that. He was playing it down.\u201d</p> <p>Another police official said Abbas is also believed to have accepted a payment of 500,000 rupees (\u00a33,600) from Shakeel and allowed him to leave. He later reappeared after acquiring \u201cpre-arrest bail\u201d, a legal move that hindered the police investigation. The inquiry team said they matched Shakeel\u2019s DNA to semen collected from Shahid\u2019s corpse, which suggested that she had been raped.</p> <p>Although her family have refused to acknowledge her divorce from Shakeel in 2014, Bakhsh said his team were satisfied that she was legally separated under British law.</p>",

An important factor to take away is that Klinsmann really has a few offensive weapons at his disposal, and this is without Dempsey or Zardes. Bobby Wood is incredibly consistent, Kjlestan is an assist king and Bedoya fits in his role very nicely in the middle of the park. But I have to say, today was all about Pulisic. He was on the field for 15-20 minutes and really caused so many headaches.

Last year in St Louis, USA won 6-1 thanks to a brace from Jozy Altidore and goals from Bobby Wood, Fabian Johnson, Geoff Cameron and Gyasi Zardes. This time around they will have to do without the latter (injured for the rest of the season) as well as Clint Dempsey but the timing seems to favor America as Altidore - who will captain the team today - is in fine form, scoring five goals for Toronto FC in the last seven matches. A possible partnership with Bobby Wood alongside an eager Jordan Morris makes for an interesting encounter.</p> <p>Despite the fact that playing away from home always offers a higher level of difficulty for any team, this should really be a game where the US takes all three points - anything less than that is a huge failure. This doesn\u2019t mean that Klinsmann should take them lightly, it is after all a historic occasion for the island as they have announced half a day off for all citizens so they can watch the game. Their team will do everything in their power to make it extremely difficult for the visitors. St Vincent and the Grenadines - known as Vincy Heat - are an extremely athletic group and blessed with pace and despite the fact that they can\u2019t qualify for the next round, a victory against the US would be an incredible achievement for this small island nation. According to a 2013 Census, the island\u2019s population is 103,000 - that\u2019s basically the same as Tyler in Texas.</p> <p>PS: Watch out for Morris\u2019s teammate, Oalex Anderson. The 20-year-old Seattle Sounders attacker scored the only goal for Vincy Heat when they lost 6-1 last year.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be back with line-ups and kick-off.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

I didn\u2019t play that well during that period and managed to come through it, thankfully, and play some good stuff in the second and third sets.</p> <p>\u201cI served at like 40, 42% first serves or something and still won in straight sets. I must have been doing things well other than serving. I was obviously hitting the ball pretty well and returning pretty good. But I could serve better, for sure. I only got broken once in a game where I had game points.

  "<p>Two very different women hold Europe\u2019s future in their hands \u2013 and neither of them is Theresa May.

Merkel has been in power <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/11/germany.topstories3\" title=\"\">since 2005</a> and is trying to remain there, while Le Pen may dream of being in office but has never approached it (last year her party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/front-national-fails-to-win-control-of-target-regions-amid-tactical-voting\" title=\"\">failed to take control</a> of a single French region in local elections). Some may ask: why would a French opposition figure count more than the man currently sitting in the Elys\u00e9e Palace? But Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has become so weak \u2013 even more so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/frances-economy-minister-emmanuel-macron-resigns\" title=\"\">with this week\u2019s resignation of his economics minister, Emmanuel Macron</a> \u2013 and terrorism has transformed French politics to such a degree that Le Pen\u2019s prospects now stand out as a key defining factor of where France, and Europe for that matter, may be heading.</p> <p>It is only partly reassuring to say that Le Pen has little chance of becoming president next year (the French electoral system makes that difficult). The trouble is, in recent months, her brand of anti-Muslim, xenophobic and nationalistic politics has spread across the French mainstream right like wildfire. Le Pen is fast capitalising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/burkini-ban-france-failed-minorities-muslim\" title=\"\">on this summer\u2019s burkini episode</a> and on the national trauma left by jihadi terrorism.

Le Pen hates Merkel, and Merkel despises Le Pen. They confront each other in a fight of European proportions. Le Pen has often attacked the chancellor \u2013 once describing her as an \u201cempress\u201d imposing \u201cillegal immigration\u201d on the whole of Europe. Merkel sees Le Pen as an acute political threat to Europe, although she has rarely mentioned her in public. If France embraces the far right, the wider impact will be far more serious than it was with, say, Hungary\u2019s illiberal slide.</p> <p>Merkel and Le Pen have never met, nor have they had any reason to. Once, last year, they sat not far from each other in the European Parliament chamber \u2013 but Merkel kept her gaze away, out of contempt. That day, Le Pen furiously lashed out at Hollande, describing him as a subdued \u201cvice-chancellor of Germany\u201d, after he\u2019d denounced populism in a speech.</p> <p>These two women have one thing in common and one thing only: the depth of their political conviction. Angela Merkel has been unwavering in her message that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/refugees-did-not-bring-terrorism-to-germany-says-angela-merkel\" title=\"\">welcoming refugees is the right thing to do</a>; Le Pen fumes against \u201crampant Islamisation\u201d of the continent. Merkel wants to save the European project; Le Pen is fully aligned with forces that want to dismantle it (she recently said on CNN that France had become an EU \u201cprovince\u201d). Merkel nurtures the transatlantic link; Le Pen admires Putin\u2019s Russia \u2013 her party sits at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/08/russia-europe-right-putin-front-national-eu\" title=\"\">pro-Kremlin networks in Europe</a>, financial ones among them. Le Pen\u2019s ideology draws from France\u2019s historical far right, the ideas of Charles Maurras and colonial racism; Merkel is the daughter of a Protestant pastor for whom individual freedoms are paramount values. Le Pen has always made much about being divorced and smoking cigarettes (trying to cast herself in the image of a modern woman); Merkel\u2019s personal style is more subdued, which isn\u2019t to say her character is less ironclad.</p> <p>For decades what drove the European project was the so-called \u201cFranco-German engine\u201d. It is now all but broken \u2013 mainly because of France\u2019s economic weaknesses, which have severely unbalanced the relationship. What now drives European politics is a different kind of Franco-German equation, one in which Merkel, often faulted for her eurozone policies, has on several occasions attempted to give France\u2019s socialist government some financial breathing space against Le Pen \u2013 including by sparing France the wrath of the EU commission for disrespecting deficit targets.</p> <p>Merkel\u2019s anti-Le Pen strategy has largely been discreet. But in May she made it very plain. Speaking at Berlin\u2019s French lycee, she said she would try to make sure \u201cother political forces are stronger than the Front National, if that can be accomplished from abroad\u201d. It was an unusually blunt statement. Le Pen\u2019s supporters immediately <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/marine-le-pen-angela-merkel-front-national-germany-455974?rm=eu\" title=\"\">accused the chancellor of meddling in French politics</a>; but Merkel has long identified the populist dynamics connecting Le Pen\u2019s rise with the rise of Germany\u2019s far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\" title=\"\">AfD</a>, a party that threatens to upend politics in her own country.</p> <p>This coming Sunday, regional elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern offer a key test for Merkel\u2019s CDU party, which has trailed in local polls behind the AfD. Le Pen will be watching closely, and little wonder: one of the two will shape the future of Europe.

  "<p>Antibacterial soaps were banned from the US market on Friday in a final ruling by the Food and Drug Administration, which said that manufacturers had failed to prove the cleansers were safe or more effective than normal products.</p> <p>Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA\u2019s center for evaluation and research, said that certain antimicrobial soaps may not actually serve any health benefits at all.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, some data suggests that antibacterial ingredients may do more harm than good over the long term.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturers had failed to show either the safety of \u201clong-term daily use\u201d or that the products were \u201cmore effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of certain infections\u201d.</p> <p>The new federal rule applies to any soap or antiseptic product that has one or more of 19 chemical compounds, including triclocarbon, which is often found in bar soaps, and triclosan, often in liquid soaps. It does not affect alcohol-based hand sanitizers and wipes, which the FDA is <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm509097.htm\">still investigating</a>, or certain <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm445002.htm\">healthcare products</a> meant specifically for clinical settings. The FDA has given manufacturers a year to change their products or pull them off shelves.</p> <p>The FDA first proposed a rule about the chemicals in 2013, following research that they might affect human hormones or change natural resistance to bacteria. The agency requested research from the producers to back up their health claims, but in the three years since has found that data lacking or their requests ignored.<br></p> <p>Triclosan has been proven effective at killing bacteria if used at sustained length \u2013 far longer than the few seconds most people spend washing their hands \u2013 and was once only found in healthcare settings.</p> <p>Recent studies have linked triclosan to a series of disruptions in human and animal health. A University of Chicago study released in July found that triclosan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/30/anti-bacterial-skin-care-microbiome-antimicrobial-harm\">changed the microbiome inside human guts</a>, and its researchers suggested that exposure could damage developing fetuses. A study from earlier this year found that overuse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/14/antibiotic-resistance-nhs-fda-agriculture-health-pfizer\">could also be contributing to antibiotic resistance</a>, and <a href=\"http://time.com/4035442/antibacterial-soap-ineffective/\">a 2015 study</a> found that antibacterial formulas were not more effective than soap and water.</p> <p>Triclosan can be found in 93% of liquid soaps labeled \u201cantibacterial\u201d or \u201cantimicrobial\u201d, according to the FDA, though some companies, including Proctor &amp; Gamble, have already begun phasing the chemical out of products. There are partial triclosan bans in the European Union and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/19/minnesota-ban-triclosan-germ-killing-chemical\">Minnesota</a>, but the chemical remains common in toothpaste, as it is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0061266/\">believed effective against the bacteria</a> that cause gum disease. </p> <p>People should still keep their hands clean, the FDA noted. \u201cWashing with plain soap and running water remains one of the most important steps consumers can take to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading germs to others,\u201d the agency said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if people need to use a hand sanitizer, it should have at least 60% alcohol.</p> <p>Professor Patrick McNamara, who has published research on antimicrobial soaps, called the ruling \u201clogical\u201d because research shows \u201cthere is no added benefit to having these antimicrobial chemicals in soaps\u201d.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">He added that triclosan could play a part in driving antibiotic resistance, saying, \u201cafter these chemicals are used in our homes they go down the drain to wastewater treatment plants and eventually to the environment where they can select for antibiotic resistance genes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn short, triclosan and triclocarbon present a risk towards propagation of antibiotic resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cSince they do not offer added benefits when washing hands, their use is not worth their environmental risk.</p>",

Competitors are observed in training and at competitions during the process. <br></p> <p>Umbrella Paralympics organisations, such as the BPA, play no hands-on role in the classification of individual athletes apart from ensuring that the process conforms to the rules.</p> <p>One of Great Britain\u2019s leading young Paralympians, who has won medals in the Games, is understood to be close to confirming that she has withdrawn from her sport because of her disquiet about what is happening in classification. Her father said: \u201cShe\u2019s categoric about leaving the sport. She feels there has been a breakdown in her trust and faith in the classification system.\u201d</p> <p>While the majority of Paralympians would appear to be correctly classified, accusations of misrepresentation have become so widespread that some of the Paralympian sports\u2019 governing bodies are now attempting to control them, with one UKA official sending an email warning athletes not to make \u201cbaseless\u201d claims or face legal action. The nature of Paralympic classification can lend itself to some disgruntled competitors and their advocates pointing the finger at their rivals, whether or not they are actually competing in the right class.<br></p> <p>Historically, there have been a few high-profile cases of cheating in Paralympic sport. At the 2000 Games, the Spanish basketball team was disqualified after winning gold.

The Guardian has discovered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/21/gb-paralympic-coach-paula-dunn\">Paula Dunn</a>, UKA\u2019s Paralympics head coach, said earlier this year that she would resign after admitting she made comments suggesting one of Britain\u2019s best medal hopefuls was too able-bodied for their category. She later retracted her resignation and now insists that the athlete in question is correctly classified \u2013 a view held up by an internal UKA inquiry. </p> <p>Dunn also circulated an email to athletes and their families in December last year relating to classification, stating that the athletics governing body \u201cwill have no hesitation in taking legal action against anyone found to have made baseless allegations in the public domain\u201d.</p> <p>When asked about the email this week, Dunn told the Guardian: \u201cIt was clarified at a later date. I did put it out \u2026 I think I had just come back from a major championships and we had had a lot of people making complaints, and you get slightly frustrated that you have gone through a system and people are still questioning whether you have got it right or wrong.\u201d</p> <p>There are also concerns that flaws in the classification system may result in competitors being inadvertently placed in the wrong classes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf71d13bf22885864a9be962f80765b180490934\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf71d13bf22885864a9be962f80765b180490934/508_388_2953_6274/471.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Breen models the Team GB kit for Rio 2016.\" width=\"471\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivia Breen models the Team GB kit for Rio 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adidas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael Breen, the father of the Paralympic runner Olivia Breen, has complained to the sport\u2019s governing body about the way athletes are classified and his views have also helped prompt the UKA to launch its planned inquiry. Breen, a solicitor, said: \u201cThe current classification system is not fit for purpose. Consequently, some athletes have been incorrectly classified.\u201d</p> <p>He said, in his opinion, UKA seemed to be primarily focused on medals. Citing the Dunn warning email, he claimed: \u201cThey blatantly threaten athletes, their parents and coaches with litigation and therefore because of this intimidation people are too frightened to speak out about erroneous classifications. This is not how Paralympic sport should be conducted.\u201d</p> <p>The claims of cheating and wrongful classification have so far failed to gain much traction with the governing bodies, however. Xavier Gonzalez, the IPC\u2019s chief executive, said last month that the committee had looked into 80 individual cases but had failed to find any proof of competitors being wrongly categorised.</p> <p>Breen questioned these findings and the level of proof required by the IPC. He said the classification system would be fairer if all athletes consented to their relevant medical records being made public, and if a clear whistleblowing policy was established.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Tim Hollingsworth, the chief executive of the BPA, said Grey-Thompson had not identified to him any specific athletes about whom she had concerns. He said: \u201cWhat she has done and said to me and others is that she\u2019s aware of some athletes within the system who would like to see classification made more robust and transparent and she is pushing hard to advocate that.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted he had no concerns about classification but conceded that it could be improved. \u201cWe will be drawing on some of these thoughts about transparency and robustness and athletes feeling that classification should be objective and transparent. We intend, post-Games, to take a more considered view about how [individual] sports and the IPC can develop practices that are more transparent.\u201d</p> <p>An IPC spokesman said: \u201cThe IPC firmly acknowledges that the classification environment requires continued attention. Over the past years dialogue with IFs [international federations] and NPC [national Paralympic committee] classification experts has intensified and more sports and IFs have recognised the urgent need for investments in research, classifier training and certification, and potentially some revisions of classification systems.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Following publication, a UKA spokesperson said: \u201cDecisions relating to the classification of international para-athletes are handled by the International Paralympic Committee. UK Athletics is not responsible for the classification of any of its athletes competing internationally. We are confident of the classification of all British athletes who took part in Rio and we always cooperate 100% with the IPC to ensure that all GB athletes are correctly classified in line with international rules. A complaint was made earlier this year by a parent of a UK athlete in connection with the classification of other athletes. This was fully investigated by UKA and the IPC who found the complaint to be without merit and we consider the matter to be at an end\u201d. <br><br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>The biggest shock at the end of the first season of Narcos, Netflix\u2019s excellent drama about Colombian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura), was that the life of Pablo wasn\u2019t over. Many assumed that the 10 episodes would tell the entire arc of Escobar\u2019s rise and fall and were surprised when it concluded before the gun battle that ended his life. (Sorry, everyone, that\u2019s not a spoiler \u2013 it\u2019s history.) Instead, season one was just about the rise and season two, which launched its 10 episodes on Netflix on Friday 2 September, is about the fall. </p> <p>What\u2019s odd about this second season, however, is that it is both identical to the first season but also entirely different. Just like the first time around, two DEA agents also based on real-life figures, Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook) and Javier Pe\u00f1a (Pedro Pascal), are hot on Escobar\u2019s trail and we see them trying to track Escobar and his entire organization. There\u2019s the same voiceover giving all the exposition, though it is much less invasive this time around. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/27/narcos-netflix-pablo-escobar-wagner-moura\">'The Michael Jordan of criminals': how Narcos found a true villain in Pablo Escobar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though much is the same about Narcos, including the exceptional performances from the main cast, there have been many changes behind the camera. After season one, showrunner Chris Brancato left to head up ABC\u2019s Of Kings and Prophets. He was replaced with Adam Fierro who was then fired and Jos\u00e9 Padilha and Eric Newman were installed to complete the season. The tumult behind the scenes means the changes on screen are slow and steady with things improving noticeably before the end of the season.</p> <p>Season two focuses on 1993, the year that Escobar is on the run and eventually killed. That means there is less of an emphasis on the personal lives of the DEA agents, which was always the weakest aspect of the show. Instead the action focuses on Escobar, the rival drug cartels that are working against him, and the DEA\u2019s turf wars with both the Colombian Search Bloc tasked with bringing Escobar to justice and the CIA, which is running their own operation. The narrative quickly gets wonderfully expansive, but never too confusing, which is an incredible feat of storytelling by Padilha and Newman.</p> <p>Narcos is an incredibly watchable series, which is odd considering that most people know how it ends. The how and why is extremely compelling and will ruin the office productivity of some fans who will find themselves staying up later than they intend to watch an extra episode. There is always action and intrigue, whether it\u2019s crosses and double crosses on either side of the law, chases through the streets of Medell\u00edn, or Escobar\u2019s narrow escapes from the death squad intent on his destruction.</p> <p>However, Narcos has a hard time going from a good show to a great show, mostly because there is little ambiguity about whether Escobar is doing something noble, like there is with a Walter White, Tony Soprano or Don Draper. There are some ham-fisted attempts at humanizing him, including beefed up roles for his wife (Paulina Gait\u00e1n) and mother (Paulina Garc\u00eda), but the most grating is his relationship to his daughter\u2019s bunny.</p> <p>The best addition, however, is focusing on the stories of some of the lesser figures in his story. There is an arc for L\u00edmon (Leynar Gomez), Escobar\u2019s bodyguard who died with him on a rooftop, who goes from a cab driver without a police record to a hardened member of the inner circle. He recruits Maritza (Martina Garc\u00eda) a young mother who needs money, for a small role in the cartel machinery. She agrees and it ends up having unintended consequences.</p> <p>We all know how Escobar is killed by the authorities, but we don\u2019t know what is going to happen to the people like Maritza, the Colombian soldiers hellbent on freeing their country from crippling narco warfare, or the agents working to keep drugs and violence off of their streets. That is the real surprise of this season and, ultimately, what takes Narcos up to the level of greatness. </p>",
  "<p>As a member of the Max Wall Society \u2013 known as bricks \u2013 I was fascinated to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/30/the-entertainer-review-kenneth-branagh-garrick-london-john-osborne\" title=\"\">Michael Billington\u2019s review of The Entertainer</a> (31 August).

Last month Simon Callow, also a brick, traced the history of Osborne\u2019s masterpiece and mentioned the Max Wall production, and acknowledged that he was able, with his music hall background, to retain the allegory which made the play so powerful. And unlike Branagh in the song and dance routines which were \u201calmost too good\u201d, Max offered them to the audience in an underplayed, take it or leave it fashion, just as the author intended.<br><strong>Paul Foxall</strong><br><em>Collingbourne Ducis, Wilthsire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Officers allowed Simpkins to sleep under a blanket in the back of their patrol car and watched over her until a bed became available.</p> <p> She and her husband, Tristan Simpkins, 25, released a photograph of her in the back of the police car to try to raise awareness of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/01/mental-health-care-pushed-breaking-point-lack-beds-psychiatrists-nhs-hospitals\">lack of beds</a> available in such situations.</p> <p> The chief constable of Wiltshire police, Mike Veale, said officers were often having to take responsibility for vulnerable people with mental health problems who ought to be in the care of health professionals. </p> <p>He said that in the past week officers had persuaded a 17-year-old girl with schizophrenia to come down from the roof of a car park, only to be told there were no beds available for her anywhere in the county. He also said officers held a man in a cell for more than 48 hours because there was no mental health care facility available for him.</p> <p> Veale said: \u201cA police officer is not the appropriate person to be dealing with a vulnerable member of the public who has an illness and poses a real risk to their own health and wellbeing. My police officers and staff face difficult, stressful and sometimes dangerous situations every day. They are not trained to provide specialist care to people with complex problems. They don\u2019t know the background of these people, their medical history or their personal details. </p> <p>\u201cThese issues have always been here for the police, and not just in Wiltshire, but are becoming more acute as austerity bites and there is increased pressure on social care and healthcare services.\u201d</p> <p> Police had detained Simpkins under section 136 of the act early last Saturday when she suffered a mental health crisis. Her husband said police rang round but could not find a place for her in a mental health unit. </p> <p>They took her into the custody suite at Melksham police station until later on Saturday afternoon, when officers were told a bed was available at Green Lane hospital in Devizes. However, when they got there at 5pm they were told it was not ready.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e451b9ad874b5a37cde80ef575ac76e38c05168c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e451b9ad874b5a37cde80ef575ac76e38c05168c/0_320_2004_2154/930.jpg\" alt=\"Tristan and Katie Simpkins\" width=\"930\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tristan and Katie Simpkins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Simpkins/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Mr Simpkins said: \u201cThe hospital suggested she go back to custody and they would call when it was ready, but the police officer said custody is not the right place for her. He didn\u2019t want to risk her missing the bed so he said they\u2019d wait, and he\u2019d wait with us. </p> <p>\u201cKatie had her medication, became drowsy and he let her sleep in the back of the police car with her blanket. When I saw her lying in the back of the police car I felt frustrated, but I\u2019ve become used to it. I feel hopeless.\u201d</p> <p> He praised the way the police had tried to help. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t their fault they couldn\u2019t get a bed but these officers were all really lovely with her,\u201d he said. She was finally admitted at 9pm.</p> <p>Angus Macpherson, the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon, said: \u201cThis is not an isolated incident. Such incidents are happening once or twice a month [in Wiltshire]. The picture of Katie Simpkins huddled beneath a blanket in the back of a Wiltshire police car has understandably caused concern to the public. I have said it before and I will say it again: custody is simply not the right place for someone in a mental health crisis.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.awp.nhs.uk/\"> Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS trust</a> confirmed there were only two beds available for people detained under section 136, which gives police the power to take a person from a public space to a place of safety.</p> <p> A trust spokesperson said: \u201cWe work closely with the police to ensure they know the availability of places of safety. In this instance we were unable to provide a bed straight away and there clearly could have been better communication. We apologise and will be mindful of this in the future. Once the matter came to our attention, we made contact with Mr Simpkins to give him and his wife our full support.\u201d</p> <p> Last month the government announced that the Avon and Wiltshire trust was among those that had successfully bid for a share of a \u00a315m fund to improve provision of mental health places of safety. </p> <p>A Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cWhen a person is experiencing a mental health crisis they need the right care, in the right place and at the right time. We are fully committed to improving mental health services across the country.\u201d </p>",

Middlesex are on top against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, while here at the Ageas Bowl Yorkshire are in an almost identical position against Hampshire.</p> <p>Middlesex are 63-0 in their second innings ahead of day three, leading by 133, and Yorkshire are 69-1 second time around with a lead of 128.</p> <p>I can offer Hampshire a touch of encouragement, however. It\u2019s overcast here in Southampton, and last night Yorkshire seamer Jack Brooks gave the following assessment of the pitch: \u201cIt\u2019s already starting to dent, and our batters have said they never felt in on it.\u201d</p> <p>Heading down the division and to Durham, where the hosts have a job on their hands to avoid a defeat against rock bottom Notts which would plunge them into trouble. They only lead by 14 with seven second-innings wickets in hand and nightwatchman Graham Onions at the crease. Durham do have a game in hand on the teams around them, but they travel to Headingley next week and also have to come here to face Hampshire in the final round. </p> <p>Lancashire also remain in danger of relegation, and they are on the back foot against Somerset at Emirates Old Trafford having seen the visitors rack up 553-8 declared first time around. An illness to Luke Procter meant Rob Jones had to open the batting in only his second first-class appearance, and his 34 contributed to a steady start for the hosts at 138-2. But there\u2019s still a lot of batting to do for them before they can feel safe, and there will be many of you who will know the issues the Red Rose have with their batting.</p> <p>At the top of Division Two, leaders Essex and promotion chasing Kent could well wrap up three day wins over Worcestershire at Chelmsford and Sussex at Hove respectively. It would take something special for Kent to overhaul Essex for the only promotion place, but at least a win will keep Ryan ten Doeschate and company honest.</p> <p>Gloucestershire are also on course for an away win against Derbyshire following a first hundred of the season for the Colonel, Phil Mustard, yesterday.</p> <p>Finally, at Northampton, they saw one of the individual performances of the season from Rob Keogh, whose off-spinners returned a remarkable career best 9-52. Prior to yesterday he had never taken more than three-for. Ben Duckett then scored 189 at the top of the order, passing 1,000 Championship runs for the season in the process, to set Glamorgan an unlikely 451 to win. They are yet to get off the mark following three overs last night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tykestravels/status/771631701772541953\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Overcast morning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAgeasBowl\">@TheAgeasBowl</a> ahead of day three. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YorkshireCCC\">@YorkshireCCC</a> in control at 69-1 in their second innings, leading by 128.</p>&mdash; Graham Hardcastle (@tykestravels) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tykestravels/status/771631701772541953\">September 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c944e0e4b00c28eaea776b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:26:04.317Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Morning all, </p> <p>We are back with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tykestravels\">Graham Hardcastle</a> in Southampton today.

  "<p>When Katonya Breaux asked Twitter about sunscreen that does not leave a white sheen on darker skin, she spotted a hole in the market. She also realised that many people were unaware of the dangers of exposure to the sun. \u201cThere is a learning gap between women of colour,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Speaking from her home in Calabasas, California, she tells me about UnSun \u2013 a line of sunscreen that she has just launched. Although it is designed for darker skin, in a neat twist on diversity, it also works on all complexions. The plaudits are pouring in.</p> <p>I ask her about moving from construction \u2013 the industry she worked in for 20 years \u2013 to beauty. She pauses, as a dog barks in the background. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo dogs, actually. Always barking.\u201d One is Bisous, a bichon frise, the other is Everest, a Bernese mountain dog who belongs to her son, Frank Ocean. Frank \u2013 the most talked-about artist of the year, the man whose much-delayed new album, Blonde, has topped the charts in the UK and the US \u2013 Ocean. That Frank Ocean.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"39c535f7c847ec2591111a9835c3ef16d388c4c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39c535f7c847ec2591111a9835c3ef16d388c4c2/188_37_388_1031/376.jpg\" alt=\"unsun\" width=\"376\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But back to Unsun. Breaux has worn sunscreen ever since her 20s, when she noticed moles&#xa0;appearing above her lip. At&#xa0;first, she liked them, painting her lips red, going \u201ca little bit Marilyn Monroe\u201d. Then, when a few more appeared, she went to the GP, got scared, read about the&#xa0;under-reported problem of skin cancer in people of colour, and became \u201cmore diligent, really, because you have to be\u201d. Then her aunt got skin cancer.</p> <p>So, does she think about the beauty industry? \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s diverse enough, but it is improving,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p>Breaux features prominently on the Unsun website and, at 50 years old, is an impressive advertisement for her own product. But, when I suggest that she get Frank to model for her, she laughs. \u201cI can\u2019t get him to do that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>So, is her son supportive of her&#xa0;business? \u201cIncredibly, yes, I send him articles and he\u2019s so great, so proud,\u201d she says.</p> <p>What does she think of his new album? \u201cOh, we love it\u201d \u2013 we meaning Breaux and her son, Ryan, Frank\u2019s brother. Apparently, they play it in the car every morning on the way to school. \u201cWe always turn it up loud at the end.\u201d And her favourite song? \u201cThat\u2019s hard. Nikes, I think.\u201d</p> <p>Then comes the big question: was, as has been widely rumoured, hers the voice on the song Be Yourself that says: \u201cDo not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol, do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated. This is mom, call me, bye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t me, no,\u201d Breaux answers, \u201cbut I would have done it happily.\u201d And why the delay \u2013 why did Frank torture us with such a long wait? \u201cAh you know \u2026 Frank is an artist, he\u2019s creative. That just happens.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The death of Veronica Forrest-Thomson in 1975, aged just 27, is among the most galling and tragic losses to modern British poetry. Born in Malaya and raised in Glasgow, she published a first poetry collection at 20 and gravitated to Cambridge, where she was taught <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/08/poems-jh-prynne-review\" title=\"\">by JH Prynne</a>. Heavily influenced by the close reading tradition of IA Richards and William Empson, her criticism also drew on French structuralist and poststructuralist theory, then much in the air.</p> <p>Published posthumously in 1978 and now reprinted for the first time, her classic study <em>Poetic Artifice</em> marked a provocative intervention. There is a widespread and mistaken assumption, Forrest-Thomson argues, that poetry is&#xa0;important for what it tells us about the external world. Not so: poetry is important for its vindication of \u201call the&#xa0;rhythmic, phonetic, verbal and logical devices\u201d that make it what it is,&#xa0;and the production of \u201calternative imaginary orders\u201d. Anything else is flim-flam. It is not the job of poetry to&#xa0;deliver states of \u201cinarticulate rapture\u201d, but to be the articulation of&#xa0;that rapture.</p> <p>Contemporary poetry is full of writers convinced they have access to&#xa0;\u201creality in its unmediated state\u201d, under&#xa0;a process Forrest-Thomas calls \u201cnaturalisation\u201d. Philip Larkin\u2019s \u201cMr Bleaney\u201d is \u201calmost embarrassingly lucid\u201d, and the thought that it represents the work of an \u201cimportant poet\u201d is \u201cwithout foundation\u201d. Ted Hughes fares no better, desiring to be mysterious \u201cwithout letting it affect his technique\u201d. We have naturalisation to thank for Larkin and Hughes being famous, and for Prynne and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/21/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Andrew Crozier </a>languishing where they do.</p> <p>To a sceptic, Forrest-Thomson\u2019s formalism might sound like a strain of&#xa0;contrarian quietism, conducted without reference to the noisy distractions of history or politics. Granted, it is one of the oddities of <em>Poetic Artifice</em> that questions of race and gender, which loom so large today,&#xa0;should hold&#xa0;so little interest for Forrest-Thomson. Her position is&#xa0;not without nuances, however: she&#xa0;is impatient of&#xa0;surrealism and its \u201cdisconnected image-complex\u201d, and comments waspishly of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/30/night-thoughts-gascoyne-fraser-review\" title=\"\">David Gascoyne poem</a> that at least \u201call the vowels in the alphabet and many of the&#xa0;consonants are present\u201d.</p> <p>Successful artifice must conduct raids on \u201cexternal elements\u201d (ie the world) and master what it finds. In using these elements, the poem will show either \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cexternal limitation\u201d. The former is when external forces are brought under the control of poetic logic; the latter is when the poem coasts along on a tide of received ideas, trading on their assumed importance. A poem on the topic \u201cIain Duncan Smith is a very wicked man\u201d would have a lot of external limitation to process before breaking through to artifice, and unsurprisingly Forrest-Thomson keeps away from overtly political poetry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/03/david-gascoyne-poetry-kate-middleton\">A fitting eulogy for the lost surrealist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A strong element in the armour of a successful poem is the \u201cimage-complex\u201d. When Ezra Pound writes, in \u201cL\u2019art, 1910\u201d, \u201cGreen arsenic smeared on an egg-white cloth, / Crushed strawberries! Come, let us feast our eyes\u201d, only a very simple reader will&#xa0;see those strawberries in their everyday role as objects for ingestion. Pound\u2019s \u201cIn a Station of the Metro\u201d is&#xa0;also the subject of a lengthy discussion, with much hingeing on its semicolon rather than comma (\u201cThe apparition of these faces in the crowd;&#xa0;/ Petals on a wet, black bough.\u201d) It is a juxtaposition, not a comparison. While Forrest-Thomson is trenchant in her dismissal of poetic social realism, she is unexpectedly dismissive of concrete poetry too, with its abandonment of \u201call pretence to meaning\u201d.</p> <p>A personal subtext here is her own discarded phase, in her short poetic development, as a concrete poet. Though it cites a pair of its author\u2019s poems, <em>Poetic Artifice</em> by and large avoids autobiographical testimony. As such, it is strikingly different from the critical prose produced by many poets today, slanted as that is towards the autobiographical and the \u201cgetting into poetry\u201d genre. It is, after all, striking how many fire-breathing manifestos were written by modernist poets, from Pound to Forrest-Thomson, and how few have been written by their contemporary heirs.</p> <p><em>Poetic Artifice</em> does not confine itself&#xa0;to anglophone poetry, and is impressively hospitable to Dadaism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/28/dada-tristan-tzara-avant-garde-exhibition\" title=\"\">Tristan Tzara</a>, Hans Arp and Max Jacob.&#xa0;While deploring \u201cour native breed of rank theoretical ignorance\u201d, Forrest-Thomson also brands the fashionable positions of the avant-garde journal Tel Quel magazine \u201cpsychopathological\u201d. A true independent, though, she prefers the bad new things to the good&#xa0;old ones, and knows \u201cnostalgia will get us&#xa0;nowhere\u201d.</p> <p>The book is not without faults. With its dismissals of sub-Movement verse and concrete poetry, it stakes a lot on the high road of Anglo-American modernism, as represented by Eliot, Pound and Prynne. Despite her radical instincts, Forrest-Thomson shows limited interest in forms beyond the lyric. Pound called <em>The Cantos</em> a \u201cpoem to include history\u201d, but 900 pages of world history would be a lot to wave away under the rubric \u201cexternal limitation\u201d. What would a Forrest-Thomson reading of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/oct/23/claudia-rankine-citizen-poetry-defence\" title=\"\">Claudia Rankine\u2019s <em>Citizen</em></a> look like? It\u2019s a tantalising question. <em>Poetic Artifice</em> ends with a reading of Sylvia Plath\u2019s \u201cPurdah\u201d and&#xa0;its mysterious \u201ccloak of holes\u201d. A&#xa0;critical landscape lacking Forrest-Thomson could only be a gapped and&#xa0;ragged thing. The reprint of this bracing study is a welcome and important event.</p> <p>\u2022 <em> Poetic Artifice </em>is published by Shearsman (\u00a316.95).</p>",

As an animal lover I couldn't agree with you more. <br />Understanding (even among humans) is a tricky concept. The philosopher Wittgenstein once said that if a lion could talk we wouldn't understand him. Rarely wrong, he was quite wrong about that one.

When I returned I felt odd being 'a year behind' and wondered if I was going to feel even lonelier than I had before I dropped out. Instead I met one friend in a radio class, and the other when my boyfriend came home and told me 'I just met someone at uni today who I think you might really like.' Within minutes of meeting each of them I felt as though I had met my soul mate. Twenty seven years later they are still my closest friends, their children are my godchildren and my son is their godchild.

Yep, it\u2019s a heavy question for a Friday afternoon, so Guardian Live shrewdly scheduled <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/utopia-2016-how-to-live-a-happy-life-26076096306\">their event on this elusive subject on Thursday evening</a> at Somerset House.</p> <p>Now then, there are a lot of answers to that question that might seem appropriate this week, such as \u201cdon\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/sep/02/morning-commute-on-southern-rail-live\">commute on Southern Trains</a>\u201d or \u201ctry not to end up as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/uzbekistan-uncertainty-death-dictator-islam-karimov\">president of Uzbekistan</a>.\u201d </p> <p>But as I met my fellow panellists Vanessa King, Ruth Whippman and Dawn Foster, it did occur to me that one way to lead a happy life might be to avoid being stuck in a stuffy basement room on a glorious evening in early autumn listening to writers talk about how to lead a happy life.</p> <p>Still, members, readers and general interlopers seemed, well, happy to be there. Whippman is amusing when describing the brutally earnest quest for happiness in America which paradoxically seems to be making everyone more miserable. King is good at the importance of emotional intelligence and self-knowledge. Foster chaired deftly with her customary deadpan delivery. <br></p> <p>Once Guardian members and readers got stuck in during the Q and A however, it quickly became apparent that happiness is like beauty \u2013 in the eye of the beholder. Different strokes etc. It\u2019s down to your parents, your freedom from psychological oppression, your upbringing, your emotional security, your self-esteem, your life choices, your talent fulfilment, the recognition of your intrinsic worth. Poverty can make you miserable, but money won\u2019t necessarily make you happy. </p> <p>So come on readers, get stuck in: what three qualities make for a happy life.

So that\u2019s what we did. It\u2019s left me wondering whether I did the right thing though.</p> <p>We played Pok\u00e9mon Go for a good couple of hours. We spent about an hour of that walking through a forest and by a lake, and we spotted ladybirds and holly bushes, and got some fresh air and exercise, and it was an outdoor activity. But we still spent a lot of of that time with our eyes glued to a screen.</p> <p>He\u2019s suddenly become absolutely obsessed with it. He knows all the names, he\u2019s constantly asking his mum to message me when I\u2019m at work to ask a question about a particular Pok\u00e9mon type, or to see if I\u2019ve caught any new ones. It\u2019s amazing the facts and figures their little minds can hoover up and memorise if they are really interested in something.</p> <p>But are games like that something a three-year-old should be playing? Should I have done something more traditional with him instead? If we\u2019d done the walk in the woods as an activity in its own right, I\u2019m not sure his attention on it would have lasted that long. </p> <p>His older sister, Emma, is six. She\u2019s already fantastically adept at using computers and typing, I think in part that is through having played games on smartphones and the iPad when she was younger. Those seem to me to be useful life skills to learn. But what do you think?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MartinBelam/status/771660885064421376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m not saying James is obsessed but... <a href=\"https://t.co/y8TkGuFZz5\">pic.twitter.com/y8TkGuFZz5</a></p>&mdash; Martin Belam (@MartinBelam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinBelam/status/771660885064421376\">September 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c97cdee4b0456abb93d648\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T13:21:58.276Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley voted joint leaders of Green party</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This news just broke - let us know what you think below the line.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/02/caroline-lucas-and-jonathan-bartley-voted-joint-leaders-of-green-party\">Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley voted joint leaders of Green party</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c94a11e4b09a68e9b64e73\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T12:51:26.429Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Crystal Maze is set to make a come-back.

Here is Ryan\u2019s response:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there\u2019s two threads here. Firstly, challenging the government who are creating policy and in turn, exacerbating the culture. Secondly, challenging the culture itself.

We can oppose the policy by writing to targeted MPs and Lords when this stuff comes up (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/stephen-crabb-government-u-turns-disability-cuts-leaves-budget-disarray\">look at Personal Independence Payments</a>.

  "<p>As an infectious disease physician, scanning breaking news headlines for stories about Zika is a work-related hobby. The latest bit of bad news to cross the wire, on Thursday, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/zika-virus-found-mosquitoes-miami-beach\">the confirmation</a> that mosquitoes in Miami Beach harbor the Zika virus. </p> <p>Reading this announcement, the general public might rightly be pessimistic about the medical community\u2019s ability to cope with emerging infectious diseases \u2013 Zika just seems to keep on spreading. However, despite <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/zika-virus-bill-funding\">the politicization of the disease</a> and the difficulties individual local health agencies may have marshaling resources, the scientific community\u2019s response so far has actually been a resounding success. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/zika-doctor-pregnant-women-obgyn-florida\">I\u2019m treating pregnant women with Zika and this is what it\u2019s like | Christine Curry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the span of less than a year, the scientific and medical worlds have moved at a breakneck speed, probably not seen since the dawn of the HIV pandemic, to not only unravel the mysteries of this virus but to provide a pathway to ultimately extinguish its ability to threaten our species. </p> <p>When Zika, a virus believed for decades to be almost entirely benign, appeared for the first time in the western hemisphere, it coincided with a remarkable spike in numbers of newborns with microcephaly, a devastating and extremely costly condition that leads to cognitive impairment, developmental delays and early death. This sort of brain damage was never before associated with Zika, or with any disease like it. </p> <p>A major scientific endeavor \u2013 and indeed the driving force behind the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) quick declaration of a public health emergency \u2013 was required to establish whether these two events were merely correlated, or if a causal relationship existed. In a remarkably short span of time, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) put Zika through <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1604338#t=article\">Shepard\u2019s criteria</a>, a rigorous series of steps used to establish causation for fetal abnormalities like microcephaly. A similar establishment of causality was made for Zika\u2019s role in the autoimmune neurologic disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Concurrently, separate efforts to develop a vaccine effective against Zika flourished, leading to at least two candidate vaccines (with more to follow) <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12047994/zika-virus-possible-vaccine-successful-mice-trials\">already moving</a> into human trials. Laboratory diagnostics for Zika, which were virtually non-existent a year ago, are now available all over the world and will probably become even more refined and accessible after the WHO took steps to internationally standardize the strain of Zika used in research and development this week. </p> <p>It is crucial to realize that these diagnostic tests have not yet been formally licensed for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but have been made available through Emergency Use Authorizations. These emergency authorizations are the result of important legislation that emphasized the absolute need to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles in the midst of a public health emergency. </p> <p>Indeed, a whole portion of the FDA \u2013 the Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats \u2013 was created years ago for just this very reason, and this office\u2019s efforts in prior emergencies, such as the 2009 flu pandemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak, altered the course of those outbreaks for the better.</p> <p>More basic scientific questions have also been probed by multiple research groups and have revealed the virus\u2019s proclivity for traversing the placenta to reach the fetus, and the molecular pathways the immune system uses to combat the virus\u2019s attack. This week, researchers also found that we may be able to repurpose a tapeworm medication to fight Zika, which would fast-track the process of delivering the drug to the market, because it is already approved by the FDA. </p> <p>With each outbreak, leaders in the fields of infectious disease and public health preparedness become more skilled as they integrate the lessons of the past into their knowledge base. The flourishing of the human species is directly related to our ability to minimize the impacts of these threats. </p> <p>There is a tendency with every outbreak of disease to see the litany of negative headlines and hear the hoof beats of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The burden caused by Zika, thus far, has been sizable, and for those families in which a pregnancy was affected, incalculable. </p> <p>However, the historic scientific and medical advances that have characterized the response to the Zika outbreak show the profound advancement of modern science, and ultimately how far we have come in confronting global threats of disease.</p>",

In his introduction, Hill sets the scene for an exercise in self-analysis by confessing that, several years after his climactic victory at Suzuka memorably brought a lump to Murray Walker\u2019s throat, he fell into a depression so profound that it took the ministrations of a therapist to extricate him from the slough of despond.</p> <p>What is not a surprise is that he traces the cause of his depression to the death of his father, the charismatic double champion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/dec/02/from-the-vault-graham-hill-formula-one\" title=\"\">Graham Hill, in a plane crash in 1975</a>, when Damon was 15 \u2013 \u201cthe night the points on the railway track of our lives were instantly switched from one destination to a completely unanticipated one\u201d. Not only was he deprived of an adored (although complicated and often absent) father at a crucial time in his adolescence, he and his mother and two sisters were to discover that, because important documents had not been kept in order, the insurance policies were invalid. The consequences effectively ruined them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/felipe-massa-announces-retirement-from-formula-one\">Felipe Massa says he will retire from Formula One at the end of the season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was in trying to handle his depression by analysing its source that Damon came to a better understanding of his parents. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to speak ill of the dead,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut I had to know what the truth was about adults if I wanted to be one myself.\u201d</p> <p>Bette and Graham Hill were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,1428846,00.html\" title=\"\">prominent members of the grand prix circus</a> in the glamorous, seemingly carefree 1960s.</p> <p>But things are seldom exactly as they seem. Here is their son\u2019s description of the strain his father endured when he started running his own team: \u201cI can remember seeing him return home one night in a cloth cap and a long brown mac, looking for all the world like his own dad. He poured himself a whisky, which was most unlike him. I went back to watching the TV.</p> <p>My dad was learning about the hard-knock life of real business, as opposed to the charmed life of a racing driver. It worried my mother sick, especially when he began staying out late at the Clermont Club and Annabel\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>The son\u2019s account of how he reacted to the catastrophe that ultimately befell the family by drifting through his final school years and a variety of low-profile jobs as a labourer and a motorbike courier is unsparing and honest. It is part of a fine-grained analysis of a childhood and adolescence that produced a man whose insecurity made him a vulnerable figure in the cynical Formula One paddock, once he had come to believe that being a racing driver offered his life some sort of meaning \u2013 as well as, more importantly, a means of supporting his own young family. His inner conflict was evident to anyone who knew him when he was struggling to establish himself in the top flight and trying to retain control of his destiny.</p> <p>Many will pick up the book and turn straight to the chapters in which he deals with the events leading up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/30/ayrton-senna-death-formula-one-20-years\" title=\"\">the death of Ayrton Senna</a>, his team-mate, at Imola in 1994 and the fatal crash itself. They will be rewarded with a pretty persuasive analysis of an accident for which there will never be a definitive explanation. Hill believes that nothing broke on the car, but that Senna crashed through a combination of circumstantial factors. Those include the prominent ripples on the track surface, lowered tyre pressures through spending several laps behind the safety car, and Senna\u2019s ferocious determination to stay ahead of Michael Schumacher\u2019s pursuing Benetton, spurred by \u201cthe thought in Ayrton\u2019s mind\u201d, as Hill puts it, \u201cthat Michael might have been cheating\u201d.</p> <p>He is good on the inner world of Formula One, with its \u201ccontinual presumption of untrustworthiness\u201d. He did not always cope well, as he recognises in his description of the circumstances leading to the discovery that Frank Williams had decided to dump him midway through the season in which he was finally getting the better of Schumacher. The tensions underlying that season are explored in fascinating depth.</p> <p>Nor does he duck the confusion of his last three seasons in F1, when a series of unfortunate decisions took him first to Arrows, where he was forced to defend his title in a car barely capable of making the grid, and then into the arms of Eddie Jordan. Having presented the Irishman\u2019s team with its maiden grand prix win at Spa in 1998, he pulled into the pits at Suzuka halfway through his final race with the team the following season, calling it a day amid a mixture of \u201csadness that it had ended like this, relief that I was unhurt and alive, and shame that I had let the team down\u201d.</p> <p>Once he had made the decision, he needed to find a new meaning to his life. \u201cEverything I had gone through was motivated by the desire to restore and repair all the damage that was done to the Hills in 1975,\u201d he writes. He had succeeded, although the legacy of that distant trauma ensured that he continued to live with the fear of having it all snatched away again.</p> <p>The afterlife of this particular world champion has not always been easy, thanks to the fight against depression and a couple of unsatisfactory business ventures, but the upside includes a decision to resume the educational path he left almost 40 years ago by getting a degree in English literature with the Open University \u2013 and getting a first. That may have encouraged him to tell a remarkable story in his own words, and to do so with eloquence, directness and insight.</p> <p><em>Watching the Wheels by Damon Hill is published on 8 September by Macmillan (\u00a320)</em></p>",

Caroline Lucas and her co-leader Jonathan Bartley delivered their first leaders\u2019 speech in tandem - with one delivering one passage, before handing over to the other - and as a result it sounded a bit a school show and tell. The writing was strong, Lucas and Bartley are both confident speakers, but this format meant the speech never really built up any rhetorical momentum.</p> <p>That aside, and turning to the content, it was fine. It did not say anything particularly surprising, but Lucas and Bartley delivered a robust critique of the conduct of the EU referendum, and of inequality, and they presented a solid, progressive vision. There was relatively little environmentalism in it, but much more on the case for political reform, even if they were vague on what a progressive alliance with Labour might look like. The Greens seem quite serious about collaborating with Labour because, although Lucas and Bartley were damning about the Tories, they said virtually nothing critical of Labour, apart from Bartley\u2019s sharp opening joke - \u201cwe stand here, more united as party with two leaders than others are with one\u201d - which may well be the line from the speech most likely to be remembered.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9823be4b0c2a396c0698c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T13:45:23.478Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lucas is now winding up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, it\u2019s been said that \u201cWe write history with our feet and with our presence and our collective voice and vision\u201d.</p> <p>We write history by resisting the climate crisis.

Like most small parties the Greens are very strong supporters of proportional representation (for obvious reasons - it took more than 1m votes to elect just one Green MP) . But there is no prospect of PR for Westminster arriving anytime soon and so currently there is an active debate in the party about how the Greens could cooperate electorally with Labour and other parties on the left. <strong>Caroline Lucas </strong>and Jonathan Bartley have made this an issue in their leadership campaign (their slogan is \u201cthe power of working together\u201d) and Lucas is the joint editor, with the Labour MP <strong>Nisa Nandy</strong> and the Lib Dem activist <strong>Chris Bowers</strong> of a new book called <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/the-alternative\">The Alternative: Towards a New Progressive Politics</a> which features essays about how progressive politicians from different parties might work together.</p> <p>There are various ideas floating around about how Labour and the Greens could work together. Here are four options.</p> <p><strong><em>1 - A proper pact - or an alliance called Plaform</em></strong></p> <p>The new book, The Alternative, does not make any firm proposals for Labour/Green cooperation. But in their conclusion Lucas and her co-authors quote at length a proposal from the Guardian journalist <strong>Stephen Moss</strong>, who wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/12/could-you-build-new-part-of-the-left-labour-jeremy-corbyn\">a long feature last summer looking at the possibility of building a new party of the left. </a>He floated the idea of an alliance called Platform, featuring four partners: a socialist Labour, a social democrat Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens. He suggested they could agree a set of common values and policies, and then in any seat put up the candidate (ie, Socialist Platform) most likely to win. The others could stand aside, or just put up paper candidates.</p> <p><strong><em>2 - A progressive kitemark</em></strong></p> <p>Lucas, Nandy and Bowers also float another idea in The Alternative - a progressive kitemark. They write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another [idea] might be for the progressives to establish a \u2018progressive kite mark\u2019 to which candidates at the 2020 election (and even earlier elections) could sign up to demonstrate to their electorate a commitment to a core set of priorities, which would include red lines for all the parties involved. This kind of pre-election identification could also help to prepare the ground for post-election cooperation without any formal agreement needing to happen before the election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Interestingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement\">Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, is currently promoting a similar idea. </a></p> <p><strong><em>3 - Informal \u201cnon-compete\u201d agreement</em></strong></p> <p>The most basic form of cooperation involves parties coming to an understanding, privately, they they won\u2019t try very hard in each other\u2019s target seats at an election. Labour and the Lib Dems operated on this basis in 1997.</p> <p><strong><em>4 - Formal \u201cnon-compete\u201d agreements in certain areas</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Adam Ramsay,</strong> the Open Democracy co-editor and Green activist, floated this <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/adam-ramsay/green-party-should-help-build-progressive-alliance\">in an article on the case for a progressive alliance earlier this summer.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the nature of an electoral pact, there is a spectrum of options ... My preference is something in the middle.</p> <p>Specifically, political activist and electoral statistics geek Elliot Folan <a href=\"https://opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/elliot-folan/what-would-labour-green-electoral-pact-actually-look-like\">conveniently outlined</a> what such a deal might look like a number of months ago. They highlighted a list of seats in which it might be sensible for Labour to stand down for the Greens and vice versa, without going the whole hog and withdrawing candidates en mass. How many each party stood aside in would have to be the result of a tricky negotiation between respective central and national parties, and I think Greens should be willing to ask for quite a lot: after all, it would be Labour who would get to be in government. Ultimately, for Greens, such a deal could offer a serious chance to elect two or three more MPs. Let\u2019s be honest: that\u2019s unlikely otherwise.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is, though, one rather significant problem with all these proposals, and that is that the Labour leadership has shown very little interest in any form of alliance with the Greens.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/caroline-lucas-labour-jeremy-corbyn-progressive-alliance-green-party\">Lucas said last month that her office had been told by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office that he had \u201cnot shut the door\u201d on the idea of talking about a cross-party electoral alliance.</a> But Corbyn himself has said during the Labour leadership contest that he does not favour a progressive alliance. At one hustings meeting he said that Labour was \u201cdifferent from any other party\u201d and growing very quickly on its own. He may like Lucas personally (many Labour MPs do) but, with Labour currently hoovering up the Greens\u2019 voters, he has little incentive to form some pact with them.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T12:23:06.260Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c83da4e4b00c28eaea75f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T11:02:03.424Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has been some controversy about Caroline Lucas\u2019s decision to stand again for the leadership. This is what <strong>Matt Townsend</strong>, a Green activist, wrote in <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/matt-townsend/green-party-leadership-election-stitch-up\">an article for Open Democracy in June.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The announcement by Caroline about returning as leader, I believe, has meant that most who were considering running campaigns now won\u2019t put their name forward. I am sure there will be some competition, but the general expectation is of a coronation rather than a real contest. Caroline is the Green Party\u2019s only national household name politician. Unless something amazing happens, there is a risk the contest has already been killed off ...</p> <p>[Bartley] is relatively unknown within the Green Party outside London. By being on a joint ticket with Caroline, he could become a co-leader of the party without any mandate of his own. He could ride in to the role on her coattails instead of earning his place through an open and fair contest which would have enabled him to become better known, test how the party feels about him and build up his profile ...</p> <p> It\u2019s easy to see how the Lucas-Bartley campaign can be justified. Two experienced media-savvy politicians, based in London and the South East, working together, for the good of the party \u2013 the end justifies the means. But does it really? Or maybe this kind of top-down decision-making by a party establishment just removes opportunities and ends fairness.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"http://leftfootforward.org/2016/06/green-party-leadership-race-doesnt-need-to-be-a-coronation/\">a Left Foot Forward article in June </a><strong>Josiah Mortimer</strong> acknowledged that some members were unhappy about Lucas standing on a joint ticket with Bartley, but he defended their decision to put themselves forward.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Greens haven\u2019t done co-leadership since scrapping principal speakers around 2008. It\u2019s an exciting democratic model that\u2019s worth drawing the best elements from \u2013 and it\u2019s clear that the two candidates\u2019 qualities complement each other: Caroline \u2013 high profile, Jon \u2013 highly organised.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c958d1e4b00c28eaea77bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T10:48:06.340Z\">11.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Archie Thomas</strong>, the Green party\u2019s press manager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Archie_Thomas/status/771635846743101440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1,200 due to attend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPConf?src=hash\">#GPConf</a> in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Birmingham?src=hash\">#Birmingham</a> - approx. 40% are first-timers.</p>&mdash; Archie Thomas (@Archie_Thomas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Archie_Thomas/status/771635846743101440\">September 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9572be4b09a68e9b64eaa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T10:46:46.117Z\">11.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peter and I have arrived at the conference.

A former MEP, and the only Green MP (she has represented Brighton Pavilion since 2010), she led the party from 2008 until 2012 and, even after she stepped down (she said she wanted others in the party to have a chance to raise their profile), she found it hard not to overshadow her successor, Natalie Bennett. An excellent media performer and accomplished parliamentarian, she is one of the few people in the party one could easily imagine serving in cabinet.</p> <p>Bartley, from Lambeth in south London, is the party\u2019s work and pensions spokesman. A former researcher for the Conservative party in the 1990s, he is the founder of a Christian thinktank, Ekklesia, and he has been active in the Green party for some years, standing as a candidate in London elections. He has a disabled son (and achieved prominence in the 2010 general election when he challenged David Cameron on camera over Tory policies on inclusive education) and he cites being a parent as one reason why he is applying for the leadership as a job share.</p> <p>Lucas and Bartely want to form a new \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/caroline-lucas-stand-green-party-leadership-job-share\">Lucas told the Guardian earlier this summer: </a>\u201cI really think there is an appetite out there now for a less tribal politics ... There is a sense, which we felt very strongly with the job share idea itself, that more ideas, the more plural your politics, the more likely they will be effective, and reach more people\u201d.</p> <p>The Lucas/Bartley website is <a href=\"http://www.bartleylucas.com/\">here.</a></p> <h2>Clive Lord</h2> <p>Clive Lord is virtually a founder member of the Green party, having joined in March 1973, five months after it was set up. Aged 81 (although \u201cremarkably fit for my age\u201d, he says in his election statement), he says he is only standing because his preferred candidate, Andrew Cooper, did not put himself forward.

Ukip went from a party attracting under 1m votes (3.1%) in the general election six years ago to one getting 3.9m votes (12.6%) in 2015. The SNP transformed itself from a party that was seen as lucky to form a minority administration in Edinburgh to one that is now the unchallenged party of government in Scotland, with almost all the countries\u2019 MPs. And, in a less dramatic way, the same trended boosted the Greens. In 2010 they got just 286,000 votes (1%). Last year they were up to 1.2m (3.8%.) and their leader, Natalie Bennett, achieved prominence because she was included in the TV debates.</p> <p>But since then the Green party has collided with an obstacle - called Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn\u2019s purist, anti-capitalist, green-tinged radicalism overlaps to a considerable degree with the Green party\u2019s policy platform. It is not just that Corbyn has an allotment; at the general election <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/18/green-party-citizens-income-natalie-bennett-benefit\">the Greens\u2019 flagship policy proposal was for a citizen\u2019s income </a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/05/john-mcdonnell-labour-universal-basic-income-welfare-benefits-compass-report\">Corbyn and his team are now actively considering whether Labour should adopt the idea. </a>As a result the Greens start their autumn conference today in Birmingham facing the challenge of how to compete or coexist with a Corbynite Labour party that seems to be stealing their USP.</p> <p>They also have to choose a new leader, although in truth they have already done so because the voting is over. The result will be announced at 2pm. Caroline Lucas, the former leader and only Green MP, is standing along with Jonathan Bartley as a job share and, although there are five other candidates, Lucas and Bartley are the overwhelming favourites to be elected. Almost 15,000 members votes in the contest (a turnout of 34%) but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that this is only the second most important leadership election for Green party voters this summer. After last year\u2019s Labour leadership election <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/09/15/anatomy-corbyns-victory/\">a YouGov analysis concluded that 40,000 of those voting in the contest were people who had voted Green in 2015. </a>Overwhelmingly they were voting for Corbyn. It is likely that this year there are more Green voters from 2015 taking party in Labour\u2019s leadership contest than in the Greens\u2019.</p> <p>I\u2019m on a Virgin train to Birmingham at the moment (with a seat) and I will be covering the opening of the conference, as well as any other Green-related developments. After the results of the leadership election are announced, the new leaders, or leaders, will address the conference.

This was a book that combined standard-issue revolutionary rhetoric with deadly serious and very practical advice about how to make bombs. It has become a standard text, a locus classicus: but not with the revolutionary left, exactly. The book has been linked with almost every killing spree and mass shooting in the US.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/30/after-kent-state-1970s-anti-war-student-art-in-pictures\">After Kent State: 1970s anti-war student art \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Powell was an alienated teen, part of the angry Vietnam and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/30/after-kent-state-1970s-anti-war-student-art-in-pictures\">Kent State</a> generation. After a brief storm of publicity, and after getting ripped off by his publisher, Powell more or less vanished from the public eye.</p> <p>Siskel tracks him down to find a gentle, bland, grandfatherly figure. He is a retired teacher who once specialised in helping children with learning difficulties, living placidly in France.</p> <p>Siskel subjects him to diffident yet thorough questioning from behind the camera, in the manner of Errol Morris. He quotes some of the more blood-curdlingly pro-violence passages from the book. Powell is often silent, offering no comebacks. His embarrassment is obvious \u2013 in some ways it is the dramatic and comic point of the entire film. But there is more to it.</p> <p> He is perhaps reluctant to undergo the humiliation of a full climb-down (especially galling for a teacher used to imposing his will on a class) or is unwilling to abandon his youthful zeal. But Siskel highlights how Powell has been in a state of denial about his book for decades \u2013 despite the professional grief it has caused him and despite the disavowals he has published on Amazon and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/19/anarchist-cookbook-author-william-powell-out-of-print\">in the Guardian</a>. He is coming out of denial right here, in front of the camera.</p> <p>Powell has been in retreat from his creation, which partly explains why he has taken so many teaching posts outside the US. He is also in denial about the personal, psychological origins of his work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/19/anarchist-cookbook-author-william-powell-out-of-print\">I wrote the Anarchist Cookbook in 1969.

And there is also something remarkable in a 19-year-old Powell researching this book using open sources (mainly US military pamphlets) from the New York Public Library. There are PhD theses with far less originality and scholarly verve.</p> <p>Even at the time, Powell wrote that his book might be used (fallaciously, as he saw it) by rightwing militia groups like the Minutemen. He also quoted the revolutionary statements of Abraham Lincoln. But in fact these gonzo-libertarian implications helped to keep The Anarchist Cookbook in print and available online, where it continues to inspire people like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/17/columbine-massacre-gun-crime-us\">Columbine school killers.</a></p> <p>Powell now rejects violence, but with no great emotional displays or mea culpas. To some degree, Siskel lets him off the hook with his insights about Powell\u2019s own unhappy teenage years, perceptive though this material is. But oddly, neither Powell nor Siskel talk about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/21/gun-control-debate-mass-shootings-gun-violence\">US gun laws</a> \u2013 which would surely be a key argument in Powell\u2019s defence. I suspect that the film-maker was himself unwilling to raise an issue that might make his subject and his film look peripheral. But this is an intriguing and original study, and a great scoop for Charlie Siskel.</p>",
  "<p>Even if you\u2019re not studying maths at uni, you\u2019ll have to become an expert at numbers. Because student life is expensive and learning how to budget is one of the most important skills you\u2019ll learn \u2013 possibly even more useful than anything you\u2019ll pick up at a lecture. </p> <p>If you\u2019re terrified by the fact that universities can now charge up to \u00a39,000 a year in tuition fees, don\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s not upfront. You only begin to pay this fee after graduation and when you\u2019re earning \u00a321,000 or more. After 30 years, if the debt is not repaid, it is written off.</p> <p>But there are other costs: rent, food, having fun. How do you pay for these? Full-time students in England starting fresher life this year can apply for a maximum maintenance loan of \u00a310,700 \u2013 but that\u2019s for students from a low household income living away from home, at a London uni; the amount you\u2019ll actually receive depends on your family\u2019s finances. The support is different for students from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, so check with your local funding institution.</p> <p>If you\u2019re from a low-income background, are disabled or a carer, or have kids, there are other grants available, such as the Disabled Students Allowance to cover the cost of specialist equipment and/or a non-medical helper. </p> <p>It\u2019s also worth searching the internet to find other sources of student funding: local charities, educational trusts and even some schools offer grants to uni-goers. Universities also offer hardship bursaries, so speak to the finance officer if you think you might be eligible.</p> <p>But most students top up their income with a job. There\u2019s the usual bar and shop work, and irregular jobs such as doing deliveries, babysitting, or IT support locally can be a good way to earn cash around your studies. Some big companies \u2013 accountancy, legal and consultancy firms \u2013 the NHS and armed forces sponsor students throughout uni, usually on the understanding that they work for them before or after university, or during holidays. Most unis recommend students limit their paid work to a maximum of 15 hours a week in term time, so they can stay up to speed on academic work too. </p> <p>Other potential sources of funding are your parents \u2013 well, it\u2019s worth asking \u2013 and an overdraft from the bank. When you\u2019re comparing student accounts, pick the one with the biggest overdraft \u2013 that\u2019s interest-free cash \u2013 rather than the juiciest free gift, because it\u2019ll be worth far more over your student career. And always avoid an unauthorised overdraft \u2013 when you go into the red without asking the bank \u2013 as this comes with expensive fees.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>Tips for living on a shoestring</h2> <p>Sure, you get a student discount at Topshop, but that\u2019s not the only way you can save money as soon as you start university. You\u2019ll probably be spending a fair amount on travel \u2013 to and from home if you\u2019re living on campus, or to see friends and family \u2013 so work out if you\u2019ll make savings with the 16-25 Railcard (full-time students who are over 25 can also be eligible). It costs \u00a330, but comes free with the Santander student bank account. If you prefer travelling by coach, National Express\u2019s \u00a310 student card gives one-third off fares. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7fbb907ecc079917863ee22289ae948605f57832\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fbb907ecc079917863ee22289ae948605f57832/38_0_916_1364/672.jpg\" alt=\"Cartoon can of beans\" width=\"672\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eating cheaply will be one of your student-life challenges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Stevie Gee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For food, try to shop and cook with other students to make the most of multibuy offers, and don\u2019t rely on the supermarket \u2013 you might find cheaper food at local markets or pound stores.

You can even get money off online shopping: at Amazon, for example, students get 5% off, but you do need to have the NUS Extra card, which gives access to lots of discounts but costs \u00a312. <br></p>",
  "<p>The resettlement of Syrian refugees has been a political flashpoint of the US presidential election. This week, Donald Trump used a speech outlining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">his hardline views on immigration and national security</a> to once again raise the specter that terrorists could infiltrate the Syrian resettlement program in the US. </p> <p>As a safeguard, the Republican nominee announced that his administration would suspend immigration from Syria and Libya.

Watch what\u2019s going to happen, folks. It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the hot rhetoric and controversial proposals, Trump is tapping into serious anxieties about national security and the threat of terrorism. Here we <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress\">revisit the topic of Syrian resettlement </a>in the US in an effort to try to separate fact from fiction.</p> <h2>We actually do know who these people are</h2> <p>Despite Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claim that the US doesn\u2019t know who it lets into the country, the US\u2019s refugee vetting process is among the most rigorous in the western world. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/11/249613.htm\">The state department</a> has said that Syrians flown to the US are among the most heavily vetted group of people currently allowed into the country.</p> <p>In total, the screening process takes an average of 18 months to two years and involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies who carry out a series of security screenings and checks. </p> <p>The process begins with an initial vetting by the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency. Prospective candidates are then referred to the US, where officials from the state department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the defense department conduct further vetting. </p> <p>The homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, said recently that the department had \u201cadded security checks to the process\u201d specifically for Syrian refugees as well as designated more resources to help make the process more efficient. As an added check, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services are instructed to review the social media accounts of Syrian refugee applicants who are referred for more enhanced vetting. </p> <p>Immigration officials have a very good idea of who they are accepting from Syria even before their plane touches down on American soil. </p> <h2>How many Syrian refugees has the US accepted?</h2> <p>The answer is significantly more than<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress\"> the last time we posed that question</a>. </p> <p>After a painstakingly slow start, the White House announced this week that it had achieved its goal of resettling 10,000 refugees by the end of this fiscal year. </p> <p>Barack Obama made the commitment last year under pressure from Europe and the United Nations for the US to play a bigger role in confronting the global refugee crisis. The majority of the refugees were accepted in the last three months. Before that, the US had admitted just a quarter of the 10,000 displaced Syrians it pledged to resettle. In total, the US has resettled roughly 12,000 Syrian refugees since the war began five years ago.</p> <p>To help ease the integration process, the refugees are resettled in areas where they have family ties. For those who have none, the resettlement groups try to place them in cities with an established community of Syrian immigrants or where they will have the best chance of finding jobs.<br></p> <p>These groups \u2013 a coalition of humanitarian and religious nonprofits \u2013 help adults find work, enroll their children in school and learn English. During this process, they receive housing and financial assistance. One year after being admitted, refugees can apply for a green card at which point they must submit to another screening.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-u-s-should-take-65000-syrian-refugees/\"> has called </a>for the US to resettle an additional 55,000 refugees from Syria in addition to the 10,000 pledged by Obama. And even if the US were to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees, it will still be just a fraction of the more than 4.8 million Syrians who have fled mostly to neighboring countries who are bearing the biggest burden of the world\u2019s largest refugee crisis. </p> <h2><strong>Are Syrian refugees likely to be Isis sympathizers?</strong></h2> <p>The Syrian refugees who are coming to the US are among the most vulnerable in the Syrian conflict: many are women and their children, religious minorities and victims of violence or torture. Many have fled to escape the brutality of both the Islamic State, or Isis, and the Assad government and are doing so at their own peril. </p> <p>The worsening Syrian refugee crisis has undermined Isis\u2019s claim that its caliphate is a safe haven for Muslims. In choosing to risk their lives on the dangerous journey to Europe and beyond rather than join Isis\u2019s caliphate is a sharp rejection of the group and its ideology.

When the US shuts the door on Syrian Muslims, it reinforces Isis\u2019s argument that the west does not want to assist them and that their only salvation lies in Isis.</p> <h2><strong>Could dangerous refugees come to the US?</strong></h2> <p>The refugees admitted to the US are much different than those arriving at Europe\u2019s borders. </p> <p>Unlike in Europe, where immigrants can cross through Turkey and then enter Greece, the immigrants who arrive will have cleared a lengthy screening process. Because of Europe\u2019s Schengen system, refugees could conceivably pass between EU countries without having to show a passport or submit to a background check. </p> <p>Public anxiety over the arrival of refugees has a historical precedent. The controversy over Syrian immigrants has <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/19/9760060/refugees-history-holocaust\">recalled</a> Americans\u2019 reluctance to accept Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany in the years just before the second world war. </p> <p>And yet an <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/us-record-shows-refugees-are-not-threat\">October 2015 analysis by the Migration Policy Institute</a> is a reminder of why many of these fears are misplaced. Of the 784,000 refugees resettled in the United States since 11 September 2001, just three have been arrested for planning terrorist activities, the report found. It adds for context that of those three cases \u201ctwo were not planning an attack in the United States and the plans of the third were barely credible\u201d. </p> <p>Finally, denying Syrian refugees entry to the United States would break a decades-long American tradition. After the second world war, the US created its first formal resettlement programs and began to position itself as a safe haven for the persecuted. In the 1970s, the US accepted <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/syria-refugees-europe-vietnam\">hundreds of thousands</a> of Vietnamese refugees. In 1980, the US accepted as many as 125,000 Cubans during the Mariel boatlift crisis. The 1990s saw an influx of refugees fleeing the wars in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/syrian_refugees_per_pop/giv-32650YJN6SYy5Ympe/\" data-alt=\"Refugees and population\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/syrian_refugees_per_pop/giv-32650YJN6SYy5Ympe/\">Refugees and population</a> </figure>",

Yet it misses the mark on both counts, lacking either the confidence or elegance of its forebears.</p> <p>In an attempt to break up the building\u2019s bulk, the architects have employed a multitude of different claddings, using fins and grids and faceted walls of glazing, but the pick\u2019n\u2019mix collage only calls attention to the building\u2019s heft.

They are laid down in the treaty and ratified by parliaments in each and every member state. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never been a secret that tax exemptions could be state aid, and that if so, they\u2019d have to be paid back. The only secret was the tax rulings themselves.\u201d</p> <p>She pointed out that Brussels gave guidance to member states as long ago as 1998, warning them how tax deals to big businesses might, in some circumstances, risk being classed as state aid. There was also European case law on the treatment of sweetheart tax deals and state aid.</p> <p>Also on Friday morning, the European commission\u2019s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, separately gave another critical response to Kroes\u2019s remarks at a press conference in Brussels. \u201cWe understand it may sometimes be challenging to reconcile the role [held by Kroes] as a former commissioner with the temptation to publicly express the views of those \u2013 in Silicon Valley or elsewhere - who oppose the commission\u2019s decisions,\u201d he said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Schinas\u2019s words appear to have been a thinly veiled reference to the fact that Kroes was <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-04/uber-names-former-eu-vice-president-kroes-to-new-advisory-board\">appointed to the advisory board</a> of taxi-hailing app group Uber Technologies in May.

  "<p>A week after patching three serious vulnerabilities in iOS, Apple has released a matching software update to fix the same flaws in its computer operating system macOS.</p> <p>The urgent security update affects the most recent two versions of macOS, El Capitan and Yosemite, and blocks weaknesses in Safari and the base operating system. It can be downloaded through software update on affected machines.</p> <p>The vulnerabilities were discovered when an attempt to hack into the iPhone of an Arab activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/apple-ios-update-arab-activists-iphone-spyware\">was discovered by two security consultancies</a>, Lookout Mobile and Citizen Lab. Ahmed Mansour received two suspicious text messages in early august, claiming to offer new information about dissidents being tortured in the UAE. Mansour forwarded the links to the security researchers, who found a hitherto unknown type of spyware: one that could take total control of an iPhone running the latest version of iOS simply by the user opening the link in Safari.</p> <p>Apple was informed, and the existence of the weaknesses was kept secret until the company was able to put together a patch for its mobile phones. But the underlying architecture of iOS and macOS is similar enough that the flaws also exist in Apple\u2019s computers.</p> <p>The company has not explained why it took a week after disclosure to fix its desktop operating systems. In theory, the delay left users open to attack, since cybercriminals were alerted to the existence of the vulnerability the day the iOS patch was released. But in practice, there are no reports of macOS malware in the wild that use these vulnerabilities \u2013 yet.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mac users would be well advised to update their computers sooner rather than later.</p>",

  "<p>A judge has recommended that a British woman on death row in Texas should not be granted a new trial, dealing a blow to her hopes of avoiding execution.</p> <p>David Garner made his decision on Thursday after listening to closing arguments on Monday at the end of a hearing in which Linda Carty\u2019s defence team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/linda-carty-grandmother-death-row-texas-new-evidence\">argued that she was denied due process</a> at trial because prosecutors allowed false testimony, failed to disclose evidence and hid the existence of deals with witnesses.</p> <p>Carty was sentenced to death in 2002 for orchestrating the kidnap and murder of her neighbour in Houston, Joana Rodriguez, who was found bound and asphyxiated in the trunk of a car the previous year. Prosecutors said that after several miscarriages, Carty was desperate for a child, wanted to steal Rodriguez\u2019s newborn baby and recruited three men to carry out the plot. The baby survived. </p> <p>The 57-year-old former teacher and ex-Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) informant, who is a British citizen because she was born on the Caribbean island of St Kitts when it was under UK rule, has insisted she is innocent.</p> <p>But Garner, a visiting judge based in nearby Galveston County, recommended that her application be denied, finding that the evidence did not show that Texas knowingly used perjured testimony, failed to correct untrue testimony or presented misleading testimony at trial.</p> <p>His assessment will be passed to the Texas court of criminal appeals, which will review it and decide whether to grant a new trial.</p> <p>\u201cThe judge found that the State did not coerce any witnesses to provide false or misleading testimony,\u201d Jeff McShan, a spokesman for the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office, said in a statement. \u201cThe court of criminal appeals will review the case and make a final determination on Carty\u2019s writ.\u201d</p> <p>Garner did determine that the state withheld or failed to disclose witness statements and information that could have helped Carty\u2019s cause \u2013 known as Brady violations \u2013 but concluded it was unlikely that this would have made a difference to the jury\u2019s decisions. He ruled that it is up to the appeals court to decide whether he can make a judgment on the significance of an alleged deal between the state and a witness.</p> <p>Carty has lost multiple state and federal appeals, previously contending that her counsel was ineffective. Her trial lawyers spent only two weeks preparing; one, Jerry Guerinot, <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20160813-texas-lawyer-who-never-won-a-capital-murder-case-calls-it-quits-defending-the-very-worst-clients.ece\">became infamous</a> for his lack of success when representing capital murder clients.</p> <p>She did not appear at this hearing, which centered on the alleged lengths that prosecutors in a county dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s death penalty capital\u201d went to in order to secure a death sentence for a high-profile and particularly egregious killing.</p> <p>Connie Spence and Craig Goodhart, two trial prosecutors who still work for Harris County, were accused during the hearing in Houston of \u201cgamesmanship\u201d and a \u201cpervasive ends justify the means attitude\u201d by Michael Goldberg, one of Carty\u2019s attorneys.</p> <p>He claimed that prosecutors cherry-picked questionable evidence to fit their narrative and withheld information from Carty\u2019s trial attorneys, resulting in a distorted picture that persuaded a jury to convict Carty of capital murder.<br>The judge was also told by Carty\u2019s lawyers that prosecutors had destroyed documents and emails that might have helped her cause.</p> <p>Charles Mathis, a former DEA agent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/linda-carty-grandmother-death-row-texas-new-evidence\">testified</a> that Spence threatened to invent a story about him having had an affair with Carty in order to blackmail him into testifying against her.</p> <p>Carty\u2019s alleged accomplices avoided the death penalty. One, Chris Robinson, claimed in a 2014 affidavit that he was told to testify that he saw Carty put a bag over Rodriguez\u2019s head, which he said was untrue. </p> <p>\u201cSpence and Goodhart had a version of events in their minds and they were alternating between coaching me and threatening me to get me to say their version,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/255684064/Chris-Robinson-Affidavit\">he said</a>.</p> <p>Spence and Goodhart appeared at the hearing and denied misconduct, with Spence rejecting Mathis\u2019s claim, the Houston Chronicle <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Prosecutors-accused-of-hiding-evidence-inventing-8340431.php\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Judge Garner made it clear in his findings that he was not persuaded by Mathis\u2019s testimony or Robinson\u2019s affidavit.</p> <p>Joshua Reiss, an assistant district attorney, conceded Monday that standards are now different regarding the ways prosecutors provide information to defence attorneys. \u201cThere are things that went on in the trial that today might honestly make us wince a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] that was the law [at the time].\u201d</p> <p>Goldberg disagreed. \u201cThe state\u2019s basic theory was that they could hide what they wanted because that was the norm back in 2002, but the reality is the constitutional requirements have never changed,\u201d he told the Guardian after the hearing. The judge concurred, writing that prosecutors at the time operated under a misunderstanding of the law, deciding whether to turn over certain evidence based on \u201cgut instinct\u201d and \u201cjudgment call\u201d.</p> <p>The scrutiny of Carty\u2019s case and unusual decision to hold a hearing into the misconduct claims comes at a testing time for the death penalty even in Texas, which carries out the punishment more than any other US state. </p> <p>Fifteen people have been executed in the US this year; six in Texas, which is the only state with executions scheduled in the remainder of 2016, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.</p> <p>Though Texas has not endured the botched executions and difficulties sourcing lethal injection drugs that have paralysed the process in other states, it <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/upcoming-executions#stays\">has not</a> put anyone to death since 6 April \u2013 an unusually long gap caused by multiple stays granted by the appeals court, which seems to have become more willing in recent months to give inmates extended opportunities to push for the re-examination of their cases.</p>",
  "<p>Until 10 May 2015, off-road motorcycling, also known as green-laning, was my passion. My friends and I would ride until we were 20 miles from anywhere, then sit and take off our boots in the most peaceful, uncharted pockets of calm.</p> <p>It was a typical spring day in the Lake District \u2013 freezing and raining. One of my mates had some trouble with his bike, so I stopped to help. We got going and headed up a steep mountain road, but another of our friends had turned back to check on us. He and I were both doing around 30mph when we met on a corner. We tried to go around each other, but we moved in sync, blocking each other, left, then right, then left again. Three seconds later, the lad I\u2019d been helping came round the corner and saw us both lying in a heap, unconscious.</p> <p>I later learned that, eventually, 45 park wardens, paramedics, mountain rescue and police came to&#xa0;this usually isolated spot. Internal&#xa0;bleeding in my chest meant I couldn\u2019t be resuscitated; my chest was so full of blood that my lungs wouldn\u2019t inflate, so they had to push two holes into my ribcage and squeeze all the blood out, then give me a transfusion right there on the forest floor. I died several times over the three hours when I stopped breathing. Just before the helicopter took off with me in it, the paramedics told my friends that, after so many things had gone wrong, they were pretty certain I wouldn\u2019t make it to hospital.</p> <p>Two weeks later, I woke up. I don\u2019t remember any of that time. All&#xa0;I knew was that I couldn\u2019t speak; I was all tubes and morphine. I didn\u2019t look in a mirror, so I didn\u2019t know how bad it was, but my face was smashed up and twisted until they operated, a week or so later. My wife asked the surgeon to make me look like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005458/\">Jason Statham</a> \u2013 he didn\u2019t appreciate the joke. It wasn\u2019t until a checkup, after coming home from hospital, that I saw an x-ray. That\u2019s when I started asking questions.</p> <p>On impact, our heads had collided and my helmet had disintegrated. My left eye socket had moved almost an inch downwards. My chin was crushed and the bone was left completely open to the elements, my nose hanging off at 45 degrees.</p> <p>The x-ray showed my face after surgery. I counted 52 screws and 13 weird-shaped plates holding the bones together. There was a girder-and-wire arrangement to keep my teeth in place, which has since been taken out, so my jaw would set back into shape. The surgeon had gone in through slits in front of my ear, under my eye, and under my lip, where it meets the gum. I was amazed by how they could do that without leaving lines or scars. It all works, but when I open my mouth wide to eat a banana my jaw clicks. My face is still a bit twisted, and it isn\u2019t symmetrical, so I\u2019ve grown a beard to hide that. I look trendy for the first time in my life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/playing-pokemon-go-crashed-car-experience\">I crashed my car playing Pok\u00e9mon Go</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Apart from a bit of pain in my arm and my leg, things are back to normal \u2013 I\u2019m working full-time as an aircraft engineer.

They are known as universal donors; their blood can be given to anyone, regardless of blood group, which is crucial in an accident like mine, when there is no time to do a test.</p> <p>Before this happened, I thought I was the man of the family. Now it is obvious that my wife is top of the tree. She showed incredible resilience while I was unconscious&#xa0;\u2013 for four days, they couldn\u2019t tell her if I would live or die.

But can the humanity that drove, starved and hunted them to extinction also be their salvation?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/23/adventures-in-the-anthropocene-by-gaia-vance-review\">Adventures in the Anthropocene by Gaia Vince \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is one of the increasingly urgent questions that Gaia Vince addresses in her dazzling work of global reportage, which won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/24/top-science-royal-society-winton-book-prize-won-by-woman-for-first-time\">Royal Society Winton prize in 2015</a>. \u201cWill we learn to love the new nature we make, or mourn the old?\u201d she asks in Adventures in the Anthropocene. \u201cWill we embrace living efficiently or will we spread out over newly ice-free landscapes. Will we eat new foods, plant new crops, raise new animals? Will we make space for wildlife in this human world?\u201d<br></p> <p>Journalism might merely be the first draft of history, but since the Anthropocene is only estimated by the IGC to have begun in 1950 and is likely to go on for many thousands of years, that first draft is badly needed. Vince set out to supply it, leaving her job as news editor of Nature magazine to trudge around many of the world\u2019s most embattled environments \u2013 from mountains to oceans, forests to deserts \u2013 finding out how people are surviving in them.</p> <p>In Peru, she discovers two friends who are painting a mountain white in an attempt to bring back the glacier that made their valley habitable.

The beauty of this idea made my eyes water. The Anthropocene\u2019s usual encounters with previous geological eras involve drilling, quarrying and fracking, but these villagers have effectively put a pair of spark-plugs between them, creating a model for a future sustainably powered by the interaction of past and present, constancy and change, flood and drought.</p> <p>I love this book for what it says about the resourcefulness of humanity, the capacity of ordinary people to make a difference, and for those small differences to add up to something that might even turn the planet away from its apparently unstoppable hurtle towards environmental destruction. </p> <p>Vince doesn\u2019t shirk the hard stuff \u2013 the whats, whys and whethers of conservation. She acknowledges that extinction is not unique to the Anthropocene, and she is clear that many of the schemes she witnesses will fail. But where they do, others will spring up. I keep returning to her book, because there is hope between these pages of colourful reportage: from the former fashion executive who is breeding Chinese tigers in South Africa to the Caribbean fisherman who has built a fruit garden on an island made of garbage. With such will and ingenuity, there may yet even be hope for the Asiatic cheetah.</p>",
  "<p>If you like movie confrontation, then take your seats for a battle of epic proportions: trans people v Hollywood.</p> <p>The trans community has long objected to the way major film companies have sidelined trans actors, while simultaneously demonising or pathologising trans characters.

Rodriguez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which is exactly Richards\u2019 point. Movies create a halo effect, endowing real people with imagined characteristics. Trans authenticity is already frequently challenged: so casting non-trans actors, and pushing a narrative that suggests being trans is just a matter of acting or \u201cputting on a dress\u201d, contributes directly to discrimination and violence.</p> <p>And despite Ruffalo\u2019s protestations, it\u2019s not hard to do better. Here are some pointers for would-be movie moguls keen to cover the topical issue of trans life:</p> <h2>Involve trans people</h2> <p>In the UK groups such as <a href=\"http://www.transmediawatch.org/\" title=\"\">Trans Media Watch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.allabouttrans.org.uk/\" title=\"\">All About Trans</a>, will help you to understand the sensitivities and the issues and put you in touch with real trans people. No one is going to lay down the law: but they will let you know if you are falling into cliche and tired tropes.</p> <h2>Explore actual trans narratives</h2> <p>Not every film need mimic mundane reality. There is drama, comedy and interest aplenty in the lived experience of ordinary trans folk. Likewise not every trans person is hero or villain, homicidal axe murderer or pathetic victim. In fact most trans people are very ordinary indeed. Don\u2019t obsess over the extraordinary or dwell on negatives.</p> <h2>Avoid unnecessary triggers</h2> <p>Trans people are so often a target for violence and discrimination, it would be preferable if we weren\u2019t constantly reminded of this. Happy endings are good, but so too is not finishing face down in a gutter.</p> <h2>Stop and think about when to use trans and non-trans actors</h2> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean handing every trans role to a trans person (The Danish Girl, covering transition, is a case in point). Nor is it about relegating trans actors to a trans ghetto. Do, though, consider the impact of casting on both the trans community and audience. If you do use non-trans actors, casting according to (final) gender rather than initial body type is preferable</p> <h2>But don\u2019t keep giving trans roles to non-trans people</h2> <p>This plays straight into the hands of those who would harm us politically, legislatively or on the streets</p> <h2>Learn from the best</h2> <p>Films like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/nov/12/tangerine-video-review\" title=\"\">Tangerine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jan/29/sundance-2015-paris-is-burning-restored-jennie-livingston\" title=\"\">Paris Is Burning</a>, or TV series like <a href=\"http://www.herstoryshow.com/\" title=\"\">Her Story</a> \u2013 even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jun/04/1\" title=\"\">The Matrix</a>, which just brims with trans imagery and symbolism \u2013 all point the way to doing trans better.</p> <p>Above all, when you\u2019ve just, for the umpteenth time, done something that the trans community loathes and feels misrepresented by \u2013 and has told you so \u2013 don\u2019t mutter self-deprecatingly about the need to learn and promise to get it right next time. Because the trans community is fed up with jam tomorrow. Tolerance of Hollywood\u2019s carelessness is at an all-time low and if things don\u2019t improve, then, as they say in the movies: \u201cThis means war!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c15ae968e677c24d080dd262f35c834a0fb34537\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c15ae968e677c24d080dd262f35c834a0fb34537/0_187_2319_1391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Films like Paris Is Burning point the way to doing trans better\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Films like Paris Is Burning point the way to doing trans better.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Launching themselves from cliffs wearing a nylon bodysuit, the \u201cwing\u201d being formed by air filling a piece of fabric stretched between the arms and legs, its practitioners glide at speeds of up to 150mph (241 km per hour), often skimming close to the ground before eventually deploying a parachute.</p> <p>But after the sport\u2019s most deadly summer, during which there has been almost two dozen deaths in three months \u2013 the vast majority in the Alps, where flying is legal \u2013 participants have begun asking why wingsuit flying has suddenly turned so lethal.</p> <p>It has not only been less experienced wingsuit fliers who have been dying this summer, but also some of the sport\u2019s most experienced and well-known figures. </p> <p>Those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/base-jumpers-die-in-switzerland\">include Uli Emanuele</a>, famous for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/jul/08/base-jumper-wingsuit-rock-crack-gopro-record-video\">flying through a small rock window in Switzerland in 2015</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/08/23/base-jumper-alexander-polli-dies-after-crashing-into-a-tree-in-the-french-alps/\">Alexander Polli, both of whom were killed in accidents in the Alps last month</a> \u2013 in Polli\u2019s case attempting to perform a spiral manoeuvre before hitting a tree.</p> <p>And the sheer number of deaths \u2013 in towns such as Chamonix, below Mont Blanc, and in the Lauterbrunnen area of Switzerland \u2013 has reached such a level that it is causing serious concern among mountain rescue teams and local residents \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/base-jumping-in-switzerland-village-appalled-by-thrill-seekers-deaths-a-784896.html\">some of whom have witnessed fatal accidents</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3a23ececd5a27cd183bf7e761de0ce9c3558147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3a23ececd5a27cd183bf7e761de0ce9c3558147/0_151_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Switzerland\u2019s G\u00e9raldine Fasnacht jumps from the top of the Br\u00e9vent mountain to glide over the French resort of Chamonix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Switzerland\u2019s G\u00e9raldine Fasnacht jumps from the top of the Br\u00e9vent mountain to glide over the French resort of Chamonix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Desmazes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Commenting after Polli\u2019s death, the head of the mountain rescue services in Chamonix, Colonel Stephane Bozon, criticised what he described as the recklessness of some fliers, describing the problem as frightening.</p> <p>\u201cThis requires our full attention,\u201d said Bozon in the immediate aftermath of the accident, adding that authorities were working to prevent such tragedies being repeated. \u201cIt is a practice that frightens us.

These include the increasingly high visibility of extreme supports \u2013 including via point-of-view footage from helmet cams \u2013 which has made such pursuits seem accessible and attractive to a wider pool of interested participants despite the risks.</p> <p>Analysis of the accidents suggests many of those killed \u2013 whether experienced or less experienced \u2013 were \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d at the time of their accident, leading some to suggest that the flying community needs to be more conscious of the risks involved. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.epictv.com/media/podcast/ellen-brennan-will-show-you-why-wingsuit-flying-is-worth-the-risk-%7C-wild-women-ep-6/600177\">Ellen Brennan, a flier based in Chamonix, </a>where there has been a growing number of fatal accidents, believes the main problem is overconfidence and complacency.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have to say that the majority of the accidents have occurred because of the jumper overestimating his or her own abilities,\u201d she said. \u201cOften jumpers become complacent and comfortable at certain jumps leading them to believe they can get away with pushing their limits much further, or ignore less than ideal weather conditions. Unfortunately we are not superman, we are fragile meat missiles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0655e31c17f1e29a5d2efb32714f74d3f1b3da8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0655e31c17f1e29a5d2efb32714f74d3f1b3da8e/33_72_666_812/410.jpg\" alt=\"Wingsuit jumper Uli Emanuele.\" width=\"410\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wingsuit jumper Uli Emanuele.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Matt Gerdes, a flier and wingsuit designer at the the US manufacturer Squirrel, is among those calling for more education in the sport. \u201cIf we were to work on just one thing, it would be education,\u201d he posted on Facebook in May.</p> <p>\u201cThe simple truth is that wingsuit Base jumpers don\u2019t know what they are getting into, don\u2019t know how to practice the sport safely, and don\u2019t even know enough to know how little they know.\u201d</p> <p>Comparing wingsuit flying to big wave surfing, Gerdes pointed out that wingsuit flying \u2013 while more dangerous \u2013 appears much easier at first, encouraging a too fast progression. </p> <p>\u201c[The comparison to] big wave surfing is interesting. Base jumping is far more dangerous and fatal, yet much easier,\u201d he told the Guardian last week. \u201cAfter just a couple of hundred skydives most people consider themselves more than ready to Base jump. And it\u2019s usually shortly after that they put on a wingsuit. This absurdly fast progression happens in less than a year in many cases.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the fact is that it is very easy, and it feels very easy, until it goes wrong. The sport is so easy that it sucks pilots into feeling like they can handle it all and that they are really good at it. It feels more like a video game than a sport and the finality of an error is impossible for most young people to grasp.\u201d</p> <p>There remains a question too of how much of an extra safety margin experience brings to a pursuit where tiny variations in turbulence and conditions can be crucial and where \u2013 say those like Webb \u2013 complacency is as big a risk as inexperience.</p> <p>Among those with deep familiarity with the risks of wingsuit flying is <a href=\"http://stephdavis.co/\">Steph Davis, an accomplished American rock climber and flier whose husband, Mario Richard, was killed in a flying accident in Italy in 2013. </a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1fcdedd4afd0dfbf9ab63785cce2e9e1a05eb6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1fcdedd4afd0dfbf9ab63785cce2e9e1a05eb6a/0_0_825_743/500.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Polli died while performing a complex spin.\" width=\"500\" height=\"450\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Polli died while performing a complex spin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the last five years wingsuit Base jumping has changed significantly,\u201d Davis, who made her first jump in 2007, told the Guardian from Chamonix, where she is currently flying. </p> <p>\u201cI come from a background of adventure climbing and this strongly affects how I make decisions and how I fly. The understanding of risk and margins of safety is something that takes time to develop.\u201d </p> <p>Davis traces a number of developments in particular that have changed flying dramatically since she began.</p> <p>\u201c[At first] people were interested in how far the suits could fly, more than getting close to terrain. Then people started diving down to terrain and flying right over the ground or the trees, what I used to call \u2018mowing the lawn\u2019,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis style of flying was being done by only the most advanced and experienced jumpers, but it coincided with small helmet cameras becoming accessible and affordable, as well as the rise of social media. Suddenly every jumper had a camera and wanted to show their footage and it had to be more and more impressive to get a positive reaction from others.\u201d</p> <p>Like Brennan and others, Davis identifies overconfidence as a key issue. \u201cThe recent spike in fatalities is a reflection of many different things, all involving decision making: overconfidence and a desire to continuously push (and get closer and closer to terrain, and then show footage of it) or lack of experience and/or understanding of consequences and mountain environments.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa2842c07cc4d45b92107bc39d2a3f8373175f34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa2842c07cc4d45b92107bc39d2a3f8373175f34/0_18_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chamonix, eastern France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chamonix, eastern France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Desmazes/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite his argument for more education, Gerdes, however, remains unconvinced that wingsuit flying can be regulated. \u201cRegulation is not really possible. Not any more than other mountain sports. Alpinism, mountain biking, rock climbing. What we will see is that the public will become more accustomed to seeing wingsuiters die. When 15 people die in an Alpine avalanche, it makes headlines, but people don\u2019t usually cry for mountaineering to be canceled as a sport.\u201d</p> <p>For his part, Bisharat, who has closely chronicled the sport, believes some regulation could have a positive effect. \u201cI think an informal regulation might help. You need a pilot license to fly a plane and you need a motorcycle license to ride a bike. I think having a wingsuit license could help, even if, in reality, it wouldn\u2019t be enforceable.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Davis is keen to underline why people are drawn to flying in the first place. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk in the media this week about danger and death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not why people fly. We fly because pushing off the edge of a cliff and feeling your wings inflate with air, seeing the walls beside you, and the Earth from above, is magic.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Online fashion retailer Asos has been forced to pay out more than \u00a320m to two European retailers due to an alleged infringement of the trademarks on their names.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/asos\">Asos</a> has reached a global settlement with Assos of Switzerland, which makes clothing for cyclists, and Anson\u2019s Herrenhaus, a German menswear retailer. The UK retailer will pay a total of \u00a320.2m in cash to the two companies.</p> <p>The deal will allow Asos to start selling athletic leisurewear, a growing segment of the youth fashion market. However, Asos will be restricted from selling cyclewear and opening shops in Germany.</p> <p>Assos and Anson\u2019s were already both in operation when Asos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/01/asos-founder-nick-robertson-chief-executive-steps-down\">changed its name from As Seen on Screen in 2002. </a>Anson\u2019s launched its legal case in 2010 and Assos launched its in 2011 as Asos began to expand rapidly outside the UK. Assos will open it first flagship store outside Switzerland in London\u2019s West End later this year.</p> <p>Asos had successfully defended its case in the UK right up to the supreme court. However, there are outstanding cases in the US, France and Germany.</p> <p>Despite the payment, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/asos-sales-brexit-benefits-pound-eu-referendum\">equal to almost six months profit for Asos</a>, shares in the company rose 132p, or 3%, to \u00a346.94.</p> <p>Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have put this litigation behind us. Entering into this settlement at this juncture is the right commercial decision for our business.\u201d</p> <p>Asos has been involved in disputes with rival retailers before over trademark infringements, but they have tended to involve accusations that the online retailer stole the design of an individual piece of clothing. The company said there were no other intellectual property cases that could have a material impact on its finances.</p> <p>Analysts at Berenberg said: \u201cIntellectual property law is very complex and varies significantly by country. Asos couldn\u2019t therefore guarantee that it would win all cases in all markets and as such decided to settle the disputes.\u201d</p> <p>The City welcomed the settlement because of the potential disruption the legal cases could have caused and the new opportunities that could open up for Asos.</p> <p>Simon Bowler, analyst at Exane, added: \u201cWhilst Asos has successfully defended itself until now, there was no certainty they would be successful in these markets. Losing a case in either of these markets would force Asos to rebrand, which was a significant risk that Asos has eliminated.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhilst the \u00a320.2m cash payment is optically large, this looks to be the right commercial decision for the business in the long term. The settlement brings certainty over the end of the dispute and eliminates any further litigation risk in Asos\u2019s biggest markets. The settlement also opens up the opportunity of moving the Asos own-brand into the attractive \u2018athleisure\u2019 market.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said: \u201cIn addition to removing a potentially large distraction, Asos will now be permitted to start selling sportswear on a global basis which they were previously unable to whilst the litigation was under way.</p> <p>\u201cSportswear, particularly yoga wear, gym wear, golf wear, could present a sizeable market share opportunity for Asos given its younger customer demographic and the growth we have been seeing in the premium sportswear market.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Here\u2019s an interesting speed fact. Two of the top three fastest human beings in track and field history were first spotted playing cricket. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/15/how-usain-bolt-made-history-with-his-third-100m-gold-medal-victory\" title=\"\">It was Usain Bolt\u2019s run-up</a> as a schoolboy fast bowler \u2013 imagine, for a moment, the sheer, oozing splendour of the Bolt run-up \u2013 that gave a first hint of the talent beneath those ankle-flapping flannels. Yohan Blake, another gold medallist this summer, was first spotted running in to bowl by his headmaster at Bogue Hill school, the brilliantly named O\u2019Neil Ankle.</p> <p>Watching the Olympic sprints in Rio it was tempting to conjure up some dreamy parallel world in which the front half of Jamaica\u2019s brutal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/19/rio-2016-olympics-day-14-usain-bolt-relays-team-gb-hockey-women-football-live\" title=\"\">brilliant 4x100 relay team</a> shunned the lure of the green romper suit and instead ended up opening the bowling for West Indies. Cricket and speed: it has always been an intoxicating mix, just as speed remains an obsession in all sport, the measure of a very basic kind of human ultimacy.</p> <p>Not that cricket has lacked for speed in recent times. The world\u2019s fastest bowler, Mitchell Starc, has been quietly traumatising the Sri Lankan top order <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/sri-lanka-australia-third-test-match-report\" title=\"\">even as Australia have stuttered</a>.

On the face of it they scarcely missed a bowler who hasn\u2019t taken a five-for in any cricket for two and a half years, has so far conceded a spendthrift 178 in 30 overs in the series, and who is yet to make any real dent in international cricket.</p> <p>And yet Wood was missed. The buzz around this fun, bold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/england-pakistan-odi-world-record-match-report\" title=\"\">England team has been all about the batting</a>, that endless gorge of swats and swipes and dinks and flaps. But Wood has been equally captivating. Drooling over the speed gun is of course callow and facile, anathema to serious analysis. And yet I think we should still drool over the speed gun for a while. Since his return Wood has regularly nudged up into the mid-90s. At Trent Bridge one delivery \u2013 driven for four by Azhar Ali \u2013 zipped in at 95mph.</p> <p>Ninety-five! In terms of concerted speed this is as fast as any England bowler since people started keeping score. Some say Steve Harmison clocked 96mph back in 2004. The internet suggests Craig White \u2013 who prefaced his toe-crushing right-arm screamers by idling to the wicket like a painfully diffident manservant preparing to knock on the parlour doors and announce with a cough that the bailiffs are at the gate \u2013 once touched 97.</p> <p>But the measurements are more settled now. On the numbers Wood, who saw himself as a batsman until quite late in his age-group cricket, can now stand as the quickest English bowler of his generation.</p> <p>It is a statement that will cause some to splutter and wibble their jowls. But then speed is an oddly personal fascination, jealously cherished, grudgingly ladled out. Cricket-lovers cling to their memories of speed in the way some people cling to moments of their youth: music, clothes, a hairstyle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/england-pakistan-odi-world-record-match-report\">Alex Hales and England rewrite record books in thumping win over Pakistan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ernest Jones, who bowled a ball through WG Grace\u2019s beard, was the \u201cfastest of the fastest\u201d, and shall remain so in perpetuity. Harold Larwood, the fastest English bowler who ever lived, was closely followed by Frank Tyson, also the fastest English bowler who ever lived. Bob Willis\u2019s famous zombie-paceman spell at Headingley, when he simply ran in, eyes rolling, and sank his dripping teeth into a succession of doomed Australians, remains a sacred interlude to those who saw it.</p> <p>This is another part of proper pace bowling. It is one of the few parts of cricket you really do need to see live: ideally to face it, to field to it, to feel the weird, gripping energy of any cricketer at any level extending themselves to their full reach. There is a butterflyish quality to these whippy, chancy types, all brittle grace and straining sinews, cricketers who can wrench a moment their way <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8tFgtzeA2M\" title=\"\">through sheer, intoxicating speed</a>.</p> <p>Against this the presence of the gun has undoubtedly brought a narrowing of focus, a dwindling away into the bare numbers that gives only half the picture. They say Joel Garner bowled no more than low 80s, but the memory lingers of relentless, low pulse-rate menace. Glenn McGrath wasn\u2019t quick, but he still broke Kevin Pietersen\u2019s rib in his final summer and nobody got more nip and jag. The greatest single act of modern fast bowling, Shoaib Akhtar\u2019s successive stump-splaying yorkers to Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar in a riotous Test in Calcutta, was as much about craft and skill as pure hostility.</p> <p>Akhtar is one of five bowlers recorded edging past the 100mph mark. He remains top of the tree on the magic 161.3kmh, just ahead of the Brett Lee-Shaun Tait-Thommo-Starc peleton. It is an absurdly precise top speed, but one the speed nerds can still point to as a kind of absolute. The air up there is pretty cramped. Barring some mechanical breakthrough, there seems to be a limit to how far human beings can push this, although Starc will still fancy his chances of beating that mark come the next Ashes series.</p> <p>Beyond this much has changed over time when it comes to speed and the effects of speed, from back foot no-balls, to protective gear, to basic method. The dawdling, rhythmic approaches, the swooping full-body delivery stride have largely gone. The modern fast bowler is a compact, high intensity athlete. Lee seems to be the model, with his sprinter\u2019s approach, braced front knee, astonishing full-body follow-through. Plus, most remarkable, his extreme high-speed longevity.This is above all a fragile business. Fast bowling tends to eat its young, a wild, unnatural activity that chafes and wrenches at every joint. This is the fear with Wood, England\u2019s own king of the gun, whose speed is generated from a short, bouncy approach and the fearlessness with which he hurls himself into the crease, but who has also suffered terribly with injury.</p> <p>In six years of first-class cricket Wood has bowled 892 overs, not far off Fred Trueman\u2019s average for each of his 20 professional seasons. Even now, nursing that reconditioned hoof, Wood is bowling on the edge, pressing hard for another central contract this September just to keep himself at cash-strapped Durham. Sunday\u2019s final ODI in Cardiff and the T20 game that follows will be crucial; a question, as ever in the search for speed, of never easing off, of keeping the pedal down, the throttle high, every tendon strained from the first gun to the finish line.</p>",

Back then, the losses of the Syrian regime were being steadily turned around through a robust Russian intervention, which had battered opposition groups in the north of the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/15/kurds-carve-out-new-reality-in-northern-syria\">sent the Syrian Kurds into areas they had never before controlled</a>. </p> <p>The Kurds\u2019 manoeuvres had two effects: to close supply lines to the border used by Turkish-backed anti-Assad groups and \u2013 far more importantly \u2013 to needle Ankara where it would hurt most, by helping move Kurds into a 90-mile zone between a Kurdish enclave in north-west Syria and another in the north-east, therefore unifying the two areas.</p> <p>It was precisely the nightmare scenario that Ankara had warned Washington about throughout its use of Kurdish groups as a proxy to fight Isis. The closing of the gap would change the demographic of the entire 500-mile border and, in doing so, create strategic depth for the PKK in south-east Turkey, which is firmly aligned to the Syrian Kurds.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s worst fears were confirmed late in August when Kurdish forces who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/us-backed-syrian-fighters-take-town-of-manbij-from-isis\">ousted Isis from the town of Manbij</a> turned their attention towards Jarabulus, which Isis had occupied for the past two years. Jarabulus lies west of the Euphrates river, which Ankara had long insisted was a demarcation line between the US-backed adventures to the east and its own core interests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"774903186d9d76e99e975da518c6084adcfa331b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/774903186d9d76e99e975da518c6084adcfa331b/0_162_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recep Tayyip Erdog\u011fan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recep Tayyip Erdog\u011fan has suddenly emerged as a decisive player.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Depo Photos/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it steadily picked off Isis-held towns near the Iraqi border, Washington had supported the Turkish stance and claimed it could control its proxies. The pivot towards Jarabulus blindsided the US and has derailed, for the time being, further plans to march towards Isis-held Arab towns. Instead, remnants of the Free Syrian Army, backed by Turkey, are now in the ascendancy. The Arabs rode across the border on Turkish tanks and now have their sights set on the town of al-Bab, the most western area held by Isis. What this means for the holy grail of Raqqa remains unclear. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/syria/giv-31075IAY0frjUMqM3/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/syria/giv-31075IAY0frjUMqM3/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>What is certain is that Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has suddenly emerged as a decisive player in whatever comes next.

Neither man sees a breakdown of the Syrian border as advancing their goals. Moscow has not objected to Turkey\u2019s advances and has even turned its guns away from the Ankara-backed rebels.<br></p> <p>The Kurds, meanwhile, claim they have been abandoned by the US, which continues to see the war as a tailored fight to contain a cornerstone of a global jihad. For all the other stakeholders, a new phase of an interminable struggle for ethnic, sectarian and national identity is being played out.<br></p> <p>It is for now impossible to reconcile competing visions for what will emerge from Syria. And it is just as difficult to see how any of the major players\u2019 key goals can be met. Turkey\u2019s detente with Russia has put both sides ahead in the lineup. On the other hand, a US-Turkish joint push into Syria appears to have been derailed by mutual distrust.</p> <p>There is little from which to take comfort for those who still live in the wastelands of Syria. The country has been carved up into spheres of influence that are doing little to slow its destruction.</p>",
  "<p>To some, a ban on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/11/phil-collins-interview-take-a-look-at-me-now-remastered-albums-rerelease-2016\">Phil Collins</a>\u2019s In The Air Tonight would always be justifiable. This fantasy, however, was once reality. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/16/gulf-war-anniversary-kuwait\">Saddam Hussein sent troops into Kuwait in August 1990</a>, the BBC (according to a 1991 report in the New Statesman) compiled a catalogue of nearly 70 songs deemed unsuitable for airplay. Alongside Collins\u2019s solo debut and other oversensitive choices \u2013 amongst them Queen\u2019s Flash and Abba\u2019s Waterloo \u2013 sat Kate Bush\u2019s Army Dreamers, about a mother mourning her soldier son.</p> <p>Bush\u2019s song now joins a list drawn up by singer-songwriter P\u00e5l Moddi Knutsen AKA <strong>Moddi</strong>. He was inspired to compile it after the Norwegian musician Birgitte Grimstad told him about her song Eli Geva, written in 1982 in response to the story of an Israeli officer who refused to lead his troops into Beirut during the Lebanon war. It had been blacklisted by Norway\u2019s ambassador to Israel. \u201cI started wondering if there were other songs like it,\u201d says Moddi, \u201cthat had this one thing in common: they had been suppressed.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuvF2IgWpgg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LuvF2IgWpgg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The result is his new album Unsongs, whose dozen tracks \u2013 whittled down from more than 400 \u2013 include a delicate chamber folk version of Army Dreamers. Released at a time when, Moddi argues, \u201cmost music you hear is just nonsense and background noise\u201d, it\u2019s a reminder that artists were once regularly moved to use their voices to inspire change.</p> <p>\u201cMusic and politics, it seems, are increasingly considered to be separate domains,\u201d he continues. \u201cOften I\u2019m told that musicians are not supposed to have an opinion, that our job is to entertain, and just that. My impression \u2013 and this is what really scares me \u2013 is that most musicians agree.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/28/pussy-riot-kremlin-european-court-human-rights\">Pussy Riot members take Kremlin to European court of human rights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among those who\u2019ve contested this assumption in recent years are Russia\u2019s Pussy Riot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/06/russian-punks-pussy-riot-putin-protest\">arrested in 2012 for performing their Punk Prayer in Moscow\u2019s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour</a>. Moddi\u2019s reinvention of the tune provides welcome proof of music\u2019s continuing, if underemployed, power to confront authorities: he was refused permission to film its video in a church on his country\u2019s border with Russia. He recalls the parish\u2019s answer to his request. \u201c\u2018After considering the text as a whole, we find that the lyrics are not acceptable within our churches.\u2019 I know this might sound strange, but in a way it made me feel very assured. It was still \u2018bannable\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Whether rebellion is back in the air tonight is debatable, but Moddi remains pragmatic. \u201cIf this album can inspire musicians, myself included, to write music that challenges the status quo,\u201d he concludes, \u201cthen I have at least partly succeeded.\u201d</p> <p><strong><em>Unsongs</em></strong><em><strong> is out on 16 Sep via Propeller Recordings</strong></em></p>",

My three older sisters and I, all Irish citizens, were caught up in a protest in Cairo. I was 17 at the time, and about to start my final year of school. My sisters were released on bail, but I, along with 493 other people, was charged with attending an illegal protest and have been incarcerated ever since, waiting for a mass trial, and possibly facing the death penalty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/31/643-days-torture-cameron-general-sisi-egyptian-radicalisation\">I got 643 days of torture.

They give two reasons. First, they say they can\u2019t control the prisoners unless they show them who is in charge every now and then. They say the police and army were the ones who sacrificed their lives for Egypt so they should rule it. Nobody is allowed to object.</p> <p>The capacity of the prison is 2,000.

  "<p>Here\u2019s a figure that could have you reaching for an EpiPen, assuming you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/epipen-price-increase-mylan\">can afford one: </a>one billion dollars. That\u2019s how much additional revenue the Institute for Policy Studies calculates the federal government might have collected over a four-year period if it weren\u2019t for a pesky loophole that allows US corporations to deduct performance-based compensation from what they have to pay in corporate taxes each year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/executive-excess-2016-wall-street-ceo-bonus-loophole/\">just-released study</a> comes amid the latest example of how basic salary on share price performance leads to bad decisions that have negative effects on society at large: Mylan, the drug company whose decision to hike the price of the lifesaving EpiPen has triggered a sky-high share price and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/27/mylan-ceo-sold-stock-epipen-price-hike-heather-bresch\">massive pay day</a> for its CEO, Heather Bresch.</p> <p>The IPS\u2019s report is the latest in a series devoted to excessive executive compensation and wealth inequality, the research firm takes aim at the loophole as it relates to Wall Street\u2019s banks. The top 20 banks forked over more than $2bn in performance-related bonus payments to each of their top five executives between 2012 and 2015, IPS says.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/epipen-price-increase-mylan\">For my daughter, the EpiPen is a lifeline, not a luxury | Liz Richardson Voyles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between the financial crisis and up until 2012, those banks weren\u2019t allowed to take advantage of the loophole. As part of a widespread attempt to rein in the worst of the compensation practices that contributed to the crisis, Congress imposed a <a href=\"http://www.willkie.com/~/media/Files/Publications/2009/02/Compensation%20Restrictions%20Under%20The%20Latest%20Stimu__/Files/CompensationRestrictionsUndertheLatestStimulusPl__/FileAttachment/Compensation_Restrictions_Under_the_Latest_Stimu__.pdf\">raft of new restrictions and rules governing pay at the banks</a> as long as they still owed money borrowed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp). </p> <p> Once those Tarp funds were repaid, the banks were free to dole out performance-based bonuses once more \u2013 and they rushed to do so. The study notes that the share of vested stock paid out as bonuses to the top five bank employees at the banks it studied rose from about 5% (when they were still under Tarp oversight) to 50% today.</p> <p> The Institute for Policy Studies uses the banks as a case study in arguing for the demolition of the executive pay bonus loophole. Their broad argument couldn\u2019t be more accurate or more timely. We need to revive the debate about all the wrongs committed in the name of delivering value to shareholders, and performance-based compensation is the tip of that particular iceberg. </p> <p> The pursuit of shareholder value has become a cult devoted to delivering maximum profits to shareholders, at all costs. Just look at how Mylan Pharmaceuticals has responded to the virtual evaporation of competitors to its lifesaving EpiPens by raising the price it charges for the auto-injector pens (which treat deadly allergic reactions to bee stings and food allergies) from $50 apiece to $600 for a two-pack over the course of eight years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/27/mylan-ceo-sold-stock-epipen-price-hike-heather-bresch\">Mylan CEO sold $5m worth of stock while EpiPen price drew scrutiny</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Just why on earth did Mylan do this?</p> <p>Well, it could. It has a virtual monopoly on a critical product \u2013 one that millions of people with an allergy rely on. There\u2019s a bonus: the active ingredient, epinephrine, degrades rapidly, so they need to buy new EpiPens every year. </p> <p>Mylan blames the insurance industry \u2013 a convenient scapegoat. Consumers were never supposed to pick up the full price tag: if insurers aren\u2019t paying, that\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act has left the health insurance system in a mess, distorting drug pricing.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting, however, that EpiPen price increases began before the Obama administration\u2019s healthcare law was put in place, and that in Canada\u2019s single-payer insurance market, people suffering from allergies <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/canadians+with+allergies+subject+same+epipen+price+hike+consumers/12159857/story.html\">can pick up an EpiPen two-pack for less than $100</a>. Of course, in Canada, it\u2019s not Mylan that sets the price, but Pfizer, which has licensed the injectable medication from Mylan.</p> <p>Let\u2019s circle back to the pesky question of what it is that motivates CEOs like Bresch, why they make decisions like this and what they conceive their responsibilities to be.</p> <p>Since the summer of 2007, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has climbed 47%, while Mylan\u2019s shares have outperformed dramatically, soaring 178%. And yes, you-betcha, Bresch has benefited from some of that same performance-linked compensation. Not only has it deprived the taxpayer of potential income, but it has rewarded Bresch for doing something that is just as clearly against the public interest just as leveraging the banking system to the hilt was in the run-up to the financial crisis in 2005, 2006 and 2007. </p> <p>Bresch clearly should have been rewarded for savvy marketing that made EpiPen a <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mylan-epipen-monopoly-20160825-story.html\">\u201cmust have\u201d item in schools, airplanes and theme parks</a>. But should Bresch have been rewarded so lavishly simply for being able to hike those prices and profit from the fact that Mylan had no viable rivals? It wasn\u2019t as if the company was being rewarded for years of costly research and development. On the contrary; about half of its revenue was pure profit. And a lot of that went to pay Bresch\u2019s increasingly lavish compensation package, which rose at an even faster clip than did EpiPen\u2019s price. In 2007, Bresch pocketed $2.45m; in 2015, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/mylan-execs-gave-themselves-raises-they-hiked-epipen-prices-n636591\">her compensation totaled nearly $19m</a>. </p> <p>In whose interests are companies like Mylan and the Wall Street banks being run? </p> <p>The basic argument \u2013 based on law that dates to the early 20th century, when Henry Ford\u2019s shareholders sued him for trying to make cars more affordable to customers \u2013 is that a company has a fiduciary duty to maximize profits for its investors. It has been seized on, amplified and raised to the status of holy writ by short-term thinkers among those on Wall Street.</p> <p>The result? Publicly traded businesses, fearful of being pummeled by hedge fund investors, end up increasingly detached from the realities of the real world. They reward CEOs lavishly for delivering outsize profits and big stock price gains, even if that is done by keeping wages and salaries for employees at rock bottom levels. That\u2019s how we end up with firms like Walmart and McDonald\u2019s ostensibly employing people full time, who still rely on various forms of government assistance to keep them above the poverty line.</p> <p> </p> <p>Doing away with tax deductibility for performance-based compensation, as the Institute for Policy Studies suggests, would be a great start. At a stroke, there would be one less incentive for companies to give outsize rewards that are geared exclusively to a measure of performance that may not be in everyone\u2019s interest. As the financial crisis should have taught us, a boom in a company\u2019s profits and a run-up in the company\u2019s stock price as a result, isn\u2019t always an unquestioned good thing. Making performance-based pay more costly to a company might force the board\u2019s compensation committee to think more critically about the criteria that they\u2019re using. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>The real value of the IPS report isn\u2019t in the fine details like how many dollars might have flowed into the US Treasury (much less how many teachers\u2019 jobs might have been funded as a result \u2013 as if government budgets worked that smoothly \u2026). Rather, it has drawn attention to the crucial issue of performance-based compensation and the pesky questions that underpin it. If, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/corporations-dont-have-to-maximize-profits\">as some legal scholars suggest</a>, it\u2019s possible for companies to go beyond the narrow, toxic pursuit of maximizing profits and think about what is good for their employees, consider their customers, take the environment into consideration and pursue innovation, then the debate about how we get from here to there has to start somewhere. Performance-based compensation is a logical point.</p>",

Here, then, is the core interaction by which Hue circumvents the obstacles that lie between him and his missing mother: as he collects differently coloured segments of the ring, he can change the background of the 2D world to make objects of the same colour disappear.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eff68c49d1622076048109f96dda7f48384e82a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff68c49d1622076048109f96dda7f48384e82a0/60_40_1733_1040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hue\u2019s greyscale world.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hue\u2019s greyscale world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Erica Webber/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hue, out of sight is more than out of mind. Your first colour segment is sky blue, your first task to rescue a miner trapped behind some sky-blue rubble. Match the background of the cave, and the rubble is gone. The challenge, of course, is that objects reappear if you change the background again. Solving puzzles in Hue is a case of erasing obstacles one colour at a time so that you can move them around. Need that orange box to be on the other side of the pink one? Just turn the background pink, drag your orange box across the level, and switch back to blue to see the results.<br></p> <p>Of course, this is only possible in a minimal 2D world. But despite its limited colour palette and blocky levels, Hue looks and feels charming. Hue himself is a black stencil, outlined in whatever the current colour of the background. The sea is thick white waves, the caves offer the occasional silhouetted tuft of grass, and rolling boulders are followed by puffs of white-swirled dust. </p> <p>Hue disturbs some objects as he passes: books on shelves, clinking chains, and hanging skeletons who tell him, \u201cYou\u2019re not getting under my skin!\u201d You start in a pretty little town but the action takes place in caves (themed with props since the designers couldn\u2019t fall back on colour-coding the usual forests, lava, and ice), a mountain, and a university. Each room is a puzzle. Die and you start the room again.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4510101fde99500d7bb5fde6d91d004d04d3c35d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4510101fde99500d7bb5fde6d91d004d04d3c35d/8_24_1760_1056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another of Hue\u2019s puzzles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another of Hue\u2019s puzzles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Erica Webber/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Explain the basic principle of Hue and it sounds quite dry, but the designers have managed to draw some interesting ideas from the core interaction. All the usual tropes of a platformer have a new dimension. A row of spikes topped with crates placed one jump apart becomes more challenging when each time you change the background every other crate disappears. Climbing a slope against a constant stream of boulders feels slightly more stressful when you can\u2019t jump over them but must keep switching to make each one invisible just before collision. Platforms that crumble beneath you are much more precarious when you have to bring them into existence before you land.<br></p> <p>The more novel and interesting puzzles, however, are those more reliant on planning. A room that involves alternately erasing an orange and pink platform to allow Hue to rearrange them is topped with a row of boulders held aloft by two barriers: one orange, one pink. Fail to plan your movements in advance and Hue will be crushed. When an orange, red, and sky-blue obstacle are separated by gates, it won\u2019t work if you place crates on the switches that open them in the same colour order. Treat Hue too much like other puzzle platformers and you\u2019ll be reminded when you try to carry out your solution that things work differently here: crates can\u2019t hold down switches or protect you from lasers if they\u2019re invisible.<br></p> <p>Most levels are short and satisfying enough to motivate you through momentum, which is useful because the story is limited. Every now and then Hue will have to walk through winding corridors as his mother narrates vaguely philosophical musings (\u201cExplaining to them the sensation of pain is like me explaining colour to someone that can only see in black and white.\u201d) or bits of her own history, which she colour-codes as you collect the relevant segments of the ring: \u201cSpring was around the corner. Yellow daffodils poked through the dirt in our backyard.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e5409a1e6ba7578012d38b8ab244e15780b5c26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e5409a1e6ba7578012d38b8ab244e15780b5c26/60_16_1773_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cWhat does a person learn when they see colour for the first time?\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cWhat does a person learn when they see colour for the first time?\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the first part of the game, your motivation is to collect all eight colours, each allowing you access to a new area and bringing Hue closer to his mother. Each nets you an appropriately named achievement: Like Clockwork for orange, Back to the Fuchsia for pink. Unfortunately, some are less pleasant than others. I liked that first blue, but the first time I saw yellow it hurt. And for some reason, whether because of my television settings or some genetic deficiency, I found it very difficult to distinguish pink and purple. I actually ended up playing with the colour-blind mode, which marks each colour with a symbol and vastly improved my ability to quickly select the right one. Mapping the colour wheel to the right analog stick was a smart choice, but because bringing up that ring only slows time, rather than freezing it, the main skill Hue tests is your ability to remember each colour\u2019s location and flick the stick in the right direction at speed.<br></p> <p>Unfortunately, quite a few of the later puzzles rely on reaction times alongside forward planning, and since they\u2019re often bigger than those earlier in the game, it\u2019s far more frustrating to have to restart because of a mistimed jump-and-switch or accidental misfire. For the first few hours, however, Hue\u2019s puzzles are concise, inventive, and surprising. For that, at this price, Hue is an experiment worth experiencing.<br></p> <p><strong>PS4, Steam and Xbox One, apparently coming soon on Vita, PEGI 3.

He said the prison officer who guided him \u201cambled along\u201d in front of his vehicle. </p> <p>The jury found Highpoint\u2019s failings included: lack of compassion for prisoners, lack of training of officers, insufficient staff on duty, failure to check logbooks, failure to earlier open a suicide and self-harm procedure and then implement that procedure. <br></p> <p>Smith\u2019s parents, Julie and Tony, said their son should still be alive: \u201cDavid was calling for help, but no one helped him.

With schools back imminently, and this being the Friday after a bank holiday, it was nowhere near as busy as a typical commuter day. Alas, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/southern-rail-owner-reports-99m-pounds-profits-go-ahead\">it was the day that Go-Ahead Group announced their results</a>, so that rather dictated the timing of it.</p> <p>2) The Southern employees I spoke to all seemed to genuinely care about the quality of the service, and the safety of the services they operate. They feel they have been misrepresented by management and the press, and their anger over that was palpable. One of them also said it was the same way that junior doctors were being treated, as if they were the problem, rather than being the people trying to take action to force the people in charge to fix problems.</p> <p>3) Having said that, there were several people I spoke to who really couldn\u2019t care less about how much profit the company was making - they were absolutely exasperated with the staff and the unions.</p> <p>4) It\u2019s a lot harder to talk to people on commuter trains than it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/20/london-night-tube-meet-people-travelled-first-night-sadiq-khan\">on the night tube</a> - where people were up for a party - or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/24/behind-traingate-we-retrace-corbyns-trip-to-see-reality-of-uk-rail-travel-live\">on a long distance mid-morning train</a>, where you can spot people idly sitting there looking wistfully out of the window and pounce on them. On commuter trains the focus was much more headphones on, face buried in smartphone screen. I got some odd looks from people for daring to try to start a conversation. And I have made my boss promise me I won\u2019t get sent onto another train for at least a fortnight.<br></p> <p>5) British people REALLY like talking about trains on social media and in the comments on articles. Although I sort of knew that already.<br></p> <p>I do enjoy going out on these type of live blogs - the rather random nature of who you run into and who you get to interview is great, and obviously, if you want to speak to railway users and railway staff, then on a train is clearly the best way to bump into them.</p> <p>Thanks for all your comments and contributions, both here in the thread, and <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d#contribute\">via GuardianWitness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/01/whats-it-like-being-a-rail-commuter-in-the-uk\">our call-out yesterday</a>.

I could generally drive there in 40-50 mins and had free parking.  The public transport option involved getting to the tram station (either a 25 minute walk or a bus ride,) a good hour on the trams and a 10 minute walk at the end.  The trams are reliable but crowded, and I have to stand until I change trams in the City Centre.  For several weeks I also had to add on a 20 minute walk across the City because the trams weren\u2019t running through services.</p> <p>Despite the fact we have a so-called integrated public transport system in Greater Manchester, you can\u2019t buy a combined tram and bus ticket until after 9.30 a.m. and you can only buy them on the bus with certain companies \u2013 and not mine, so you have to get to the tram stop anyway.  Buying tram and bus tickets costs \u00a310.40 for 2 x 90+ minute journeys (there might be slightly cheaper options but the TfGM website is impenetrable when it comes to combined fares) compared with about \u00a34.80 in petrol for 2 x 45 minutes.  The tram stop does have park and ride, but unless you get there before 8.00 a.m. it\u2019s full because of people who park there to work in the town centre, as it is not effectively monitored.</p> <p>Add to that the facts that I was an essential car user because of travel required in the job itself and I also do shopping, go out after work (e.g. choir) or visit family, then driving - in warmth and comfort, listening to my own music and admiring the buzzards, kestrels and herons you often see on an M60 commute -  becomes a no-brainer.  My brother lives in South Manchester and works in Rochdale.  His public transport journey involves trains and trams and is just as unfathomable as mine.</p> </div>   </div> <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">  By  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/KarenED\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">KarenED</a> </p> <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2016-09-02T11:14:58+01:00\">2 September 2016, 11:14</time> </p> </div> </footer>  </figure>  <p>And finally ... one more about Southern rail ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-text\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPageElement\" data-canonical-url=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002308\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">    <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002308\" itemprop=\"url\">Southern, you&#39;ve finally broken me!</a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"text\"> <p>The last 5 months of Southern Rail chaos has coincided with the 20 weeks of my first pregnancy.

He claims Southern is trying to blame its own failings on the unions and calls for the government to seize back the franchise from Govia.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the past year Southern has established itself as the standard bearer for dysfunctional privatised rail services. Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25%, and public investment to improve Southern services seems a long way off.</p> <p>The primary cause of train cancellations and delays on GTR services are poor planning and management by GTR and the DFT. Southern was already the least reliable service in the country before industrial action began in the spring and GTR\u2019s management revealed their failure to prepare and plan for necessary driver numbers at a select committee session in July. Trying to pin the blame on rail unions is a politically contrived attempt to deflect criticism from the failures of management and the DFT.</p> <p>GTR\u2019s management contract or \u2018concession\u2019 with the government sees the DfT taking all the revenue risk whilst GTR is paid an annual management fee, totalling \u00a38.9bn over the life of the seven-year contract to 2021. Not only does this place all the risk on the taxpayer and the passenger, GTR is not incentivised to improve performance for passengers. But the company is incentivised to cut costs at the expense of staff and to poison industrial relations. </p> <p>Go-Ahead CEO, David Brown, let the cat out of the bag this morning when he said: \u2018A large part of the role of the GTR franchise is to introduce three new train fleets and modernise working practices.\u2019 If revenue risks were with GTR, they would never have allowed services to get to this point and if the DfT had not insisted on \u2018modernising working practices\u2019 which really means attacking trade unions in order to force through an extension of cheaper and controversial driver only operations, then the current dispute would have been settled by now and the company and the rail unions could set about restoring good industrial relations.</p> <p>Instead, GTR have been fined just \u00a32m, a pittance of the company\u2019s annual turnover of \u00a31.9bn and easily covered by the \u00a315m (36%) increase in operating profit from the rail sector announced this morning by Go-Ahead. Passengers seeking recompense for serial delays, service cancellations and failures must enter the \u2018delay-repay\u2019 lottery which is heavily loaded against them.</p> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that another \u00a320m of taxpayers\u2019 money would be spent to try to save the failing franchise. Today, the Go-Ahead group, a co-owner of the Southern franchise, announced a 27% rise in profits on last year.</p> <p>The Government should strip Southern of the franchise, end the Tory sponsored rip-off of the public and run services in the public sector. The last Labour government took this approach when franchises failed on both South Eastern and twice on the East Coast, where Directly Operated Railways went on to deliver record punctuality and passenger satisfaction scores. Passengers, not ideology or political pride, must now be the priority.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9446fe4b09a68e9b64e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:23:24.520Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There\u2019s been a few comments on this story over on our Facebook page.

Jan says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sum of \u00a320m was mentioned on various news programmes yesterday as being the amount given to Southern rail to assist them in some way. I\u2019m very confused by this. I never voted Tory and don\u2019t live in the Southern rail region, but voters were always led to believe that privatisation was the best thing ever, with more choice and competition, etc. Odd, then, that those wonderful private companies, including many banks, financial institutions and now this particular railway provider, make such a total and utter mess of running them. </p> <p>Those at the very top, however, seem to thrive on this series of cock-ups, being awarded ever-expanding salaries and bonuses and then, when they fail, they are often given hand-outs to make our benefits system weep. Yet this government support this, tacitly, by chucking more and more money in the direction of many corporate companies who are poor at best and out and out crooked at worst. </p> <p>To add insult to injury, the same government holds public servants (except for themselves and their public servant cronies, of course) in extremely low regard, denying that there are available monies to support the NHS, ambulance, police, councils and fire services while handing out \u00a320m to a failing, rubbish rail company without a qualm. </p> <p>Indeed, some government bloke appeared on the BBC news yesterday, and had the bare-faced cheek to tell viewers that \u00a320m was \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d. Really? If it truly is a \u2018drop in the ocean\u2019 I am sure there are many more \u2018drops\u2019 it could find to fund public services which would benefit everyone and not just bail out CEOs who can\u2019t do their job.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:34:00.506Z\">at 10.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c94359e4b06b4ac1748b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:21:14.860Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>One contributor, who wishes to remain anonymous, travels on East Midlands trains from Nottingham to Leicester.

David Brown is, apparently, set to turn down his bonus and salary increase; but shouldn\u2019t he, and all the directors, be handing back their salaries after another year of failure?</p> <p>Because Southern is a company which has shown this year that it cannot - or will not - deliver on its franchise commitments. It is failing to deliver for passengers, it is letting down the government, it is selling the British taxpayer short. And morale among staff - the men and women who work hard, who take real pride in their job, and who want to deliver a first class public service but are prevented by the hapless management at Southern - is, not surprisingly, at rock bottom.</p> <p>It\u2019s time for the company to hand back the keys and for this franchise to be run by people who know what they are doing and who will - like East Coast when it was in public hands - return money to the Treasury, not take it out of the industry.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c93712e4b00c28eaea774f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T08:34:54.173Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s an image from Alan Simpson, who commutes between Nunhead and Farringdon on the service run by Govia Thameslink. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4080c1a7e267399d9f0ba2a4a4105f531c93e0ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4080c1a7e267399d9f0ba2a4a4105f531c93e0ff/0_126_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"A Thameslink train.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Thameslink train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Simpson/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nearly every day the train is delayed from between 5 and 20 minutes for a 22-minute journey.

But the last four months have been Fawlty Towers on Rails. Multiple cancelled trains in the morning and evening have been the norm, leaving me phoning family to pick up the children, or penning and editing articles on the train. Filling in the delay relay form for compensation (a pitiful \u00a34 or so per delay for me) is slow and tedious.</p> <p>For some, the stress and inconvenience is more serious. An actor I spoke to recently was furious at having been left stuck in London several times by last-minute cancellations, unable to get home to Sussex and forced to beg a sofa from friends in the capital. \u201cI despise them: Southern rail, Thameslink Govia, it\u2019s a nightmare, they\u2019re useless,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One friend, David Wicksteed, who commutes from Banstead in Surrey to a school in south London, now has to include over 10km of running into his daily journeys, because Southern\u2019s emergency timetable cut off his line entirely. </p> <p>Some long-suffering passengers I spoke to earlier this summer had a very British, resigned approach to the ongoing problems. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any choice. What can I do?

It is what it is. What can you do? They\u2019ve got you over a barrel, you\u2019ve got to get to work,\u201d said Martin Smith, an IT contractor who commutes from Crawley to London Bridge.</p> <p>James Emanuel, a software developer who travels up to London from Newhaven, said he was regularly delayed and had taken to getting earlier trains, but echoed the sentiment. \u201cI\u2019m resigned.

It\u2019s run by Southern rail. He describes a typical day\u2019s commute: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The day begins with checking the Network Rail app as soon as I wake up so that I can see whether any trains have been delayed or cancelled. If everything seems fine I get a bit worried that the app isn\u2019t working properly. I\u2019ll step out to the station and will usually notice that the train I\u2019m aiming for is a few minutes late. This is one thing to point out, they\u2019re never on time. Ever. </p> <p>I usually have the option of a seat at my station, but the train is still crowded most of the time. A few stations along and it\u2019s standing room only. </p> <p>Coming back from work, those of us who travel by train discuss which services we can aim for and we religiously check the Network Rail website again to see if they\u2019re cancelled or delayed. On the way home, if you\u2019re not at the train when the doors open, you\u2019re not going to get a seat. </p> <p>Along the line, if London trains have been delayed or cancelled you will get two or three train loads of people trying to cram themselves on at particular stations. If you\u2019re in a wheelchair or you have a pram, you can forget it. If I\u2019m lucky, the train will be within 10 minutes of its scheduled arrival time. This is my commuting life, every single day of the working week.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not all bad news out there though.

Industrial disputes have made it harder to find drivers and guards willing to do overtime.<br></p> <p><strong>New trains: </strong>New rolling stock has been ordered but drivers have to be retrained to operate them. That means taking them off the usual schedule, adding to staff shortages. <br></p> <p><strong>Industrial action: </strong>Some new trains have been designed to run without a guard, which unions oppose. This has fuelled strike action that only exacerbates existing problems.<br></p> <p><strong>Growth in rail usage:</strong> Passenger numbers have reached record levels and the south-east is where three-quarters of UK journeys take place. This has strained busy commuter routes to bursting point.<br></p> <p><strong>Cost cuts:</strong> The government has sought to transfer the cost of rail travel from taxpayers to passengers but fares are already so high that raising them is difficult.

  "<p>It\u2019s often the first thing someone finds out about you, and can shape any first opinions. But what if you have a name you hate, or one that simply doesn\u2019t suit you? Not everyone is happy with their name, and sometimes even the person who gave them it has their reservations. In fact, according to<a href=\"http://www.mumsnet.com/surveys/parents-baby-name-regret\"> a new Mumsnet survey</a>, 18% of parents regret the name they chose for their child, although only 2% have actually changed it. Here, a group of parents reflect on whether they got it right. <br></p> <h2>Sophie McCorry Day, 31, Kent: \u2018I feel pangs of remorse for calling my son Tennessee \u2013 it\u2019s a hefty name to live up to\u2019<br></h2> <p>Occasionally, as you might expect having named my child Tennessee, I feel pangs of remorse. I worry that, from his perspective, it will prove a hefty and tease-worthy moniker to live up to. And, also for any inverse snobbery from others at having called our child such an indulgent name. Then, there\u2019s the abbreviation (Tena) that is perhaps inevitable based around a certain ladies\u2019 incontinence product. The name was on our shortlist thanks to a belated honeymoon road trip across the US (NB: he wasn\u2019t conceived there, no Brooklyn Beckham here) whereby we were beguiled by the inky tree-blanketed hills. Some interpretations suggest Tennessee means \u201cplace of deep rivers\u201d, and it sounded poetic. We also admire the writing of the namesake author. </p> <h2>Helen Martin, 38, Wales: \u2018I don\u2019t regret calling my son Bear, even though my in-laws weren\u2019t keen\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0857538c478783255ff73eaa350cc11fc9c32ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0857538c478783255ff73eaa350cc11fc9c32ae/0_0_2224_2597/856.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Martin and children\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I have no regrets about the baby names I picked. When I was pregnant we were living up in the US Santa Barbara mountains on an off-grid ranch. We were staying with a native American who told us about his friend Bear and we instantly loved the name. . For a couple of years my grandma would only refer to Bear as \u201cthe baby\u201d. I\u2019ve also had to explain quite often that he isn\u2019t named after Bear Grylls.</p> <h2>Jasmine Daze, from Norwich: \u2018My parents changed my name because I didn\u2019t suit it\u2019</h2> <p>My parents regretted what they called me \u2013 I was named Sophie Jasmine, but at nine months they (unofficially) swapped my first and middle names around. They looked at me and realised I wasn\u2019t a Sophie. According to my dad, even as a baby I was outgoing and wanted attention, and they felt Jasmine (Jaz for short) was much more fitting. It was also a more unique name in the 1990s. I\u2019d originally got my name because my dad wanted to call me Sophia \u2013 a name that my mum didn\u2019t like \u2013 so they compromised on Sophie. My name now goes better with my surname: Jaz Daze has a nice ring to it. As our family surname was also made up, changed by deed poll to my dad\u2019s stage name, my name has a unique history. If I were to have a child I would be willing to call them what they wanted, and whatever fitted them best. </p> <h2>Magda, Midlands: \u2018I called my son Scott \u2013 it seemed like a good idea at the time\u2019</h2> <p>I named my son Scott just before Neighbours had the big romance between Scott (Jason Donovan) and Charlene (Kylie Minogue). After that I was constantly asked if he was named after Jason Donovan\u2019s character, but I have never even watched Neighbours. The worst part of it, though, was that the name became very popular because of the show.</p> <p>I realised the name is always associated with bad characters in films and TV too \u2013 such as gang members. When my son was a boy there was a teacher perception that he\u2019d be someone to watch, just because he was called Scott. He proved them wrong, however, because he was always very good. I named him Scott because I come from a Scottish family living in England, and it seemed to be a good idea at the time. <br></p> <h2>Sarah, 38, Surrey: \u2018I hate shouting his name across a playground and cringe when I introduce him to people\u2019</h2> <p>Consumed by pregnancy hormones, I decided to call my son Rafferty. I had no particular attachment to the name before I was pregnant, but for some reason I tenaciously spent months convincing my husband this was the name for us. I regret it now, people think it\u2019s his surname, no one can spell it, and when I introduce him to people they always ask me to repeat the name. Sometimes they respond, saying: \u201cOh, how unusual.\u201d I hate shouting his name across a playground and inwardly cringe when I introduce him to people. I wish I had given him a classic name such as William or Benjamin. It doesn\u2019t help that since his birth, a few C-list celebrities also have his name. We didn\u2019t discus the choice with anyone before making the decision; I wish we had now. My husband has come round to it and thinks it really suits our son. </p> <h2>Chris Weaver, 66, Germany: \u2018We liked Eilidh but Germans would pronounce it eyelid\u2019</h2> <p>I have no regrets. My wife is Scottish, so we gave our sons traditional local names: Neil and Ian. These names are quite unusual in Germany, where we now live, but neither of our boys has had any problems at school, work or with friends here. Interestingly, we have recently become aware of a local German called Ian, and his family name is almost identical to ours (Weber, which means \u201cWeaver\u201d in English). Before we knew whether we were having a boy or girl, we did consider Scottish girls\u2019 names. Our of our favourites was Eilidh (Scottish pronunciation \u201cAylish\u201d), until we realised that most Germans would automatically pronounce the name \u201ceyelid\u201d. </p> <h2>Tetra, 52, US: \u2018I\u2019ve told my daughter she can change her name, but so far she hasn\u2019t\u2019</h2> <p>I regret the fact that my daughter complains about the spelling of her name. She\u2019s called Madeleine (the French spelling) which is unusual in the US. I\u2019ve reminded her she can choose another name and make it legal, but she\u2019s opted not to. She was originally going to be named either Verity or Celia, which sounded fine with her surname but didn\u2019t look right when written. So, we eventually chose Madeleine \u2013 completely different from the first two names, and it sounds lovely. Picking a baby name is a big deal. My elderly mother still tells of how her sister-in-law \u201cstole\u201d the name she\u2019d intended for my younger sister 50 years ago.</p> <h2>Hannah, 34, Glasgow: \u2018I feel we\u2019ve landed my daughter with a lifetime of correcting people\u2019</h2> <p>While I still love our daughter\u2019s name, I do regret it slightly. As my husband is French, we needed a name that would work in both English and French. We settled on Cl\u00e9o (pronounced Clay-o) which is also a nod to my Egyptian heritage. Unfortunately, we have since found that people constantly mishear it as Claire and when corrected still pronounce it as Cleo. Official documents almost never include the accent on the \u201ce\u201d from the forms I fill in, so her passport and nursery enrollment etc all have the English version of her name on them. It\u2019s not a huge deal, but I can\u2019t help but feel that we\u2019ve landed her with a lifetime of correcting people. I briefly considered changing her name when she was a couple of months old but by then she had already \u201cbecome\u201d her name, and it didn\u2019t seem right to change it. <br></p> <h2>Nicola, 36, Glasgow: \u2018My daughter\u2019s called Astrid, but people mistake it for Asterix\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"695330f4e763bfef9b970418ce3a009494dae556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/695330f4e763bfef9b970418ce3a009494dae556/0_0_1456_2592/562.jpg\" alt=\"Baby asterid\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We called our daughter Astrid, which we still love but we hadn\u2019t taken into account other people not being familiar with it. One of the midwives called her \u201cAsterix\u201d and her name is often misheard as Ashley and Ashton. When my husband phoned his mum after Astrid was born she thought he said Ashtray. We\u2019ve also had to think hard to come up with name-based nicknames, although we\u2019re quite pleased with Astridnaut.

  "<h2>The Glory, Haggerston</h2> <p>In deepest, darkest \u201cFaggerston\u201d lies the jewel of east London\u2019s late-night alt-drag-queer-party-performance-disco world. The Glory is co-owned and run by the Bert and Ernie of drag, Jonny Woo and John Sizzle. Upstairs it\u2019s Cheers meets queers, an East End boozer where everyone knows your name and your Grindr profile, and downstairs there\u2019s banquette seating, arty performance and even some plays. We love performing here, it\u2019s relaxed, it\u2019s intimate, it\u2019s loud, it\u2019s our place to play and experiment. Shows happen through the week, with late-night performances from midnight at the weekend.

So thank goddess for Soho Theatre, which has been bringing weirdos like us to Dean Street since 2000 and now stands as one of the few places to see first-rate comedy and cabaret in the capital. Its three venues sit on top of each other: a studio space above, a theatre in the middle and, down in the basement, a cabaret space \u2013 where we can usually be found. Late shows in the cabaret space start at 9.30pm, with a piano bar running afterwards on most Friday nights.

It\u2019s a proper sticky-carpeted, plastic cups of wine, regulars of 80-plus kind of club. And, with a balance of new east London nights mixed in with its regular activities, it\u2019s thriving. We first attended a night called Britain\u2019s Next Top Tranny, hosted by drag queen Fabulous Russella about 10 years ago. The contrast of what we saw on stage versus what we saw around the venue was magical. The nostalgia, and sensory overload, that a traditional working men\u2019s club with heart and soul makes it, in our opinion, London\u2019s best late-night performance venue. Warren and Charlotte, who run things, always support the newest, weirdest, most wonderful talents and nights. The making of our dress-up party Sink The Pink came from their trust and support when we were just two over-excited kids with a bag of wigs. From the long-standing regular night Coney Island (where dressing up to various classic movies is encouraged, music is themed accordingly and hotdog eating competitions are standard) to The Virgin Xtravaganzah and her variety show of the best of London\u2019s alternative cabaret scene to the popular Disco 54 night, there\u2019s something for everyone.

The show starts at 11pm and you\u2019ll often see red-faced showgirls running across Leicester Square from earlier shows that didn\u2019t run to time (me, every single week). Not only is what is happening on stage pretty glamorous, but the audience is often full of post-show cabaret performers letting their hair down. If you want to watch cabaret\u2019s great and good consuming one too many glasses of prosecco, Saturday night at the Soho Burlesque Club is the place to go. And being in a casino lacking in natural light and time-telling devices, means that everybody stays out far too late. I once stayed out drinking there with burlesque superstar Dirty Martini until the early hours of the morning. I went upstairs to grab my bag so I could head home, sat on the very comfortable sofa in the dressing room and accidentally fell asleep. I was woken by the cleaners at lunchtime the next day. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.hippodromecasino.com/\">hippodromecasino.com</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by burlesque performer <a href=\"http://www.kittybangbang.com/\">Kitty Bang Bang</a></strong></p> <h2>Circus, Covent Garden<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f38f3b8190763204434d2c61c6b3f1f9223b9b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f38f3b8190763204434d2c61c6b3f1f9223b9b4/0_0_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Circus, Covent Garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Circus is really more of a dinner venue and it has fabulous pop-up entertainment until 11.30pm, but then the tables are pushed backto make the restaurant into a club, which is open until about 2am. The main feature is a huge marble table that doubles as a stage: people can sit down at it and enjoy their meal, but between courses the plates are cleared and you can see world-class acrobats spinning above your head from hoops suspended from the vaulted glass ceilings. You could find <a href=\"http://legateauchocolat.com/about/\">Le Gateau Chocolat</a> high kicking along the table or, one time for a Circus birthday party, the management had a ramp built and I rode a tiny motorbike up it. It often gets travelling performers in, so you can see the likes of the Briefs cast up close and personal. The menu has to be the best food I\u2019ve had at a cabaret show and its cocktail menu is to die for! I\u2019d recommend the black angus fillet with this amazing caramel soy sauce and the lobster with white truffle aioli, washed down with a Carousel \u2013 a cocktail served with alcoholic cotton candy.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://circus-london.co.uk/\">circus-london.co.uk</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by Kitty Bang Bang</strong></p> <h2>Hackney Showroom</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e821346db2d0a1f69ca0cee056e139989e6cff7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e821346db2d0a1f69ca0cee056e139989e6cff7/0_44_1218_731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hackney Showroom - Leviathon Show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Leviathon Show at Hackney Showroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ambra Vernuccio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hackney Showroom is a DIY space that hosts cabaret, live art, variety, circus and performances: from Lasana Shabazz, Plains Plough, and the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/discolocouk\">Disco Loco festival</a> to weird bits of drag. What I love about the place is that 10 years ago when I started out on the scene there were a lot of places like that about, when you didn\u2019t have to work so hard to find a space to set up a show. Hackney Showroom is doing this at a time when venue space is scarce and prices are high. It\u2019s a 70s queer utopia, like back when they were first thinking about how to create spaces like this, but Sam and Nina have come along and done it. You can go anytime and find queer and drag shows and emerging artists from Hackney. The crowd is mixed, you get the usual bunch who go to the all the drag and cabaret shows, but they also do \u00a31 tickets for people on the local estate. It doesn\u2019t have regular nights, so you have to check what\u2019s on before you go. But you can always get cheap beer, which I love, hot patties and delicious ice-cream. I like that it\u2019s a bit of a knees up \u2013 you can get your tea, then see a show. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.hackneyshowroom.com/\">hackneyshowroom.com</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by <a href=\"http://www.scottee.co.uk/\">Scottee</a>, asscociate artist at the Roundhouse and performance collective Duckie</strong></p> <h2>Royal Vauxhall Tavern</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a81e6bf106b30704cf408288dcc60acdd4a80a36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a81e6bf106b30704cf408288dcc60acdd4a80a36/0_64_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Royal Vauxhall Tavern\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, queer spaces are disappearing in London, but one place that is still standing and remains the lynchpin of the scene is the Royal Vauxhall Tavern. Every Saturday I go to Duckie. I\u2019ve seen every type of performance you can imagine on that stage. Duckie programmes the most innovative live artists. I\u2019ve watched go-go dancers, opera singers, drag kings, a sexualised re-imagining of the Nativity by Lucy McCormick, and this summer I finally got to perform on it too. I was part of Duckie Homosexualist Summer School and I got to MC our showcase as a terrifying buffoon called the Matron \u2013 dressed head to toe in leather, a huge tumour bottom, a mop for a head and eight-inch high heels \u2013 shouting and swearing at the Duckie audience; an audience of drag kings, queens, students, regulars and people who had <em>no</em> idea what to expect. It was fantastic. I would not usually feel confident enough to try that sort of comedy character at other venues, but at Duckie difference is embraced. It\u2019s all about inclusiveness. I\u2019m now about to launch a comedy night as the Matron at new queer space Her Upstairs<em> </em>in Camden. I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to, or confidence to, if it hadn\u2019t been for Duckie. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.vauxhalltavern.com/\">vauxhalltavern.com</a><br></em><strong>Chosen by <a href=\"http://www.theelflyons.com/\">Elf Lyons</a>, comedian and writer</strong></p> <h2><strong>Paper Dress Vintage, Hackney</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88852a56e8446fd9776a8034cfdb50e583f9b3dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88852a56e8446fd9776a8034cfdb50e583f9b3dd/0_52_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paper Dress Vintage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I first moved to London I was desperate to start a comedy night here.

Government <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/230/221495.pdf\">estimates from the 1990s</a> put the number far lower, from about $12bn to $22bn to account for about five million immigrants. A 2007 <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/87xx/doc8711/12-6-Immigration.pdf\">analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office</a> concluded that the cost of migrants is \u201cmost likely modest\u201d to government at any level, but that it\u2019s hard to make any clear estimate.</p> <p><strong>\u201cOur government has no idea.

  "<p>After Brexit, and with a Trump victory in November still a possibility, liberals are in a panic about populism. They have struggled to comprehend what a figure like Trump is about ideologically \u2013 hence the enormous amount of ink spilt over the question of whether he is or isn\u2019t a fascist \u2013 and the rather hapless attempt to coin the term \u201cTrumpism\u201d (Trump, you see, is really a representative of Trumpism). Alternatively, liberals have focused on actual Brexit and Trump supporters and jumped to conclusions about what they think and, especially, feel. As a result, the content of what, after all, is an \u201c-ism\u201d \u2013 that is to say, a political belief system \u2013 has become conflated with the supposed psychological states of its supporters, namely feelings of resentment and relative deprivation.</p> <p>It is correct that in Europe and the United States (at least in the case of Trump) less educated males are the main constituency of what is commonly referred to as populism; it is true that in surveys many voters register their sense that the country as a whole is declining (an assessment that does not necessarily depend on their personal economic situation; it is simply not true that every supporter of what can plausibly be classified as a populist party is an objective \u201closer in globalisation\u201d). But all this is like saying that we best understand the intellectual content of social democracy if we keep redescribing its voters as workers envious of rich people. The profile of supporters of populism obviously matters, but it is patronising to reduce all they think and say to resentment, and explain the entire phenomenon as an inarticulate political expression of the Trumpenproletariat and its European equivalents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df66a4d29c764e8f64eacba4c0ee3629ad98c8f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df66a4d29c764e8f64eacba4c0ee3629ad98c8f8/0_272_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Austria\u2019s Norbert Hofer reaching out to his supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Austria\u2019s Norbert Hofer reaching out to his supporters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisi Niesner/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of speculating about the motives of voters, we need to pin down what populism really is. And that can only be done by paying attention to what populist leaders themselves are saying. The crucial point is this: it\u2019s not enough to be critical of elites in order to be classified as a populist. Otherwise, anyone finding fault with the status quo in, for instance, the US, UK, Greece and Italy would by definition be a populist \u2013 and, whatever else one thinks about, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate\">Bernie Sanders</a>, Jeremy Corbyn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/25/one-year-on-syriza-radicalism-power-euro-alexis-tsipras\">Syriza</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/beppe-grillo-calls-for-nationalisation-of-italian-banks-and-exit-from-euro\">Beppe Grillo\u2019s</a> insurgent Five Star Movement in Italy, it\u2019s hard to deny that their attacks on the status quo can often be justified. Also, virtually every presidential candidate in the US would be a populist, if criticism of existing elites is all there is to the phenomenon: everyone, after all, claims to run \u201cagainst Washington\u201d.</p> <p>When in opposition, populists for sure criticise elites. But there is also always something else they do that is the tell-tale sign of populism: they claim that they, and only they, represent the people. Think, for instance, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/welcome-to-demokrasi-how-erdogan-got-more-popular-than-ever\">Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a> addressing his critics in the country: \u201cWe are the people. Who are you?\u201d Of course, he knew that they were Turks, too.</p> <p>The claim to exclusive representation is not an empirical one; it is always distinctly moral. Populists\u2019 political competitors and critics are inevitably condemned as part of the immoral, corrupt elite, or so populists say when running for office; once in government, they will not recognise anything such as a legitimate opposition. The populist logic also implies that whoever does not really support populist parties might not be part of the proper people at all: there are American citizens, and then there are what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/civil-rights-anniversary-11-june-1963\">George C Wallace</a>, an arch-populist of the 1960s often viewed as a precursor of Trump, always called \u201creal Americans\u201d (white, God-fearing, hard-working, gun-owning and so on). Thus, populists do not just claim: we are the 99%. According to their own logic, they actually have to say: we are the 100%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"575ee55c1689770033b027bce6c264f07d0eada6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/575ee55c1689770033b027bce6c264f07d0eada6/0_269_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage, centre, claimed the Brexit vote was a victory for \u2018real people\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage, centre, claimed the Brexit vote was a victory for \u2018real people\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Think of Nigel Farage celebrating the Brexit vote by claiming that it had been a \u201cvictory for real people\u201d (making the 48% of the British electorate who had opposed taking the UK out of the European Union somehow less than real \u2013 or, rather, questioning their status as members of the political community). Or consider a deeply revealing remark by Trump that went virtually unnoticed, thanks to the frequency with which the New York billionaire has made scandalous statements. At a campaign rally in May, he announced that \u201cthe only important thing is the unification of the people \u2013 because the other people don\u2019t mean anything\u201d.</p> <p>The conventional wisdom that populists want to bring politics closer to the people or even clamour for direct democracy could not be more mistaken. They do say that they are the only ones who care for the \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d, but they are hardly interested in an open-ended, bottom-up process where citizens debate policy issues. What populists take to be the people\u2019s real will is derived from what they stipulate to be the real people. What\u2019s worse, \u201cthe people\u2019s will\u201d that populists claim they will just faithfully execute \u2013 in that sense denying their own role as leaders and also any real political responsibility \u2013 is a fiction. There is no single political will, let alone a single political opinion, in a modern, complex, pluralist \u2013 in short, enormously messy \u2013 democracy. Populists put words into the mouth of what is after all their own creation: the fiction of the homogeneous, always righteous people. And then they say, like Trump, \u201cI am your voice.\u201d Or think again of Erdo\u011fan claiming this July: \u201cWhat does my people want? The death penalty!\u201d Never mind that he had asked for its reintroduction first.</p> <p>This split between the actual citizenry and \u201cthe real people\u201d explains why populists so frequently question election outcomes when they aren\u2019t the winners (which, after all, seems to falsify their claim to be the only legitimate representative of the people): populists only lose if \u201cthe silent majority\u201d \u2013 shorthand for \u201cthe real people\u201d \u2013 has not had a chance to speak, or worse, has been prevented from expressing itself. Hence the frequent invocation of conspiracy theories by populists: something going on behind the scenes has to account for the fact that corrupt elites are still keeping the people down. Before Trump was assured of the Republican nomination, he kept alluding to fraud, and with a defeat in the November election looming, he is already trying to discredit Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/problem-populism-syriza-podemos-dark-side-europe\">The problem with populism | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, the rightwing populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/austrias-far-right-freedom-party-challenges-presidential-election-reults\">Freedom Party</a> in Austria successfully contested the outcome of the presidential election in May. Its candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/norbert-hofer-austria-presidential-hopeful-rightwing\">Norbert Hofer</a>, had kept confronting his rival, the economics professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/im-very-relieved-10-austrians-on-the-presidential-election\">Alexander van der Bellen</a>, with the claim: \u201cYou have the<em> haute vol\u00e9e</em> [high society] behind you; I have the people with me.\u201d What clearly follows: if the people\u2019s politician doesn\u2019t win, there must be something wrong with the system.</p> <p>Populist politicians are not like other politicians in a democracy. But the difference is not that they are somehow closer to the \u201cmasses\u201d who, according to the self-declared non-establishment thinker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/oct/21/-sp-the-truth-about-evil-john-gray\">John Gray</a>, are everywhere in \u201crevolt\u201d. It is also not that they want direct, as opposed to representative, democracy. Populists are fine with the idea of representation, as long as they get to represent who they consider to be the real people. This is why one cannot score points against figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/dutch-far-right-leader-geert-wilders-goeson-trial-for-inciting-hatred\">Geert Wilders</a> (who has spent his entire adult life in the Dutch parliament) or Trump by pointing out that they themselves are not exactly ordinary people. The crucial difference is that populists deny, or wish away, the pluralism of contemporary societies. When they say equality, they mean sameness, which is to say: conforming to some ideal of Middle America, Little England, or whatever a symbolic representation of real peoplehood comes down to for them.</p> <p>Does all this matter in practice? It\u2019s certainly worrying that populists cast doubt on election outcomes and try to question the legitimacy of all other politicians (to the point of wanting to lock them up, or even suggesting they could be shot, if we believe Trump\u2019s recent musings). But this might also lead one to conclude that populists live in a kind of political fantasy world and hence are bound to fail in practice. Many liberal observers think populists only offer simplistic prescriptions that will quickly be exposed as unworkable, or even that populists, deep down, are afraid of actually winning, because they are clueless about what to do next (an impression confirmed by Farage\u2019s flight after the referendum). Conventional wisdom has it that populist parties are primarily protest parties and that protest cannot govern, since, logically, one cannot protest against oneself: anti-politics cannot generate real policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"313ed87e383705daf7c34b6d2fa854a68f35c27e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/313ed87e383705daf7c34b6d2fa854a68f35c27e/0_182_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Orban at an election rally for the Fidesz party in Budapest, Hungary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Orban at an election rally for the Fidesz party in Budapest, Hungary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The notion that populists in power are bound to fail one way or another is comforting. It\u2019s also an illusion. For one thing, while populist parties necessarily protest against elites, this does not mean that populism in government will become self-contradictory. All failures of populists in government can still be blamed on elites acting behind the scenes, whether at home or abroad.</p> <p>Many populist victors continue to behave like victims; majorities act like mistreated minorities. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/02/hugo-chavez-strongmans-last-stand\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela</a>, for instance, would always point to the dark machinations of the opposition \u2013 that is to say, the officially deposed \u201coligarchy\u201d \u2013 and the US trying to sabotage his \u201c21st-century socialism\u201d. Erdo\u011fan would present himself as a plucky underdog; he\u2019d forever be the street fighter from Istanbul\u2019s tough neighbourhood Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa, bravely confronting the old, Kemalist establishment of the Turkish republic, long after he had begun to concentrate all political, economic and, not least, cultural power in his own hands. One little noted side-effect of the recent failed putsch has been to reinforce this self-presentation as struggling with the people against the visible and invisible forces of evil \u2013 the military and the shadowy G\u00fclen network \u2013 as opposed to the face of a sultan-in-the-making, holed up in his pompous presidential palace, which Erdo\u011fan had been showing in the past few years.</p> <p>More worryingly still: when populists have sufficiently large majorities in parliament, they try to build regimes that might still look like democracies, but are actually designed to perpetuate the power of the populists (as supposedly the only authentic representatives of the people). To start with, populists colonise or \u201coccupy\u201d the state. Think of Hungary and Poland as recent examples. One of the first changes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/hungary-election-viktor-orban-fidesz-party\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his party Fidesz</a> sought after coming to power in Hungary in 2010 was a transformation of the civil service law, so as to enable them to place loyalists in what should have been non-partisan bureaucratic positions. Both Fidesz and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/jarosaw-kaczynski-one-more-thorn-in-europe-eastern-side\">Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s Law and Justice </a>party (PiS) in Poland also immediately moved against the independence of courts. Media authorities were captured; the signal went out that journalists should not report in ways that violate the interests of the nation (which were equated with the interests of the governing party). Whoever criticised any of these measures was vilified as doing the bidding of the old elites, or as being outright traitors (Kaczy\u0144ski spoke of \u201cPoles of the worst sort\u201d who supposedly have \u201ctreason in their genes\u201d).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Austrian arch-populist J\u00f6rg Haider would hand out \u20ac100 bills to 'his people' on the streets of Carinthia</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such a strategy to consolidate or even perpetuate power is not exclusive to populists, of course. What is special about populists is that they can undertake such state colonisation openly: why, populists can ask indignantly, should the people not take possession of their state through their only rightful representatives? Why should those who obstruct the genuine popular will in the name of civil service neutrality not be purged?</p> <p>Populists also engage in the exchange of material and immaterial favours for mass support. Again, such conduct is not exclusive to populists: many parties reward their clientele for turning up at the voting booths, though few would go so far as Austrian arch-populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/29/austria.kateconnolly\">J\u00f6rg Haider</a>, who would literally hand out \u20ac100 bills to \u201chis people\u201d on the streets in Carinthia. What \u2013 once more \u2013 makes populists distinctive is that they can engage in such practices openly and with moral justifications: after all, for them, only some people are really \u201cthe people\u201d and hence deserving of the support by what is rightfully their state. Without this thought it\u2019s hard to understand how Erdo\u011fan could have politically survived all the revelations about his regime\u2019s corruption, which began to emerge in 2013.</p> <p>Some populists have been lucky to have the resources to build up entire classes to support their regimes. Ch\u00e1vez benefited from the oil boom. For regimes in central and eastern Europe, funds from the European Union have been the equivalent of oil to some Arab authoritarian states: governments can strategically employ the subsidies to buy support or at least keep citizens quiet. What\u2019s more, they can form social strata that conform to their image of the ideal people \u2013 and that are deeply loyal to the regime. Erdo\u011fan continues to enjoy the unshakable support of an Anatolian middle class that emerged with the economic boom under his AK party (and that also embodies the image of the ideal, devout Turk, as opposed to westernised, secular elites and minorities such as the Kurds). Hungary\u2019s Fidesz has supported a new group that combines economic success, family values (having children brings many benefits) and religious devotion into a whole that conforms to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s vision of a \u201cChristian-national\u201d culture.</p> <p>There is one further element of populist statecraft that is important to understand. Populists in power tend to be harsh (to say the least) with non-governmental organisations that criticise them. Again, harassing civil society is not a practice exclusive to populists. But for them opposition from within civil society creates a particular symbolic problem: it potentially undermines their claim to exclusive moral representation. Hence it becomes crucial to argue (and supposedly \u201cprove\u201d) that civil society isn\u2019t civil society at all, and that what can seem like popular opposition has nothing to do with the real people.</p> <p>This explains why Putin, Orb\u00e1n and PiS in Poland have gone out of their way to try to discredit NGOs as being controlled by outside powers (and also legally declare them to be \u201cforeign agents\u201d). In a sense, they try to make the unified people in whose name they had been speaking all along a reality on the ground: by silencing or discrediting those who refuse their representative claim (and, sometimes, by giving them every incentive to exit the country and thereby to separate themselves from the pure people; 500,000 Hungarians have left in recent years). Thus, a PiS government or Fidesz government will not only create a PiS state or a Fidesz state \u2013 it will also seek to bring into existence a PiS people and a Fidesz people. In other words, populists create the homogeneous people in whose name they had been speaking all along: populism becomes something like a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"885b1dda9b79305abf093026bdd4f57043257d4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/885b1dda9b79305abf093026bdd4f57043257d4c/0_92_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rally for Donald Trump in Austin, Texas, in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rally for Donald Trump in Austin, Texas, in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a tragic irony in all this: populism in power commits the very political sins of which it accuses elites: excluding citizens and usurping the state. What the establishment supposedly has always done, populists will also end up doing. Only with a clear justification and, perhaps, even a clear conscience. Hence it is a profound illusion to think that populists, as potential leaders of Gray\u2019s \u201crevolt of the masses\u201d, can improve our democracies. Populists are just different elites who try to grab power with the help of a collective fantasy of political purity.</p> <p>So how should we react to the current wave of populism in the west? To begin with, we should stop the inflationary use of the term \u201cpopulism\u201d. There is no reason to put Sanders, Corbyn, Syriza and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/podemos-revolution-radical-academics-changed-european-politics\">Podemos </a>into the same category as Trump, Farage and Erdo\u011fan \u2013 only the latter group claims exclusively to represent the one authentic people, whereas the former are just more or less plausible attempts to reinvent social democracy. Second, one should call populists out for what they are: a danger to democracy and not a useful corrective for too much elite power, as some commentators naively assume. This doesn\u2019t mean that one should avoid engaging them politically: talking with populists is not the same as talking like populists. Otherwise, one ends up in a paradoxical situation: because populists exclude, we exclude them; because they demonise their opponents, we demonise them. Instead, one should concede that some of their complaints may have been justified (Erdo\u011fan and Ch\u00e1vez did not invent the notion that many citizens in their respective countries had been excluded from the political process; rising inequality across the west is not a figment of the populist imagination).</p> <p>Finally, one has to face up to a genuine conflict that characterises our time (but which is hardly about \u201celites versus the people\u201d): on one side there are the advocates for more openness; on the other, the proponents of some kind of closure. Openness can mean more porous borders and the recognition of minorities inside a country (a commitment to openness can also translate into more trade agreements \u2013 but, contrary to what neoliberals insinuate, it doesn\u2019t have to). Demands for closure can come in the form of legitimate concerns about democracy. \u201cTake back control\u201d is not necessarily a populist imperative, whereas \u201cWe have been robbed of our country\u201d is likely to mean: \u201cThe government is un-British or un-American by my definition of Britishness or Americanness\u201d, or \u201cToo many other citizens don\u2019t look like us\u201d. It can also hide outright racism or a desire to preserve traditional hierarchies (on closer inspection Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d turns out to mean: \u201cMake sure white males continue to rule\u201d).</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to think that all liberals have to do is make these conflicts ones about interests, not identity, and win back voters willing to back populists by offering trade agreements more favourable to workers (and, right now, hammer away at the point that Trump\u2019s actual economic policy proposals, especially the enormous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, are a slap in the face of the working class). All this undoubtedly has to be part of an anti-populist strategy. But liberals also have to tread on the dangerous territory of identity politics. They have to argue against the populist fantasies of a \u201cpure people\u201d, and instead fashion attractive and, above all, pluralist conceptions of Britishness and Americanness.</p> <p>\u2022 Jan-Werner M\u00fcller is a professor of politics at Princeton and a fellow at the Institute of Human Sciences in Vienna.

  "<p>I don\u2019t remember a time we didn\u2019t have video games in the house. </p> <p>I grew up in Gregory, Michigan, a small town in the middle of nowhere; a town that literally borders Hell. That\u2019s Hell, Michigan. I wish I was kidding. My dad was a second shift supervisor at a General Motors plant in Detroit. He always wanted to have the latest expensive things; we owned an early home PC and he\u2019d bring home these floppy discs filled with games \u2013 they would trade them around at his office. My mom worked as a secretary and later a substitute teacher and a city postal carrier \u2013 she learned how to program at college. She made sure we all had access to the computer, even though my sister and I were super little and there were six of us fighting to use it.</p> <p>We owned an Atari when I was a toddler and a Nintendo Entertainment System by the time I was six. I had four older brothers \u2013 the eldest a decade older than me \u2013 so I didn\u2019t get to touch the consoles much. But that all changed when we got a Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/07/prototype-nintendo-playstation-obscure-games-consoles-snes-cd\">After the prototype PlayStation: six more obscure games consoles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We were given it for Christmas right before my 11th birthday. By that time, my two oldest brothers had moved out and then the third brother got a summer job. This left me in the position of second player to my youngest brother. The Snes was purchased for him (of all the girls I was friends with in late elementary and early middle school, none of them had a console in the house unless they also had a brother) but this time, by default, it was for me too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59823ccb12aff64919b2395ea0c7cd62850bfbff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59823ccb12aff64919b2395ea0c7cd62850bfbff/0_122_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child playing Donkey Kong Country on the American version of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child playing Donkey Kong Country on the American version of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was at the right age for it. Born in 1981, I fell through the cracks of the big generational distinctions. I am not Gen X, I am not a millennial. I am the Goonies and Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club and The Gremlins and Back to the Future. I grew up with a rotary phone, a VCR, the very first CD player, the first DVD player. My introduction to the internet was in a physical science class in 1994, trying to send an email to a university about some chemistry term. This was the era of Telnet and dial-up. It was the tipping point into the digital age.</p> <p>The Snes sat right in that weird middle ground between the past and the future. It couldn\u2019t easily handle 3D graphics like later consoles, but the pixel art worlds envisaged at the time contained the same sprawling stories and immersive experiences that modern games are built around.</p> <p>We\u2019d never before had so much control over a story as we did in on that console with its grand role-playing adventures. We\u2019d played simple arcade games on the Atari, but they were generally too hard for younger kids; the games on the Nes were nearly impossible for us too. But by the time the Snes came along, we were old enough and confident enough to go all in \u2013 and we could experience them with our friends. The games finally had proper save functions too, allowing us to store progress without having to write down a special code, which was how it worked with the Nes (and it wasn\u2019t easy for a kid who could barely write).</p> <p>So in the summer of 1993, my brother, sister and I saved up every cent of our raspberry-picking money to buy Secret of Mana, the new role-playing game from Squaresoft, creator of the legendary Final Fantasy series. It was, like, $60, which was a fortune for a bunch of kids at the time. I remember opening the package after setting up the Snes on the \u201cbig TV\u201d in the family room, which was usually forbidden by my parents. We studied the game manual together and then we started our epic journey. My brother played as the Mana Sword hero and I played as Purim, a young girl determined to rescue her boyfriend Dyluck from a witch, and Gnome, a powerful earth spirit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79f844c016549293d1dc119f802fdd81df5ce922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f844c016549293d1dc119f802fdd81df5ce922/71_48_664_398/500.jpg\" alt=\"Secret of Mana was one of the great Snes role-playing adventures\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Secret of Mana was one of the great Snes role-playing adventures. It was ported to smartphones in 2014</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We spent every second we could playing that game. We played it until we beat it, and then we started again. It was the first time we had ever been sucked into a world that took us far away from our own. If we\u2019d had access to the early online fan fiction community (where people wrote and shared their own stories based around games, movies and TV shows) or if there had been something like Pottermore for Secret of Mana \u2013 we would have spent the rest of our waking hours interacting there. We had never seen anything like this game; we cared about the characters, they were real people to us, and we needed to bring stability and peace to their sad world.</p> <p>It feels weird to describe this simple, pixelated landscape in the same way someone would describe a hyper realistic endlessly exploratory game environment from today. But in 1993, this place, where I fought monsters in real time with my brother, where we got to save a world while flying on a dragon \u2013 it was like I was really there and my actions mattered. When Dyluck was taken by the witch, when the town of Pandora was struck mute, even when I had to save Santa \u2013 which is REALLY a thing in the game \u2013 everything mattered.</p> <p>What was going on culturally and historically in the years before this? The Berlin wall came down. The first Gulf War had just ended. I grew up with nuclear bomb drills, the red scare, the end of the cold war. My parents lived through the recession in the 1980s \u2026 and then here was the VERY FIRST real digital escapism for children where they were in control of a world that needed saving. Secret of Mana and the games like it were products of the culture we lived in. They were a mirror to the joy and terror we experienced as we grew older. There are parallels to the types of media kids are gravitating toward today \u2013 video games fill a need for us all. </p> <p>With their elaborate stories, multi-gendered characters, astonishing musical scores, and countless hours of gameplay, the Super Nintendo role-playing games certainly reflected a need in me. I was a 12-year-old girl from the Midwest, feeling, but not understanding, the effects of the auto industry collapsing in Detroit, the economic uncertainty of my parents and friends\u2019 parents, the shrinking of the world through satellite TV and globalisation. Yet with Secret of Mana, I had this one place where I was in control.</p> <p>Even now, many years later, I feel all of these things when I turn on that game. I am transported back to the summer of 1993, when I got to know my brother and sister so well. The world feels just as real, even though I am looking at it through adult eyes \u2013 eyes that have witnessed the first school shootings, the homegrown terrorist attacks in Oklahoma City, the bombings and destruction of the World Trade Center, the wars that claimed the lives of kids I grew up with, the illness and death of friends and family.</p> <p>My brother, sister and I still play Secret of Mana together when we are all in one place. It is much harder now that we are parents ourselves, living at opposite ends of the country. Our current playthrough has taken years instead of a few hours \u2013 10 years to be exact. But we will complete it. </p> <p>And that story \u2013 about a child who must save the world with nothing but his sword and his friends \u2013 still speaks to the kid inside of me.</p> <p><em>Rebekah Saltsman is cofounder of indie studio Finji.

  "<p>I spent Saturday morning at the public library with my 2.5-year-old daughter. She sat in the centre of a multi-racial, multi-lingual group of toddlers, spread her arms out as wide as they would go, and screamed: \u201cHe turned into a beautiful butterfly!\u201d at the end of the consummate classic, The Very Hungry Caterpillar. The parents and grandparents giggled at the collective exuberance of little ones. The kids\u2019 insanely spongy brains soaked up the sea of words surrounding them.</p> <p>This may sound like a mundane scene, but it\u2019s a surprising triumph for philanthropic equity \u2013 one of the few that exists at a meaningful, functional scale in our increasingly unequal country. At a time when early childhood has exploded as a lucrative market opportunity, no money is exchanged at the nation\u2019s public libraries.</p> <p>Why? Because in the 1850s, a wealthy guy invited a poor, 13-year-old immigrant boy to spend Saturday afternoons at his private library in Pittsburgh.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only philanthropy worth engaging in is the kind that honours the wisdom of relationships and the power of money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That boy grew up to be steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. <a href=\"https://dp.la/exhibitions/exhibits/show/history-us-public-libraries/carnegie-libraries\">Carnegie remembered</a> that, as a child, \u201cI resolved, if wealth ever came to me, that it should be used to establish free libraries.\u201d True to his word, Carnegie\u2019s funding built about half of the 3,500 public libraries that existed by 1920.</p> <p>Philanthropy has come a long way since the \u201cPatron Saint of Libraries\u201d took a childhood experience and turned it into a national legacy. Too often, it feels like we\u2019ve lost our core wisdom about how change actually happens.</p> <p>As they say, money can\u2019t buy love. It can\u2019t, ultimately, buy equity either. Both start with the seed of relationship.</p> <p>There would be no three-year-old black kid in Oakland screaming hungry caterpillar exuberance without Andrew Carnegie. And there would no Andrew Carnegie without that Pittsburgh bibliophile.</p> <p>So what does this mean for philanthropy? It means that the only philanthropy worth engaging in \u2013 both ethically and strategically speaking \u2013 is the kind that honours the wisdom of relationships <em>and</em> the power of money.</p> <p>In what organiser and human rights activist<strong> </strong>Ella Baker deemed the \u201cfoundation complex\u201d in 1963, those with money usually call the shots. Typically, a foundation positions itself as the expert and judges the merits of a nonprofit to solve a particular problem, whether it\u2019s childhood hunger, or deforestation, or homelessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"069d2a4b34de366b3995c5a4f6fe4076e32be3d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/069d2a4b34de366b3995c5a4f6fe4076e32be3d3/0_3_4287_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl stamping her own book at the old Aberystwyth Carnegie funded public lending library, Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl stamping her own book at the old Aberystwyth Carnegie-funded public library, Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Morris/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been on the phone myself, scrambling to feel worthy of a foundation officer\u2019s attention and money; nothing has inflicted me with a more toxic form of impostor syndrome. The questions foundation representatives ask, like those little bubbles on a standardised test, seem to pop up one after the other. With each one, I feel my breath get shallow. I\u2019m feverishly tap-dancing when what I want to be doing is have good faith, meaningful conversation.</p> <p>With individual donors, the hierarchy is often softened with social graces \u2013 a cup of coffee, a chat about shared passions, the scent of camaraderie \u2013 but ultimately the power dynamic is no different. One of us has the means and therefore is in the position of judging the other\u2019s \u201cgood works\u201d. In some ways, these interactions can be even more demoralising because they are deeply confusing; sometimes it can feel like you are performing friendship.</p> <p>In the midst of particularly demoralising experiences with wealthy philanthropists, I have often reminded myself of my own privilege \u2013 a white woman from an upper-middle-class background with an Ivy League degree. If these interactions make me feel this way, imagine how confusing and alienating they likely are for people even further afield of the social class of most philanthropists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/12/philanthropy-global-poverty-development-finance-sdgs\">Philanthropists can\u2019t eradicate global poverty, but we can make a start</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A note about philanthropists\u2019 demographics: three-fourths of foundations\u2019 full-time staff are white and nearly 90% are over 30. Women flourish at smaller foundations \u2013 about three of four fundraisers are female \u2013 but at those with assets of more than $750m, <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2012/03/22/foundation-portrait-demographics-and-compensation/\">women comprise only 28.9% of CEOs and CGOs </a>(chief growth officers).</p> <p>Board leadership is even more demographically starved. \u201cFully 85% of foundation board members are white, while just 7% are African American and only 4% are Hispanic,\u201d <a href=\"http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/34/democracy-and-the-donor-class/\">said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance</a>. \u201cNearly three-quarters of foundations have no written policy on board diversity, and fewer than 10% of board members are under 40.\u201d</p> <p>This means a lot of people who are not white, male and older are hustling their asses off to understand the sensibility of those who are. They are spending energy being tactical about how they talk about their work and build relationships, however transactional or tokenising. I admire their commitment and acuity, but even if some get good at translating and tap-dancing for dollars, that should not comfort the philanthropic world about its own inclusivity or transparency.</p> <p>It only means that some people are willing to put in the work to get good at the game, not that the game isn\u2019t profoundly rigged or that it doesn\u2019t distract from getting real work done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How do we create paradigm-shifting programmes together, not just send LinkedIn requests and push money and paper around?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And the truth is, I imagine it\u2019s a disconcerting experience for most philanthropists, too. On some level, they must know that they\u2019re not the wisest authorities on the issues they\u2019re seeking to effect. Money doesn\u2019t make you an expert on poverty alleviation; in fact, it can make you dumber with distance. And yet, traditional philanthropy is set up to put you \u2013 the one with financial wealth \u2013 in the position of playing god with something you deeply care about. Even if it strokes your ego to be the decider, it\u2019s got to erode your sense of integrity.</p> <p>How can we reinvent philanthropy with an eye toward true equity? How can we create new cultures and structures that allow resources \u2013 financial, experiential, energetic \u2013 to flow in ways that feel dignifying? How do we create paradigm-shifting shit together, not just send LinkedIn requests and push money and paper around?</p> <p>One obvious thing we can do is work to change the demographics of those giving away money and sitting on boards. But even that isn\u2019t a fix; it\u2019s a good bet to slowly shift culture, but not a promise of radical restructuring. There has been a slight uptick in black executives at foundations, for example, but as soon as they arrive, many are looking for an out, <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/06/09/study-why-has-the-number-of-black-professionals-in-philanthropy-decreased/\">according to the Association of Black Foundation Executives</a>. They overwhelmingly cite as their reason for fleeing that they want to be \u201cmore directly engaged in creating community change.\u201d Duh.</p> <p>If we really want to reinvent philanthropy then we are going to have to look at the underlying historic and structural causes of poverty and work to dismantle them and put new systems in their place. It\u2019s also about culture \u2013 intentionally creating boundary-bashing friendships, learning to ask better, more generous questions, taking up less space.</p> <p>It\u2019s about what we are willing to acknowledge about the origins of our own wealth and privilege. It\u2019s about reclaiming values that privilege often robs us of: first and foremost, humility. But also trust in the ingenuity and goodness of other people, particularly those without financial wealth. And a more accurate sense of proportion \u2013 where and how are philanthropists really most crucial in the fight for a more just society?</p> <p>Several groups are working to show us what this kind of giving might look like. An example: a group of trust fund kids, calling themselves the <a href=\"http://resourcegeneration.org/gilmoregulfsouthalliedfunders/\">Gulf South Allied Funders</a>, took their own inheritances, raised even more money from their own networks and then donated the sum to the Twenty-First Century Foundation, which has a long-standing presence in New Orleans. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, they acknowledged their unfamiliarity with the community, and decided to funnel their resources to someone who could make a bigger difference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb9ea380c5a4df610354d2c1c9d880fc9d18e838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb9ea380c5a4df610354d2c1c9d880fc9d18e838/0_11_3224_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emergency Response Team volunteers clean up debris from a home destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emergency response team volunteers clean up debris from a home destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another: poor families in Boston and Detroit and Fresno track data about their own strengths and goals and then come together on a regular basis to talk about what they\u2019re learning and the kinds of support they need.

They have authentic, trusting relationships at the centre. They acknowledge history and local context. They walk their talk \u2013 moving beyond radical theory to radical practice.</p> <p>To their credit, many of<strong> </strong>the world\u2019s most powerful donors have begun to question the ethical underpinnings and best practicesof status quo philanthropy. In 2013, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/3cab31066f79\">Peter Buffett</a>, chairman of the NoVo Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/opinion/the-charitable-industrial-complex.html?_r=0\">wrote a manifesto</a> that, at its essence, was a call for more structural consciousness and less cognitive dissonance among wealthy altruists: \u201cBecause of who my father is, I\u2019ve been able to occupy some seats I never expected to sit in. Inside any important philanthropy meeting, you witness heads of state meeting with investment managers and corporate leaders. All are searching for answers with their right hand to problems that others in the room have created with their left.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/f7208b89e16c\">Darren Walker</a>, the President of the Ford Foundation, has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/opinion/why-giving-back-isnt-enough.html\">called for</a> a \u201cnew \u2018gospel of wealth\u2019 for the 21st century\u201d \u2013 one that addresses \u201cthe underlying causes that perpetuate human suffering. In other words, philanthropy can no longer grapple simply with what is happening in the world, but also with <em>how</em> and <em>why</em>.\u201d</p> <p>The shift in zeitgeist is promising. A critical mass of people working within philanthropy is hungry to do work with more ethical rigor; more systemic, cultural, and emotional intelligence; less bureaucracy and hubris. There is a growing conversation about these shifts. On paper, the will is there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/30/cincinnati-experiment-peoples-liberty-citizen-philanthropy-improve-city\">The Cincinnati experiment: can 'citizen philanthropy' improve a city?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But philanthropists need more than \u201cbig ideas\u201d about how their profession could and should change.

It requires us to reexamine everything we know and change systems and practices that we have been using for hundreds of years. This is often painful and uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>In part, this is about scale. Philanthropists must push themselves to give more, and in particular, give more to address American poverty. Only 12% of total giving in 2015 went to \u201chuman services,\u201d <a href=\"http://givingusa.org/see-the-numbers-giving-usa-2016-infographic/\">according to Giving USA</a>.

And they\u2019re not as generous as those with less income: \u201cThe wealthiest Americans \u2013 those who earned $200,000 or more \u2013 reduced the share of income they gave to charity by 4.6% from 2006 to 2012.

Philanthropists also need to rethink their most basic giving processes:</p> <p><strong>How and where do you meet potential grantees?</strong></p> <p>If you don\u2019t have genuine relationships with those outside of your racial or class category, you\u2019re going to have a hell of a time finding out about the most interesting, powerful work going on to tackle poverty.</p> <p><strong>How do you approach general operating funds or capital campaigns?</strong></p> <p>Have you ever noticed that foundations feel justified in spending millions on beautifully designed headquarters, but frown on nonprofits using money to spend a fraction of that on dignifying spaces of their own? Poor people, and those that partner with them, deserve fair salaries and beauty, too.</p> <p><strong>How can grant reporting be redesigned so it doesn\u2019t create such huge frustration and a misuse of time and energy on the part of grantee organisations?</strong></p> <p>Human-centered design is so often heralded by foundations these days, but too often their own bureaucracies are filled with soul-deadening detail that is anything but humanising.</p> <p><strong>Do you build relationships for the long, systemic haul?</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Funding also shapes and dictates our work by forcing us to conceptualise our communities as victims</p> <footer> <cite>Adjoa Flor\u00eancia Jones de Almeida,  The Revolution Will Not Be Funded</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gara LaMarche <a href=\"http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/34/democracy-and-the-donor-class/\">takes his peers to task</a> for talking big game about sustainability, but then essentially treating grantees like \u201cthe right wing would treat single mothers on welfare, imposing strict time limits and cutoffs \u2013 the fact is that most sustainability strategies are aimed at helping grantees move from dependency on one foundation to another.\u201d</p> <p>This may all seem \u201cin the weeds\u201d, but it has a huge impact of the daily lives of those tackling poverty on the ground. How we treat one another every day, as cliched as it may sound, becomes the nature of our relationships, and the nature of our relationships, becomes the nature of our institutions and, ultimately, systems.</p> <p>Perhaps the most profound question that philanthropists can ask themselves at this ripe time for reinvention is this: what stories do you want or expect grantees to tell you? What stories do you tell about yourself?</p> <p>Adjoa Flor\u00eancia Jones de Almeida of the Sista II Sista Collective in Brooklyn, NY,  <a href=\"http://www.utne.com/Politics/Revolution-Will-not-be-Funded-Nonprofit-Industrial-Complex.aspx\">wrote in the groundbreaking anthology, The Revolution will not be Funded</a>:</p> <p>In theory, foundation funding provides us with the ability to do the work \u2013 it is supposed to facilitate what we do. But funding also shapes and dictates our work by forcing us to conceptualise our communities as victims. We are forced to talk about our members as being \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d and \u201cat risk\u201d, and to highlight what we are doing to prevent them from getting pregnant or taking drugs \u2013 even when this is not, in essence, how we see them or the priority for our work.</p> <p>Six years later, organiser and activist Mia Birdsong, <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/mia_birdsong_the_story_we_tell_about_poverty_isn_t_true/transcript?language=en#t-639570\">took the TED stage</a> and furthered the paradigm-shifting narrative: \u201cThe quarter-truths and limited plot lines have us convinced that poor people are a problem that needs fixing. What if we recognised that what\u2019s working is the people and what\u2019s broken is our approach?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/19/homegrown-philanthropy-local-giving-global-south\">Homegrown philanthropy: the rise of local giving in the south</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story we\u2019ve told about the poor in America, the story that we continue to ask them to tell in order to get funding, is that they\u2019re broken. In fact, we are.</p> <p>The ultimate irony of the way the philanthropic sector is structured is that it is actually the recipients \u2013 people of colour, the working class, women \u2013 that may be the most masterful at creating and maintaining long-lasting, catalytic relationships. They are disproportionately poor in terms of dollars and cents, but rich with experience of making a way out of no way and persevering in the face of huge, intractable, sometimes downright exploitative systems. This usually involves relying on friends and extended family, nurturing people\u2019s gifts for the betterment of whole communities and having grace through challenge.</p> <p>We have an ethical imperative to acknowledge and build new systems around that intelligence.

  "<p>The acting? Dire. The direction? Awful. The adaptation? Conservative and pedestrian. In conventional terms, everything about this new retelling of the Jesus story \u2013 showing here in Venice in an abbreviated 40-minute cut \u2013 is ropey. It is all too clearly influenced by Mel Gibson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/26/dvdreviews.shopping2\">The Passion of the Christ</a>: the film has the same executive producer, Enzo Sisti and the same religious adviser, Fr William Fulco. But technologically it\u2019s a different story. It\u2019s the first feature film to be presented in complete wraparound 360-degree virtual reality. And it\u2019s a startling, bizarre, often weirdly hilarious experience. With your bulky headset on \u2013 it began to overheat during the crucifixion scene, alarmingly \u2013 you have the urge to giggle. Not necessarily mocking. You just feel skittish.</p> <p>The camera position is fixed and so are you. You can\u2019t walk up to people or back away. There is little or no intercutting within scenes. But you can revolve around completely on the spot and look up at the roof/sky or down and even back through your legs to look at people upside down, should you so wish. I was filled with the weird, paranoid urge to turn my back on the main action and check that reality really was carrying on as normal and that the actors weren\u2019t having a cheeky cigarette.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b67f60e80da2a62d05b23e954aa04ca3af8d2ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b67f60e80da2a62d05b23e954aa04ca3af8d2ee/0_8_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As the wise men presented their gifts to the baby Jesus during the nativity scene, I spin round to be confronted with a large, placidly chewing cow.

And during the sermon of the Good Samaritan I found myself watching two actors pretending to fix a cart at the edge of the crowd.</p> <p>The film works reasonably well in the crucifixion scene, which is conceived on intimate terms with just a small gathering of centurions, believers, etc (though where were Mary and Mary Magdalene?) and there is a reasonably bold Christ\u2019s-eye view shot. Very Mel. Weirdly, there are no close-ups of Jesus, who is kept in respectful medium- and long-shot. But unimportant villagers will get right up in your personal space.</p> <p>What could not be achieved in VR if you had someone who knew what they were doing? Someone who could see the potential and the limitations and work with them? The producers of the VR Jesus say they\u2019re targeting the 2 billion-plus smartphone users worldwide (you attach your handset into the VR headset gear) and also the 2 billion-plus Christians. It\u2019s a smart initial move. But this is a home entertainment market and I have a feeling that virtual reality is going to be driven by the same thing that drove the internet and VHS in the early years.

  "<h2><strong>1) Roger Federer beats Andre Agassi (6-3, 2-6, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3) in 2004</strong></h2> <p>Despite Roger Federer causing one of the biggest shocks in Wimbledon history by proving that Pete Sampras really could be beaten on grass, in 2001 there were still few indications that the Swiss would go on to become the greatest player of all time. Two months later he faced another American legend in the US Open but Federer was no match for Andre Agassi in the fourth round. He lost 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 and it would be another two years before Federer won his first grand slam, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jul/07/wimbledon2003.tennis2\">outclassing Mark Philippoussis</a> in the Wimbledon final.</p> <p>Agassi was too good for Federer in their first three matches. They first came across each other in Basel, Federer\u2019s home city, in October 1998 and Agassi, long established as one of the most fearsome players in the men\u2019s game, dropped only five games on his way to victory against a teenager who was at the start of his professional career. It was similarly one-sided when they first met in New York and though Federer finally won a set in their Miami final in 2002, the trophy belonged to Agassi after a 6-3, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 match.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/05/the-joy-of-six-sporting-pitch-fiascos\">The Joy of Six: sporting pitch fiascos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A quirk of the Agassi-Federer rivalry, which spanned seven years, is that all of their 11 matches were on hard courts. But that was the only constant because that defeat in Miami was the first sign of resistance from the Swiss against one of his heroes, a hint that the balance of power was shifting his way, and confirmation arrived when Federer beat Agassi 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 in the final of the Tennis Masters Cup in 2003, having already defeated him in the round robin.<br></p> <p>A new order was emerging and Federer\u2019s star was rising at unstoppable speed when he played Agassi in the quarters of the US Open in 2004. He was the Australian Open champion and had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jul/05/wimbledon2004.wimbledon5\">successfully defended his Wimbledon title</a>, just about surviving an onslaught from Andy Roddick in the final, while it had been more than a year since Agassi had won a grand slam. Whereas Federer was taking the first few steps on his journey towards sporting immortality, Agassi was easing towards the sunset.<br></p> <p>It did not take long for a boisterous Flushing Meadows crowd to realise that they were witnessing a special occasion. Federer took the first set 6-3 and one spinning backhand drop shot took the breath away. \u201cThis is why you look at this guy and think he could be the greatest player who ever lived,\u201d John McEnroe said on the commentary. \u201cThis is unreal.\u201d<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qJiLDK-EBk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5qJiLDK-EBk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Roger Federer topples Andre Agassi at Flushing Meadows in 2004.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet the veteran still had a few tricks up his sleeve. Agassi, returning serve with trademark ruthlessness, whipped the home crowd into even more of a frenzy by levelling the match in the second set, leaving Federer in no doubt that he would have to play his best tennis to maintain his hopes of winning his first US Open. He was so good in those days that it was headline news when he had to struggle. But Agassi was determined to leave nothing out there.<br></p> <p>An aura of invincibility does not materialise out of thin air. In Federer\u2019s case, there was no doubt about his class, feel and natural ability. But he still had to prove that he could fight, to make sure his opponents could never detect a lack of desire. It is why this win over Agassi was so important. The match was suspended because of rain after Federer snatched the third set and Agassi pushed it into a fifth when they returned the next afternoon. </p> <p>In blustery conditions, however, Federer held his nerve. His groundstrokes remained solid despite the wind and instead it was Agassi who roared in frustration after an errant forehand saw him drop serve to trail 5-3. <br></p> <p>Federer progressed to face Tim Henman in the semis, dispatched the fifth seed in straight sets and then demolished Lleyton Hewitt in the final. Just look at his scoreline: 6-0, 7-6, 6-0. There are worse ways to win your first US Open and there was no looking back. Only the mighty Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro stopped him making it six in a row in 2009. <strong>JS</strong><br></p> <h2>2) Manuel Orantes beats Guillermo Vilas (4-6, 1-6, 6-2, 7-5, 6-4) in 1975</h2> <p>One of tennis\u2019s lesser known one-slam wonders, Manuel Orantes beat Jimmy Connors in straight sets to win the 1975 US Open at Forest Hills. Given his opponent\u2019s standing as the world\u2019s best tennis player, the Spaniard\u2019s victory was remarkable under any circumstances, but the ease with which he swatted Connors aside to win his only grand slam title was truly astonishing given the circumstances in which he\u2019d earned his berth in the final just 18 hours previously.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/31/cici-bellis-shelby-rogers-us-open-tennis-match-report\">CiCi Bellis must forfeit $140,000 US Open prize money despite another win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A clay court specialist playing in the first of three US Opens to be contested on the green clay-like Har-Trusurface, Orantes had met the dashing Argentinian Guillermo Vilas, a fellow baseline prowler, in the semi-final the previous day. Both men took to the court knowing that a place in the final against Connors was up for grabs. Vilas quickly seized control, racing into a two set lead before Orantes got a foothold in the match by winning the third 6-2. The 26-year-old\u2019s resurgence appeared short-lived, however, as he subsequently lost five consecutive games. He managed to pull one back, saving a match point in the process, to leave Vilas serving for a place in the final. At 40-15 with another two match points to his name, Vilas appeared to have vindicated the collective decision of many in the crowd to leave two games previously in a bid to beat the traffic. </p> <p>They would rue their impatience. Orantes saved both, along with another two in one of the most epic sets of tennis ever played, as he won seven consecutive games to level the match. After winning the late-night decider 6-4 to end a four-hour marathon, he returned to his hotel room at around 2am to get some sleep ahead of a final that was scheduled less than 24 hours later. If he was suffering any adverse physical or mental effects from his incredible comeback from the brink, Orantes hid them well. The No3 seed\u2019s victory over Connors, who had enjoyed a far less stressful straight-sets win over Borg in his semi-final, could scarcely have been more straightforward. Despite seeing their brash hero dismantled in a surprisingly one-sided final, few in the partisan crowd begrudged the quiet and crafty Spaniard, renowned among fans and fellow players alike as one of the circuit\u2019s gentlemen, what would be his only grand slam title. <strong>BG</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_pgSPKetrg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f_pgSPKetrg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Manuel Orantes\u2019s astonishing comeback win over Guillermo Vilas</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>3) Justine Henin beats Jennifer Capriati (4-6, 7-5, 7-5) in 2003</strong></h2> <p>Of the players who have given Serena Williams the most trouble down the years, the one who comes to mind more than any other is Justine Henin, the elegant Belgian whose subtle game unsettled the American on so many occasions. In 2007, for instance, Henin beat Williams in three grand slams, on the clay at Roland Garros, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/05/tennis.wimbledon1\">the grass at Wimbledon</a> and the fast hard court at Flushing Meadows. Although Williams led their head-to-head 8-6 when injury forced Henin to retire for a second time in 2011, she lost four of their seven matches at majors.</p> <p>The 35-year-old Williams is still going strong these days, her sights trained on a 23rd grand slam title, while the 34-year-old Henin\u2019s final match was a third-round defeat to Svetlana Kuznetsova at the Australian Open more than five years ago. Yet when it comes to assessing how Williams finally matched Graf\u2019s record of 22 grand slam titles at Wimbledon earlier this year, Henin\u2019s decision to take an early retirement when she was the world No1 in 2008 should not be underestimated. What might have been, after all, if one of the biggest thorns in Williams\u2019s side had not voluntarily removed herself? <br></p> <p>Henin had her reasons, though. She decided that she had given enough to tennis, all 5ft 5in of her, and she had already achieved a lot, winning six grand slam titles. Her first came at the French Open in 2003 and she played one of her finest matches later that year, fighting back from a set down to defeat Jennifer Capriati in their US Open semi-final. Capriati, a former world No1, was enjoying a resurgence but Henin maintained her composure against her more experienced opponent and secured her place in the final against another accomplished Belgian, Kim Clijsters. Having crushed Clijsters in the French Open final, there was no stopping Henin in New York. <strong>JS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0782afe46d2bb3e234098c65e25d88d7cdb50e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0782afe46d2bb3e234098c65e25d88d7cdb50e9/0_249_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justine Henin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justine Henin in action against Jennifer Capriati in their 2003 semi-final, one of the Belgian\u2019s finest performances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhona WISE/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) John McEnroe beats Jimmy Connors (6-4, 5-7, 0-6, 6-3, 7-6) in 1980</h2> <p>\u201cWe gave them glamour, excitement and controversy and they didn\u2019t want it,\u201d Jimmy Connors once said of a professional tennis circuit brat pack that included himself, John McEnroe, Ilie Nastase and Bjorn Borg. \u201cNow, they\u2019re longing for it and they can\u2019t have it. Tennis is big business these days and the conscious entertainment has gone, but back then we all walked a fine line. Did we overstep it sometimes? Sure, but that\u2019s what drew in the crowds.\u201d</p> <p>Loud, often foul-mouthed and prone to the kind of obnoxious on-court behaviour that makes their modern day counterpart Nick Kyrgios resemble something of a choirboy, McEnroe and Connors shared a toxic rivalry steeped in genuine mutual animosity that apparently lingers to this day. Between 1977 and 1991, the pair met across the net on 34 occasions, with McEnroe besting his compatriot 20 times. Few of their matches were as tight and fiercely contested as their 1980 US Open semi-final, which McEnroe won in five sets, emerging victorious in the fifth set tie-breaker, an arrangement with which, uniquely among grand slam tournaments, the Americans persist to this day.</p> <p>McEnroe and Connors were three years into a rivalry that would last more than a decade and incorporate four Flushing Meadows semi-finals but never the final the organisers and native New York crowd would have so enjoyed. This was their 14th career meeting and, going into it, Connors led the young pretender to his American tennis throne in matches won by three. McEnroe, however, was the defending champion. The previous year, he had become at the age of 20 the youngest winner of the US Open since 1948 by beating Vitas Gerulaitis.</p> <p>McEnroe would retain his crown, beating Borg in the final, but first had to overcome Connors in a thrilling semi-final that lasted four hours and 16 minutes, due in no small part to stirring comebacks mounted by both players when their respective geese looked cooked. McEnroe took the first set and went 4-1 up in the second, before an 11-game winning streak by the man from Illinois sent him to the edge of madness. The petulance and indiscipline that had earned McEnroe the sobriquet \u201cSuperbrat\u201d inevitably surfaced and he stormed the court in a deep funk, angrily admonishing both himself and any officials who displeased him in the strongest possible terms.</p> <p>From a position of almost total control and dominance, he soon found himself 3-1 down in the fourth set. Composing himself, McEnroe turned things around to make it all square and take the game to a fifth set in which he accidentally (well, that was his story and he\u2019s sticking to it) flung his racket the length of the court, narrowly missing his opponent. Serving for the match at 5-4, he was undone by a couple of Connors groundstrokes that took the match to a tiebreaker. This McEnroe won easily, 7-3, benefiting in no small part from what Connors would later describe as \u201cthe two worst points\u201d he had ever played in his life. He picked a bad time to play them. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">BG</strong></p> <h2>5) Stefan Edberg beats Jim Courier (6-2, 6-4, 6-0) in the 1991 final</h2> <p>Most sportsfolk split opinion. However good they are at actual sport, they\u2019re still people and we\u2019re still people, so it\u2019s easy to manufacture antipathy: Roger Federer is smug, Cristiano Ronaldo is arrogant, Serena Williams is \u2026 whatever people pretend to themselves that she is. </p> <p>But every now and again emerges someone \u2013 someone such as Stefan Edberg \u2013 who transcends petty prejudice, an artist whose tennis was as gentlemanly as he was. Tall, Adidas and handsome, he had a big but not huge first serve teamed with a playfully high-kicking second; a wondrous, beautiful backhand; and creative, definitive volleys that didn\u2019t so much kill points as euthanise them. If you didn\u2019t like Edberg, you didn\u2019t like liking. </p> <p>Principally, he is remembered for three consecutive Wimbledon finals against Boris Becker, its 1990 iteration <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8o6fudihvQ\">one of the best tennis matches ever played</a>; one of the best anything matches ever played. But he never performed better than in the US Open final of 1991, absolutely fedexing Jim Courier the complete DHL of kickings. </p> <p>At Roland Garros earlier that year, Courier\u2019s baseline bruising had carried him to the first of four interregnum majors, and in New York he rinsed his way to the final without losing a set, taking out Pete Sampras and Jimmy Connors in the process. But Edberg was on a mission. He had never done well at Flushing Meadow, turning up the previous year as the new world No1, only to lose in the first round.</p> <p>So he set about Courier from the off, breaking his serve in the third game \u2013 something that had happened only seven times in the competition until that point, but would happen five more that afternoon. Nor did Courier get anywhere near retaliating. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a reading on where he was going with it,\u201d he said, forced to move out of its way \u201cjust to get it back in play\u201d; whereupon Edberg simply applied the volley. </p> <p>It was a fight between a rapier and a rolling pin, Edberg deploying his full range of tricks to caress his way to a 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 victory. \u201cI\u2019ve been pummelled before,\u201d said Courier. \u201cBut this is the worst beating I\u2019ve taken this year. He was making my shots look like I don\u2019t know what.\u201d </p> <p>Even the new champion, famed for his reserve, was moved to comment on what had come to pass. \u201cIt\u2019s the best match I\u2019ve ever played. It\u2019s pretty hard to believe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost like a dream. I felt I could do anything out there. It\u2019s fantastic you can actually play such a good match in a grand slam final without losing your concentration once.\u201d</p> <p>And he successfully defended his title the following year, beating Peter Sampras in the final \u2013 but, though he was only 26 then, he couldn\u2019t win another major, so he retired in 1996. Naturally, he then became a squash player and was soon one of the best in Sweden, also taking to racketlon. But he remained pretty handy at tennis, too \u2013 as late as 2000, he popped by the All England Club to help the world No4 hit.

Her forehand might just be the greatest tennis shot of all-time and she might just be the greatest tennis player of all-time, which makes her among the greatest sportswomen of all-time and the greatest sportspeople of all-time. Her total of 22 majors is joint-most in the Open era, she owns the only grand slam in the hard court era and the only golden slam ever; she is the only person to win four or more titles at all four majors, to win three or more slams in five calendar years and to make 13 consecutive major finals; she holds the world record for the most consecutive weeks at No1, 186 weeks between 1987 and 1991. Steffi Graf is <em>awe-some. </em> </p> <p>Like most of the best women, she started young, beating Martina Navratilova to win the 1987 French Open, aged only 19. Typically, though, Navratilova retorted with interest at Wimbledon and Flushing Meadow; equally typically, Graf retorted with compound interest, reeling off a calendar-year grand slam which incorporated a Wimbledon dethroning, plus the Olympic title.</p> <p>And that appeared to be that. The players met three times in 1989, all of them finals and two of them major finals, Graf winning all three, and even though Navratilova then took her final slam, at Wimbledon in 1990, it took Zina Garrison to beat Graf \u2013 and Monica Seles \u2013 on her behalf. So, when the two were paired at Flushing Meadow in 1991, Graf was the overwhelming favourite. </p> <p>Except this time, Navratilova had carefully devised a cunning plan: all-out attack. And incredibly, Graf wobbled, struggling with her serve all the way to a first-set tie-breaker, which she lost, 7-2. Nor was she ever comfortable in the second, needing five set-points to win another breaker, 8-6; the volley that clinched it was her only such success of the match. </p> <p>Navratilova then broke in the first game of the final set, consolidated, and broke again for 3-0. Graf hit back, but Navratilova made it 4-1 before a pair of double-faults gave Graf 4-2 and she held for 4-3; the onslaught had arrived. Navratilova, though, hung on for 5-3 in a colossal struggle, but when Graf reduced the arrears to 5-4, she was forced to serve for it.</p> <p>This was a problem: for all her magnificence and omnipotence, Navratilova was not fond of pressure, and sure enough, she was soon break-point down. But, somehow, she collected herself, collected herself again, and sent down an ace. Then, when Graf forced another opportunity, she did likewise: paused, took her time, made sure to hit through the ball, and found not one but three enormous serves. She was in the final! </p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect her to play such a game,\u201d said Graf; \u201cA 34-year-old woman showed more guts than she did,\u201d said Graf\u2019s coach. </p> <p>Navratilova, meanwhile, was more reflective. \u201cI feel that I\u2019ve really made some progress emotionally and mentally on the court,\u201d she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t lay down and die the way I used to. Sometimes when I lose an opportunity like that, I would just be so disappointed I\u2019d let the whole match get away. This time I just hung in and said: \u2018OK, start over.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Or put another way, Steffi Graf was still awesome, but that afternoon, Martina Navratilova was awesomer. <strong>DH</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX8plX8NJnE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sX8plX8NJnE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A titanic semi-final in 1991.</figcaption> </figure>",

I like it when virtual reality feels punk and DIY. Claire\u2019s piece Shining360 definitely has that feeling, it blew me away. She has a really fresh point of view on VR, which almost affects your brain like science fiction; what is real and what isn\u2019t becomes so blurry. It\u2019s similar to Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s science fiction, which wasn\u2019t about special effects or crazy space costumes, but about one reality that existed inside another reality inside another reality. What\u2019s the dream and what\u2019s not the dream? A hundred years ago in cinemas people watched a train and ran out because they thought the train was gonna hit them. And people are having these experiences now with VR. It\u2019s exciting to be part of VR and the people defining it.\u201d</p> <h2>Musician: Klein</h2> <p><strong>Obscurant Tumblr pop from London </strong></p> <p>A favourite of Mica Levi and Bj\u00f6rk collaborator Arca, who Bj\u00f6rk also reps for her \u201cidiosyncratic, stubborn style\u201d, and who <a href=\"https://klein1997.bandcamp.com/\">sounds like Levi\u2019s band, Micachu and The Shapes, deconstructing Kiss FM classics</a>.</p> <h2><strong>TV presenter: RuPaul</strong></h2> <p><strong>King of the queens on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race</strong> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"949e5468b4492c2501050ceff1c705f0902ac212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/949e5468b4492c2501050ceff1c705f0902ac212/0_336_4979_2986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RuPaul, first used in G2 4 June 2015 press image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy assistant James Merry, who\u2019s become my collaborator now, introduced me to it back in 2009 when we were in Costa Rica.

I thought it was brave, it\u2019s trying to map out a spiritual place. And it belongs in this medium, it\u2019s not just murdering, killing and hell. I feel strongly about that. I\u2019m up for murdering, killing and hell films and games and TV series being 50% of stuff, but now it seems about 95%, and I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019m not a purist that just wants rainbows everywhere; I like dark stuff, and I believe that we have a lot of dark energy in us that we should deal with, I\u2019m not a Pollyanna, but 50% is enough. The other 50% should be about constructive things, and the light. Another game Jenova and Robin did, Flower, you\u2019re just floating above fields of flowers forever, and if you manage to touch enough flowers you create this synergy between them and you get a halo, almost like this enlightenment. It sounds hippy but it\u2019s beautiful and profound.

The hashtag came to define the unrest that erupted when on 24 November a grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who shot him.</p> <p>In the next three weeks, #BlackLivesMatter appeared on Twitter nearly 2m times as protests, some of them violent, broke out in Ferguson and other cities across the US. Between Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal and March 2016, it was used almost 12m times on Twitter, making it the third-biggest \u201csocial issues\u201d hashtag in 10 years of the platform.</p> <p>And then <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/08/15/major-recent-events-bring-blacklivesmatter-back-to-the-forefront-as-the-tone-shifts-overnight/\">in July this year</a>, when the deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota preceded gunmen killing police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, use of the hashtag reached record heights.

  "<h2>1) Mart\u00ednez and Henry with much to prove in Belgium </h2> <p>What Belgium need most right now is a bit of rigour but they have hired a dreamer. Little about the career of Roberto Mart\u00ednez suggests he is the man to instil the defensive cunning and balanced plan that a gifted Belgian squad has lacked in recent years. It seems a perverse appointment or at least a hugely optimistic one, because to succeed Mart\u00ednez will have to temper his idealism and Thierry Henry will have to emerge as a masterful coach. There was no evidence of that or, indeed, of any other useful impact in the duo\u2019s first match in charge: Spain were brilliant in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/01/belgium-beaten-2-0-by-spain-in-roberto-martinezs-first-match-in-charge\">Thursday\u2019s 2-0 friendly victory in Brussels</a>, where Belgium just looked confused.

The manager, Danny Blind, who took charge only halfway through that campaign, has had to contend with unprecedented upheaval over the summer, as both his assistants have stepped down \u2013 Dick Advocaat joining Fenerbahce and Marco van Basten taking up a job with Fifa \u2013 and this week the director of the Dutch football federation, Bert van Oostveen, also resigned in advance of Thursday\u2019s friendly with Greece, which, to cap everything off, ended in a 2-1 home defeat. Some absences were of the manager\u2019s choosing, as Memphis Depay and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar were among the big names omitted from the squad in the last campaign. Daryl Janmaat has been given a reprieve due to an injury to Ajax\u2019s talented young right-back Kenny Tete. Holland do not have much time to demonstrate radical improvement, as next week they play their first qualifier, in Sweden, and next month they host Belarus and France. There is a high risk of them being shunted off the road to Russia before they find any kind of stride. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">PD</strong></p> <h2><strong>3) Will Sterling\u2019s good form continue?</strong></h2> <p>Raheem Sterling was one of the main targets of abuse after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/england-iceland-euro-2016-match-report\">England\u2019s defeat to Iceland</a> at Euro 2016. Criticised in the media and heckled by supporters, it would have been easy for him to retreat into his shell, especially after a difficult first year at Manchester City. Instead, however, he has demonstrated his resilience by making an excellent start to the new season for City, scoring two accomplished goals and performing superbly in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/28/manchester-city-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\">last Sunday\u2019s 3-1 victory</a> over West Ham United. A fresh start under Pep Guardiola has helped. For all the negativity, Sterling proved that he is an intelligent player when Liverpool almost won the league in 2014. Coached properly, he is a major talent. Sam Allardyce would be wrong to see him as a winger who will run in straight lines up and down the flank. His movement is clever and varied, he is spatially aware and his passing is underrated. England would be wise to capitalise on those qualities against Slovakia on Sunday. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/01/raheem-sterling-england-players-euro-2016-exit\">Raheem Sterling and England\u2019s players reflect us all, so why so much hate? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>4) The return of Verratti</strong></h2> <p>As enjoyable as Italy\u2019s classic counter-punching style was in France, perhaps what held them back in the quarter-final against Germany, other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/04/simone-zaza-bizarre-penalty-italy-euro-2016-germany\">a couple of comical penalties</a> in the shootout, was the absence of a player who could control the game. With Andrea Pirlo no longer around to pull the strings, they lacked a midfielder who could lift the pressure on the defence by keeping the ball. Yet that might change now that Marco Verratti is fit again and back in the squad after missing Euro 2016 because of injury. Verratti is widely seen as Pirlo\u2019s successor and Italy\u2019s new manager, Giampiero Ventura, is a big fan. He defended the 23-year-old, who is yet to look comfortable under Unai Emery at Paris Saint-Germain, pointing out that he is not being played in his best position. \u201cIn Paris, Verratti is playing just behind the strikers, but it\u2019s not the right position for him,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cHe is a playmaker. Verratti is not happy in PSG because he is playing in the wrong position.

The results were immediately apparent, with Northern Ireland winning 2-0 in a display that showcased all the vim and vigour that had been absent from their first major tournament match in three decades. It could be argued that nerves played a role in Northern Ireland\u2019s opening defeat, while we can only speculate how much of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/16/ukraine-northern-ireland-euro-2016-match-report\">follow-up victory was down to the puzzling ineptitude of Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>Northern Ireland acquitted themselves well in France and O\u2019Neill will be forced back to his tactics board before their World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic following the news that the defender Craig Cathcart, an ever-present during Euro 2016, will miss the trip to Prague through injury. Whether O\u2019Neill slots Paddy McNair, Ryan McGivern or the uncapped Tom Flanagan in to his preferred three centre-back system or reverts to a flat back four remains to be seen, but one suspects it is a detail this thoughtful man will have agonised over during his team\u2019s Austrian training camp this week. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">BG</strong></p> <h2><strong>7) Time for Strachan to justify his big talk</strong></h2> <p>Alone among the home nations in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/09/scotland-euro-2016-gordon-strachan\">missing out on the Euro 2016 party</a> after finishing fourth in their qualifying group behind Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland, Scotland get back on the competitive trail against Malta on Sunday. During Euro 2016, Gordon Strachan stated, not altogether convincingly, his belief that his side were as good, if not better than many of the teams competing in France. In a World Cup qualifying group boasting Slovakia and England, two of the less convincing sides at Euro 2016, he will get the chance to prove it.</p> <p>\u201cThe mentality is fantastic,\u201d said Strachan of his Scotland side back in June, before stating the need \u201cto find the best system with the best players we\u2019ve got for this next campaign\u201d. Prior to a potentially tricky visit to the Ta\u2019Qali National Stadium, Strachan has already suffered more of the bad luck he feels dogged his team\u2019s attempts to qualify for the Euros \u2013 the number of decent players he\u2019s got has dwindled alarmingly.</p> <p>The Celtic duo Kieran Tierney and Leigh Griffiths will miss the game against Malta through injury, along with the Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur and his Fulham counterpart Kevin McDonald. As cover, Strachan has drafted in the Rangers captain Lee Wallace and the striker Tony Watt.</p> <p>Compared to those halcyon days of yore when qualifying for the World Cup was the norm rather than the exception for Scotland, it is a measure of their lack of strength in depth that the former made the most recent of his eight international appearances three years ago, while the latter is currently on loan at Hearts from Charlton Athletic, for whom he scored five Championship goals last season. Despite his lack of resources, Strachan has forged a team that are difficult to beat and rarely come unstuck against minnows. Avoiding slip-ups against Malta and then Lithuania before visits to Slovakia and England will be essential if Strachan\u2019s team are to justify their manager\u2019s big talk back in June. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">BG</strong></p> <h2>8) Croatia host Turkey in empty stadium</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d3eaab241d7c3d84d759723cc84b3139a1b2680\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3eaab241d7c3d84d759723cc84b3139a1b2680/0_23_1688_1013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luka Modric scored the winning goal for Croatia when they met Turkey at the European Championship and has now been named the new Croatia captain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luka Modric scored the winning goal for Croatia when they met Turkey at the European Championship and has now been named the new Croatia captain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A stunning volley from Luka Modric settled the Euro 2016 group game between these nations at a tournament in which neither covered themselves in glory.

This translated into the delivery of 63 million ad impressions that would have otherwise not been seen. \u201cWe started seeing users whitelist us immediately and, as we measured their site visits, we saw that the people participating in our ad light experience were consuming 40%\u2013plus more page views and spending over 100% more time on the site,\u201d says Howard. <br></p> <p>Other publishers are acting to reduce their reliance on online advertising. For Car Throttle, billed as the \u201cLad Bible for petrol heads\u201d \u2013 which reaches 100 million car enthusiasts each month \u2013 the challenge is acute. <a href=\"http://www.iabuk.net/about/press/archive/new-iab-uk-research-reveals-latest-ad-blocking-levels\" rel=\"nofollow\">Figures from the IAB</a> in November 2015 show that ad blocking is more prevalent among men (23%) than women (13%) and the propensity to block ads decreases with age \u2013 from 35% of 18- to 24-year-olds to 13% of people age 55 and over. \u201cNinety percent of our audience are millennial males so we\u2019ve always known that our users are likely to be heavy users of ad blocking software (around 50% of all desktop users have ad blockers turned on),\u201d says Adnan Ebrahim, chief executive of Car Throttle. \u201cOur commercial strategy was formed with this very much in mind.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/06/algorithms-more-puppies-than-monsters-please-you-natural-language-processing\">Algorithms are more like puppies than monsters, they want to please you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Car Throttle\u2019s approach has been to embrace branded content campaigns, which now make up 80% of the site\u2019s ad revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s an effective way of being able to offer advertisers access to users without being dependent on \u2018ad-blockable\u2019 advertising.\u201d It has run recent content campaigns with Nissan and Ford, creating and distributing content to its millennial car enthusiasts. \u201cIn the case of Nissan, the video we helped to distribute reached over 15 million people with 5.5m views, because the advertiser message becomes part of the content.\u201d<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The International Business Times (IBT)</a> is trialling \u201cpolite but firm\u201d messaging such as \u201cBy having ads on our site, this ensures we can offer our content to you for free. Please turn off your ad blocker or whitelist us. Thanks in advance, the IBT team\u201d to ad blocking users. But the organisation is also looking to spread its risk by exploring other revenue streams. IBT editor-in-chief John Crowley says the publisher is \u201cdevoting increasing focus to platforms like Facebook Live, where we see new revenue opportunities unaffected by ad blocking\u201d. Facebook revealed in August that it was trialling an option for publishers to insert a short ad break in their Facebook Live videos.</p> <p>Yet those publishers who take arguably the crudest solution to the problem and simply ban some readers from accessing content are also seeing results. In October 2015, 20% of daily financial site City A.M.\u2019s desktop Firefox users were using ad blocking software. The finding prompted City A.M. to implement a ban against such readers \u2013 the first UK newspaper to do so \u2013 greeting them with blurred content overlaid with a message explaining that it relies on advertising to fund its journalism. It has proved a successful move. \u201cStaggeringly, 65% of desktop users turn off their ad blockers when confronted with our polite message,\u201d says Emma Haslett, digital editor at City A.M. \u201cObjections have been fairly minimal.\u201d</p> <p>What works in the fight against ad blocking will depend on each publisher and its audience, but finding fitting ways to educate readers about the necessary value exchange is clearly a top priority.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

  "<h2>After seven years I was running out of energy</h2> <p>Dan Cook\u2019s foray into owning a small business wasn\u2019t something he expected to happen as soon as it did. \u201cMy plan was always to be a graphic designer, then a teacher, then buy a cafe [\u2026] It was supposed to happen in 30 years, but it happened in about 12.\u201d<br></p> <p>After teaching IT, business, film and media at a secondary school for seven years, Cook bought <a href=\"http://www.joescafebrighton.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joe\u2019s Cafe</a> in Brighton in 2013. At the time, it was a builder\u2019s cafe that dated back to 1987, which Cook says didn\u2019t suit the area anymore. Cook and his wife Jane completely revamped the building and their breakfast eatery was born. It went on to win the best cafe gong at the Brighton and Hove Food Awards in 2015. <br></p> <p>Cook enjoyed teaching but things changed after the 2008 recession. \u201cIt meant my class sizes got larger, the support became less, the funding [dried up and] you could see it was becoming harder for schools to function. At the school I was at there were a lot of redundancies and debt. It became quite a negative place to work. </p> <p>\u201c[Teaching] used to be a job for life, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you could do for 30 years now. After seven years I was running out of energy [\u2026] I miss the students and the staff, but I don\u2019t miss the changing curriculums and paperwork. It\u2019s quite nice to be able to please myself a bit more now.\u201d</p> <p>He says running a business has been a steep learning curve \u2013 particularly controlling stock and dealing with suppliers. But he has put his teaching skills to good use, managing the cafe\u2019s young staff (some of whom are Cook\u2019s ex-students), and two apprentices. </p> <p>\u201cIn many ways, [running a business] is more relentless than teaching, but not quite as stressful,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhen you\u2019re teaching, you\u2019re trying to get kids into college or university, whereas here we\u2019re just doing breakfast.

She says she loved teaching and that it fit neatly around her children\u2019s lives when they were small. But over time she realised she wanted more flexibility and her long-term ambitions lay elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to do something in food, but I didn\u2019t really know what it was going to be. Then I did a bread course, and it was a light-bulb moment.\u201d</p> <p>The London-based entrepreneur focused on bread full-time in September 2014. She now makes 50 loaves on each \u201cbake day\u201d, delivers them herself and runs up to four bread-making classes a week at home. She won two Great Taste Awards in 2016 and recently received funding from the Plunkett Foundation for a new oven and mixer. </p> <p>As for her previous career, there are things she misses, but she has kept connected to her school. \u201cI miss the kids but the teachers I used to work with still buy my bread so I\u2019m in school every week delivering. I get all those lovely bits of school but without the hard work and paperwork. I\u2019ve got the best of both worlds now, I think.\u201d </p> <p>Wilson\u2019s teaching skills have been vital. \u201cTeaching has taught me patience, how to deal with people and how to get the best out of people.

  "<p>Reading the opening pages of <em>The Lesser Bohemians</em>, I wondered if I might still be in the world of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/20/girl-half-formed-thing-review\" title=\"\"><em>A Girl is a Half-formed Thing</em></a>. Here was a diffident 18-year-old Irish girl talking, writing or thinking in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/eimear-mcbride\" title=\"\">Eimear McBride</a>\u2019s characteristic broken sentences, gliding between the demotic and the lyrical. \u201cDaub my soul with a&#xa0;good few pints til my mouth swings wide with unutterable shite. Laughing lots too, like it\u2019s true. Worldening maybe, I think. I hope.\u201d I felt anxious that the voice that had seemed to be created for the heroine of <em>A Girl</em> had suddenly become the voice of an apparently different character, and that we were expected to accept this and read these sentences as though for the first time.</p> <p>In fact, McBride\u2019s style is more capacious than it might seem. The voice here is different, though it takes a couple of chapters to feel your way into its cadences. The girl whose head we are in now is more eagerly poetic, more gently amused, more responsive to the sights around her. This is Eily, a young drama student new to the London of the 1990s and determined to lose her virginity as quickly and decorously as possible.</p> <p>Eily meets Stephen, a 38-year-old actor, wiry, handsome, damaged. He is promiscuous on principle, dedicated to&#xa0;sensual pleasure but determined to control the feelings it unleashes. The two embark on a course of friendly but casual sex that turns, without either of&#xa0;them quite understanding what is&#xa0;happening, into a love affair that frightens them both in its intensity. Most of the book chronicles in microscopic detail their encounters in bed and out of it, offering a lens on to the touch and talk of lovers unlike any I&#xa0;have come across before.</p> <p>What is most remarkable, and it\u2019s not something we could see in the more consistently destructive world of <em>A Girl</em>, is McBride\u2019s sensitivity to moment-to-moment shifts in feeling. She allows any conversation or sexual encounter to be a journey where the characters cannot know where they are going or who they will be when they get there.</p> <p>It is notoriously difficult to write about sex, and McBride does it better than almost any other contemporary novelist I\u2019ve read. Because of the way the voice works, we don\u2019t see Eily\u2019s body but we feel it from within. We know exactly what the lovers are doing but there\u2019s nothing here that could be entered for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/badsexaward\" title=\"\">Bad Sex award</a>. McBride manages to get across the essential strangeness of sex itself: the disjunction between the triviality and repetition of the physical acts and the intense, high emotion with which we can experience them; the way that within a single encounter we can go from being just bodies, doing odd things to each other, to minds, urgently expressing love, without it being easy to define what has shifted.</p> <p>McBride evokes brilliantly the distinctive pleasure of days spent in bed, moving imperceptibly between humour and passion, and between violent and tender desire. \u201cBodies knowing the other\u2019s well from before but everything else running through now, making it rare \u2026 and the desire that follows, no matter what we do, cannot be spent up and does not let go.\u201d And she shows that it is these days in particular that are in danger of collapsing into alienated despair, because lovers are not quite in&#xa0;control of the vulnerability they have unleashed. \u201cWe are in&#xa0;such fragile&#xa0;skin, so close to&#xa0;getting lost in&#xa0;the in-between.\u201d</p> <p>In the light of all this, McBride\u2019s absence from the Booker longlist is surprising, but I can see how the judges might have thought this a more flawed book than the densely perfect <em>A Girl</em>. In&#xa0;the second half, the novel opens up so that we can see the world beyond Eily\u2019s head. This is done through pages of reported speech: we hear Stephen\u2019s story through a long reported monologue, and then hear him recounting a&#xa0;monologue from his ex-wife. In an account that has gained its force from our&#xa0;being deep inside the head of the central character, it feels difficult to move on to accepting the narrative convention that we talk in paragraphs and can recall the paragraphs of those around us. There is also the question of &#xa0;balance: the novel becomes a&#xa0;little baggy at this point, and we are taken quite abruptly into a less easily realistic, more dangerous and destructive world. In these closing sections, the plot starts to feel more determined. There is no longer the sense I admired in the&#xa0;first half that what happens to the characters has the same randomness as the sex described; the sense that you have no idea where they will end up.</p> <p>But if it is less perfect than <em>A Girl</em>, then it is a book to live with in a different way. I found that I thought about it more urgently, and that for days afterwards it was still shaping my sense of the world. This is especially remarkable given the experimental form. McBride has been compared to&#xa0;Joyce, and her debt to him is sometimes explicit, but this seems to be creative innovation with a different end from his. At her best, McBride is fulfilling Woolf\u2019s injunction to \u201crecord the atoms as they&#xa0;fall upon the mind in&#xa0;the order in&#xa0;which they fall\u201d.</p> <p>Both McBride and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alismith\" title=\"\">Ali Smith</a> have achieved the apparently unlikely feat of winning the avant-garde Goldsmiths prize and the more populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/baileys-womens-prize-for-fiction-2016\" title=\"\">Baileys prize</a> for the same book. They have managed to do this because, in both cases, to say that they are experimental writers misses the ease with which we read them. Reading McBride is simple as well as exhilarating because in gleefully puncturing the sentence she is allowing us to inhabit a character\u2019s mind and body. The world that emerges is startlingly familiar precisely because it&#xa0;is rendered less familiar by the prose. The blending of speech and thought, of present and past, and the disjunction between interior and exterior worlds are all part of daily experience.</p> <p><em>The Lesser Bohemians</em> confirms McBride\u2019s status as one of our major novelists. She writes with beauty, wisdom and humour and she is uniquely sensitive to what is being communicated with every look or jerk of the body. If, in DH Lawrence\u2019s formulation, the novel is \u201cthe one bright book of life\u201d, then the life here radiates through the pages and illuminates ours.</p> <p>\u2022 Lara Feigel is the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bitter-taste-of-victory.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Bitter Taste of Victory: In the Ruins of the Reich</em></a> (Bloomsbury).

  "<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Friday Night Lights meets Educating Yorkshire.</p> <p><strong>Why you\u2019ll love it:</strong> It\u2019s important that I put Last Chance U into context here. I do not like American football. I do not understand American football. The college football system is the most bafflingly arcane thing of all time. And yet Last Chance U might be the best sports documentary series I have ever seen.<br></p> <p>The East Mississippi Community College Lions are a force of nature. National junior college champions for three consecutive years with a 24-game winning streak, the Lions rose to prominence thanks to their policy of recruiting gifted athletes who have been rejected by the system elsewhere. This nothingy school in the middle of nowhere (Scooba, Mississippi: pop 732) is the last place these misfits and screw-ups want to be, but it\u2019s the best chance they have of reaching the NFL.</p> <p>However, their winning streak means nothing if they don\u2019t pass their classes. And, as interesting as the players \u2013 with their assorted ambitions and desperate backstories \u2013 are, the true stars of the show are the two figures tasked with maintaining the ridiculous highwire act between sport and academia.</p> <p>Buddy Stephens is the team\u2019s coach, and the architect of all its success. Aside from a few discombobulating home scenes, his entire life is the Lions. This is not a man of shades of grey; every emotion he feels is felt volcanically. When his team is winning, he\u2019s a force of inspiring optimism. When it isn\u2019t, his fury is galvanising. By the third episode, when the Lions hit the first of many lows, his anger and disgust at everything around him is so vehemently pronounced that even I started to want to win his approval.</p> <p>Arguably, though, Stephens has it easy. Brittany Wagner is the EMCC\u2019s academic adviser, and she\u2019s the one with her work cut out. Wagner\u2019s job is to corral the players\u2019 enthusiasm for football back to their schoolwork. If they fail a subject, or miss a deadline, or don\u2019t show up to class, they are dropped from the team. The Lions do many of these things frequently, and Wagner\u2019s good cop/bad cop routine is fascinating. The players often hang out in her office, lying on the floor, shooting the breeze, right up until the moment they do badly. Then they vanish from sight, much to her frustration. The grace with which she copes with these highs and lows is breathtaking.</p> <p>You do not need a working knowledge of American football to enjoy this. The sum total of my American football experience before Last Chance U consisted of a half-watched Super Bowl and a miserable summer spent failing to work out a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_H5UqkNcZQ\">Megadrive John Madden</a> game. And yet I was absolutely gripped. Especially during the match-day sequences, director Greg Whiteley knows exactly when to slow the action down, when to cut away to a furious coach or a fretting spectator, when the music should swell with expectation and when it should dissolve away to nothing. It\u2019s handled so expertly that even a non-fan like me can understand the stakes. Each win is giddying. Each loss hurts. The end of the series is nothing less than Shakespearean. This is a show about obsession, and it is very, very easy to get swept up in.</p> <p><strong>Where:</strong> Netflix.</p> <p><strong>Length:</strong> Six hour-long episodes.</p> <p><strong>Stand-out episode: </strong>The finale, which opens in a state of pandemonium, screams itself raw, and then ends on a moment of heartbreaking sweetness.</p> <p><strong>If you liked Last Chance U, watch:</strong> Friday Night Lights (Netflix), All Or Nothing (Amazon), The Battered Bastards of Baseball (Netflix).</p>",

A briefing stressed that curbing migration is a red line, and that Britain is not interested in an off-the-shelf deal with Europe but a bespoke one. Nevertheless it is still far from clear, perhaps even to May herself, what will emerge once she has finished with her hammer and chisel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/restricting-immigration-will-be-at-heart-of-brexit-deal-theresa-may-says\">Restricting immigration will be at heart of Brexit deal, Theresa May says</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-conservative-leadership-bid-brexit-means-brexit-video\" title=\"\">May\u2019s well-tried line about Brexit meaning Brexit </a>has been a useful summer defence against attempts to bounce her into committing herself before she was ready. It allowed her to scotch suspicions that a predominantly pro-remain government would attempt to renege on the people\u2019s verdict. It also bought her time to clarify what, in her view, Brexit really adds up to. But its shelf-life is over now and decision time is getting close.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s cabinet meeting showed that what Brexit really means is still a work in progress. To extend the sculpture analogy, it showed that May has begun to shape and narrow the block of marble without starting to cut irrevocably into it. The precise outlines of the figure to be carved remain hidden. But some things are now not in&#xa0;doubt.</p> <p>It was always clear, for instance, that meaningful migration controls would be at the heart of any Brexit package that May will accept. Border controls are crucial to the social reform Toryism she stands for. That was explicitly confirmed this week. Free movement as we know it will end. The rules governing movement to and from the 27 remaining European Union member states will change. Downing Street claims to have a pretty clear idea of what it wants to achieve.</p> <p>Likewise, it has always been obvious that May will look to maintain existing EU single market trading links as much as possible. As an aim it\u2019s a no-brainer. But the reality is something else. You can\u2019t be in the single market without free movement, so if the UK forsakes free movement, in what sense can it still access the single market? Deciding how far to push that is not a dilemma for London, but one for the whole EU.</p> <p>True, it is a mistake to think that no compromises whatever are possible. The single market is not just one undifferentiated system. Services, digital issues, energy and transport are all not fully unified. Even rights to free movement can be differentiated \u2013 like existing length of stay, the position of dependents, students and, in particular, those in and with offers of employment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc3d9a0c406d088d70706b8c983b64de292119b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc3d9a0c406d088d70706b8c983b64de292119b1/0_183_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at Chequers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at Chequers: \u2018Wednesday\u2019s cabinet meeting showed that what Brexit really means is still a work in progress.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, it is naive to imagine May either wants to or could deliver continued freedom of movement in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. The Brexit vote was many things, but at its heart it was a revolt against migration, both real and imagined. Others may be in denial about this, but the prime minister certainly is not.</p> <p>It therefore follows that Britain has not got a hope in hell of negotiating a deal that keeps the country in the single market after Brexit. Freedom of movement is not a detail, to be casually set aside. And if the UK is determined to end freedom of movement, it also follows that UK access to the single market will be very limited.</p> <p>Not enough people have grasped this yet. Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform thinktank says \u201cthe British people are living in cloud cuckoo land\u201d about the economic impact. Most prophets of post-Brexit economic doom are lying low at the moment \u2013 August\u2019s rebound in manufacturing being the latest reason for them to do so. But it is hard to imagine how a Britain outside the single market will not struggle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All the choices that follow from Brexit are difficult \u2013 and many of them are very bad ones indeed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s why the real political tension in the May cabinet is actually not between the remainers and the leavers, as many have too easily assumed. People who were at the meeting claim there is reasonable agreement among ministers about the shape of the strategy so far. The bigger faultline is the one between the Treasury, which wants the single market to be the priority, and No&#xa0;10, which puts migration control first.</p> <p>Since No&#xa0;10 will ultimately win that battle, the question is how the Treasury will react. In its determination to maintain the City of London\u2019s global position outside the single market, the Treasury will find itself inexorably drawn down the road towards remaking the UK as an offshore, low-tax financial haven. Just at the very moment when the EU locks horns with Apple over sweetheart tax deals, so Britain may roll out the welcome mat to international corporations such as Apple, offering Britain as the new Ireland, or as a European Singapore.</p> <p>There was a sign of that changing mood this week when Carolyn Fairbairn, the new head of the CBI, urged the government <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/248396/let-banks-off-naughty-step-fight-london-post-brexit-says\" title=\"\">to allow the banks to come \u201coff the naughty step</a>\u201d, said City regulators should prioritise competitiveness and proposed scrapping the current 8% surcharge on bank profits. George Osborne\u2019s brief post-referendum flirtation with a low corporation tax regime was ended by his sacking in July. But the pressure on Philip Hammond to follow that path seems likely to grow as the shape of the Brexit stance gradually becomes clearer this autumn.</p> <p>This will present May with a huge dilemma. If she sanctions a drive towards lower tax, lighter-touch financial regulation, she will delight the Thatcherite Brexiteers such as the international trade secretary, Liam Fox. He told Wednesday\u2019s meeting that Britain had to rediscover a Victorian buccaneering spirit \u2013 language that may not travel as well as Fox imagines. May herself talked this week about forging a unique new role for the UK in the world, so some of that may have rubbed off on her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/theresa-may-brexiteers-conservative-right-prime-minister\">Has Theresa May really thrown in her lot with the Brexiteers? | Jackie Ashley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But a re-embrace of City bankers and an even more sumptuous welcome mat to global corporations would be disastrous for the Tories. A decent opposition would make hay with it. It would make a mockery of the claim that Britain should be \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d. This claim has been central to May\u2019s political positioning ever since the referendum (and indeed long before that). And it is now to be the theme of the post-referendum Tory party conference in Birmingham next month.</p> <p>May and her ministers aren\u2019t stupid people. They know they are advancing into an autumn in which all the big political and economic calls are connected and all have big consequences. They mostly understand the problems they face.

  "<p>The rains are not what they once were in Kitui County. As climate change bites, the wet season is more erratic and drought has become an all-too-common phenomenon in this rural corner of eastern Kenya.</p> <p>This year, the community\u2019s produce of peas, sorghum and other staples failed to reach maturity because the rains arrived one month late, says Onesmus Mwangangi, an agricultural expert at the charity <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.farmafrica.org/\">Farm Africa</a>. \u201cFarmers in this region have lost more than 80% of their crops due to lack of rain,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>They are not alone. Much of southern Africa is currently suffering consecutive seasons of drought, prompting the <a href=\"http://www.sadc.int/\">Southern African Development Community</a> to declare a regional disaster and to request $2.7bn in aid. If donors were to follow the recent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fao.org/emergencies/resources/documents/resources-detail/en/c/426926/\">advice of the UN</a>, a proportion of that funding should be spent on so-called drought-resistant seeds.</p> <p>Seeds have been conventionally bred to be more tolerant to low water levels for decades. Plants are either conventionally crossed and then screened to identify those with optimum gene patterns or, more recently, they have been genetically modified (GM) to include the desired DNA traits. </p> <p>Among the early pioneers of conventional cross-breeding for drought resistance are organisations such as the non-profit <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cimmyt.org/\">International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://archive.agra.org/\">AGRA</a> (supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation). In Kitui County, Farm Africa is already encouraging farmers to adopt drought-tolerant hybrids of traditional crops, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-013-0256-x\">evidence suggesting</a> these seeds use water more efficiently and, in many cases, mature over shorter periods.</p> <p>The big guns of the biotech world are also moving in, with seed giants such as <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/products/pages/droughtgard-hybrids.aspx\">Monsanto</a>, <a href=\"http://www.syngenta-us.com/corn/agrisure/agrisure-artesian\">Syngenta</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www2.dupont.com/Renewably_Sourced_Materials/en_US/seeds.html\">DuPont</a> investing heavily in GM strains of drought-resistant crops for the US, but not yet Africa.</p> <h2>Do drought-resistant seeds work?</h2> <p>The evidence in favour of drought-resistant seeds is strong, says Kate Fehlenberg, from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cimmyt.org/project-profile/drought-tolerant-maize-for-africa-dtma/\">Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa Seed Scaling project</a> (DTMASS), funded by USAID. Over a five-year period, a total of 2.9 million farmers in 13 African countries covered by an earlier version of the DTMASS project saw their yields increase by 20% to 30% after sowing a variety of drought-tolerant hybrids. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/sep/17/food-security-gm\">Africa shouldn't take GM crops lightly, but neither can it ignore their potential</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fehlenberg says that the hurdle has less to do with science and more to do with distribution. \u201cThe challenge is to get [the seed] out to the farmers \u2026 You can have the best corn in the world but it\u2019s no good if it\u2019s sitting in the freezer.\u201d</p> <p>Some inroads are being made. The <a href=\"http://wema.aatf-africa.org/\">Water Efficient Maize for Africa programme</a>, involving Monsanto, for example, saw sales of its drought-tolerant hybrid non-GM seed variety increase by more than <a href=\"http://www.aatf-africa.org/files/files/publications/AATF-ar-2015.pdf\">300% last year</a> [pdf], with around 200,000 farmers having used its seeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf12dc373c5100fb97e4ebde655220ced6e00b1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf12dc373c5100fb97e4ebde655220ced6e00b1d/0_174_5216_3129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmer in Africa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trials of drought-resistant seeds, funded by the Gates Foundation, have shown yield increases.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farm Africa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such successes remain relatively isolated, however. In reality, most smallholder farmers in Africa have yet to hear about drought-resistant seed technology. And those that have are still to be convinced. According to an as yet unpublished survey of more than 4,000 farmers by DTMASS, common concerns include the cost, reliability and productivity of these novel seed varieties. </p> <p>The seed market also needs better regulation, says Fehlenberg. In countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, for example, the sale of fake and falsely labelled seeds is widespread.</p> <p>DTMASS recently set up a seed scaling programme to increase awareness and demand for drought-tolerant varieties among small farmers in Africa. Part of its strategy will be to look beyond formal market channels such as seed companies\u2019 local salespeople and try to access informal farmer networks.</p> <h2>Seeds not the only solution</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/18/africa-drought-untapped-groundwater-aquifers-water-stress-ngo-partnership-ethiopia\">Africa droughts prompt calls to start pumping untapped groundwater</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are, however, reservations. Seed sovereignty in particular has become a red-flag issue for many farmer groups in Africa. The drought-tolerant seeds have to be purchased anew every year, unlike traditional seeds, which can be regularly recycled. If seed companies like Monsanto end up controlling the sale of drought-tolerant seeds in Africa in the future, many farmers fear becoming locked into cycles of financial obligation as well as losing control over local systems of food production.</p> <p>The solution, says Clare Oxborrow, senior <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/page/sustainable-farming\">food and farming</a> campaigner at Friends of the Earth UK, is an approach to seed development, including drought-tolerant seeds, that prioritises local-led breeding and local knowledge. </p> <p> Seeds are also only one piece of the puzzle, says Fehlenberg. Other important steps to increase resilience to drought include good farm management, effective irrigation, suitable crop insurance, and the use of crops suited to the local climate and soil.</p> <p>With this advice in mind, Farm Africa currently trains farmer groups in agricultural best practices such as manure-based fertility management, water conservation and proper tillage. The charity is also working to provide improved early warning of potentially extreme weather conditions so farmers can better prepare for drought conditions.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2016.

Under Section 18C:</p> <blockquote> <p>(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:</p> <p>(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and</p> <p>(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is important to note that under <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html\">Section 18D</a>, conduct that prima facie breaches 18C will not be unlawful if it is done \u201creasonably and in good faith\u201d for artistic, academic, scientific or other public interest purposes, or in reporting on any such conduct.</p> <p>The original Racial Discrimination Act was (and still is) primarily concerned with situations in which racism produces a material disadvantage for someone. That might be, for example, denial of a promotion in the workplace context, or rejection as a potential tenant of a residential property.</p> <p>In 1995 federal parliament recognised racism can also manifest in other ways and cause other sorts of harms. These include the harms that can be done by what is often referred to colloquially as \u201cracial vilification\u201d or \u201chate speech\u201d.</p> <p>Thinkers, writers, politicians, journalists and others have been arguing for many years about whether words alone can harm \u2013 or harm to such an extent that the state should take an interest in discouraging such behaviour.

It can crush people\u2019s self-esteem, leave them feeling paralysed and silenced, and excluded from the wider community.</p> <p>It may also cause people to modify their behaviour in undesirable ways, such as avoiding going out in public to avoid abuse, being unwilling to identify with one\u2019s ethnicity in the workplace so as not to risk ridicule, or speaking only English in public.</p> <h2>So who has a problem with it, and why?</h2> <p>No-one pays much attention to the majority of cases in which Section 18C is invoked \u2013 to signal that the behaviours that cause such harms are unacceptable in a multicultural liberal democracy.</p> <p>The heat is always at the margins, stoked by media interest because of the identity of an alleged perpetrator (the <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2011/1103.html\">Andrew Bolt case</a> from 2011 being a prime example), or because the case is regarded as linking up a wider agenda around \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d.</p> <p>This appears to be, at least in part, why The Australian newspaper and Bernardi are so interested in <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/18c-case-student-cleared-by-queensland-university-of-technology/news-story/a86f5c3d65d1c1df5289bcd44bc354d2\">a pending case</a> triggered by controversy over a computer lab provided to support Indigenous students at the Queensland University of Technology.</p> <p>It is much harder to perpetuate the myth that 18C threatens the foundations of Australian democracy (and so must be repealed), if the more typical cases that <a href=\"http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/392-2.pdf\">we have discovered in our research</a> are considered. These included:</p> <ul> <li>cases involving holocaust denial and anti-Semitism;</li> <li>a case in which Aboriginal youths killed in a car accident were described as \u201ccriminal trash\u201d and \u201cscum\u201d that should be used as \u201cland fill\u201d; and</li> <li>a case in which an Aboriginal women and her family were subjected to a torrent of abuse, including being called including \u201cniggers\u201d, \u201ccoons\u201d, \u201cblack mole\u201d, \u201cblack bastards\u201d and \u201clying black mole cunt\u201d.</li> </ul> <p>There was also a case in which a man who was simply doing his job as a security officer at a public building was called a \u201cSingaporean prick\u201d, and echoing the classic retort of xenophobic exclusion that has been slung at numerous immigrant communities: \u201cGo back to Singapore\u201d.</p> <h2>Why 18C should not be amended</h2> <p>The wording of Section 18C, and the inclusion of exemptions in Section 18D, represent a genuine attempt to set some parameters for civil and respectful communication, and for making a declaration that, as a society, we recognise the human dignity of all, irrespective of colour, ethnicity or country of origin.</p> <p>Bernardi and Leyonhjelm, and other campaigners for the rollback of 18C, tend to focus on the words \u201coffend\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d that form part of the key phrase in the legislation (\u201coffend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\u201d). However, this approach misunderstands the harm threshold in 18C.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/cory-bernardi-vows-new-bid-to-change-orwellian-section-18c-of-race-act\">Jewish community leader says removing 18C would send 'worst possible message'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The courts have consistently held that the bar is not a low one.

The word \u2018offend\u2019 is potentially wider, but given the context, \u2018offend\u2019 should be interpreted conformably with the words chosen as its partners.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, there is another point that often gets lost in the debate over 18C. As far as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-do-australias-laws-on-hate-speech-work-in-practice-26105\">legal regulation goes</a>, the regime contained in the Racial Discrimination Act is one of the more modest forms of state intervention. The Human Rights Commission is a neutral facilitator, not an enforcer. And, wherever possible, the aim is to resolve things via conciliation.</p> <p>Only a very small number of cases ever make their way to the court system. Even where a complaint is upheld, the remedies are hardly draconian. Damages are rarely awarded (and if they are, the amount is modest), and no-one is convicted or goes to prison \u2013 because 18C does not create a criminal offence.</p> <p>Section 18C alone can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d the problem of racism that continues to exist in Australia. It would be wrong to see it as a magical panacea. But it is equally wrong \u2013 and unsupported by the available evidence \u2013 to regard 18C as a threat to Australia\u2019s liberal democracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The\u00a0Conversation&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/64359/count.gif&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u2022 <em>This piece <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-section-18c-and-why-do-some-politicians-want-it-changed-64660\">originally appeared in the Conversation</a>. </em><em>Luke McNamara is a professor in the faculty of law at the University of New South Wales.

And the fact that some people on the first week went home early before the end of the adjournment debate is an absolute disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>Keenan apologised to his colleagues on Friday, admitting on ABC radio that Malcolm Turnbull had \u201cmade his view clear to me that he thinks that [was] unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEvery member should be available for divisions at all times and I haven\u2019t failed in that responsibility in the past and won\u2019t be failing in that responsibility again in the future,\u201d Keenan said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a decision that I shouldn\u2019t have taken and obviously I\u2019m sorry that I did. It was a work-related matter but that\u2019s obviously no excuse.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher Pyne, the leader of government business in the lower house, also conceded on Nine\u2019s Today<em> </em>program that the government had misstepped: \u201cThere is no doubt what happened late yesterday afternoon was a stuff up. Those people who weren\u2019t there learnt a valuable lesson, everyone learnt a valuable lesson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a salutary lesson for anyone who went home before the House rose yesterday afternoon. I\u2019m absolutely certain that they won\u2019t do that again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201c[But] these were three procedural votes and quite frankly, people out there in the community are more worried about jobs. They\u2019re more worried about feeding themselves and their children than they are about three adjournment votes in the House of Representatives,\u201d he said.</p> <p>George Brandis said the vote loss shouldn\u2019t have occurred, but he heard Keenan apologising on radio and people needed to put things in perspective.</p> <p>\u201cBut I think we have to put this into perspective ... this was a motion of a procedural character, it wasn\u2019t a vote on a bill,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a political stunt that Bill Shorten decided to pull and he got away with it because there was indiscipline on the part of a small number of my colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Opposition leader Bill Shorten denied on Friday Labor\u2019s tactics amounted to a stunt. </p> <p>\u201cLabor wants to have justice for banking victims,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cLabor wants a banking royal commission. The Liberals just want to go home. I don\u2019t think that the challenge of tens of thousands of people, a generation of Australians who have been ripped off and let down \u2013 it is not a stunt, it is not a laughing matter.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten reiterated that Labor would work with the government where possible, but said Malcom Turnbull was \u201cturning bungling into an art form\u201d, and his promises of stable government had been shown to be false.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a stable majority. It\u2019s taken them precisely two days ... to prove that Mr Turnbull can\u2019t manage the parliament,\u201d Shorten said. </p> <p>Labor senator Stephen Conroy said Tony Abbott\u2019s recent complaint that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/tony-abbott-urges-turnbull-to-pursue-reform-to-counter-populist-politics\">this government was not in power</a> was true: \u201cIt\u2019s not often I agree with Tony Abbott, but this is a government that\u2019s in office but not actually running the country,\u201d Conroy told ABC radio.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen again ... complacency, arrogance, ministers who think they can just leave the building without permission from anybody.</p> <p>Turnbull rejected that point on Friday, saying his government is running the country.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are in office and we are in power,\u201d he said.</p>",

Yet women are often damned if they do conform to gender stereotypes and damned if they don\u2019t. If they show assertiveness, they\u2019re more likely to be perceived as bossy or bitchy. If they seek to lead by consensus, they\u2019re more likely to be labelled weak and lacking leadership. Hillary Clinton is a case in point. Like or loathe her, Clinton\u2019s fierce ambition combined with her perceived lack of warmth is held against her where the same traits would be regarded as a strength for men. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/31/jeffrey-siminoff-twitter-inclusion-diversity\">Jeffrey Siminoff: 'Twitter is the place where inclusion lives'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given the pervasiveness of everyday sexism, there is clearly much to be done to arrive at the day where gender is a non-issue in how we parent, speak, lead and pursue our ambitions. Until then, those who recognise the chasm that needs to be closed to reach gender equality must actively speak up and call out sexism when they see it \u2013 both the unintentional, seemingly harmless everyday variety and the more menacing and ill-intentioned type perpetuated by those who feel threatened by strong women.</p> <p>At a recent talk by the former army chief and Australian of the year, Lieutenant General David Morrison, he spoke about how the Australian army was slower to wake up to the sexism within its ranks than the airforce or navy. He shared the epiphany he had when then sexual discrimination commissioner Liz Broderick asked him why, for the past 100 years, less than 10% of the army had been female. His lack of a good answer woke him up to the sexism in his ranks and took him on a mission to radically change its culture. His call to arms against misogyny and unacceptable behaviour in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaqpoeVgr8U\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube video</a> sent a clear message to all who didn\u2019t respect women to \u201cget out\u201d.<br></p> <p>We need more of that. Much more.</p> <p>We need more people to wake up and see that sexism is still a barrier for women and that each of us has a role to play in removing it. Simply agreeing that women make strong leaders, that gender diverse teams produce stronger results and make better decisions \u2013 in business, science, politics, education and beyond \u2013 or that gender equality is morally right is not enough. For change to occur, we need an army of men and women committed to confronting sexism where it lives. In our conversations around the coffee machine at work, around the dinner table at home or at the pub on a Friday night.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about casting women as victims or making villains of men. It\u2019s about taking personal responsibility for the part we all play, albeit often unintentionally, to perpetuate the status quo and in having the courage to do our bit to change it.</p>",
  "<p>Does a walk in the park during your lunch break make you feel relaxed? Does lush greenery or a glint of sunlight on running water catch your eye and allow you to stare and rest your brain?</p> <p>We recently turned our attention to these questions when we asked park users in the city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne\">Melbourne</a> to view films of walks. We used \u201ceye-tracking\u201d: a technology that allows us to look deeply into exactly what you are looking at or paying attention to. Eye trackers follow your gaze as you look around a scene. We see where your eye dwells and what things you skip over.</p> <p>Where you stop is called a fixation, and where the eye darts around is called a saccade. During saccades, the eye is effectively blind. Watching what you stop to pay attention to, and what you \u201cdon\u2019t see\u201d, can tell us a lot about what might be going on inside your mind \u2013 what is driving your eyes to move about the way they do.</p> <p>What you see can affect where you go, what you buy, and how prone you are to accidents. </p> <p>In addition, park designs have been shaped by a number of theories:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ecehh.org/research-projects/attention-restoration-theory-a-systematic-review/\">Attention Restoration Theory</a> (ART), for example, predicts that natural scenes promote fixations, and these allow the brain to recover from extended periods of concentration. This explains why parks are relaxing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://prezi.com/sydoyajztv-j/prospect-refuge-theory/\">Prospect Refuge Theory</a> predicts that we feel safer when we have a clear view of a scene and so can identify potential dangers. This explains why people take certain paths and not others.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9QTAr0xG-E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l9QTAr0xG-E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Eye-tracking can test these theories. In our study, 35 respondents were shown four short films of walks through Melbourne parks such as the walk through Royal Park shown in the above video.</p> <p>Respondents\u2019 eye-tracking data were then overlaid with features that were automatically identified in the video, such as trees, the path and man-made objects such as lamp-posts. Our analysis required every tree, rock, shrub, pathway, seat, person and sky region to be automatically segmented out and then data from these regions collated.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.thatsmelbourne.com.au/Placestogo/ParksandGardens/AllParksandGardens/Pages/4438.aspx\">Royal Park</a>, one of the drier-looking grassland parks, the study showed that, overwhelmingly, respondents spent more time looking at man-made objects, relative to their appearance in the video.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a335ab83e0778773ac67f9013c461aa0e3d3d08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a335ab83e0778773ac67f9013c461aa0e3d3d08/95_0_1435_861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A segmented analysis of Royal Park, Melbourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A segmented analysis of Royal Park, Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: the authors</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand, in <a href=\"http://www.fitzroygardens.com/\">Fitzroy Gardens</a> with its dense green foliage, participants spent much more time looking at the bushes.

In our study, Fitzroy Gardens came out as the favourite park with its lush green foliage, abundant bird sounds and water features.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSDtTxYxpJY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HSDtTxYxpJY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>\u2018Mann-cams\u2019 \u2026 the age of the mass panopticon?</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Using data in this way will allow researchers to analyse and identify what matters to users of outdoor spaces. Urban decision-makers will be able to use this information to better refine urban design, signage and safety.</p> <p>At the same time, with eye trackers becoming cheaper and more ubiquitous, the collection of this kind of data could become a double-edged sword.<br></p> <p>Studying what we \u201ceye-ball\u201d is of keen interest to advertisers. In academic research, subjects know we are watching what they look at, as do the users of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/smile-face-recognition-for-google-glass-is-here-thanks-to-hackers-16262\">Google Glasses</a> or Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/with-hololens-the-future-of-reality-is-augmented-37104\">Hololens</a>. However, we may be unaware of how data from our eyes are gathered by other means, as <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/au/news/no-dummy-this-mannequin-is-spying-on-you/\">spying mannequins demonstrate</a>.</p> <p>In 1791, the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham coined the term \u201c<a href=\"http://studymore.org.uk/ybenfou.htm\">panopticon</a>\u201d: an inspection house that allowed guards to see all cells in a prison, while remaining hidden from view. Although few prisons with panopticons were ever built, they became an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham\">essential concept for the analysis</a> of cities and government during the 20th century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/28/manifesto-conscious-cities-streets-sensitive-mental-needs\">A manifesto for conscious cities: should streets be sensitive to our mental needs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>French philosopher Michel Foucault <a href=\"http://foucault.info/doc/documents/disciplineandpunish/foucault-disciplineandpunish-panopticism-html\">argued</a> that a panopticon ably maintains social and power imbalances while using that most passive method of control: observation. As governments and private corporations increasingly use eye-tracking data, everyone can act as observers, recorders and the observed \u2013 whether they intended to or not.</p> <p>In this sense we could argue that the increasing development of eye-tracking could usher in the age of the mass panopticon. Yet, the relationship between a selfie society, an \u201call-seeing, all-knowing\u201d culture and the future of eye-tracking in open domains remains to be \u201cseen\u201d.</p> <p><em></em><em>This piece is an edited version of an article first published at <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-panopticons-are-coming-and-theyll-know-when-we-think-the-grass-is-greener-63935\">the Conversation</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/63935/count.gif&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>"
