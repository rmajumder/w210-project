  "<p>This week reminded us that the government\u2019s default narratives on welfare spending and government debt and deficit falter in the face of reality.</p> <p>The big story about welfare this week was that the worries about growing numbers of people staying on welfare was not that big a problem.</p> <p>The minister for social services, Christian Porter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/20/coalition-to-reveal-plan-to-tackle-welfare-dependence-across-generations\">released a report</a> which examined the dependence of certain groups on the welfare system over the course of their lives.</p> <p>The report contained some pretty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/22/christian-porters-welfare-figures-are-designed-to-shock-pay-them-no-respect\">dodgy budget figures</a> that were best ignored but the report itself was worthwhile and instructive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/australia-does-not-have-a-welfare-problem-we-have-a-poverty-problem\">Australia does not have a welfare problem. We have a poverty problem | John Falzon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conservative governments often struggle with welfare, given their default position that it is a \u201cproblem\u201d that requires cutting. They aren\u2019t helped by friendly media outlets so desperate to push the idea of those on welfare as bludgers that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/22/father-furious-after-daughter-labelled-aussie-bludger-by-news-corp-tabloid\">will rush</a> to paint youth as such on their front pages, regardless of the facts.</p> <p>The struggle is compounded by the findings of reports, such as that released this week, which show the biggest driver of welfare spending is the age pension, and that those who remain on welfare for lengthy periods are in small and very specific groups.</p> <p>That reality doesn\u2019t look good on a tabloid front page and so that rather benign information is smothered with large hypothetical figures.</p> <p>Joe Hockey tried this approach last year in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/mar/09/intergenerational-report-assumptions-about-government-spending-are-a-confusion-of-idiocy\">much criticised Intergenerational Report</a>. That report actually predicted all welfare payments would decrease by 2055 as a proportion of GDP except for the age pension and the carer payment \u2013 both of which are linked to our ageing population.</p> <p>To his credit, despite the inclusion of big numbers about \u201clifetime costs\u201d, Porter this week did try to swim against the flow of welfare bashing by talking instead of the failures of the system. He spoke movingly at the National Press Club about the plight of youth who are forced to care for their parents and who remain in the welfare system due to a lack of education and employment experience.</p> <p>He also talked of a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to help such people. </p> <p>The pull of the old narrative, however, was often too strong to resist. </p> <p>Fifteen years ago the base level of Newstart was equivalent to being on the poverty line; now it is equal to being 30% below that line. But Porter quickly dismissed propositions from organisations such as Acoss about the inadequacy of the base level of the payment as exaggerated because \u201conly 5%\u201d of those on Newstart receive only Newstart.</p> <p>That receiving rent assistance, carer allowance, or the family tax benefit resolved questions of the \u201cadequacy\u201d of Newstart is a rather alarming proposition from the man with carriage of the program.</p> <p>Similarly, Porter dismissed concerns about the government\u2019s proposed policy of a four-week wait before being able to access Newstart. He suggested that \u201cit may well be challenging for a very short period of time\u201d but he insisted, because in his view it would prevent people from entering the welfare system, it would be a \u201chuge win\u201d.</p> <p>Yet he already noted that only 5% of those on Newstart were only on Newstart, therefore in reality many of these people would already be in the \u201cwelfare system\u201d.</p> <p>And the very report he was trumpeting noted that the numbers of people on working-age welfare payments such as Newstart was almost perfectly correlated with the unemployment rate.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, what keeps people on Newstart is not the level of Newstart, but whether or not there are jobs available.</p> <p>The rhetoric on the dangers of debt and deficit was also hit by reality this week when the new governor of the RBA, Dr Philip Lowe, appeared before the House economics committee.</p> <p>He suggested that cutting interest rates was nearing the end of its usefulness and that to spur growth the government instead should take advantage of \u201cthe low interest rates to increase its spending\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/lets-learn-from-the-mistakes-that-created-us-poverty-not-copy-them\">Let's learn from the mistakes that created US poverty, not copy them | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lowe argued the government should borrow money to fund infrastructure projects, which in turn would improve productivity and drive growth.</p> <p>But throughout the election the narrative from the government \u2013 and the ALP \u2013 was of the terrible danger of Australia losing its AAA credit rating should spending not be brought \u201cunder control\u201d.</p> <p>Lowe, however, argued there was little to fear from such an occurrence.</p> <p>Rather than preach fear, he suggested the ratings were really just a \u201cuseful reminder\u201d about the need to watch government spending growth and would have little material effect on the government\u2019s borrowing costs.</p> <p>It is unlikely the government will change its narrative, but you would think at some point it might realise that if you are going to get people to agree with your policies, perhaps basing them on reality might be a good way to start.</p>",
  "<p>There are six good reasons to be discomfited by what\u2019s turning out to be a very messy and public divorce for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt \u2013 their kids. Apart from those innocent and vulnerable souls (and however much the Jolie-Pitt brood strut through their gilded, red-carpeted lives, they remain innocent and vulnerable), it seems to be a case of grab your popcorn and enjoy the spectacle.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. At base level, this is just a venal hiss of: \u201cOoh, very rich, very pretty people falling out!\u201d Celebrity divorce reimagined as a disaster movie. Pathetic rubberneckers, like myself, gobbling up the gossip, accusations and fury. Perhaps a little snort at Jennifer Aniston photographed \u201clooking solemn\u201d, as though she had imposed a smiling ban on herself, lest normal cheeriness be mistaken for spiteful joy at the news.</p> <p>It\u2019s a PR universe away from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, who strove to \u201cuncouple\u201d with so little acrimony or, indeed, emotion, that there were times that it came across as less a split, rather a kind of squeaky pulling apart of weak Velcro.</p> <p>But good for Gwynnie and Chris, right? However much we mock their efforts (leastways, the vocabulary), they behaved with dignity and protected their family. Most would agree that co-operation and mediation are best, especially when kids are involved. Sure, but on the other hand, just like regular divorce, perhaps there are some celebrity divorces that just couldn\u2019t (and maybe shouldn\u2019t) end quietly.</p> <p>Where the Jolie-Pitt divorce is concerned, whatever the conjecture, right now, there\u2019s no way of knowing what\u2019s true or false. However, it\u2019s widely accepted that it was Jolie who initiated the divorce and in such a determined manner that there could be no hope of pretending that it was amicable. In this way, it\u2019s reminiscent of 2016\u2019s other Big Blockbuster Divorce \u2013 between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Then, Heard was widely branded a \u201cgolddigger!\u201d, scrabbling for a \u201cbig pay day\u201d. Such was the venom directed at her, I felt at the time that I\u2019d inadvertently signed up for a crash course in synchronised global misogyny. A big cheer, then, for Heard, the big ol\u2019 golddigging slut, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/18/amber-heard-donates-divorce-settlement-charity-abused-women\">announcing</a> that all her settlement money would go to charity.</p> <p>The Jolie-Pitt divorce is totally different. (Just one of the ways it\u2019s different is that no one could pelt \u201cgolddigger\u201d mud at Jolie.) However, there could be said to be a core similarity in the way that both women initiated divorce proceedings and both seemed defiant about making a lot of noise. While ugly celebrity bust-ups are nothing new, there still seems to be a fresh feminist-flavoured attitude, a sense of rebellion here.</p> <p>It\u2019s a little acknowledged fact that sometimes huge status and wealth can trap a person. Put into context, this is a world where fame and money tend to calm things down, smooth things over, at least on the surface. The main (lawyered/PR-ed/micromanaged) onus is on control and its smiling twin, damage limitation \u2013 managing and protecting the famous faces and their highly lucrative brands. Even when both parties are famous, it takes a certain courage to use that very fact not to soothe, calm and conceal, but almost as an accelerant.</p> <p>This is why, while there\u2019s much to be said for the measured, mediated approach (not least for any children involved), I find Heard and now Jolie\u2019s brand of bolshiness noteworthy and fascinating. I\u2019m not suggesting they have anything in common with the powerless or penniless who divorce, but that\u2019s the point \u2013 women like them appear to be rebelling against the controlling A-list status quo (speak no evil/tweet no evil\u201d?) and accepting the public censure that comes with that.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m just a sucker for women with fiery gobs and a refusal to go quietly, indeed, do <em>anything</em> quietly. Messy it might be, but there\u2019s no denying the spirit.</p> <h2>In Liverpool, it seems, you\u2019ll never walk alone<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f31abedcb4157c11f233ae71caa629833a2165a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f31abedcb4157c11f233ae71caa629833a2165a/0_195_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster are posthumously awarded the freedom of the city last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster are posthumously awarded the freedom of the city last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 96 victims of the 1989 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/13/hillsborough-disaster-police-south-yorkshire-liverpool\">Hillsborough stadium disaster </a>have been given the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/hillsborough-victims-posthumously-awarded-freedom-of-the-city-of-liverpool\"> freedom of the city of Liverpool</a>.

I bet it was.</p> <p>These honours are a lovely gesture that says a lot about Liverpool. The most bittersweet of \u201cvictories\u201d, Hillsborough wasn\u2019t only about getting justice for those who were killed, it was also about spirit in the face of impossible odds and Liverpool showed it had guts to burn.</p> <p>Time and again, over the years, Liverpudlians have received stick for being over-emotional, melodramatic and the rest, when it seems to me that all the people there do is try to stick up for each other.</p> <p>Liverpool is a true flagship city for community spirit and should be applauded for that.</p> <h2>Whingers should try self-control too</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0a50aae158d0b2e1af008f4ca8a4d7e4413ca3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0a50aae158d0b2e1af008f4ca8a4d7e4413ca3d/28_35_4179_2508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Emirates airline was the subject of a complaint by a passenger about his overweight neighbour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Emirates airline was the subject of a complaint by a passenger about his overweight neighbour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kamran Jebreili/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An Italian man has brought a case against the Emirates airline after being forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/30/traveller-sues-etihad-back-injury-obese-passenger\">sit next to an obese passenger on a nine-hour flight</a>. The man says that he tried to move seats but was told that he couldn\u2019t and that he wasn\u2019t offered compensation or an apology.</p> <p>These stories happen periodically and they always make me angry \u2013 on behalf of the people being complained about. Obviously space can be an issue on planes and it\u2019s uncomfortable feeling squashed, especially on a long flight. However, hasn\u2019t this got a lot more to do with some airlines not giving passengers enough room in the first place?</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the ethical dimension of whether people want to place their temporary personal comfort above basic decency, by insulting and humiliating another human being in this way. I\u2019d rather plunge my face into boiling tar than be the reason an overweight person gets to feel terrible about themselves that day.</p> <p>Overweight people are always being told to exercise self-control over their eating habits \u2013 how about their tormentors thinking about exercising their own self-control, over their manners?</p> <p>I\u2019ve written before that such levels of intolerance could swiftly get out of control both on aircrafts and in wider society. (Overweight people first, then start on the next vulnerable group?)</p> <p>Generally, it\u2019s often suggested that the obese person needs to buy an extra aeroplane seat to accommodate their girth, as if money was no object. How about flipping this so that the people complaining are the ones who need to buy the extra seats, to accommodate their bad attitudes?</p> <p>If the thin and judgmental are so precious about their \u201cpersonal space\u201d, then they should be the ones shelling out for extra seats.</p>",
  "<p>Britain has blocked European Union efforts to establish an independent international inquiry into the war in Yemen, prompting dismay among human rights groups.</p> <p>The Netherlands had hoped to garner broad support for its proposal that the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva set up an inquiry to examine civilian deaths in Yemen, where the Saudi Arabia-led coalition is accused of committing war crimes.</p> <p>Instead, with the UK refusing to give its backing, the Netherlands\u2019 proposal for an international inquiry \u2013 submitted on Friday by Slovakia on behalf of the EU \u2013 was replaced with a much weaker one that the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) dispatch a mission \u201cwith assistance from relevant experts, to monitor and report on the situation ... in Yemen\u201d. This falls far short of what human rights groups and the OHCHR had wanted.</p> <p>In an open letter to the HRC, Human Rights Watch and other campaign groups claim an international inquiry would help to \u201cestablish the facts, collect and preserve information related to violations and abuses with a view to ensuring that those responsible for crimes are brought to justice in fair trials\u201d.</p> <p>Foreign secretary Boris Johnson last week rejected the need for such an inquiry, arguing that the UK was \u201cusing a very, very wide variety of information sources about what is happening to acquaint ourselves with the details\u201d about Yemen.</p> <p>But the revelation that the UK neutered EU attempts to bring about such an investigation is likely to raise questions about its motives. Since the conflict began, the UK has sold more than \u00a33bn worth of weapons and military equipment to the Saudis and defence contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline.</p> <p>\u201cBlocking attempts to create an international inquiry is a betrayal of the people of Yemen who have suffered so much during this conflict,\u201d said Polly Truscott of Amnesty International. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking.

The groups have documented more than 70 \u201cunlawful\u201d coalition airstrikes \u2013 on homes, hospitals, markets, civilian factories and schools \u2013 some of which, they say, may amount to war crimes, and which have killed at least 913 civilians.</p> <p>An airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in August, the fourth during the war, prompted the group to withdraw its staff from six hospitals in northern Yemen and declare a \u201closs of confidence in the coalition\u2019s ability to avoid such fatal attacks\u201d.</p> <p>At least 30 civilians were killed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/aug/20/bombing-vital-port-yemen-children-serious-risk-un-warns\" title=\"\">Saudi-led airstrikes </a>attacked a civilian neighbourhood in Yemen\u2019s central port city of Hodeida last Wednesday.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch also claims that the Houthi armed group and forces allied to it, including those loyal to the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, have committed numerous violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law.</p> <p>Growing disquiet about the UK\u2019s policy on Yemen has seen more than 200 doctors and health professionals sign an open letter to the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, himself a doctor, calling for the UK to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

  "<p>Never mind lemon drizzle cake: where would Britain be without a pantomime villain? The former is a recently confected \u2013 pun required by law \u2013 communal obsession, more imagined nostalgia for cosy postwar domesticity than actual taste. The latter is a cultural conduit through which a population not known for its ability to let it all hang out, emotions-wise, can express its fury, resentment, jealousy and hopelessness.</p> <p>But in a week in which frequent offenders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/19/joey-barton-believes-remain-rangers-talks-mark-warburton\" title=\"\">Joey Barton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/20/angelina-jolie-files-for-divorce-brad-pitt\" title=\"\">Brad Pitt</a> have had their mugs all over the newspapers, it\u2019s absurdly twinkly-eyed baker Paul Hollywood who has really taken the \u2013 second contractual pun \u2013 biscuit.</p> <p>For those who have been living in a hole for the past week, or perhaps engaged in gainful or valuable employment, Hollywood is currently the only member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\" title=\"\"><em>Great British Bake Off</em></a>\u2019s presenter team to follow the programme from BBC1 to Channel 4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/18/bake-off-mel-sue-bbc-punk-rock-stewart-lee\" title=\"\">Mel&#xa0;and Sue </a>were quickest out of the blocks to tell Love Productions where to shove it, thereby obliterating the memory of countless lame jokes and loud blazers to shoot straight to No 1 in the national treasure chart, and were only knocked off when Mary Berry followed suit.</p> <p>Hollywood\u2019s failure to swell the picket line has had immense and instant repercussions. Unsurprisingly, reporters flocked to his house, whereupon he tweeted a picture of himself outside Berlin airport, with the words: \u201cSee you over here soon?\u201d</p> <p>Pretty chipper behaviour from a man who had just been on the receiving end of some choice comments from former contestant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ruby-tandoh\" title=\"\">Ruby Tandoh</a>, who called him \u2013 also on Twitter \u2013 a \u201cpeacocking manchild lingering wherever the money is\u201d, recalled him turning up to work revving a rental Lamborghini (possibly, she corrected herself, a Ferrari) and poked fun at his spray tan and boot-cut jeans. These, of course, are fairly common or garden signifiers of a distaste for middle-aged men and their middle-aged crises, but worse was to come.</p> <p>\u201cWe locked battle with a mythic beast,\u201d wrote Tandoh, now in full Sylvia Plath mode, \u201cboth bright white and mahogany, man and baby, ego and&#xa0;terrible, terrible fragility all at once.\u201d Harsh.</p> <p>But what, really, has Hollywood done? Set fire to the big tent and all the weird pastel furniture therein? Stuck a \u201ckick me\u201d sign on one of Mary\u2019s vivid bomber jackets? (Well, pretty much; he failed to thank her in one of his statements, thereby incensing <em>Bake Off </em>fans staring into the terrifying abyss of having nothing to be angry about.)</p> <p>Essentially, not much: just gone along with a new business model for an entertainment product that might very well have needed one. That\u2019s one way of looking at the duck-rabbit that is <em>Great British Bake Off.</em> The other is that he stared a fragile populace directly in its tear-filled eyes, grabbed the only thing standing between them and a full-blown national nervous breakdown and ground it beneath his hand-tooled cuban heel. For a quid. And then cackled.</p> <p>Another school of thought is that Hollywood, the baker\u2019s son who kneaded his way through kitchens from the Dorchester to Egypt before setting up his own business and beginning to develop a media career, was always going to be the overfilled souffle that brought on an attack of dyspepsia. And, as with many&#xa0;annoying ailments, it began with&#xa0;an unrestrained appetite, not merely Hollywood\u2019s but also the programme makers\u2019.</p> <p><em>Bake Off</em>\u2019s charm has always lain in its refusal to conform to the rampant back-story prurience of other reality television shows, the high-definition equivalent of curtain-twitching combined with a vapid belief in personal journeys. The brief clips of bakers\u2019 home lives that punctuate <em>GBBO</em> are more likely to picture them dishing up a shepherd\u2019s pie on a Tuesday night than weeping into the arms of the brother they never knew they had.</p> <p>And attempts to foster rivalry \u2013 the whipped-up scandal that ensued when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-iain-watters-baked-alaska\" title=\"\">Iain Watters</a> threw his baked alaska into the bin \u2013 have always met with limited success; the competitors can\u2019t seem to help themselves nipping over to someone else\u2019s bench to offer advice&#xa0;and moral support when the sugar hit the fan.</p> <p>But there is always sex. Sex always sells and sex always brings trouble in its wake, especially once you hit 50, as Hollywood did early this year. For the midlifers on telly, there are scant choices: you either float above it or get down and dirty with it.</p> <p>The executives \u2013 and possibly Hollywood was a willing victim \u2013 decided that the bread-maker was their likeliest option for the second course of action. Thus: the eyes got bluer, the hair got spikier, the jeans got&#xa0;tighter. Shirt unbuttoned, legs planted firmly apart, thumbs in belt loops, Hollywood issued his instructions for all manner of buns, brioches and bagels; it was the thigh watermark of that contemporary feminist b\u00eate noire, manspreading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"752cbd093a3d109d3da0cd2c3ed6620dbd91b931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/752cbd093a3d109d3da0cd2c3ed6620dbd91b931/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Great British Bake Off contestant Ruby Tandoh, who called Hollywood a \u2018peacocking manchild lingering wherever the money is\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Great British Bake Off contestant Ruby Tandoh, who called Hollywood a \u2018peacocking manchild lingering wherever the money is\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there was the flirting. You could circle the globe with a list of Mel and Sue\u2019s double entendres and even Mary is occasionally allowed to veer slightly towards the cheeky. Paul, on the other hand, does not feel the need to limit himself to juvenile soggy bottom jokes. Verbal sparring is of no great interest to him.</p> <p>His preferred methods of communication are fairly simple: he mildly intimidates&#xa0;contestants he\u2019s not much impressed by&#xa0;and butters up the ones he likes. And if they happen to be an attractive, youngish woman,&#xa0;all to the good. (This&#xa0;might, incidentally, explain some of the history between Hollywood and Tandoh: when Tandoh&#xa0;came out in 2015, she delighted in pointing out that misogynists who had accused her of flirting with Hollywood on the show to better her chances of winning had been barking up the wrong&#xa0;tree. He subsequently sent her his congratulations, but&#xa0;questioned why she&#xa0;had involved him in&#xa0;her announcement.)</p> <p>Such developments introduced an unstable element to the mixture; its thorough benignity began, perhaps, to look like something a little brasher.

  "<p>Organised crime is far more involved in running Britain\u2019s sex trade than previously thought, with more than three-quarters of brothels found to have links to criminal gangs, according to pioneering research. It claims that sex workers\u2019 movements were controlled by brothels in a third of cases and criticises police for failing to tackle the criminals who control much of the off-street sex industry.</p> <p>Published by an independent thinktank, the <a href=\"http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Police Foundation</a>, the study is the first of its kind to document the links between organised crime and prostitution in a comprehensive way.</p> <p>Using police data, researchers examined 65 known brothels in Bristol over two years, a figure which is a fraction of the true total, and interviewed more than 100 officials from the police and supporting agencies.</p> <p>The report criticises the failure of local police to protect vulnerable sex workers, quoting one source saying that organised crime in the sex trade is \u201ctoo hard [to tackle] for the amount of harm it causes\u201d, while admitting that operations against brothel owners are rare.</p> <p>The findings come shortly after the conviction of Christopher Halliwell for the murder in 2003 of 20-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/23/becky-godden-case-shines-light-on-issue-of-uks-missing-women\" title=\"\">Becky Godden, a Swindon sex worker</a>, a development that has prompted debate about the ability of the police to provide sufficient protection to sex workers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/383764/Modern_Slavery_Strategy_FINAL_DEC2015.pdf\" title=\"\">cost of tackling trafficking for sexual exploitation in the UK </a>is estimated to be \u00a3890m a year, but the study highlights a near absence of proactive police strategies. \u201cOccasional welfare checks were completed at brothels by a local police team and partners, but sex workers rarely came forward,\u201d it states.</p> <p>\u201cConsequently, there were few calls to respond to and little information to direct more proactive policing efforts.\u201d It says that police welfare checks at brothels are \u201csporadic and not core business for any local agency\u201d.</p> <p>Researchers say police, whose organised crime work is primarily focused on theft and drug-related offenders, did not apply a rigorous approach to the issue. \u201cWhile one or two officers had attempted to scan online ads for the threat of exploitation, this was not done systematically or regularly,\u201d the report states.</p> <p>Sex workers most vulnerable to trafficking are those at \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/11/lake-district-pop-up-brothels-human-traffickers\" title=\"\">pop-up brothels</a>\u201d, which constitute up to a fifth of the number identified and move location frequently. Almost half of the sex workers identified in Bristol are Romanian.</p> <p>The combined failure of any agency to take full responsibility for exploitation in the off-street sex trade, the Police Foundation claims, is leaving many sex workers isolated and vulnerable to exploitation by organised criminals.</p> <p>\u201cThe relative impunity with which pimps and traffickers operate, combined with the almost total exclusion of many off-street sex workers \u2013 particularly foreign nationals \u2013 from mainstream society, requires a radical reconsideration of what the police and other relevant agencies should be doing,\u201dthe report adds.</p> <p>Overall, the Police Foundation recommends a radical overhaul of local police approaches to organised crime in the sex trade. It urges the police, working with other local agencies, to do more to help victims of exploitation to come forward and offer more protection when they do.</p> <p>The study also outlines a need for police forces to gather more robust intelligence: \u201cThe police and other local agencies need to do more to identify the hidden victims exploited in the off-street sex market and facilitate investigations for which no victim comes forward.\u201d</p> <p>Although the buying and selling of sex is legal in Britain, pimping and running brothels are illegal. The International Union of Sex Workers, a trade union affiliated with the GMB, advocates complete decriminalisation as the only way to ensure that sex workers have the full protection of the law.</p>",

As I see it, it\u2019s not so much that I am leaving the Labour party (as I may well be after more than 30 years if Jeremy Corbyn is elected leader) as that the Labour party has left me.</p> <p>If I needed any further confirmation of Corbyn\u2019s unsuitability as leader, his childishly sarcastic comments on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p048bnl5\" title=\"\"><em>Today</em> programme</a> the following day were enough to convince me that this is someone completely out of his depth.</p> <p>Please do not publish my name or contact details. I am still a Labour party member and have no wish to have a backlash from any of the small but vociferous (and downright unpleasant) members who attack anyone not supporting Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Now over 60, I have been a Labour member and supporter since I started full-time work. When I have had the spare time to be an activist, I have always taken a two-track approach to membership. On the one hand, I have argued in whatever constituency party I have found myself, for a more leftwing approach to policy. At the same time, I have always participated in elections and other campaigns for Labour candidates regardless of their political position in the party.</p> <p>Barbara Ellen does not understand the Labour party. It has always been a coalition between socialists and social democrats with widely differing viewpoints. Both sides have been wrestling for control over decades.

The problems with Corbyn\u2019s leadership aren\u2019t the invention of a hostile media. In my younger, redder days, I believed that qualities of \u201ccompetence\u201d and \u201ccredibility\u201d were some sort of elitist ploy, words invented by Tories to discredit any leftwing political project. It isn\u2019t just Corbyn\u2019s gaffe-strewn tenure that convinced me otherwise, but the collapse of John McDonnell\u2019s economic advisory committee.</p> <p>And yet, for all this, the anti-Corbyn opposition, \u201cthe 172\u201d \u2013 Labour MPs who voted they had no confidence in the party leader \u2013 have no positive alternative, least of all Owen Smith, a man who spends lonely nights worrying that his choice of coffee mug isn\u2019t proletarian enough.</p> <p>Broad swaths of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) failed to realise that the attempt to unseat Corbyn in the wake of the EU referendum felt like a direct attack on the membership. No one could reasonably expect the bulk of party members to rally around a candidate standing because the electorate couldn\u2019t be trusted to vote properly the first time. It gave members the feeling that the contest was one between rank-and-file and party elites; or youthful optimism and jaded cynicism. This only solidified pro-Corbyn opinion among potential waverers.</p> <p>So if you can\u2019t remove Corbyn through official channels, the only option left is to persuade members with reasoned discussion, right? Wrong, apparently. A better strategy is to wage a low-intensity war against anyone of vaguely leftish sympathies within the party. Re-tweeted the Greens? The procedures committee will show you the door. This sort of antagonism is proven electoral poison.</p> <p>As someone long on the left of the party, I would have been amenable to an alternative candidate who engaged with me on an intellectual level. The problem with this isn\u2019t that it hurts my feelings \u2013 nothing compared with the abuse decent MPs have received at the hands of some on the left \u2013 but that it exposes the intellectual poverty on the right of the party. I voted for Corbyn the first time round because I feared that Labour, and social democracy, faced an existential threat.</p> <p>Pasok, PSOE, Labour in Scotland: traditional socialist parties in Europe, shorn of their traditional support bases seemed vulnerable to populists on left and right. No one on the right of the party has properly addressed this, instead offering a rehashed vision of \u201997 .</p> <p>I felt Labour needed a way of tapping into popular anti-elitism with a progressive, socially just programme, rather than one that made weak, mug-based overtures to controlling immigration. With no one on the Labour right or left offering a credible alternative to Corbyn, the only choice we have is to cooperate, to find grounds for compromise with the bulk of the PLP, and to work for a Labour victory in 2020. I can\u2019t help but feel a twinge of sadness that this, the greatest opportunity for real political change in my lifetime, is all being squandered.</p> <p><em>Alex Hacillo is 24, and joined the Labour party in Liverpool in 2010</em></p> <h2>Isabel Hardman: stop all the bickering and start the long walk to power<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007/0_749_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Hardman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opponents now have a long time to answer two big questions.

They have twice boasted they wereable to do this before the 2015 and 2016 contests \u2013 and twice miserably failed.</p> <p>The party is becoming less and less attractive a prospect for anyone with a decent perspective on life and interesting hobbies to give up their spare time and money to attend vitriolic branch meetings. Indeed, it\u2019s not just a question of finding new members, but trying to stem the exodus of existing ones.</p> <p>The second question concerns how to heal the divide between centrists and soft left. Moderates are offended by the way Owen Smith and his soft left comrades have explicitly blamed the Blairites for the turmoil in the party, suggesting that things were fine until they started whingeing. Both sides need to put aside their personal gripes with one another, otherwise the walk back from the wilderness will take even longer as everyone bickers about the directions.</p> <p><em>Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator</em></p> <h2>Kerry-Anne Mendoza: it\u2019s time to end a toxic coup and resume the party\u2019s core mission<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3bea8c3c78021bdcf074d31ab7cc4d00a58ba1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3bea8c3c78021bdcf074d31ab7cc4d00a58ba1c/0_1637_3181_1909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry-anne Mendoza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Labour is having a moment of reckoning.

Now.</p> <p>The country is crying out for the kind of vision and values that set a road map to a better future.

The wasp, after drilling an ovipositor into its hapless victim, will lay its eggs inside the caterpillar\u2019s body; the larvae, when they hatch, will then devour their host\u2019s bodily fluids. Taking great care not to damage its vital organs, they will also mind-control it, so that the caterpillar, even after the larvae have erupted through its exoskeleton, continues to defend them as they pupate. Eventually, the wasps hatch. The caterpillar, meanwhile, is left to die.</p> <p>Such is the fate that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s re-election as leader seems to portend for the Labour party. The hard left faction that has seized control of Britain\u2019s main progressive party has every prospect now of devouring it inside out. That this is bad news for anyone who wants to see a Labour government goes without saying.</p> <p>Among the numerous reasons why the incompetent, incurious and pharisaical Corbyn will never be prime minister, the most copper-bottomed is surely this: that British voters will never elect as their leader a sympathiser with the IRA. Corbyn himself can blame this on false consciousness all he likes. If he genuinely cared about securing a Labour victory at the next election, he would have stood down long ago.</p> <p>The reason that he has not, I can only assume, is because - like the zealot he is - he believes in a higher cause. Bad for Labour, and bad for those who would best be served by a Labour government, Corbyn\u2019s re-election is bad as well for the very fabric of our parliamentary democracy.</p> <p><em>Tom Holland is a journalist and author</em></p> <h2>Eliza Filby: centrists should help themselves by taking a long look in the mirror<br></h2> <p>The one standout moment in this tiresome leadership campaign was when Owen Smith asked Jeremy Corbyn to name how many seats Labour would need to win back in order to form a majority government. Corbyn got the answer wrong. It was perhaps symptomatic of the fact that Corbyn may offer a genuine alternative to Labour members sick of centrism but he does not currently offer a credible alternative to the electorate. The British state is about to undergo its biggest overhaul since 1945; this requires an opposition that does not simply oppose but effectively scrutinises.</p> <p>In order to do this, Labour needs unity, ideas, organisation and competence; all of which this leadership is completely lacking. Corbyn now has three options: purge the party of dissenters, push for unity between MPs and party members, or alternatively try to find agreement on key issues (at least on Labour\u2019s Brexit policy). The first option seems depressingly likely, the second depressingly unlikely, and the third the most sensible. A separate Labour party in Scotland also presents problems as well as opportunities.</p> <p>So, what now for Labour centrists? They may choose to sit and wait for Corbyn to fail. But by then it might be too late and a split inevitable. Collaboration with Corbynistas might be too hard to stomach and impossible to maintain. One thing that centrists could do is stop blaming Corbyn for everything and take a long look in the mirror. The foundations of leftwing centrism have completely crumbled and fresh thinking is required.</p> <p>What should be at the forefront of their minds for both MPs and members is the future of the Labour voter. Ukip will redouble its efforts in Labour heartlands and, with the possible resurgence of the Lib Dems and the strength of the SNP, Labour MPs of all shades might find there is no longer a loyal electorate on which they can draw.</p> <p><em>Eliza Filby is the author of God and Mrs Thatcher</em></p> <h2>Neil Kinnock: do not desert the only party that can deliver social justice<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d390c6acb01b1cdc81aa448626ca8d7d198861f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d390c6acb01b1cdc81aa448626ca8d7d198861f/0_1694_3992_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Kinnock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Countless conversations in communities of all kinds in the past year tell me that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/im-taking-my-vote-elsewhere-if-corbyn-wins\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> columnist Barbara Ellen last week </a>spoke for many who react to the current Labour leadership, and some of its followership, with an intention to leave the party and even stop voting Labour.</p> <p>I plead with them to do neither. I urge them to understand that the only people pleased \u2013 and strengthened \u2013 by their departure would be those who provoked them, in despair and anguish, to go. I ask them not to give the Labour party to such people but to stay in the party and to keep on voting Labour. Despite the political tunnel vision and self-indulgence of the current leadership, Labour is still, to borrow Ellen\u2019s words, the \u201cpolitical entity conceived to provide parliamentary representation (and therefore protection) for the most overlooked and vulnerable people in society\u201d; it still needs broad support to secure elected power at local and national levels; it is still the only \u201cpolitical force\u201d that can credibly offer the social justice essential for a productive and equitable country.</p> <p>In a previous existential crisis \u2013 in the 1930s \u2013 the Labour party declared that \u201cthe victory of ideals must be organised\u201d. It is an abiding, inescapable truth. Many democratic socialists would, like me, appeal to all to stay, to organise, and to uphold the reality that only a Labour party that again makes a wide electoral appeal can feasibly earn the parliamentary power to combat the huge injustices and inefficiencies of gross and growing inequality, underinvestment and underperformance.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t an easy course.

We\u2019ve been hearing about globalisation, digitalisation and automation for decades, but the left still hasn\u2019t found a politics to match its challenges.</p> <p>With the leadership election now over, Labour should set about finding one, because if it doesn\u2019t this time there may be no way back for the party if voters in this country decide it hasn\u2019t got any answers.</p> <p><em>Dreda Say Mitchell is an award-winning crime novelist</em></p> <h2>Sue and Jennie: we\u2019re feeling despondent \u2013 and politically homeless<br></h2> <p>Between us we have 100 years on the electoral register, voting Labour every time.

  "<p>The BBC\u2019s coverage of the EU referendum was highly regarded by the critics who matter most to us: the public. Our audience research shows that the BBC was the most trusted reporter of the referendum. In fact, our scores for trust rose as the campaign progressed. Complaints were low. And more than 90% of people in the UK<strong><em> </em></strong>came to the BBC during the campaign for the news. That said, there have been two strands of criticism of our coverage. On the one hand, some Leavers have said the BBC reported impartially and accurately through the course of the campaign, but, since the vote of 23&#xa0;June, we have returned to what they say are our true EU-luvvie colours and our reporting of the prospects for Brexit Britain has been gloomy or hysterical.</p> <p>On the other, some Remainers have complained that we have been too impartial \u2013 that our unthinking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/bbc-impartiality-skewers-evidence-based-facts\" title=\"\">insistence on balance</a> meant we treated Remain and Leave arguments with equivalence, giving the same treatment to respected experts as to know-nothings and lightweights. Worse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/29/tvs-failure-to-properly-scrutinise-boris-johnsons-eu-claims-a-criminal-act\" title=\"\">the criticism has gone</a>, we abandoned our duty to inform the public: the Leavers\u2019 exaggerations, distortions and downright lies, they say, were given the same airtime as the Remainers\u2019 evidence-based judgments. Impartial reporting, this argument goes, is contributing to the problem of post-truth politics.</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss these critics as regular BBC bashers or sore losers. But the BBC has no business being complacent. It is worth making a few points that, I hope, show that we are alive to our critics.</p> <p>The Leavers\u2019 complaint will, in no small part, be answered by what happens next and how we report it. The fact is that, since the EU referendum, there has been a revaluation of sterling, the Bank of England cut interest rates because it says the outlook for economic growth has weakened markedly and the government\u2019s plans for Brexit are unclear. But consumer confidence has bounced back and manufacturing and services sectors have rebounded accordingly. In the months ahead, our job is to understand what Brexit actually means \u2013 without relish or alarm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The BBC was abundantly clear that the overwhelming weight of expert economic opinion advised people to vote Remain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Remainers who grieve at the result have blamed the BBC. But they know that the BBC did not choose to hold the referendum, frame the question, decide the timing of the vote, agree the reform package with Brussels or set the terms, tone and talking points of the campaign. Nor was the BBC responsible for the approach of the big political parties to the campaign. Labour chose to operate separately from Stronger In. Downing Street refused to send out Conservative cabinet ministers to rebut arguments made by prominent Tory Leavers live on air, because they insisted that \u201cblue on blue\u201d arguments would turn the national debate into a Westminster soap opera. Unsurprisingly, the BBC did not carry water for the government: our job is to challenge politicians, not to serve as a rebuttal unit or advocate the alternative argument.</p> <p>One other point: inasmuch as the EU referendum was about the economy, it was about forecasts more than facts. It was not a contest of hard truths but an argument over whose predictions of the future you preferred. The BBC was abundantly clear that the overwhelming weight of expert economic opinion advised people to vote Remain. But the BBC, at all times, should be open to those who may challenge a consensus \u2013 not all such opinions stand the test of time. (And, for the avoidance of doubt, that does not mean any crank heretic can come along and think they can take a pop at a point of historical, scientific or social fact.)</p> <p>The fundamental charge \u2013 that BBC reporting resulted in a false balance in which fanciful claims got the same billing as serious insights \u2013 is not true. We were keenly aware of this risk, precisely because the BBC had been so roundly criticised by the scientific community over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/02/mps-criticise-bbc-false-balance-climate-change-coverage\" title=\"\">climate change</a>.</p> <p>For the uninitiated: \u201cfalse balance\u201d means thinking wrongly that you have to give pro and anti equal airtime, regardless of the facts, editorial judgment and the expertise of the interviewee. The BBC\u2019s rules are clear. We have to deliver \u201cdue impartiality\u201d and \u201cbroad balance\u201d, terms designed to ensure that we are free to make judgments on the validity of stories, that we challenge facts and figures, that we acknowledge that different people speak with different levels of authority on a subject.</p> <p>The editorial guidelines that we spend a great deal of time thinking through make clear that balance is not measured with a stopwatch. So, if you go back, you will see that the squeakier claims made by politicians were challenged again and again by our presenters and correspondents. Go back and look at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380980\" title=\"\">Evan Davis take on Douglas Carswell</a> over the claim that voting Leave would bring \u00a3350m a week back into UK coffers; watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-on-question-times-eu-referendum-special-the-verdict\" title=\"\">David Dimbleby take on Michael Gove</a>\u2019s dismissal of the IFS; read what <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36073201\" title=\"\">Reality Check said about George Osborne\u2019s forecast</a> that voting Leave would cost each home \u00a34,300; watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSQT7QnbWI\" title=\"\">Andrew Neil pick apart Nigel Farage\u2019s numbers</a> on immigration.

No one who watched the BBC during the campaign could have been left in any doubt that President Obama, the governor of the Bank of England, the IMF, OECD, IFS, CBI, prime minister, chancellor and, yes, both David Beckham and Jeremy Clarkson believed Britain should remain in the EU. People who voted out made up their own minds and did so knowing that all those people thought it was a bad idea. If some people who believe in the benefits of EU membership think they lost the referendum because their case was not sufficiently heard on the BBC, I can\u2019t help feeling they may be missing the point of the 52%. It is impossible to generalise on what 17.5&#xa0;million voters were saying, but it was a vote for a change.</p> <p>We plainly do not get everything right. We make mistakes and, I hope, move quickly to grip them. More than that, there is a real issue about how newsrooms can get beyond the noise to the news. This means thinking differently about reporting stories, the resources we put into data analysis, and the prominence we give to context. But no one wants paternalistic news. The BBC\u2019s job is not to preside over the democratic process \u2013 it is to report, to host the argument and to interrogate the participants. We aim to inform our audiences, not seek the approval of politicians or pundits. That is what we sought to do in this difficult and contentious contests. And it is what we continue to do.</p>",
  "<p>Mollycoddled and cosseted or stressed and over-pressured. Energised and engaged or bored and turned off. Young people have so many labels and stereotypes slapped on them it\u2019s a wonder these are not visible on their endless selfies. What is undeniably true is that the evidence suggests that rates of depression, self-harm and anxiety among young people are at unprecedented levels.</p> <p>Youth unemployment is <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05871\" title=\"\">more than 13%</a>, the cost of higher education is rapidly rising, a drought of affordable housing coupled with low pay is keeping many young people sealed under the parental roof and trapped in what one report called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/22/young-people-living-in-a-suspended-adulthood-finds-research\" title=\"\">suspended adulthood</a>\u201d. The ubiquity of the internet and social media, with its dark underbelly of hardcore pornography, body shaming and cyberbullying, is encroaching on their wellbeing, while a relentless focus on academic high-achieving is turning up the pressure in the classroom. Youth, traditionally thought of as the most enviable time of life, can now look like a deeply challenging and sometimes unpleasant time of life.</p> <p>But is the experience of adolescence \u2013 defined as the period after childhood, from puberty to maturity \u2013 any tougher now than it was for previous generations? And when does it stop, given that some experts argue that full intellectual maturity is reached at the age of 27.</p> <p>Among the events planned for <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/world-mental-health-day\" title=\"\">World Mental Health Day</a>, an exhibition by a small but successful charity in London aims to unpick some of the issues around the \u201clived experience of adolescent development\u201d. <a href=\"https://opendooronline.org/\" title=\"\">Open Door</a> has helped thousands of young people with therapy and support with problems including depression, anxiety, self-harm, drug and alcohol misuse, eating disorders, psychosis, sexuality and gender identity issues since it opened in 1976.</p> <p>The exhibition, Adolescence Then and Now, marks the charity\u2019s 40th anniversary, and director Julia Britton, one of the capital\u2019s leading consultant child and adolescent psychotherapists, says demand for its services is greater than ever. \u201cWe are operating with a constant waiting list of around 100, we can\u2019t even meet local demand. Parts of the country have nothing at all for young people with mental illness. The lack of provision is a huge issue for now, and a huge issue being stored up for the future.\u201d</p> <p>She says many of the issues facing young people have not changed. \u201cI look at myself as a teenager in the 1970s and so many issues were around: teen pregnancies, drug and alcohol misuse, psychotic breakdowns, financial and identity pressures. But there are many differences, too. The context certainly is different. I think there are far more pressures educationally, more sense that it\u2019s all hinged on one exam, and certainly teachers are hugely concerned about the mental distress they are seeing. Then there\u2019s cyberbullying where you can\u2019t switch off and you can\u2019t get away. Pornography, a normal part of development, is now very far removed from <em>Playboy</em>. A lot of young people are disturbed by what they see online.</p> <p>\u201cThe internet is both helpful and not. If young people type in \u2018self-harm\u2019, they can either go to a Young Minds website where they will be offered help and support, or to a destructive group which is discussing how to self-harm and hide eating disorders. So it\u2019s good and bad,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The sense of a struggling generation has undoubtedly taken on new dimensions. Last week a poll by the charity <a href=\"http://www.youngwomenstrust.org/\" title=\"\">Young Women\u2019s Trust</a> found that \u201csuspended adulthood\u201d was affecting the mental health of one in three 18-to-30-year-olds who felt worried about the future and under financial pressures due to low pay and lack of work or opportunities. More than half of the 4,000 surveyed were having to live at home with their parents.</p> <p>\u201cMake no mistake,\u201dsays Dr Carole Easton, chief executive of the charity, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about a generation of young people in crisis. It is not in any of our interests to write off an entire generation.\u201d</p> <p>Abena is 18. A former mental health service user at Open Door, she interviewed artist Grayson Perry in a video project for the coming exhibition. They discussed the contrasts in their teenage experiences. He told her: \u201cMy family was quite screwed up, it was quite a volatile household and quite scary.\u201d In 1976 Perry was 16 and had already been thrown out of his home by his stepmother over his transvestism: \u201cWhen I was that age you hung out on the village green and got bored with others. I had low impulse control, I was incredibly angry until I went into therapy.\u201d</p> <p>What most struck Abena, she says, was that, while his cross-dressing was a major taboo and so a pressure point for him as a teenager, \u201che doesn\u2019t remember having any issues over his body image at all. He doesn\u2019t remember having a conversation about body image. But he remembers trying to keep his dressing-up from his parents and how everybody thought transvestism was very strange and taboo. That identity didn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>\u201cNow I think that would be far more acceptable and people would be quite relaxed about that. But I feel like there are very real pressures around body image now that he didn\u2019t have. Having social media now, it\u2019s real pressure around how you look, making sure every picture is perfect,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cSo the pressure he had then isn\u2019t what we have now, but we have other ones. And it all depends on where you go in the world. I\u2019m a black woman, but that would be a very different issue if I was living in America, for example. As a young person now I don\u2019t drink very much, but I\u2019m going to university where there is a real culture of drinking heavily and I find that really daunting. I\u2019ll be in a minority, and being in a minority can be very uncomfortable,\u201d says Abena. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d have gotten through my bad times, to be honest, if I hadn\u2019t been able to access Open Door. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have coped on my own. All the worries I had which felt too big to say to teachers or even my family, I was able to say there. It felt like home.\u201d</p> <p>Leigh Wildman, a therapist and support worker for young people with special needs, is 54. \u201cI often wonder about whether I\u2019d be on computer games if I\u2019d been a teenager now instead of climbing trees, kicking a tin can down the road and making camps as we did then. Then later on there was music, of course, counter-culture music and art which rescued me. I left school at 15, but in those days you could go round the industrial estate and get a job and I did lots of jobs before taking off hitchhiking round Europe when I was 18,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum was pleased, but I feel young people today are much more fearful. They stay at school longer, at home longer, and the world looks very daunting. They have to knuckle down at school and there\u2019s no space to be light-hearted or to drift a little, to find out who they are, what kind of people they like. I had time for that, and I\u2019m very glad I did,\u201d adds Wildman.</p> <p>Another teenager, a client at Open Door, is Elena, 17. She says all her friends at school suffer panic attacks and anxiety: \u201cIf you drop grades a bit, you feel a failure, you feel the teachers immediately ignore you for the people who are high achievers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you have to be this robot. I think it\u2019s harder now in terms of all the pressures to look a certain way and keep up with everything, and I think it\u2019s harder in terms of trying to speak to your parents or people at school who are not trained because when they were growing up mental health was not something anyone spoke about.\u201d</p> <p>And she adds: \u201c I\u2019d cry in the classroom a lot at school, but teachers would just be a bit uncomfortable and you\u2019d not want to open up. I\u2019d just say I was having a bad day. I feel a lot more hope for the future now than I used to. I never used to think there was a future for me.\u201d</p> <h2>CHANGING TIMES</h2> <p><strong>Television</strong></p> <p><strong>1976</strong> Around 93% of homes own a television. <strong>2016</strong> Young people spend more time online than watching TV.</p> <p><strong>Pop scandals </strong></p> <p><strong>1976</strong>: Sex Pistols prompt a media storm by swearing live on Bill Grundy\u2019s TV show.</p> <p><strong>2016</strong> Kanye West faces a backlash after calling Taylor Swift a bitch in a song lyric.</p> <p><strong>University</strong></p> <p><strong>1976</strong> Around 14% of people go to university. <strong>2016</strong> Around 40% of England\u2019s school-leavers go to university.</p> <p><strong>Youth unemployment</strong></p> <p><strong>1976</strong> 9.1% of UK men and 8% of UK females aged under 20 are out of work. <strong>2016</strong> 13.6% of UK 16-24-year-olds are unemployed.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d John McDonnell inquired softly as he passed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/13/jeremy-corbyn-victory-draw-line-under-infighting\">John Woodcock</a>, the Labour MP for Barrow and Furness, and a chief critic of the Corbyn project. The shadow chancellor touched Woodcock\u2019s arm, as a small gaggle of reporters lingering in the exhibition hall looked on. \u201cI\u2019m serious \u2013 let\u2019s have a cup of tea soon,\u201d added McDonnell. Woodcock meekly agreed. He gave a thin smile as McDonnell moved on. \u201cThat\u2019s the first conversation the two of us have had where voices weren\u2019t raised,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The MP looked sick to the stomach.</p> <p>The last three months have been bruising for those involved in or cheering on the Owen Smith campaign. Their man has been heckled, ridiculed and even accused of misogyny. The Labour leadership candidate, popular among his colleagues, was regularly booed by party members as he appealed for votes during official hustings. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-election-result-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-appeals-for-unity-politics-live\">final result announced</a> to the half-empty conference hall in Liverpool was definitive. Corbyn won among the full members, the registered supporters and the union affiliates. His 61.8% share of the vote (313,209 votes) was a significant improvement on last year\u2019s tally.</p> <p>There were few MPs sitting among the audience in the dimly lit hall. Fewer still had a smile on their face as Corbyn\u2019s triumph was announced and the Labour leader took to the podium to address the party and call for unity. Regrettable things had been said, Corbyn told members, as his stony-faced deputy Tom Watson watched on from the front row, next to Labour\u2019s under-fire general secretary Iain McNicol. The slate was wiped clean \u201cas far as I am concerned\u201d, Corbyn added, before taking a swipe at the alleged purge of some of his supporters over comments made on Twitter. \u201cMy responsibility as Labour leader is to unite this party,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also the responsibility of the whole party.\u201d</p> <p>In July, McDonnell had told friends in the Corbyn campaign that he feared Smith was picking up some momentum; that the MP for Pontypridd\u2019s support in south Wales could be harvested and that Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour party was slipping away. Saturday showed that this was never actually the case. For all the attacks on Corbyn by the most senior figures in the parliamentary party \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/senior-labour-figures-warn-of-party-breakup-and-urge-corbyn-to-go\">including the previous leader, Ed Miliband</a> \u2013 the MP for Islington North\u2019s position was not really under threat. Sources close to the Smith campaign said they had wanted a long campaign to introduce their candidate to the membership. \u201cBut the membership that has joined since 2015 is a Jeremy Corbyn fan club,\u201d said one. \u201cIt was pointless. They weren\u2019t interested.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74ecb09446c13f1a6717242bc274b3f40b730128\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74ecb09446c13f1a6717242bc274b3f40b730128/0_265_6989_4194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A T-shirt showing Jeremy Corbyn's face\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Corbyn supporter with a T-shirt showing the Labour leader\u2019s face at The World Transformed, a festival organised by the Momentum movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em> shortly after the result was announced Corbyn wasn\u2019t in any mood to dress it up. \u201cIt is a vindication,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a mandate last year. Yes there was a challenge, yes we have had an election. The participation is even higher and my majority is bigger and the mandate is very strong.\u201d</p> <p>What now for his critics?</p> <p>It is, perhaps, an indication of how weakened the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) has become that the only fight left is for the election of the shadow cabinet by MPs. The argument goes that senior figures need to be allowed to return with dignity, and that the shadow cabinet should therefore be chosen by MPs rather than comprise Corbyn\u2019s own picks. \u201cThe only way to regain the confidence of MPs is to show a willingness to compromise,\u201d said the former shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander. \u201cA new top team, elected by the PLP, will give MPs a respected team around which to coalesce.</p> <p>\u201cHe must also respect and have confidence in that team. As shadow health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/heidi-alexander-attacks-john-mcdonnell-labour-nhs-policy\">my work was undermined on more than one occasion by the shadow chancellor John McDonnell</a> \u2013 and I know it was the same for other colleagues,\u201d she added. \u201cThat kind of behaviour has to stop \u2013 it\u2019s destructive and it is not the kind of platform or approach members would expect.\u201d</p> <p>The newly empowered Labour leader\u2019s response has been to say that the party will decide on shadow cabinet elections in time \u2013 but has mooted there should be a role for the membership in choosing the shadow team too. \u201cWith this huge membership, that has to be reflected much more in decision making in the party,\u201d Corbyn told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cI recognise that to be successful the party has to reach to all sections and I will do that. They [the MPs] also have to reach out to understand that we have this enormous party membership. They are the people that raise the money, knock on doors, deliver the leaflets, do the campaigning work,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McDonnell suggested that there might have to another special conference at some point in the future to discuss such matters. For her part, the shadow health secretary Diane Abbott questioned the motives of MPs demanding PLP control over the makeup of the shadow cabinet. \u201cSome of these people are saying \u2018I want a mandate\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cA mandate for what? A mandate to criticise Jeremy day and night? If people are coming in with goodwill, they will be welcomed but what I think party members don\u2019t want is ongoing internecine warfare \u2026 If you look at some of Jeremy\u2019s fiercest opponents in the party, their local parties nominated Jeremy. What MPs have to do is start listening to party members.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c48582e407b4ebdd917b92cb941e926c06d52f5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c48582e407b4ebdd917b92cb941e926c06d52f5e/125_111_4175_2505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell embraces Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corbyn is congratulated by shadow chancellor John McDonnell after the leadership result.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the continuing wrangling, a return of the big hitters of the former frontbench \u2013 including Alexander, former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell, former shadow housing secretary John Healey and the former shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer \u2013 seems unlikely.</p> <p>It is against that backdrop that a party within the Labour party could be in the process of forming.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-leadership-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54fx5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2746904\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn wins Labour leadership election - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e66580e4b0831a51401dec\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/24/160924CorbynWins_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/24/160924CorbynWins.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/24/160924CorbynWins_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-leadership-election-video\">Jeremy Corbyn wins Labour leadership election</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A memo circulating among MPs, drawn up by Ed Miliband\u2019s former director of strategy Tom Baldwin, lays out the unpalatable options now facing rebel MPs and suggests a way out: \u201cWe can anticipate some face-saving formula,\u201d reads the memo, which has been seen by the <em>Observer</em>, \u201cin which Corbyn promises to listen to the PLP a bit more and, in return, MPs will be expected to express public loyalty to the leadership until the next election, to rule out another challenge, to make themselves available for shadow ministerial jobs, as well as agree in advance their full support for whatever policy programme emerges from the policy process.</p> <p>\u201cThose who refuse to meet this list of expectations will face the threat of deselection with the explicit or implicit backing of the leadership.\u201d</p> <p>It adds: \u201cThis will present a terrible dilemma to many members of the PLP. To agree to the expectations of the Corbyn leadership would mean spending the next four years saying something which their colleagues, commentators and informed members of the public would know to be untrue. They would have no personal credibility.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, it is suggested, a team of spokesmen in areas such as \u201cmigration\u201d and \u201clearning\u201d should emerge \u2013 called the 2020 group \u2013 which would be able to set out an alternative set of policy positions to the leadership, while avoiding any kind of formal split.</p> <p>\u201cThe stated goal of the group would be to develop the analysis, ideas, stakeholder networks and public support that can contribute to Labour winning the next election and becoming a successful and progressive government,\u201d says the memo.</p> <p>Meanwhile in conference corridors, there is already conspiratorial talk of challenging Corbyn again in a year or 18 months. It already looks doubtful that Saturday\u2019s most definitive of results has really settled anything at all.</p>",
  "<p>Trust \u2013 or rather, the absence of it \u2013 stands suddenly top of journalism\u2019s talking shop. Gallup in the US releases another of its annual polls that shows trust in the mass media \u201cto report the news fully, accurately and fairly\u201d has dropped to its lowest level in polling history \u2013 with only 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of such confidence.</p> <p>Those findings are down eight percentage points from last year. Compare and contrast a whopping 72% trust rating on parallel Gallups in 1972, opinions sampled directly after the Watergate heroics: different reputations, different times.</p> <p>And as for Britain, the ambitious director of the Impress regulation project has been setting out his stall recently. \u201cThe press is sitting on a trust timebomb,\u201d claims Jonathan Heawood. He cites Ipsos Mori results showing that a mere 25% of the UK public trust journalists to tell the truth \u2013 and he produces wider European research to reveal that we\u2019re flat bottom for reverence right across the continent. \u201cOnly 22% of the British public say they tend to trust the press, the lowest rating in Europe. 73%, nearly three-quarters of the public, say they tend not to trust the press, the worst trust rating by a long way \u2013 beyond Greece on 65%, and Serbia on 63%\u201d.</p> <p>Impress, naturally enough, doesn\u2019t let such disquieting perceptions lie. It contrasts newspapers\u2019 ratings\u2019 mire with the somewhat higher confidence levels that broadcasters enjoy. Why? Because they\u2019re monitored by Ofcom rules on evidence checks, fairness, balance and the rest \u2013 an underlying ring of confidence. And now, Heawood claims, the press and attendant websites can choose the same higher ground \u2013 by signing up for Impress regulation and displaying its \u201ctrust mark\u201d on their front pages.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not wander too far into the rivalry between Impress and the Independent Press Standards Organisation for custom post-Leveson charter protection (by one group that Ipsos Mori finds even less beloved: politicians). Simple issues can get very misty on that road. Trust itself, though, is an issue that can\u2019t be avoided.</p> <p>Does it matter? Of course it does \u2013 especially to many journalists. Trust is their obvious key to self-esteem. It says what they do is appreciated and respected. And there\u2019s some occasional evidence of reality here: see the swell of interest in serious newspaper sales and websites in moments of electoral or referendum crisis. But don\u2019t get carried away.</p> <p>Codes and kitemarks of purity are only a tiny piece of this equation. The same public opinion survey Impress commissioned and relies on begins by pointing out that regulation \u201cis not a particularly salient topic and there are generally low levels of engagement with the issue of press misconduct\u201d. Ipsos Mori, one bad news bearer, can\u2019t find room for post-Leveson reform in its list of the top 36 issues facing Britain.</p> <p>No, the problem doesn\u2019t start in newspaper offices or television studios. It\u2019s outside in the wider world. Last week, one major US poll reported that 44% of voters under 35 are choosing to vote for the Libertarian candidate, who hadn\u2019t heard about Aleppo, or the Green nominee. If Trump wins, in short, it will reflect millennial anger over and apathy towards Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Does that remind you of a Brexit result that saw too many young voters stay at home? Or the Brexit surge from voters who did turn out far below the metropolitan media radar? Has a notably antagonistic US posh press dished Trump\u2019s chances?</p> <p>More immediately this weekend, whatever happened to the stop-Corbyn surge in the press and on TV? You can unload many doubts over Labour and Momentum. You can run twin exposures back to back on two different TV channels. But, curiously, very little seems to bite.

  "<p>Perry, a five-year-old African grey parrot, is for sale on a well-known pet trade website for \u00a3750. She looks in good condition with her large black bill, red tail and white mask and her owner says she can whistle the tune of Flower of Scotland, does a passable imitation of R2D2 and is \u201cvery clever and funny\u201d.</p> <p>What Perry\u2019s Scottish owner does not tell prospective buyers is that the African grey is close to extinction in the wild largely because of the international pet trade.</p> <p>Although there have been restrictions on the export of these small and intelligent birds since 2009, dealers pay a pittance for tens of thousands of them to be trapped every year in the rainforests of west and central Africa and smuggled out.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to catch them, say researchers from <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Birdlife</a>, a global grouping of conservation groups. A team of hunters will use decoys or go to the birds\u2019 water and mineral licks in the forests where flocks gather. They then throw nets over them and take dozens at a time.</p> <p>Once caught they will be smuggled over borders, stuffed in tiny cages and flown illegally to Europe, South Africa, the Middle East and China, where they may fetch up to \u00a31,000 each. All this makes the African grey probably the most highly traded bird in the world, causing their numbers to plummet from Nigeria to Cameroon, and from Ivory Coast to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Nine African states, the European Union and others will ask world governments and EU at the triennial meeting of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/7-billion-people-how-protect-wildlife-endangered-species\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) in Johannesburg</a> to give the highest international protection to the bird. But it is far from the only species whose future hangs in the balance and whose fate could be determined at this year\u2019s meeting. The Cites convention, signed by more than 180 countries and the EU, is the best hope the world has of stemming the growth in the \u00a3150bn a year wildlife trade and of reversing catastrophic animal and plant losses.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of a surge in African elephant and rhino poaching, and continuing deforestation and habitat losses, governments will come under intense pressure in Johannesburg to increase protection for many hundreds of endangered species. Ministers will hear from scientists, technical experts and conservationists that the fate of wildlife is at a crossroads, with populations crashing and a slow-motion extinction taking place.</p> <p>The precipitous decline of the African grey echoes what is happening to hundreds of other plant and animal species, including the African elephant, the tiger, rosewood trees, pagolins, banggai cardinal fish and many others, say conservationists.</p> <p>Last month the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) revised its animal danger lists. Sixty-eight species are said to have become extinct in the wild; 5,107 are critically endangered; 7,600 are endangered; and 16,000 are \u201cvulnerable\u201d or \u201cthreatened\u201d.</p> <p>Within a human generation, the meeting will hear, species such as the African elephant, tiger, gorilla and lion could be on the verge of extinction in the wild as a result of illegal hunting, habitat loss and the pet trade. The trade in illegal ivory has more than doubled since 2007.</p> <p>\u201cAfrica\u2019s overall elephant population has seen the worst declines in 25 years, mainly due to poaching over the past 10 years,\u201d the IUCN\u2019s director-general, Inger Andersen, will say. \u201cTheir plight is truly alarming. Poaching has been the main driver of the decline, while habitat loss poses an increasingly serious, long-term threat to the species.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a340216eb91cf6969244f9a68e2a34dc3e806d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a340216eb91cf6969244f9a68e2a34dc3e806d35/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old African elephant bull with a broken tusk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The trade in ivory has attracted the opposition of Prince William, who has has lobbied President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping to take action against it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beverly Joubert/Getty Images/National Geographic Creative</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cites protects about 5,000 animal and 30,000 plant species, and ministers will be asked to change the protection status of more than 500. Some, like the lion, African elephant and pangolin, are high profile, but many reptiles, coral and fish, such as the banggai cardinal fish, are barely known.</p> <p>Nearly all the 62 proposals put forward by governments will be to increase protection. But a few species, like the panda and peregrine falcon, are no longer considered to be in danger and could have their protection reduced.</p> <p>Many countries will be admonished for allowing the illegal trade in animal parts and plant species to flourish. Laos has pledged to phase out its controversial tiger farms, which supply neighbouring China with bones and other parts for traditional medicine. But international animal trade inspectors will report in Johannesburg that rhinoceros horn, elephant ivory and many other wildlife specimens are being regularly smuggled through the country both to China and other south-east Asian countries. \u201cLaos is being targeted by organised crime groups as a transit point,\u201d says wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic. \u201cNo arrests or prosecutions related to illegal trade in rhino horn, elephant ivory and other wildlife specimens have occurred in the country since 2012. Significant loopholes still exist in national legislation.\u201d</p> <p>South Africa, the host country, is certain to be embarrassed, having lost nearly 6,000 rhinos to poachers since 2007, including more than 700 this year. Vietnam will be told to crack down on its rampant illegal rhino horn trade or face sanctions, and China will be identified as the world\u2019s primary destination for precious woods.</p> <p>\u201cVietnam\u2019s poor law enforcement record speaks for itself; ending the illegal rhino horn trade and helping to save Africa\u2019s rhinos is clearly not a priority for the government,\u201d said Ginette Hemley, WWF\u2019s head of delegation to Cites.</p> <p>\u201cWith around three rhinos being poached each day, there is no time to lose. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/total-ban-ivory-disastrous-elephants-legalise-it\">Cites must take a tough line with Vietnam</a>: swiftly implement critical measures to tackle the illegal rhino horn trade or be banned from legally trading many wildlife products,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"157d44996af7a501655df82788b840e241018696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/157d44996af7a501655df82788b840e241018696/0_262_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The future of the rhino is also hanging in the balance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The future of the rhino is also hanging in the balance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Minihane/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chinese consumption will be blamed for the plight of the tiger but also for the loss of west African forests.

It is some of the world\u2019s poorest peoples who will suffer when their natural resources are stripped from them illegally and brutally,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week Joanna Lumley weighed in to voice dismay at a proposal at Cites to allow the trade of horns from rhinos that have died from natural causes, or recovered poached horns. \u201cThis iconic species should not be reduced to a commodity that can be plundered for human indulgence,\u201d said the actress.</p> <p>Since the last meeting, in 2013, governments, too, have found a new reason to crack down on wildlife crime. According to the London international affairs thinktank Chatham House, wildlife crime can lead to international terrorism, and the destabilisation of vulnerable democracies. The Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabaab is said to generate its funding from illegal ivory sales.</p> <p>But everyone knows that the international trade restrictions which Cites can impose on countries are limited and nowhere near enough to stop the \u00a3150bn a year trade. The measures, say conservationists, are complicated, difficult to enforce, do not take the place of national laws, and are implemented in different ways by different countries.</p> <p>Moreover, court fines are nowhere near enough to deter poaching or smuggling. The street value of ivory is now more than \u00a31,500 a kilogram in Beijing, and rhino horn can sell for \u00a350,000 per kilo \u2013 far more than the price of gold or platinum \u2013 on the Chinese black market. Meanwhile rosewood can sell for many thousands of pounds a cubic metre.</p> <p>The UN environment programme says that 88 countries must strengthen their laws if they are to implement Cites decisions and combat illegal trade in wildlife. Many, including Bolivia, Guinea-Bissau, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritania and Mozambique must to do it urgently, says the UN body.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45d02113ff6efed34e38c520472cfd6c6d72f000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d02113ff6efed34e38c520472cfd6c6d72f000/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild, Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Johannesburg on September 24, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists demonstrate against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild, Fauna and Flora (Cites) in Johannesburg on September 24, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Animal welfare groups say that Cites pays no attention to the treatment of animals. \u201cEvery year it rubberstamps the trade in thousands of live animals from Africa, but corruption and a complete disregard for the wellbeing of these animals means that most will suffer mistreatment, and many will experience unimaginable cruelty during their capture and transport,\u201d said David Barritt, Network for Animals\u2019 chief campaigner.</p> <p>\u201cInternational trade bans are critical to saving wildlife, but without rigorous efforts to prevent poaching and trafficking they are never enough on their own. Organised criminal networks will continue to target threatened species, as we have seen with rhinos, elephants and tigers,\u201d said the WWF.</p> <p>The Johannesburg meeting will be the largest ever, with more at stake than ever before, said John Scanlon, Cites secretary-general. \u201cCites is critical to fight the illegal trade in wildlife. Thousands of species are internationally traded and used by people in their daily lives for food, housing, healthcare, eco-tourism, cosmetics or fashion.\u201d</p> <p>If countries agree to protect the grey parrot, either by consensus or by a two-thirds majority, an outright ban will be placed within 90 days on its international trade. It would also mean that all owners in Britain and elsewhere will have to register their birds.</p> <p>The exotic pet trade, which has powerful political support in many tropical countries, will lobby, but with backing for a total trade ban also likely from Washington and Brussels the parrot is almost certain to join 1,000 other species, such as tigers, rhinos and gorillas, on what is known as Cites Appendix I, the list of most endangered species. If it stays on Appendix II, which includes sharks, polar bears and lions, some limited trade will continue to be allowed.</p> <p>\u201cCites has remarkable power. It is a pragmatic and honest convention. Discussions can be robust and intense. If there is no consensus on a request, it goes to a vote. The stage is set for a remarkable two weeks,\u201d said Scanlon.</p> <p>But whether Cites really saves the African grey parrott, the pagolin and the rosewood tree from vanishing is far from certain.</p> <h2>African lions</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7905e67647cd16fc62324a2eb816784628b9cb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7905e67647cd16fc62324a2eb816784628b9cb4/0_0_5899_2770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lioness and adolescents lying down in Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"470\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Numbers of lions in west Africa have declined by about 60% in the last 20 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anup Shah/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many west African countries are seeking a total ban on the commercial trading of lions.

Countries that promote trophy hunting will object to an upgrading of lions\u2019 protection.

The silky shark, three species of thresher shark and nine species of mobula ray could all be put on Appendix II for the first time because all are said to have seen declines of more than 70%.</p> <h2>African elephants</h2> <p>Countries will consider several proposals to clamp down on the ivory trade, destroy stockpiles, close legal domestic ivory markets, restrict live animal exports and create a mechanism for a future ivory trade. Currently, all African elephants are included in Appendix I, except for those in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, which are in Appendix II. One contentious proposal from Namibia and Zimbabwe seeks to move the populations of all four countries to the most stringent Appendix I level. Along with South Africa, they also propose to adopt a mechanism to permit commercial exports of ivory from lesser protected Appendix II range states. Conservation groups were encouraged this month when the IUCN World Conservation Congress voted by a 90% majority to pass a resolution urging countries to close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw or worked elephant ivory. Last week Britain pledged to ban all domestic trade in ivory that could not be at least 70 years old.</p> <h2>White rhino</h2> <p>Swaziland has submitted a highly controversial last-minute proposal to be allowed to sell its stockpile of around 330kg of valuable southern white rhino horn and some 20kg annually from animals that died naturally. The proceeds from a one-off sale to traditional Chinese medicine hospitals would, it says, raise nearly $10m which, placed in an investment fund, could earn enough to pay for conservation and cover the $2m annual costs of running the country\u2019s three national parks. It argues that the 39-year-old worldwide ban on the sale of horn has clearly not worked, with more than 1,200 rhino killed a year in Africa, and that there is little likelihood of demand in China reducing. Far better, it says, to strictly control poaching and to trade judiciously with selected partners. The proposal has dismayed conservationists, who say that the animals are critically endangered and that any legal trade would provide cover for poaching and undermine existing international and domestic bans.</p> <h2>Pangolin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca1e1f45a937c57f1c4986753920c7164b6b7fad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca1e1f45a937c57f1c4986753920c7164b6b7fad/0_0_3771_2263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pangolin searching for ants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The critically endangerd pangolin is poached for meat and its scales and skin, which have become luxury fashion materials.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These burrowing, armour-shelled anteaters with sticky tongues are critically endangered and ranked as the world\u2019s most hunted mammals, with possibly a million illegally poached in the past 10 years for their meat, plus their scales and skins, which have become luxury fashion materials.

Moulty hurt his hamstring when he stood on his child\u2019s toy.</p> <p>\u201cSo that was a worry all week, but he declared fit this morning after a fitness test. But that\u2019s why we took him off. So there was that, \u2013 and the first half we weren\u2019t connected \u2013 and didn\u2019t have the team performance we had of late.\u201d</p> <p>The Thistle manager, Alan Archibald, rued the missed chances to finish Motherwell off. \u201cWe controlled the first half and created a number of chances, but at the moment we look like we need to score two goals to win a game,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating. Motherwell came out in the second half and probably controlled the midfield for 10-15 minutes, but in that time we had two very good chances. If we take one then the game\u2019s dead and buried. But every team you play will always create a chance.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ross County</strong> held Hearts to a 0-0 draw at Tynecastle. Hearts dominated the contest before and after the break, but County had their goalkeeper, Scott Fox, to thank after he made two good first-half saves from Tony Watt and Conor Sammon. Hearts lacked the cutting edge to win the contest. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/celtic-kilmarnock-scottish-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">The draw means Hearts slip further behind the leaders, Celtic, after the champions\u2019 win against Kilmarnock</a>.</p> <p>In the Championship, <strong>Queen of the South</strong> retain top position after a 0-0 draw with <strong>Hibernian</strong> at Palmerston Park. Neil Lennon\u2019s side had to play the majority of the second half with 10 men after Lewis Stevenson was sent off for a second yellow card with 55 minutes played.</p>",

Throughout Arsene Wenger\u2019s time as manager, Arsenal v Chelsea has been a reliable mismatch. For the first eight years, Arsenal always beat Chelsea; for the last 12, since Wayne Bridge Night at Highbury, Chelsea have been specialists in Arsenal.</p> <p>Even last season, when Chelsea were fifty shades of shambles, Arsenal lost home and away to them. They haven\u2019t scored a single league goal against Chelsea in the last three seasons. But, as Johan Cruyff didn\u2019t say, in every negative there is a positive. If Arsenal beat Chelsea today, it will empower them significantly and leave them with one fewer demon to exorcise if they are to win one last title under Wenger.</p> <p>The mutual loathing of these sides is driven largely by their distinct identities. This season, however, they have plenty in common: five games, 10 points, plenty of late goals and a reality check at home to Liverpool. We aren\u2019t much the wiser as to whether they are serious title challengers; today\u2019s match should give us a few more clues. Or Chelsea might just beat Arsenal on autopilot again.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 5.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T15:32:43.576Z\">at 4.32pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

In a speech which conveyed notably more confidence and authority than the one he delivered after his victory last year, he appealed for unity, saying it was time to wipe the slate clean. He also used a phrase, \u201cmore in common\u201d, coined by Jo Cox, the Labour MP killed in the summer who had been one of his critics. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Elections are passionate and partisan affairs things are often said in the heat of the debate on all sides that we later regret.</p> <p>But always remember in our party, we have much more in common than that which divides us.</p> <p>As far as I\u2019m concerned the slate is wiped clean from today.</p> <p> We are proud as a party that we\u2019re not afraid to discuss openly, to debate and disagree that is essential for a party that wants to change people\u2019s lives for the better that isn\u2019t prepared to accept things as they are</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn has said that \u201clots of MPs\u201d are now willing to support him ahead of compromise talks which may thrash out a deal that could lead to shadow ministers who resigned because they had lost confidence in Corbyn agreeing to work for him again</strong>. Around 60 shadow ministers resigned over the summer; a few have indicated publicly that they would be willing to return to the front bench, but many are still resisting. The party\u2019s national executive committee is meeting this evening to discuss the impasse. Corbyn wants the dissidents to return to the front bench so he can run an effective opposition in parliament. His critics want him to agree to shadow cabinet elections. As the Herald\u2019s <strong>Kate Devlin</strong> reports, MPs are under pressure not to go back until Corbyn has compromised.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/_katedevlin/status/779638486727098368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What happens now?

But I do not understand how almost an entire generation of mainstream Labour MPs can throw their hands up in horror at the prospect of trying to recruit more members than a far-left fringe that has just emerged from the woods.

He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you will see a sense of unity around the party.

And that\u2019s just what we are going to be doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if he was referring to MPs, he said he he was talking about \u201clots of MPs\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that there would be \u201ca lot of changes\u201d to party rules being proposed soon.</strong> This is what he said when asked if he would introduce shadow cabinet elections.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a need to strengthen the democracy within our party. We are a party of more than half a million members, and so there has to be a discussion about democracy in the party. And that includes the proposal for elections to the shadow cabinet. That is absolutely in the mix. That is what we are discussing at the moment with colleagues in parliament, with the parliamentary committee and with many others on the national executive committee. So I think you will see a lot of changes over the next few weeks.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He played down the prospect of MPs being deselected.</strong> Asked why he would not rule out deselections, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not my decision on who is selected for a place or not. I am not a leader who imposes things on constituencies. The new boundaries will probably come in in 2018 ... Obviously all sitting MPs go automatically on the the shortlist. And I hope the local parties will recognise that and support them. </p> </blockquote> <p>In the past, while not actually encouraging deselections, Corbyn has pointed out that the boundary changes will lead to new selections taking place. Today, by saying that he hoped local parties would support sitting MPs, he sounded more keen to quell concerns about MPs being deselected than he has done in the past.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e68f02e4b0f55a9f402d2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T14:35:10.806Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/779645918232604676\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Statistic of the day is that Owen Smith got more votes than Ed Miliband did six years ago.<br><br>Smith, 2016: 193k<br>Miliband, 2010: 175k</p>&mdash; Jim Pickard (@PickardJE) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/779645918232604676\">September 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e68d65e4b03598d1ce8336\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T14:30:03.637Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Further to his earlier tweet (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-election-result-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-appeals-for-unity-politics-live?page=with:block-57e685d2e4b0831a51401e7d#block-57e685d2e4b0831a51401e7d\">3pm) </a>ITV\u2019s <strong>Chris Ship</strong> has posted another one saying that, when Jeremy Corbyn talked about a shadow cabinet reshuffle happening \u201cimminently\u201d, he did not quite mean imminently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/779685511548002304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Been given some guidance on what Jeremy Corbyn meant by &#39;imminent&#39; positions to Shad Cabinet in my interview.

Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>MPs could say they\u2019re overturning the vote of no confidence for two reasons: firstly, to accept the democratic decision of the membership, but secondly, in exchange for concessions. These concessions would be conciliation with Corbyn opponents (making a distinction between the irreconcilables from the critics), as well as a strategy for winning a general election (or, frankly, avoiding a disastrous rout). Mandatory reselection should continue to be opposed by the leadership (it is unlikely to be endorsed by the NEC, in any case) and the existing arrangements for selections after the boundary changes should be maintained. Some believe that this is waving a white flag of surrender. But if MPs believe that they will be deselected \u2014 which they may think is inevitable however they behave \u2014 it won\u2019t force them into line: they will simply have no incentive whatsoever to cooperate. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e67222e4b0f55a9f402cac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/anushkaasthana\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T12:32:53.528Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong>\u2019s analysis of the election result.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-leadership-win-shows-labour-is-now-a-changed-party\">Corbyn leadership win shows Labour is now a changed party</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One other piece of evidence that will be raked over by the \u201cmodernisers\u201d who wanted to topple Corbyn is a Yougov \u201cexit poll\u201d of the election, commissioned by the psephologist Ian Warren.</p> <p>The poll predicted that Corbyn would win by 59% - reasonably close, although slightly below Corbyn\u2019s actual result.

(A more detailed set of figures may be released later.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Jeremy Corbyn has increased his majority and his grip on the party is getting stronger</strong>. The number of people voting was just over 80,000 higher than it was in 2015, and so the key figure to look at is percentage of first-preference votes. Last year Corbyn got 59.5% of first-preference votes when he was up against three candidates, Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall. This year he got 61.8% of the votes. That is not a dramatic increase, but it is an increase. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn has a clear majority with all three groups voting in the contest.</strong> Last year he had had an overwhelming lead amongst registered supporters and affiliated supporters, but amongst members he only had 49.6% of first-preference votes, meaning that Burnham/Cooper/Kendall beat him collectively. (Admittedly, if Kendall\u2019s votes had been re-allocated, he might have crept over the 50% threshold on the second round.) This time Corbyn won 59% of the members\u2019 votes. That probably reflects the extent to which the party membership has changed, with Corbyn supporters joining after his election last year and those opposed to him leaving. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn again was best at getting registered supporters to back him, but he did not win amongst this group as overwhelmingly as he did last time.</strong> In 2015 Corbyn was much better than other candidates at actively recruiting registered supporters and he won by 84% in this category. This year he won with 70%, reflecting the fact that this year Corbyn\u2019s opponents made an active effort, through groups like Saving Labour, to get their own people to sign up. The fact that people had to pay \u00a325 to be a registered supporter, not \u00a33, may also have deflated Corbyn\u2019s support a bit.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn\u2019s support amongst affiliated supporters (union members) was up, but not by much, from 58% to 60%.</strong> This group may have been the most stable of the three groups in the selectorate (ie, least changed from 2015). There was some anecdotal evidence in the spring suggesting that some people who backed Corbyn in 2015 were starting to have doubts about him. If so, it is possible that any loss he suffered in support may have been outweighed by people rallying to him because they disapproved of the actions of those MPs plotting against him.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T17:10:36.956Z\">at 6.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e663c1e4b03598d1ce8291\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T11:34:25.250Z\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Owen Smith says he will 'reflect carefully' on what role he will play with Labour in future</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Owen Smith </strong>has issued a statement about the result. I can\u2019t find it on the web, so here it is in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to congratulate Jeremy Corbyn on his clear win in this leadership contest. There is no doubt that the Labour party has changed under his leadership, he has mobilised huge numbers of people over the last 12 months, many of whom are here at Conference in Liverpool, and he deserves the credit for that, and for winning this contest so decisively. </p> <p>I am humbled by the more than 193,000 members, supporters and trade union members who have put their faith in me and I want to say a big thank you to them. It has been a privilege to meet so many of you, who have given so much of your lives to Labour, and I promise to continue to work for what we all believe in. It has been a huge honour for me to stand for leader of our great party and I am also deeply grateful to my Parliamentary colleagues for nominating me. </p> <p>I entered this race because I didn\u2019t think Jeremy was providing the leadership we needed, and because I felt we must renew our party to win back the voters\u2019 trust and respect. However, I fully accept and respect the result and I will reflect carefully on it and on what role I might play in future to help Labour win again for the British people. </p> <p>I have no time for talk of a split in the Labour movement - it\u2019s Labour or nothing for me. And although today\u2019s result shows that our movement remains divided, it now falls primarily to Jeremy Corbyn, as Labour Leader, to heal those divisions and to unite our movement. We have to turn round our dire opinion poll ratings and take on this right wing, failing Tory government. Jeremy has won this contest. He now has to win the country and he will have my support in trying to do so.</p> <p>Above all, despite present divisions, we have to stick together in for the long term. I call on those party members disappointed by the result and tempted to look elsewhere to stay with Labour and to stay involved. Let\u2019s work together to renew this movement and take the fight to the Tories.</p> <p>I want to say thank you to my campaign team, and particular my wonderful campaign chairs, Kate Green, Heidi Alexander, and Lisa Nandy.</p> <p>I want to thank Iain McNicol, the Labour Party staff and ERS who have all worked tirelessly and professionally during this contest.</p> <p>And, most importantly, I want to thank my family who have made huge sacrifices for me during this campaign and in recent years. I\u2019m going to be at Conference today and tomorrow before returning home to Wales to spend some precious time with them. </p> <p>Thank you.</p> </blockquote> <p>During the election campaign Smith repeatedly said he would not take a job in shadow cabinet if Jeremy Corbyn won.</p> <p>But his line about about he will fully accept the result and \u201cwill reflect carefully on it and on what role I might play in future to help Labour win\u201d suggests that he might be willing to change his mind on this.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e66016e4b03598d1ce827e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T11:16:00.787Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are the percentages.</p> <p><em>Members</em></p> <p>Corbyn: 59%</p> <p>Smith: 41%</p> <p><em>Registered supporters</em></p> <p>Corbyn: 70%</p> <p>Smith: 30%</p> <p><em>Affiliated supporters</em></p> <p>Corbyn: 60%</p> <p>Smith: 40%</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e65dece4b03598d1ce8274\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T11:08:33.746Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Voting figures in detail</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are the voting figures in detail.</p> <p>How members voted</p> <p>Corbyn: 168,216</p> <p>Smith: 116,960</p> <p>How registered supporters voted</p> <p>Corbyn: 84,918</p> <p>Smith: 36,599</p> <p>How affiliated supporters voted</p> <p>Corbyn: 60,075</p> <p>Smith: 39,670</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/labour/giv-1406xhZ2SjRRSFqB/\" data-alt=\"Leadership results\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/labour/giv-1406xhZ2SjRRSFqB/\">Leadership results</a> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T11:49:52.381Z\">at 12.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e65d98e4b0831a51401dc0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T11:05:00.755Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are more of the election statistics.</p> <p>Eligible votes - 654,006</p> <p>Votes cast - 506,438</p> <p>Spoilt ballots - 1,042</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e65bfee4b0f55a9f402c4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T10:59:54.805Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says Theresa May\u2019s government is not a new government; it is a new version of David Cameron\u2019s rightwing government.</p> <p>He says school segregation is wrong.</p> <p>He says poverty levels are unacceptable.

Many of Jeremy Corbyns\u2019s supporters believe that the party bureaucracy has been actively trying to help Owen Smith by excluding potential Corbyn voters, and even<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/corbyn-investigating-claims-leadership-contest-is-being-rigged\"> Corbyn has suggested that this could be happening.</a></p> <p>Labour officials do not accept this and earlier this month they released figures apparently showing that only a tiny fraction of the selectorate were being excluded by the national executive committee panels that have been vetting voters to make sure they support Labour values. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/3107-people-purged-from-labour-leadership-election-nec-figures-show_uk_57d079a6e4b0d45ff870bc34\">Only 3,107 people, or 0.48% of those entitled to vote, had been \u201cpurged\u201d, Labour said.</a></p> <p>But this figure ignores two other categories of people who have excluded from voting.</p> <p>1- Around 130,000 people who joined Labour after 12 January were not allowed to vote because the party imposed that date as a cut-off point. Technically these people have not been \u201cpurged\u201d because they are still party members, and some of them will have paid the \u00a325 to vote as a registered supporter. And it is not unusual for parties to impose a cut off point for voting in a leadership contest, to stop last-minute entryism. But a six-month cut off is unusually long - in the Conservative leadership contest the equivalent period was three months - and when the national executive committee took this decision, it was widely interpreted as an anti-Corbyn move.</p> <p>2 - Around 50,000 registered supporter applications were rejected for technical reasons. This does not mean that these people were \u201cpurged\u201d, because the Labour party says the applications were invalid in the first place. And some were multiple applications, meaning we are not necessarily talking about 50,000 individuals. But the scale of the exclusions has made Corbyn supporters suspicious. This is what Labour said in August explaining why 50,000 applications were rejected.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are currently approximately 129,000 registered supporters who will be able to vote in this contest. Out of the 183,000 applications to become a registered supporter (at a one off payment of \u00a325), over 50,500 were rejected for technical reasons such as:</p> <p>\u00b7 Duplicate applications \u2013 for example, a number of people hit refresh multiple times on the final page or submitted a number of applications (for example, one person applied 117 times). These people were charged just once.</p> <p>\u00b7 People whose payment failed and who didn\u2019t get back in touch with us by the deadline (Wednesday 27 July at 5pm).</p> <p>\u00b7 People who failed the electoral register check (once appeals are dealt with the main reason for these failing are due to people being under 18 years old or living abroad).</p> <p>\u00b7 People who are already affiliated supporters or eligible members.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e3e71de4b0fcb95da8f899\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T09:50:29.867Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier I posted some pictures from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign.

It has become commonplace to point out that Michael Foot thought he might win the 1983 general election because of the vast crowds turning up to his rallies, only to discover on polling day that they were not representative of national opinion.</p> <p><strong>Andy Burnham</strong> made a similar point on the Today programme this morning. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whoever wins needs to be given time to get their message over to the public. That is what you have earned the right to do as leader of the Labour party. However, also it is the case that that leader, whoever it is, has to be able to show progress - progress with the public, progress at local elections, progress in the polls. </p> <p>We cannot measure our success by the size of the membership or indeed the size of the rallies that we are holding. No-one gets the right to take Labour down to a devastating defeat.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2016/09/new-times-john-harris-why-labour-losing-its-heartland\">a New Statesman article this week</a> my colleague <strong>John Harris</strong> also makes a good point about rallies, warning against the \u201cJohn Peel fallacy\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those mass rallies by which Jeremy Corbyn sets such store could be the first stirrings of a social movement, some of which may play a part in an eventual left renaissance. But for now, they say nothing about Labour and the left\u2019s basic predicament. (In its own way, in fact, the idea that they augur well for Corbyn\u2019s electoral prospects is reminiscent of what I call the John Peel mistake. Circa 1969, the DJ wondered why one of his favourite albums was not in the charts: \u201cEveryone I know\u2019s got a copy,\u201d he said. Back came the reply: \u201cNo \u2013 you know everyone who\u2019s got a copy.\u201d)</p> </blockquote> <p>But on the Today programme this week <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> claimed that the huge crowds attending his rallies were evidence that Labour could win a general election and that this would start to show at next year\u2019s local elections. He said tens of thousands of people had attended his rallies over the summer. That showed there was a real \u201cinterest in politics\u201d, he said. The crowds were \u201cpretty diverse\u201d, he went on, and quite different from the sort of people who used to turn up to hear him speak before he became Labour leader.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That then becomes, surely, a very strong campaigning basis for the Labour movement, becomes a campaigning factor in towns and cities where there\u2019s never been very much activity before. That does begin to change the debate and national mood. I think you\u2019ll begin to see that play out, particularly in local elections next year and after that.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been at political rallies all my life, of various sorts. What I find exciting and nice, but slightly depressing, is when I know half the people at the meeting I go to. I go to these events all over the country, and some of them, I don\u2019t know anybody. I don\u2019t know anybody at all, and they\u2019re people who come up to me who say \u2018I\u2019ve never been involved in politics before, I\u2019m interested in what you have to say, because I\u2019m interested particularly in the economic argument that you have to rebalance society away from inequality towards equality\u2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T09:44:52.419Z\">at 10.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e63e93e4b03598d1ce81f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T08:59:44.672Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are two of the Labour stories around this morning that are worth reading.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-results-live-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-poll-incompetent-working-class-voters-a7326486.html\">Joe Watts at the Independent says new polling shows how unpopular Jeremy Corbyn is with working-class voters.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The extent of the challenge facing Jeremy Corbyn if he is named Labour leader has been laid bare by a detailed study showing broad negative views of him among working-class voters.</p> <p>Exclusive BMG Research polling for <em>The Independent</em> reveals almost half of the unskilled workers and manual labourers that Mr Corbyn needs in order to become Prime Minister believe him to be \u201cout of touch\u201d and an \u201celection loser\u201d.</p> <p>More than a third thought him \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cnaive\u201d, with middle-class voters sometimes holding slightly more positive views of the Labour leader.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/i-will-say-and-do-as-i-think-my-job-is-not-to-pander-to-corbyn-hv5nwpw39\">The Labour MP Jess Phillips tells the Times (paywall) that she will not pander to Corbyn if he wins and that she does not think he can win an election.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But she is not going to fall into line behind Mr Corbyn. \u201cNothing has changed.

That would be an even bigger win than last year when Corbyn got 59.5% of first preference votes. A result like this would be a big disappointment for Owen Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary who is challenging Corbyn and who, at the very least, hoped to make a dent in Corbyn\u2019s lead.</p> <p>Last night Corbyn issued a statement appealing for unity.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We must win the next general election so that Labour can rebuild and transform Britain \u2013 so that no one and no community is left behind. We can and must do that together.</p> <p>That includes those who have voted, volunteered and campaigned for Owen Smith.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also claimed that the election campaign had been \u201coverwhelmingly respectful in tone\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This summer, we have had a debate about the future of Labour and the future of Britain. It has been robust, and at times difficult, but it has been overwhelmingly respectful in tone.</p> </blockquote> <p>That will surprise many whose view of the contest has been shaped by the abusive debate on social media. But just as David Cameron once correctly said that Twitter is not Britain, Twitter is not the Labour party either and, as reports like <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n16/tom-crewe/we-are-many\">this one in the London Review of Books</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/sep/22/labour-and-liverpool-the-city-that-reveals-cracks-in-party\"> this one by the Guardian\u2019s Ewen MacAskill</a> point out, the Corbyn supporters attending events generally have nothing in common with the angry Corbynites who have been spewing venom online. (There has also been some online abuse from anti-Corbynites, although generally it has been much harder to find.)</p> <p>But nevertheless the division within the Labour party is real \u2013 quite possibly as deep as it has ever been \u2013 and Corbyn\u2019s appeal for unity seems optimistic, to put it mildly. That\u2019s because Labour increasingly looks like two parties: a leftist Corbyn faction, which is taking over the party at grassroots level and which rejects much of what Labour stood for when it was in office; and a centrist, parliamentary faction dominated by the 75% of MPs who backed a motion of no confidence in Corbyn because they think he is incapable of winning an election. The centrists believe the Corbynites are hopelessly naive, or even malign. The Corbynites think PLP-led Labour is discredited, reactionary, elitist and undemocratic. A marriage guidance counsellor would have given up trying to reconcile these two ages ago, but Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system makes launching a new party pointless and and so these two tribes who despair of each other seem condemned to co-exist.</p> <p>The result of the leadership contest will be announced during Labour\u2019s women\u2019s conference. The main conference opens tomorrow and will run until Wednesday afternoon, when Corbyn will close the conference with a speech.</p> <p>Inevitably the next five days will be dominated by reaction to Corbyn\u2019s likely re-election. It has been said that the 60-odd frontbenchers who resigned over the summer because they lost confidence in Corbyn face a choice of \u201csulk or serve\u201d, and we will start to find out who intends to return to the front bench, and who intends to carry on refusing to cooperate with Corbyn.</p> <p>More generally, by Wednesday we will know whether Labour looks like a party that is beginning to reunite \u2013 or the fractures are continuing to deepen.</p> <p>I\u2019m in Liverpool and I am just heading off towards the conference centre now. I will post again around 9am.</p> <p>If you want to follow or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\" draggable=\"true\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments below the line but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

At the end of an afternoon in which his side squandered a two-goal lead, Christian Benteke\u2019s headed stoppage-time winner for Crystal Palace ensured Sam Allardyce\u2019s successor has taken only one point from six Premier League games.</p> <p>Presented with an awful hand by Ellis Short, Sunderland\u2019s owner who failed to properly address long-standing recruitment needs this summer, it is not Moyes\u2019s fault that his squad is sub-standard and his team already look Championship bound.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/jose-mourinho-wayne-rooney-manchester-united\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho insists there is no problem with Wayne Rooney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Extreme defensive negligence left Sunderland occupying the division\u2019s bottom place and Alan Pardew celebrating a third successive league win. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d said Moyes, not for the first time this season. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d played well enough to be 2-0 up, I was going to take it but we deserve to be bottom because we\u2019re not good enough. We\u2019re not doing enough defensively. It\u2019s our fault. The players need to stand up and take responsibility. It\u2019s not all down to me and my staff; they have to assume some responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>The first half was mainly about sustained Palace pressure, nervous Sunderland defending and unimaginative final visiting balls. Then, suddenly, and completely against the run of play, Jermain Defoe very nearly scored.</p> <p>Defensively suspect but much more impressive going forward, Patrick van Aanholt sheared his way down Palace\u2019s right and his low cross was met by Defoe, whose adroit flick looked destined for the bottom corner before being deflected inches wide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5116972808992a4dc80af7cb53ded7508706bbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5116972808992a4dc80af7cb53ded7508706bbe/0_37_973_584/500.jpg\" alt=\"James McArthur, left, celebrates his goal with his Crystal Palace team-mates at Sunderland.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James McArthur, left, celebrates his goal with his Crystal Palace team-mates at Sunderland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Failing to heed this warning, Palace promptly gifted the former England striker a goal. Under pressure from Adnan Januzaj, Joe Ledley attempted to pick out Damien Delaney with a back pass but miscued horribly, leaving it to fall virtually at Defoe\u2019s feet. Having already outmanoeuvred James Tomkins, Moyes\u2019s prize asset shot low beyond Steve Mandanda\u2019s reach, leaving Ledley staring at the floor.</p> <p>Across in the technical area, Moyes\u2019s expression offered a definition of relief, albeit a tentative and slightly disbelieving one. For once, he had enjoyed a little luck but Pardew\u2019s players might have equalised almost immediately. When Benteke connected with a corner, his ensuing headed flick prefaced Delaney volleying fractionally wide.</p> <p>After being virtually in complete control, Palace were now required to take risks as they chased an equaliser, offering Sunderland counterattacking opportunities along the way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/24/premier-league-swansea-man-city-middlesbrough-spurs-live\">Football clockwatch: Swansea v Man City, Middlesbrough v Spurs \u2013 as they happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From one such break Defoe \u2013 without whom Sunderland really would be sunk \u2013 briefly appeared to have shredded Pardew\u2019s gameplan. No sooner had Mandanda performed wonders to repel one of his shots than Duncan Watmore\u2019s slide-rule pass cued him up once more. This time, Palace\u2019s goalkeeper had no answer to Defoe\u2019s low, 12 yard, finish.</p> <p>Pardew seemed momentarily crestfallen but Wearsiders will not have been entirely surprised to see Palace reduce the deficit within seconds. Endeavouring to block Ledley\u2019s speculative shot, Van Aanholt merely succeeded in deflecting the ball beyond Pickford.</p> <p>With hope rekindled, the visiting manager made an inspired substitution. Zeki Fryers had barely replaced Martin Kelly than his exquisite left-wing cross was met by James McArthur, who headed powerfully past Pickford. Moyes will not have been impressed to note that Van Aanholt was dodged all too easily by the scorer, while Fryers had earlier delighted in side-stepping Javier Manquillo.</p> <p>Palace were not quite done. If Moyes felt reprieved when Andros Townsend cut inside and curled a late shot wide, his afternoon was ruined when Paddy McNair needlessly conceded a free-kick, taken near the corner flag by Lee Chung-yong and, deep into stoppage time, an unmarked Benteke rose imperiously to clinch it.</p> <p>\u201cI was really scratching my head as to how we could get back into it,\u201d Pardew said. \u201cBut our quick response to Jermain\u2019s second goal affected Sunderland\u2019s mentality and it\u2019s become a great day for us.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Manchester City made it a perfect 10 to continue their immaculate start to the season and take their run of successive victories into double figures, with Sergio Ag\u00fcero carrying on where he left off prior to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/pep-guardiola-sergio-aguero-manchester-city-nolito-vincent-kompany\" title=\"\">his suspension.</a> But Pep Guardiola\u2019s side never had everything their own way with Swansea giving as good as they got for an hour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/liverpool-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool\u2019s Adam Lallana inspires emphatic win over 10-man Hull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The turning point was the penalty kick that Neil Swarbrick awarded in the second half, when the referee penalised Mike van der Hoorn for an elbow on Kevin De Bruyne. Van der Hoorn and his Swansea team-mates were bitterly upset with that decision, but television replays suggested Swarbrick made the right call and once Ag\u00fcero dispatched his penalty for his second goal of the match and his 11th of the season City tightened their grip on a terrific game.</p> <p>Swansea, who produced their best performance of the season at a time when their manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/football-rumours-ryan-giggs-to-replace-francesco-guidolin-at-swansea\" title=\"\">Francesco Guidolin, needed it most,</a> had equalised earlier on through an exquisite goal from Fernando Llorente, but it was hard to see the home team responding for a second time.</p> <p>City, instead, added a third, when the rejuvenated Raheem Sterling ran half the length of the pitch before registering his fourth goal of the season.</p> <p>This victory means Guardiola has become the second manager to win his first six Premier League matches, following in the footsteps of Carlo Ancelotti, who did the same thing with Chelsea in 2009, and it promises to be some game at White Hart Lane next Sunday when City take on Tottenham Hotspur in a top-of-the-table match.</p> <p>Some of City\u2019s numbers are extraordinary. They have scored 30 goals this season and Ag\u00fcero now has 28 in his past 27 Premier League matches.</p> <p>There was an air of nonchalance about the way the Argentinian chipped his penalty kick down the middle and it was a sublime first touch that created the space to drill home his first.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43066cd149a3947583592e2df8ebe4d57418642e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43066cd149a3947583592e2df8ebe4d57418642e/0_337_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raheem Sterling scores Manchester City\u2019s third goal to round off another victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Sterling scores Manchester City\u2019s third goal to round off another victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guardiola, however, is far from satisfied with the striker. \u201cCongratulations for his first goal and for the personality for the penalty, he\u2019s scored a lot of goals in the games, so I am so happy for him,\u201d City\u2019s manager said. \u201cBut he knows that I want more. He can play better. He can do other things that is going to help us. I will try to help him to develop his abilities. I want him to be involved in our game, in our process, and keep the ball.</p> <p>\u201cIn the box I cannot help him \u2013 he\u2019s going to help us a lot in the box, he\u2019s magnificent. His first control for the opening goal was outstanding, but I want to help him to be a better player.\u201d</p> <p>The only bad news for City was the sight of De Bruyne pulling up with what looked like a hamstring problem nine minutes from time. By that point the game was over, Swansea\u2019s brave resistance broken by the breakaway goal Sterling scored when he skipped past Kyle Naughton with a lovely stepover before coolly beating the goalkeeper, Lukasz Fabianski.</p> <p>It was a fourth defeat in six league games for Swansea and Guidolin may well struggle to hold on to his job beyond next Saturday\u2019s match against Liverpool, although in fairness to the Italian this was a much-improved display. Playing with the belief that has been so lacking of late, Swansea were excellent for two-thirds of the match as they produced some lovely passages of football and worked tirelessly to win the ball back.</p> <p>Llorente led the line superbly and scored a wonderful goal, his left-foot half-volley arrowing past Claudio Bravo and into the top corner following Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s clever pass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/24/premier-league-swansea-man-city-middlesbrough-spurs-live\">Football clockwatch: Swansea v Man City, Middlesbrough v Spurs \u2013 as they happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ag\u00fcero had opened the scoring four minutes earlier, expertly controlling Bacary Sagna\u2019s pass and turning Jordi Amat in one motion before drilling home.</p> <p>Chances came and went at both ends and Guidolin was right to point out that Swansea had a couple of opportunities to take the lead in the second half, but City were a constant threat going forward with their slick movement and one-touch passing. In the end, though, it was Van der Hoorn\u2019s challenge on De Bruyne that opened the door for Guardiola\u2019s side to restore their lead, with Sterling\u2019s goal ending any hopes Guidolin had of salvaging a point.</p> <p>The Swansea manager described his team\u2019s performance as perfect and insisted he was not concerned about his job. \u201cI do not feel under pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not need to speak to the chairman. If he has to tell me something, it is the easiest thing to do.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp admonished the Kop for singing his name before the conclusion of Liverpool\u2019s previous home game but this time there were no complaints. It was the 82nd minute when Anfield felt safe to salute their manager: their team were coasting 5-1 against 10-man Hull and all had gone brilliantly, devastatingly to plan. Or so it seemed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to criticise but ...\u201d said the Liverpool manager with an apologetic grin. \u201cI think we could have done better in the second half. It was good, but not as good as it could have been. I am really happy and usually I am quite a thankful person. I am really thankful for the first half. We have a lot of things to improve and one is that if you are brilliant you need to be brilliant for 95 minutes. But that is my responsibility and my problem.\u201d</p> <p>Good luck to Liverpool\u2019s opponents when they do reach Klopp\u2019s exacting standards. His team have now scored four times or more in four of their eight matches this season and this rampant, incisive performance ensured a 54th birthday to forget for Hull\u2019s caretaker manager, Mike Phelan.</p> <p>Still \u201cwaiting for answers\u201d from the club\u2019s current owners over the offer of a permanent managerial appointment, he had Ahmed Elmohamady dismissed after half an hour and a long time to wait for that birthday drink.</p> <p>\u201cI will have one,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have one in defeat as well as when you win. I\u2019m not going to pick holes in the team or the players.

There are harsh lessons in football and we have learned some over the last week.\u201d</p> <p>Two James Milner penalties and goals from the impressive Adam Lallana, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Philippe Coutinho took Liverpool\u2019s tally to 24 in eight games. At the corresponding stage of last season, under Brendan Rodgers, they had scored six. Klopp had called for anger from his players and patience from the crowd but there was no examination of the latter as Liverpool took control immediately and a comfortable early lead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3beb80d24b25d575a625905ff10e5deadbaa88b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3beb80d24b25d575a625905ff10e5deadbaa88b/0_74_3551_2132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Lallana celebrates scoring Liverpool\u2019s first goal against Hull in the Premier League match at Anfield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Lallana celebrates scoring Liverpool\u2019s first goal against Hull in the Premier League match at Anfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hull set up to stifle Liverpool\u2019s runs from midfield plus the varying threats of Coutinho and Man\u00e9 either side of Roberto Firmino. They were powerless on all counts, even with 11 men. Joel Matip and Coutinho had both missed clear chances before the hosts swept in front with another demonstration of how their understanding in the final third and Lallana\u2019s influence have grown this season.</p> <p>Coutinho was the creator, exchanging passes with Milner on the left and ghosting away from Ryan Mason before feeding Lallana\u2019s run. The England international had work to do but, before Andrew Robertson could intervene, he guided the ball behind the defender and inside David Marshall\u2019s left post.</p> <p>Another flowing, enterprising move ensured there was no way back for Hull with a third of the game gone. Firmino released Man\u00e9 into space and when Coutinho met the Senegal striker\u2019s pass with a powerful drive beyond Marshall, Elmohamady stuck out his right arm to deny a certain goal. The referee, Andre Marriner, had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and showing a straight red card. The Egyptian was heading down the tunnel when Milner tucked his penalty beyond Marshall\u2019s dive to his left. \u201cIt is a sending-off and a penalty,\u201d Phelan accepted. \u201cProbably now there is a mentality that is better to let the ball go in and stay on the field.\u201d</p> <p>Hull were in damage-limitation mode and Liverpool were showcasing long before the interval. Georginio Wijnaldum even had time to nutmeg the referee. Man\u00e9 got the goal his efforts deserved following more good work by Lallana. Spinning away from Mason on the corner of the Hull area, the midfielder picked out Man\u00e9 and he provided a fine finish to beat Marshall low to his right.</p> <p>The visitors grabbed a consolation when Loris Karius, selected ahead of Simon Mignolet in Liverpool\u2019s goal, stayed on his line when Robertson curled a corner in from the left. Wijnaldum, under pressure from the substitute Harry Maguire at his back, was unable to clear with his header and his fellow substitute David Meyler converted with a close-range volley.</p> <p>The comeback always seemed a fanciful prospect and Liverpool restored their three-goal advantage in magnificent style within seconds. Once again Lallana was involved, cutting across the Hull defence and finding Coutinho lurking in the area where he causes most damage. The Brazilian accepted the invitation to beat Marshall with a trademark shot from 25 yards and the home team continued to coast towards a fourth consecutive victory.</p> <p>Lallana received a standing ovation when replaced by Daniel Sturridge and the substitute was quickly involved in the procession, going over Robertson\u2019s trailing leg inside the area and earning Liverpool a second spot-kick. The result was the same as the first, Milner firing low to Marshall\u2019s left, and, as with the game itself, had never looked in doubt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/sunderland-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Benteke strikes in injury time to give Crystal Palace win at Sunderland</a> </p> </aside>",

He was one of the sponsors of the first federal \u201c<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2006/02/21/5168163/partial-birth-abortion-separating-fact-from-spin\">partial birth abortion</a>\u201d ban, which was vetoed by Bill Clinton but passed in 2003 and upheld as constitutional. (He was also one of the impeachment managers in the House, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/pdfs/canady.pdf\">strongly advocating</a> against the president and <a href=\"http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/detail/some-reflections-on-impeachment-remarks-of-congressman-charles-t-canady-to-the-miami-lawyers-division-of-the-federalist-society\">defending the impeachment after the fact</a>.) </p> <p>His other most notable legislative effort involved the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/16/us/house-approves-measure-on-religious-rights.html?ref=topics\">Religious Liberty Protection Act</a>, essentially a conscience clause designed to limit state and local statutes that interfere with people\u2019s free exercise of religion. When civil liberties advocates attempted to insert an amendment that would create an exemption for people using religion as a reason to violate anti-discrimination laws, Canady and fellow Republicans rallied to defeat it. Canady <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/16/us/house-approves-measure-on-religious-rights.html?ref=topics\">told the New York Times</a> he opposed the amendment because \u201cit would establish as a matter of congressional policy that religious liberty would have second-class status\u201d. He denied it was an effort to allow discrimination against LGBT people in housing and employment.</p> <h2><strong>Timothy Tymkovich</strong></h2> <p>A colleague of Gorsuch on the 10th circuit court of appeals in Denver, Tymkovich is another Bush appointee and the chief justice on the court. Prior to that he served as Colorado\u2019s solicitor general, where he <a href=\"http://blogs.findlaw.com/tenth_circuit/2015/10/10th-circuit-welcomes-new-chief-judge-timothy-tymkovich.html\">unsuccessfully attempted</a> to defend the state\u2019s constitutional amendment, passed by ballot initiative, <a href=\"http://web.law.duke.edu/voices/romer\">banning any attempt</a> to legislate against discrimination against LGBT people. The US supreme court ruled against him, <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1995/94-1039\">stating</a> that the codification of discrimination was not a legitimate government interest.</p> <p>More recently, Tymkovich <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/us/justices-take-companies-cases-challenging-contraception-rule.html\">found from the bench</a> that the company Hobby Lobby <a href=\"https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/12/12-6294.pdf\">was a person</a> and thus subject to protection from laws forcing it to violate its religious beliefs: his ruling, which carved a huge hole in the contraception mandate of the Affordable Care Act, was upheld by the supreme court.</p> <p>He has also <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/07/30/supreme-challenge-judge-calls-out-scalia-over-heller-language/\">openly questioned</a> the constitutionality of bans on felons owning firearms.</p> <h2><strong>Amul Thapar</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8da44a0e098a35a2104b4a01db3bcaea7d451ae0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8da44a0e098a35a2104b4a01db3bcaea7d451ae0/0_393_2955_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amul Thapar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amul Thapar seen in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Reinke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first South Asian to serve as a federal appeals or district court judge, Thapar serves as a district (trial) court judge in the eastern district of Kentucky, where he once served as the US attorney. He too was appointed by the second President Bush. </p> <p>Thapar is most famous for <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-nuclear-idUSBREA1H0SS20140219\">sentencing</a> three anti-nuclear activists, including an 84-year-old nun, to three years in prison for breaking into a Tennessee nuclear facility. He should be more famous for <a href=\"http://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/circuit-gives-us-bible-star-trek-and-bourbon-and-really-what-more-is-there-to-life/?rf=1\">an opinion he authored</a> while visiting the 11th circuit appeals court in Florida, in which he threw out the convictions of a group of women charged with fraud for pretending to like men in order to run up their bar tabs. In the opinion, he said that a man gets what he bargains for when he buys a woman a drink: \u201cthe opportunity to buy a young woman a drink\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Federico Moreno</strong></h2> <p>Moreno is an unusual entrant in this list: George HW Bush appointed him to the district court in southern Florida in 1990 and then chose him for the 11th circuit court of appeals in 1992. Senate Democrats, however, never took up his nomination. He is also, in a sea of former prosecutors, a former federal public defender. In the early 2000s, he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/10/business/judge-sides-with-doctors-over-insurers.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=0\">sided with a doctors\u2019 class-action suit</a> against managed care providers, attempting to prove that they had violated federal racketeering statutes. More recently, he <a href=\"http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510651652-airbag-recall-class-actions-to-continue-federal-judge-denies-companies-motions-to-dismiss\">sided with plaintiffs</a> against Honda and Takata in a class-action suit over defective airbags subject to recall. </p> <p>But, like Thapar, as a trial court judge, his job is to preside over cases and not to adjudicate the law itself. His rulings might have no bearing on his legal philosophy.</p> <h2><strong>Robert Young</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/republicans-block-black-votes-fair-judges-crucial\">Republicans keep trying to block black votes.

  "<p>It was all eyes on Hull this weekend with two games widely considered to be Hull FC\u2019s and Hull KR\u2019s biggest in years. Next weekend, though, the stakes will be even higher after 24 hours to forget for the sport in Hull as a whole. The neutral will feel differently.</p> <p>Hull FC\u2019s inability to secure the League Leaders\u2019 Shield on Friday will have no doubt brought joyous, albeit cautious, celebrations from Hull KR fans. But after another dramatic match by the banks of the Humber, just hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/warrington-hull-league-leaders-shield\" title=\"\">Warrington\u2019s 23-6 victory</a> across the city on Friday, both sides play again next week in very different circumstances. For FC there is a spot in the Grand Final at stake at Wigan; for Hull KR, livelihoods, careers and Super League survival are on the line in the Million Pound Game against either Salford or London Broncos next Saturday.</p> <p>It would not have been a victory for Huddersfield\u2019s class of 2016 without drama, though. At the break they led 22-4 and victory seemed inevitable, but a fightback by Hull KR made it 22-22, and if it stayed that way the Robins would have secured the point they needed to seal third place in the Qualifiers.</p> <p>But this was just a fraction of the drama that would follow. The final quarter was a microcosm of an enthralling Qualifiers campaign, with the match decided by the width of a post after a number of close calls for the Giants.</p> <p>With Hull KR pressing late on, after falling behind to what turned out to be a decisive drop goal from Danny Brough, Terry Campese\u2019s audacious effort from 40 metres hit the post. In the final minute a try for Thomas Minns, which would have secured survival for KR, was ruled out after a push on Jake Connor in the buildup.</p> <p>It certainly was not dull, but that will matter little to the Robins, who will now host Salford or London next Saturday in the sudden-death play-off.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s huge relief,\u201d said Rick Stone, the Huddersfield coach. \u201cI knew we\u2019d get another chance at the end, be it just one point, and that\u2019s all we needed. We can start planning for next year now.\u201d</p> <p>For Hull KR, how they pick themselves up after this will be fascinating. Defeat of any kind when a place in the Super League is at stake would be hard to get back up from, but doing it after coming so close survival will be tough.</p> <p>The star for Huddersfield in establishing that first-half lead was their half-back Ryan Brierley. He has found opportunities hard to come by under Stone, but after scoring two tries and creating another for Leroy Cudjoe, the Giants looked in complete control and seemed all but certain to retain their Super League place.</p> <p>The half-time siren was met with boos from the home fans, but the Robins responded well, with tries from Ken Sio, Mitch Allgood and Iain Thornley levelling the scores before the late drama began.</p>",
  "<p>As Burberry models wafted down the catwalk at London fashion week in outfits inspired by Virginia\u2019s Woolf\u2019s <em>Orlando</em>, it wasn\u2019t the ornate drummer-boy jackets and ruff-collared shirts that stole the show.</p> <p>The hottest runway trend was instant shopping, as the British brand turned its catwalk into a living and breathing shop window. Fans were suddenly able to buy the equestrian-inspired leopard-print bridle bags or shearling jackets that previously they could only have coveted on social media straightaway \u2013 albeit for price tags larger than the average monthly mortgage payment.</p> <p>\u201cI think this can be seen as significant in the sense that when Burberry said it was going to do this, it was essentially rewriting how things are done [in fashion] and the point of a traditional catwalk show,\u201d says Graeme Moran, head of content at the fashion-industry bible <em>Drapers</em>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you go back 100 years, catwalks used to be small, private events that brands put on to show buyers, and eventually the press and clients, what they were doing. It can be argued that the catwalk has now become a platform to speak to customers, rather than the industry,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Burberry \u2013 along with brands such as Tom Ford, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, which also proffered their own shoppable runway collections at New York fashion week \u2013 is at the vanguard of what the fashion industry refers to as the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d model.</p> <p>It might not sound like a phenomenon to most people, but this is not how the fashion industry has traditionally worked. There is normally a six-month time lag between catwalk shows and designer clothes arriving in department stores and boutiques around the world. The delay means that fashion editors are usually writing about next year\u2019s shorts and sundresses just as the rest of us are digging out our winter coats.</p> <p>This interregnum also enables nimble high-street chains to piggyback on emerging trends and get cheaper versions of standout styles into store.</p> <p>The backdrop to all this has been the rise of digital media, which has turned runway shows into powerful consumer marketing events that brands cannot cash in on if products have not yet even been produced.</p> <p>Burberry\u2019s chief executive, Christopher Bailey, described the show as a \u201cspecial moment\u201d that was the \u201cculmination of a series of important changes we made, designed to bring our collections closer to our customer.</p> <p>\u201cThe changes we are making will allow us to build a closer connection between the experience that we create with our runway shows and the moment when people can physically explore the collections for themselves,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The usual fashion business cycle sees buyers examining new collections in the wake of the runway show and then placing their orders. But, this year, Burberry let important buyers and press view its new designs back in July, provided they agreed to keep its secrets. Rather than the world\u2019s most beautiful women parading the key looks around the room, it is understood the industry\u2019s power brokers studied mannequins on a rotating carousel in a showroom at its London headquarters.</p> <p>\u201cOur brand is about moving forward,\u201d Bailey told the <em>Financial Times</em> after Monday\u2019s show. \u201cBut we\u2019re testing things out, seeing what we will be able to [do] better in future. We\u2019ve had to look at every facet of the business, from the suppliers, factories, media, every level of the process, to see how it works. And we\u2019ll learn from this and build from there.\u201d</p> <p>Despite its 160 years in fashion, Burberry has not resisted the encroachment of technology. It was one of the first luxury brands to embrace digital and social media, with a ground-breaking runway show streamed on Facebook, as well as YouTube and WeChat.</p> <p>But it may be harder for smaller brands to follow Burberry\u2019s lead. The FTSE 100 trenchcoat maker, which has a market value of around \u00a36bn, is able to shake up its supply chain because it has a lot of control: the company owns a number of factories and has an extensive company-run store network.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"363db9dfc4c4c51029150326b7d2b749e2481a41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363db9dfc4c4c51029150326b7d2b749e2481a41/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Burberry shop in central Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Burberry shop in central Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By closing the time gap and effectively hanging price tags out on the runway, Burberry is primed to cash in on the latent sales potential within the social media buzz. But other brands may struggle to follow suit because of the upheaval involved, says Moran. \u201cAll the brands definitely can\u2019t,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019d spoken to a number of people who said \u2018I\u2019d love to but it just doesn\u2019t work for us\u2019 and others who said \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want that to be how we worked\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cBurberry is a global brand with a huge network of stores and its own e-commerce platform. A small-to-medium-sized brand working from a studio in east London can\u2019t physically do it. Making people change the way they work is only something that brands of Burberry\u2019s influence can do. Burberry has the power to say, \u2018You\u2019re not in charge any more\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Smaller brands have started to test out what this new faster fashion model can do for sales, with British designers Alice Temperley and Oliver Spencer using fledgling social media platform Vero to enable fans of their designs to purchase pieces from their recent fashion-week collections. Temperley, who is on the British Fashion Council advisory board, said the tactic had enabled the brand to get closer to its customers: \u201cThis is a dynamic industry and we need to embrace change.\u201d</p> <p>Vero\u2019s chief executive, Ayman Hariri, says that rather than have an algorithm lobbing ads at its members, users have chosen to hear from brands they like in their news feeds, so companies are pushing on an open door.</p> <p>\u201cWhereas in the noughties the website was the method brands used to connect with their audience, today it is social networks and apps,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018See now, buy now\u2019 is a big step into the future and it will take time for brands to come to terms with it, as it requires a lot of investment ahead of time in order to have the stock ready. Time will tell how it shapes up.\u201d</p> <p>While the Burberry show had a romantic, ethereal quality in keeping with Woolf\u2019s classic novel, the company\u2019s dealings with investors are more down to earth amid tough market conditions. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/18/burberry-cut-jobs-product-range-save-100m-a-year-profit-fall\" title=\"\">profits were down 10%</a> as a result of flagging demand for luxury goods in markets such as China and Russia, and it is cutting costs to improve its financial performance.</p> <p>The point of \u201csee now, buy now\u201d is ultimately to sell clothes and the City will be poring over its next set of figures to get a sense of how far this leap into the unknown has taken the brand.</p> <p>\u201cI think the jury is out on this model, even though the logic is sound,\u201d says Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence, at trend forecaster WGSN. \u201cWhy wait six months to sell your products when you\u2019ve just spent millions of pounds creating a big hullabaloo?\u201d</p> <p>Hall points out that the whole industry has not jumped on the bandwagon, with the major Italian and French labels yet to get involved. \u201cBurberry and Tommy Hilfiger have a position because they are very digitally focused and that has pushed them further into this space than anybody else,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think it will be evolution, not revolution. Everyone will wait and see what kind of impact it has on Burberry\u2019s sales.\u201d</p> <p>Moran confesses that the day after the Burberry show, he popped into a store to try on a shirt that caught his eye on the runway. \u201cI had been hooked in by \u2018see now, buy now\u2019 and went in to try it on \u2013 and it was sold out. I had been sucked in and obviously a number of other people had been, too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When Sports Direct caved in to pressure last week and accepted an external review of how it treats its workers, it was a sweet victory for Janet Williamson.</p> <p>Williamson is head of corporate governance at the TUC and oversees Trade Union Share Owners (Tuso), a handful of union pension funds that got together three years ago to vote for change at companies\u2019 annual general meetings.</p> <p>It was Tuso\u2019s resolution, at Sports Direct\u2019s AGM on 7 September, that called for an independent review of its treatment of workers and corporate governance, and it was backed by a majority of independent shareholders \u2013 so excluding owner Mike Ashley.</p> <p>Ashley had tried to head off unrest by commissioning his own review and a further report by a law firm close to him but to no avail. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sports-directs-biggest-investors-want-independent-review-mike-ashley-keith-hellawell\" title=\"\">Though the vote was not binding, shareholders made an independent review a condition for letting chairman Keith Hellawell remain</a> and on Tuesday Ashley caved in.</p> <p>To get the resolution through, Williamson forged an unlikely alliance \u2013 with City fund managers. Now she wants to build on this success to give unions a lasting influence on how big shareholders treat companies that exploit workers.</p> <p>The <em>Guardian\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\"><em>r</em>evelations about conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse</a> last year had drawn attention to poor treatment of workers at the company, and shareholders, already unhappy about how Sports Direct was run, were incensed.</p> <p>The Unite union had long campaigned against Sports Direct and Tuso held a seminar for investors a year ago on insecure work that used Sports Direct as a case study. After Tuso wrote to leading shareholders asking them to vote against Hellawell at the September 2015 AGM, opposition to the chairman increased.</p> <p>Williamson says: \u201cSports Direct was clearly a company that was on the horizons of investors so we felt there was an opportunity to join forces with them in raising the issues we wanted to raise.\u201d</p> <p>The resolution calling for an independent review of working practices and governance was filed in March, after Williamson scraped together enough shares to get over the minimum threshold. But to have an impact it needed support from City fund managers \u2013 not the most likely of allies for the unions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/unions-seek-city-support-for-review-of-sports-direct-working-conditions\" title=\"\">The alliance was cemented in July, when Tuso met about 30 investors at the TUC\u2019s office in London.</a> Unite presented evidence about Sports Direct and fund managers asked questions. Everyone invited turned up, Williamson says.</p> <p>Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, one of Britain\u2019s biggest fund managers, says: \u201cThe information they shared and put in front of shareholders had a noticeable effect on people\u2019s views on the company and I think it hardened investors\u2019 line on what was needed.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-board-turned-down-chairman-keith-hellawell-resignation\" title=\"\">At the AGM on 7 September</a> the resolution passed \u2013 the biggest-ever vote in favour of a resolution on employment matters at a UK AGM: 57% failed to support the board\u2019s call for shareholders to vote against the resolution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb04fb18bdfec9c2ca1d125aae7a45aada5e5013\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb04fb18bdfec9c2ca1d125aae7a45aada5e5013/0_154_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O\u2019Grady\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances O\u2019Grady: \u2018We are coming for you.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her speech at the TUC conference a few days after the AGM, Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary, said Sports Direct was a warning to others with a \u201cbig brand but a dirty little secret \u2026 we are coming for you\u201d. She promised to win over shareholders, use the courts and persuade customers to get fair treatment for all workers.</p> <p>Williamson says low pay, zero-hours contracts and other employment issues have now shot up the agenda for politicians, shareholders and consumers.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope this resolution will show to companies that if they don\u2019t act responsibly on employment practices they may be the target of a similar campaign; and we hope we have shown to investors the benefits of engaging with us over employment issues.\u201d</p> <p>Now she is picking new targets, which could include retailers, where low pay and poor working conditions are common, and airlines with pilots on zero-hours contracts. Companies that are not publicly quoted, such as \u201cgig economy\u201d businesses and care home operators backed by private equity firms, could also be targeted through their investors, she says.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Sports Direct marks a turning point as a precedent or is just a cause celebre that has fleetingly concentrated the minds of investors, who will accept tough but not terrible working conditions.</p> <p>Aberdeen\u2019s Lee says: \u201cThere may be cases where investors will say: \u2018Yes, we understand that life could be nicer for the workforce but this is the nature of the business and while it\u2019s legal and the company has effective management structures, so that it\u2019s not causing problems with consumers and so on, why would investors intervene to increase the costs of the business?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But Williamson reckons things are changing. In the wake of the Sports Direct controversy, several big employers, including JD Wetherspoon, Greene King and Everyman cinemas have all announced plans to scrap zero-hours contracts this month.</p> <p>Only one City investor, she says, has told her profit is its priority, rather than treatment of workers. \u201cI hope investors who supported our resolution are pleased to have been part of something that is sending a signal that customers, ordinary people, investors and workers will not accept these poor employment practices,\u201d she says. \u201cPerhaps the tide is turning.\u201d</p>",

An autopsy has not been completed. </p> <p>According to initial accounts by the Baltimore County police department, officers were responding to a 911 call placed by Boyd\u2019s girlfriend, Deona Styron. But a lawyer for Boyd\u2019s family, Latoya Francis-Williams, told a different story. She said Boyd called 911 himself because he was feeling disoriented and needed an ambulance.</p> <p>\u201cThey really were supposed to be there to get him to the nearest healthcare facility,\u201d Francis-Williams said.</p> <p>After being questioned on the discrepancy, the police department updated its account, saying: \u201cPolice originally thought the girlfriend was the caller because the information passed on to police from the dispatcher said \u2018female yelling on the phone\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.wbaltv.com/blob/view/-/41784036/data/1/-/10wgqab/-/Tawon-Boyd-police-report.pdf\">the police incident report</a>: \u201cThe call stated that there is a female yelling in the background. 911 added that a female keeps saying \u2018Tell them hurry up\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd repeatedly asked officers to enter his home, the report said, and asked a neighbor to call the police. Boyd told officers that Styron, who lived with him, \u201cgot him intoxicated and is secretly recording him while someone else is in the home\u201d. The author of the police report described Boyd as \u201cconfused and paranoid\u201d. Boyd asked officers to go into the house and find out who was inside.</p> <p>According to the report, Boyd attempted to enter two police cars and then ran to a neighbor\u2019s house and banged on the door, calling: \u201cHelp! Call the police!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was obvious suspect Boyd was under the influence of a narcotic and/or suffering [REDACTED] and needed to be taken to the hospital for emergency evaluation,\u201d the report noted.</p> <p>By the time medics loaded Boyd into the back of an ambulance, he reportedly had physical injuries imposed by officers.</p> <p>The report does not describe Boyd as violent or threatening, saying Boyd seemed to scratch the author\u2019s neck and accidentally kick another officer, named Garland, \u201cwhile trying to stand\u201d. Boyd grabbed a third officer\u2019s face, the report said, describing his hand slipping down to the officer\u2019s badge and microphone. That officer, Bowman, \u201cdelivered two closed fist strikes to the suspect\u2019s face with his right fist\u201d.</p> <p>Francis-Williams said: \u201cHe is literally attacked. And by attacked, I mean the witness [Styron] is describing that he [was] struck many times and struck to the ground. </p> <p>\u201cOfficer Bowman is the one that when he arrived, really started wailing on Mr Boyd, meaning Mr Boyd was on the ground in a prone position and Bowman sat on him, almost straddled his back, and put his left arm under Boyd\u2019s neck and pulled his head up in a choking fashion.\u201d</p> <p>This is not too far from the language used in the incident report, which says \u201cofficers were able to get him under control by using our body weight to keep him on the ground. Officer Bowman controlled Suspect Boyd\u2019s head and arms by holding him down with his arms while [the report author] held Suspect Boyd down by leaning on his buttocks/thigh area with my knees and using my arms.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd\u2019s grandmother, Linda Burch, <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-co-police-fight-20160920-story.html\">told the Baltimore Sun</a>: \u201cI kept telling them stop before they hurt him because I told them they could kill him like that.

Of her own conversation with Styron, Francis-Williams said: \u201cAccording to the witness, Mr Boyd was screaming, \u2018Stop, stop, I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019 That could have been from the choking but at the same time, officer Bowman is punching and striking Mr Boyd in the face and in the neck area. </p> <p>\u201cThe witness described that after a little she\u2019s screaming, \u2018Stop,\u2019 and Mr Boyd is kind of foaming at the mouth or spitting and his body goes limp.\u201d</p> <p>According to the incident report, Boyd became so calm that Bowman \u201casked a medic to check the suspect for a pulse\u201d. The report noted that the \u201cmedics advised that the suspect did have a heartbeat prior to being transported\u201d.</p> <p>The report ends with a redacted list of minor injuries sustained by the officers. Boyd ended up in intensive care. </p> <p>Though an autopsy has not been released, Francis-Williams said there was \u201cswelling on the brain and fluid on the brain because the doctors attempted to drain that.</p> <p> \u201cMy understanding is his kidneys end up failing and at some point, his heart stops,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Police officials said the autopsy report could take as long as a month to complete. </p>",
  "<p>It would be harsh, perhaps, to pin this result solely on the fact Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had decided to remove Wayne Rooney from his starting lineup. If this was the old Manchester United at work, it also looked suspiciously like the old Leicester. Put the two together and it was not just Rooney\u2019s absence that contributed to the reigning champions of England taking such a walloping against a team that would desperately love to go by that title again.</p> <p>All the same, Mourinho\u2019s team selection was fully justified given the margin of victory and that 20-minute blitz in the first half when his side scored all their goals and looked equipped to add even more. It was an exhilarating burst of attacking football and in those moments it was tempting to wonder what must have been going through Rooney\u2019s mind in the dugout. Sir Alex Ferguson has dropped him in the past. Louis van Gaal did the same at Stoke on Boxing Day but never has there been such a sense that United genuinely look better off without the man who has led their attack for the past 12 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/jose-mourinho-wayne-rooney-manchester-united\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho insists there is no problem with Wayne Rooney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His absence coincided with United\u2019s most satisfying result to date in the Mourinho era and it must have pained a player with Rooney\u2019s competitive instincts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/jose-mourinho-drop-wayne-rooney-manchester-united-england\" title=\"\">to be restricted to the role of an 83rd-minute substitute</a>, brought on only because Marcus Rashford had taken a bang. Mourinho preferred Juan Mata in his starting lineup and the Spaniard, operating in the No10 role, scored United\u2019s best goal as well as being instrumental in the part of the match when Leicester were overwhelmed. Paul Pogba put in his best performance since joining the club, including scoring his first United goal, and Rashford continued his fine scoring form. The system did not change but the personnel did and United did not look back after Chris Smalling\u2019s header instigated the kind of Leicester collapse that would have been unimaginable for most of last season.</p> <p>Leicester did save some face with their second-half performance, featuring a splendid goal from the substitute Demarai Gray, but they barely looked recognisable from the side that were taking on all-comers not so long ago and it was a jarring reflection of their deterioration that Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, the two players who shared last season\u2019s individual awards, were substituted at half-time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24d6d0a773cb2416ae66709025ddde2851737e72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24d6d0a773cb2416ae66709025ddde2851737e72/742_138_3978_2387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Pogba peels away to celebrate after scoring Manchester United\u2019s fourth goal of the game and his first for the club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Pogba peels away to celebrate after scoring Manchester United\u2019s fourth goal of the game and his first for the club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ranieri talked afterwards of his players losing \u201cour confidence, our strength, our attention, our concentration\u201d and his team have now lost as many league games as they did all last season. This was their second successive away defeat of this score, having gone a year without a comparable loss, and he must be alarmed, to say the least, by their sudden disorganisation. A side that built its success on teamwork, structure and a rare spirit of togetherness might have to reinvent themselves unless their title defence is to descend into a long old slog.</p> <p>It was certainly unusual, to say the least, to see any side at this level concede three goals from corners. Daley Blind, deputising for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/23/jose-mourinho-luke-shaw-criticism\" title=\"\">the injured Luke Shaw</a> at left-back, took all of them in Rooney\u2019s absence and the tone was set, midway through the first half, when Robert Huth, normally such an imposing presence in his own penalty area, lost the first one in mid-air and Smalling powered a downward header into the net.</p> <p>Pogba\u2019s goal was another unchallenged header from the same route and, by half-time, Leicester\u2019s defenders looked in need of smelling salts. Kasper Schmeichel was badly missed but his deputy, Ron-Robert Zieler, could not be held accountable for the kind of generous defending that left the team so vulnerable.</p> <p>United\u2019s third goal was a case in point. This time, Blind decided against putting in a cross. Instead, he picked out the quick-thinking Mata with a low pass towards the near post. Mata whipped the ball across the six-yard area and Rashford, showing his own speed of thought, dived in to apply the finishing touch without a single Leicester player reacting.</p> <p>The paradox is that it had actually been a plodding start from the home side, looking decidedly uneasy after the two previous league defeats that had led to prolonged criticism of the side and provoked a cranky performance from Mourinho in his post-match interviews. Smalling\u2019s goal had therapeutic qualities and even before Mata made it 2-0 there were other moments to lift a hitherto quiet crowd. First Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent Rashford clear, only for the teenager to slash at his shot. Soon afterwards, Ibrahimovic cushioned Pogba\u2019s flick on his chest, spun and volleyed over. Pogba then had a go from 30 yards and Zieler scrambled the ball around for a corner.</p> <p>Mata certainly justified his place and his goal originated from the game\u2019s outstanding move. Pogba was involved again and it was a lovely touch from Jesse Lingard to create the shooting opportunity. The most impressive part, however, was that Mata had started the exchange, playing the ball into Pogba and darting into the penalty area. Two passes later, the ball was back at his feet and he aimed his left-foot shot inside Zieler\u2019s right-hand post.</p> <p>Perhaps it was just inevitable United would lower their effort after the break, whereas Gray seemed determined to inspire an improved second-half performance from the visitors. His goal was a beauty, coming in from the left before aiming a diagonal, long-range shot high into David de Gea\u2019s net. There was never any realistic chance, however, of a comeback in the remaining half an hour and, for Rooney, there is the lingering thought that he might have to grow accustomed to his new role.</p>",
  "<p>Pep Guardiola is not the only all-conquering coach on the Etihad Stadium campus. Under Nick Cushing\u2019s charge, Manchester City\u2019s female side are within touching distance of winning the Women\u2019s Super League title for the first time.</p> <p>Cushing\u2019s players need a point against Chelsea, the reigning champions, at City\u2019s Academy Stadium on Sunday to secure first place. It will not be easy \u2013 Emma Hayes\u2019s side are no pushovers \u2013 but, so far this season, City are unbeaten in 14 league games, winning 12 and conceding three goals along the way. Even Guardiola would cherish a similar record.</p> <p>Seven points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who have a game in hand on the leaders and are eight points ahead of third-place Arsenal, with two league fixtures remaining, City have undoubtedly benefited from sharing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jill-scott-manchester-city-women-super-league-title\" title=\"\">a magnificently appointed club campus</a> built with Emirati wealth alongside their Premier League pace-setting counterparts.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got unbelievable facilities and an exceptional set of fans that push us over the line when needed,\u201d says Cushing, who also benefits from having Steph Houghton, the England captain, at the heart of a defence that will face Birmingham City Ladies in the Continental Tyres Cup final next Sunday .</p> <p>By then Houghton hopes to be a WSL champion. \u201cIt would mean everything to win our first Super League trophy but we have to actually go out and do it,\u201d she says. \u201cGames don\u2019t come much bigger than playing the title holders with the chance to win the trophy yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Not that City will be remotely content to settle for the draw they need. \u201cThe mentality at this club is always to win,\u201d says Houghton before issuing a reminder of the City Women\u2019s mantra. \u201cAt the start of the season, we set out to claim three points from every game and to be competitive, playing the football we love to play. \u201cWe\u2019re a club with ambition. We\u2019ve brought in a lot of talent, but we\u2019ve also grown our own and over the last three years it\u2019s been so pleasing to see how we\u2019ve progressed. Any success we have will be deserved. We\u2019re the model everyone else wants to follow.\u201d</p> <p>Chelsea would prefer to eclipse their closest rivals and, until recently, have made a decent job of keeping them in check. They have met City nine times in the past three seasons, each team recording four wins and the remaining game was a draw.</p> <p>With Mark Sampson, the England coach, compiling the bulk of his side from City and Chelsea, their domestic dominance bodes well for the Lionesses\u2019 chances at next summer\u2019s European Championship in the Netherlands. Even so, there are concerns that the WSL is in peril of becoming a little predictable, not to mention a bit top heavy.</p> <p>Houghton, though, cannot look past on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult \u2013 we know that \u2013 but we\u2019ll respect Chelsea and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll respect us too,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever we play them, it\u2019s always a tough fixture \u2013 it\u2019s very competitive and aggressive. We\u2019ll both want to stamp our authority on the game as soon as we possibly can and control it for large periods. It\u2019s going to be really exciting.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Photography is like magic to me.</strong> I was six or seven when my mum [photographer Linda McCartney] first took me to her dark room in Soho.

  "<p> Only a handful of people have laid eyes on the treasure of the Padmanabhaswamy temple in the city of Thiruvananthapuram, formerly Trivandrum, capital of Kerala in southern India. Lawyer Ananda Padmanabhan is one of the lucky few. \u201cI have seen the items in the vault but I can\u2019t say much about it as a court case is still going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Its riches are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/04/kerala-temple-treasure-found\" title=\"\">worth billions of rupees</a>, and for the past eight years, Padmanabhan has been fighting to protect them. He believes that more than a billion rupees\u2019 worth of gold has been taken from the temple and blames the Travancore royal family, the temple\u2019s original guardians, who still believe that they should have custody of the fortunes of Padmanabhaswamy.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 108 Vaishnavite shrines in the world,\u201d he says, \u201cand this is one of them.\u201d Vaishnavites are devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu, and for them the temple is one of the holiest places on earth. \u201cThere is a rare statue of the Lord Vishnu lying down and it is so big that you have to look at it through three different doors to see the whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>According to Padmanabhan, the temple has, along with six main vaults, several secret storage areas in which gold coins, precious stones and carvings are stashed. For generations, myths about removal of the temple treasures leading to misfortune stifled any efforts to properly examine the vaults.</p> <p>After independence, India nationalised the maharajas\u2019 wealth and their ruler status was revoked. Now, the government is seeking to take control of 3,000 tonnes of gold and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/27/india-temple-gold-circulate-economy\" title=\"\">melt some of it down to sell to jewellers</a>, who face a gold shortage and crippling import prices.</p> <p>\u201cThe royal family think this is their private property. But in 1972, the government took away all their benefits. There was an exception that the incumbent rulers from the royal families could continue to have their wealth, but the last ruler died in 1991. So now the royal family has no claim on Padmanabhaswamy,\u201d said Padmanabhan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4b452b40d4f0e3913bc364577476636f159331e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4b452b40d4f0e3913bc364577476636f159331e/0_247_7360_4418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from the temple\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Myths that removing the temple treasures could lead to misfortune stifled any efforts to properly examine the vaults for generations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emad Aljumah/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A legal battle over who should be in charge of managing the temple\u2019s wealth started in 2007, after Padmanabhan argued that the royal family was mismanaging the temple\u2019s wealth and that priceless treasures were being siphoned off. \u201cThere was never a proper inventory of what was even in the temple,\u201d he says. \u201cThe royal family have said that the vaults were never opened, but you can see from the temple\u2019s registers that they have been opened at least seven times.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s proposals to melt down some of the gold items in the temple is controversial as they have spiritual and historical value. One Hindu organisation has argued that the Padmanabhaswamy\u2019s riches should stay where they are. Padmanabhan doesn\u2019t have an opinion on what should be done with the treasure. \u201cMy main objective was to get the temple\u2019s assets recorded and inventoried. Now that they\u2019ve done that, the supreme court will decide what the next step should be. My role is now almost over.\u201d</p> <p>The supreme court has not heard the case for 10 months, and is expected to announce the next hearing in the coming weeks. It has put in place a temporary temple administration committee, controlled by a district judge and members of the Indian civil service, and 200 police officers are on 24-hour duty.</p> <p>The royal family argue that the temple has belonged to them for centuries, and that they are the rightful guardians of its wealth. Until recently, historian MG Shashibhushan agreed. \u201cI used to be very close to the royal family, but these days our relations are not so cordial, and I am keeping my distance,\u201d he said. When asked if he believed treasure had been taken from the temple, he said: \u201cI think, I suspect.\u201d His doubts arose after India\u2019s auditor general, Vinod Rai, released a 1,000-page report detailing the temple\u2019s missing assets.</p> <p>R Chandrakutty, a former union leader who represents a group of around 50 temple employees, said: \u201cSo many things have been stolen. There was one flute made from an elephant\u2019s tusk. It was centuries old. I remember seeing it once, but it is not there any more. There are many things that have been stolen.\u201d</p> <p>No one from the royal family was available for comment.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you write about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elizabeth-jane-howard\">Elizabeth Jane Howard</a>?\u201d asked my mother. She used to stay with Jane at her house in Suffolk every summer, with a group of friends who met to paint in a meadow beside the river Waveney. I dismissed her suggestion instantly. Why do the biography of someone who had already written a remarkably revealing memoir? When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\"><em>Slipstream</em></a> was published in 2002, critics and readers alike were left gasping at Howard\u2019s courage and candour. But just to see if there was anything left to say, I read it again. The book presented only one side of a very complex story, and there was surprisingly little about her work.</p> <p>Born in 1923 and always known as Jane, she enjoyed a comfortable childhood in London with holidays in Sussex among a crowd of cousins. Yet she felt her hypercritical mother never really loved her, and she grew up anxious and uncertain. Her father never made her feel stupid or clumsy; but when she was 15 his hugs and kisses became more urgent. He went no further but Jane was terrified, ashamed and alone: there was no one she could tell, least of all her mother.</p> <p>She wrote stories and plays and wanted to act; but the outbreak of war in 1939 changed everything. Jane was 20 when she married Peter Scott, painter, naturalist and son of the Antarctic explorer. Peter was then in the navy, facing danger and death every day. His mother, keen to ensure the survival of the Scott genes, put pressure on Jane to have a child before she was really even ready for marriage. The birth of Jane\u2019s only daughter, Nicola, left her feeling trapped, and guilty that she couldn\u2019t love her child as she should. She made the break four years later, abandoning her husband and daughter to become a writer.</p> <p>In the course of the 1950s she wrote articles, edited books, modelled for Vogue and wrote two novels. The first, <em>The Beautiful Visit</em>, won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize; the second was her masterpiece, <em>The Long View</em>. Driven by her hunger for love she became known as a literary femme fatale, with a trophy collection of lovers who included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/28/day-lewis-poetry\">Cecil Day-Lewis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthur-koestler\">Arthur Koestler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/laurie-lee\">Laurie Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/15/romain-gary-david-bellos-review\">Romain Gary</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kenneth-tynan\">Kenneth Tynan</a>. In <em>Slipstream</em> she revealed not only the abortions and betrayals, but also the loneliness and the lack of respect accorded to women who were considered \u201cfast\u201d. She claimed that she only married her second husband, Jim Douglas-Henry, because she was sick of men thinking they could bed her after half an hour\u2019s acquaintance.</p> <p>Douglas-Henry was a matrimonial mistake she regretted almost at once; but when she married <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/kingsleyamis\">Kingsley Amis</a> in 1965, they were deliriously in love. Kingsley left his wife and three children for beautiful, brilliant Jane. His novels paid the bills, but she had to manage everything else alone \u2013 even his two rebellious teenage sons. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/martinamis\">Martin Amis</a> credits Jane with getting him into Oxford; yet as time went on she sank into the role of overworked and under-appreciated housewife. Kingsley\u2019s irritation grew into active dislike. But he needed her support, and her presence \u2013 he panicked if left alone \u2013 and he never forgave her for walking out on him in 1980.</p> <p>The years that followed were bleak. What saved her was joining a women\u2019s group that gave her the strength to face life alone, and the success of the Cazalet Chronicle: a series of novels based on her own family. Yet she was still, as she put it, \u201ca tart for love\u201d. At 72 she fell for a conman, who was only unmasked thanks to her daughter Nicola.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As I closed <em>Slipstream</em>, I found myself with a question I couldn\u2019t get out of my head: how can someone who writes so perceptively about love and what it does to people make so many mistakes in their own life? Perhaps my mother\u2019s idea wasn\u2019t such a bad one after all.</p> <p>Over the course of 2013, I had five long interviews with Jane at her house in Bungay in Suffolk. As we talked, her hands were busy with knitting or embroidery and when she looked up, her glance was piercingly direct. I loved listening to her deep smoker\u2019s voice, her rumbling laugh. She enjoyed being interviewed, and I liked the way she would turn a question over in her mind before replying. She helped me in every possible way: giving me copies of her novels, and urging all her friends \u2013 including her psychotherapists \u2013 to talk to me. But the fact is that exploiting memories, whether in interviews or novels or writing about your own life, tends to harden the images: they become what you have written or said. She could not tell me very much more than I had already learned.</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you got some early chapters to show me yet?\u201d she asked, on about our third interview. \u201cI want to read this book of yours before I pop off, you know.\u201d A terrifying prospect, but one I never had to face. That winter, her beloved brother Colin was taken seriously ill. He died in December 2013, and she followed him in early January.</p> <p>Jane had sold her archive to the Huntington Library in California, and that spring I spent four weeks going through her letters. Swarms of questions that I would never be able to ask her buzzed round my head. I found that she had written her memoir from memory, without consulting her papers. For example, in <em>Slipstream</em> she wrote that when she ended her affair with Day-Lewis, \u201che was bitterly hurt, resentful, called me a whore\u201d. But reading the letters he wrote at that time, it\u2019s simply not true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c00827498c6e2ab6334f10a885d89f5ad56b82df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c00827498c6e2ab6334f10a885d89f5ad56b82df/0_0_4064_4869/835.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Jane Howard 1964\" width=\"835\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mass of contradictions \u2026 Elizabeth Jane Howard in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I came nearest to understanding Jane when talking to those who knew and loved her \u2013 and there were many, for she was a much better picker of friends than she was of men. One of my earliest interviews was with Nicola, who had moved to Bungay to look after her mother. Jane, so demonstrative and dramatic, probably never fathomed Nicola\u2019s quiet reserve; but how did the four-year-old Nicola feel, I asked, when her mother abandoned her? \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a part of Mum\u2019s guilt trip,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t abandoned. I had my father, and my stepmother who was wonderful, and my pony. My mother was very elegant, but she wasn\u2019t part of my life \u2013 she was doing her own thing.\u201d</p> <p>This makes Jane sound very much in control, but she felt the opposite, and the more I talked to people the more she emerged as a mass of contradictions. I sometimes despaired of ever making sense of them, and I think Jane did too. Some found her haughty, others were surprised by her diffidence. She took little part in Nicola\u2019s upbringing, yet no one writes better about the experience of childhood. She was equivocal about sex, yet she could not separate it from the affection she craved. And although an ardent feminist, she was at the mercy of any man who expressed desire and admiration for her.</p> <p>This was why she was drawn to the figure of Malcolm Shane (not his real name), who began his courtship of her by letter in 1995. He had fallen in love with her voice, he said, and had read all her books. The letters came thick and fast, and she responded. Her friends described him a burly man in his 60s, potty about Jane but otherwise dull; but they were alarmed by her fluttery excitement, which was that of a schoolgirl rather than a mature woman. When she found out the truth about him she was devastated; yet by then she had experienced his violence, and had still taken him back the following day. The first time I asked her about it, she said he had come just short of hitting her. When I came back to it again later (one should always ask the important questions more than once), she said he did hit her: that felt like the truth, because she sounded ashamed to admit it.</p> <p>The person who best explained Jane\u2019s insatiable thirst for love was Jenner Roth, who led the women\u2019s group that Jane had relied on so much. She only agreed to see me because Jane had asked her to. Jane wrote that a therapist had once described her as \u201ca bottomless pit\u201d of neediness: why was that? After a long pause Jenner said: \u201cTo receive love you have to have something to put it in,\u201d and she brought her hands together into a bowl as though she were holding water. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t know how to make that bowl, or if it\u2019s broken, when love comes along you have nowhere to put it \u2013 it just trickles away. That\u2019s why Jane could never have enough love, and why she was constantly searching for more.\u201d</p> <p>All Jane\u2019s books are about love in one form or another, and about herself. \u201cI write to find things out,\u201d she wrote, \u201cas much as, and sometimes more than, to tell them to other people.\u201d Her stories are always beautifully constructed, the writing clear, the plot lines firm \u2013 even when, as in the Cazalet novels, she is handling decades of time and a huge cast of characters. She has two self-portraits that reappear throughout her work: one is a naive girl at ease with herself, and the other a restless femme fatale who can\u2019t bear to be alone. Jane felt that if she could find someone who really loved her, she would recover a kind of innocence. She never doubted that enduring love heals the spirit and makes it whole.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/18/elizabeth-jane-howard-a-dangerous-innocence-artemis-cooper-review\">Elizabeth Jane Howard: A Dangerous Innocence by Artemis Cooper \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her novel <em>After Julius</em>, she dramatises the tension between the innocence she longed to regain, and the experience in which she was trapped through two sisters: Emma and Cressy. At one point Emma (the innocent one) asks Cressy if she would like to get married and Cressy replies, \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing I really want in the world. If I could find the right person, I\u2019d do anything to keep things good \u2026 I feel wrong all by myself: you don\u2019t. I suppose that\u2019s why I have affairs and you don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>Jane never found the love and companionship she craved; but she left behind a body of work that is enduring far better than she expected. For much of her life, she saw her books eclipsed by those of Amis. But women\u2019s voices have grown stronger over the years, and if you go into a bookshop now, you are likely to find more novels by Jane than by him. As for that question that haunted me \u2013 how can someone get it so right on the page, so wrong in their own life? \u2013 I see now that it only makes sense the other way round. It was because Jane lived at such an intense emotional pitch; because she rushed into things without considering the risks, because she could not control her impulsive imagination \u2013 all these were what made her the powerful novelist she was.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Elizabeth Jane Howard: A Dangerous Innocence</em> by Artemis Cooper is published this week by John Murray.

I should have known. In this part of south-west Virginia tunes are passed down, passed on. The arrangements might be different but the chords and the melody are hardwired into the musicians\u2019 memory bank.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/travel_virginia_web/giv-1406fE9ZKZpOQaBQ/\" data-alt=\"Virginia road trip map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/travel_virginia_web/giv-1406fE9ZKZpOQaBQ/\">Virginia road trip map</a> </figure>  <p>Stevie showed me the memorabilia he had collected \u2013 old bluegrass 45s, setlists, posters and photos \u2013 and introduced me to the elderly ladies enjoying coffee and cake in the cafe area. They shared tales of their Irish, Scottish and English ancestry; Virginia has that settler makeup, though it also had a German influx \u2013 which brought the dulcimer, an instrument later co-opted into the Appalachian sound.</p> <p>Since I was a teenager learning the guitar, I\u2019d dreamed of a road trip like this: where the intoxicating landscape inspired the music and that music reflected the communities along its byways. Galax, the last stop on my four-day adventure, had that spirit in abundance. It\u2019s a town of 7,000 and famous for its annual <a href=\"http://www.oldfiddlersconvention.com/\">Old Fiddlers\u2019 Convention</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.rextheatergalax.com/\">Rex Theater</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d7b6d63f9743644d53b0fd8cd925114090db9929\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7b6d63f9743644d53b0fd8cd925114090db9929/0_158_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musicians at Barr\u2019s Fiddle Shop in Galax, with Stevie Barr on banjo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musicians at Barr\u2019s Fiddle Shop in Galax, with Stevie Barr on banjo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Hull/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a tale of two roads. The first is real, one of America\u2019s most scenic highways: the 90-mile stretch of the <a href=\"http://www.blueridgeparkway.org/\">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> (the 469-mile-long road that links the Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks). The second is symbolic, an evocation of the region\u2019s cultural traditions: the <a href=\"https://www.myswva.org/tcr\">Crooked Road</a> (subtitled Virginia\u2019s Heritage Music Trail) links nine major venues plus concert halls, stores and festivals connected to the old time, bluegrass and country artists whose stories are sprinkled across the majestic, often melancholic Blue Ridge mountains.</p> <p>The two roads frequently overlap and when they do, the mixture of music and mountains is irresistible.</p> <p>I began in <a href=\"https://www.visitroanokeva.com/\">Roanoke</a>, a city within the beautiful Roanoke Valley and less than 10 minutes\u2019 drive from the Blue Ridge Parkway. I set course for Ferrum, then Floyd \u2013 both major Crooked Road venues \u2013 and hit the Parkway for the hour-or-so drive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ac311923e1940fdf79177b2dd95927873de6be8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ac311923e1940fdf79177b2dd95927873de6be8/0_141_2165_1299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway, near Roanoke, Virginia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway, near Roanoke</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roanoke Valley Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This part of the road affords fantastic views of valleys, of spruce and firs, oak and pine forests, and acres of mixed hardwood trees. The road, however, doesn\u2019t allow for cruise control. It provides fauna and flora but also requires focus, as it twists, turns and undulates through the landscape. Fortunately, the Parkway \u2013 maintained by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">National Park Service</a> (NPS), and 80 this year \u2013 has many pull-in observation points (known as overlooks) for safely contemplating the view.</p> <p>At milepost 135.9, I turned off and headed for Ferrum, and its <a href=\"http://www.blueridgeinstitute.org/\">Blue Ridge Institute and Museum</a>. The institute provides a superb insight into the region\u2019s musical heritage: in the main gallery is a timeline \u2013 using photos, video clips, news reports and letters \u2013 of the evolution of what was originally called \u201cstring music\u201d but is now more commonly known as \u201cold time\u201d and bluegrass. It also introduces the leading musical families, names that crop up repeatedly in these parts: the Carters, the Stanleys and the Stonemans.</p> <p>Appalachian music \u2013 driven by guitars, banjos and fiddles \u2013 wasn\u2019t as straightforward to define as I thought. I learned \u201cold-time\u201d is for (flat foot) dancing to, while bluegrass is mainly for listening to. Though, as with many \u201cdefinitions\u201d, there are no hard-and-fast rules. To hasten my education, I was loaded up with CDs for the rest of my journey by the museum\u2019s director, Roddy Moore. Roddy was also insistent he wanted me to come back, and much sooner than I\u2019d expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df25aa3ce44fe1e9dada9f309617c43a8cd46606\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df25aa3ce44fe1e9dada9f309617c43a8cd46606/0_0_3546_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"memorabilia at the Carter Family Fold , Virginia.

Saturday is our festival. You need to see this. It\u2019s a pretty big deal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And so, with Buster Pack and His Lonesome Pine Boys\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4gqTwW-W0Y\">Indian Boogie</a> spinning on my car stereo, I made a note of the Blue Ridge Folklife Festival\u2019s main musical attractions, and then wondered just what \u201cmule jumping\u201d and \u201ccoon-dog water racing\u201d might look like.</p> <p>The mountains imprint themselves on songs written in (and about) this region, but as well as the scale of the landscape there is also a hemmed-in feel to parts of it. Roads curl around peaks and there are epic switchbacks to navigate. These tracks inspire tales, too, such as Shooting Creek Road, which led me down from Ferrum towards Floyd. It is one of the most beautiful, curving, tree-festooned routes I\u2019ve ever driven \u2013 and once moonshine territory. The story goes that if a police car was on the road, moonshiners would fire their rifles to signal to brothers-in-stills that trouble was afoot. True or not, I know that if I hadn\u2019t had to be in Floyd for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/09/floyd-country-store-virginia-us-music-venue-bluegrass\">Friday Night Jamboree</a> at the Floyd Country Store, I may still be on that road taking pictures and looking for ghosts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c17ca5dc150deac8b323a623bfd713b06ebabc31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c17ca5dc150deac8b323a623bfd713b06ebabc31/0_0_5616_3374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Band on state at the Friday Night Jamboree at Floyd Country Store, Virginia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friday Night Jamboree at Floyd Country Store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Woody Crenshaw</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over a honey barbecue chicken dinner at Floyd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Oddf3llows/\">Oddf3llows</a> restaurant, tourism director Pat Sharkey explained to me how this \u201cone-stoplight town\u201d (pop 400+) had become a \u201cprogressive, artsy and creative\u201d hub amid Floyd County and an otherwise conservative, rural south-west Virginia. Her colleague, Vera, put it differently. \u201cYou remember that 90s TV show Northern Exposure? It\u2019s like that here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Little Floyd\u2019s big thing is the <a href=\"http://www.floydcountrystore.com/\">Floyd Country Store</a> and it\u2019s Friday night extravaganza (admission $5): a family-friendly musical get-together that welcomes all styles of Appalachian music \u2013 and broadcasts it on its own radio show. Run by Heather Krantz and husband Dylan Locke, the store is filled with a happy vibe. Though my imagination was fired by the music at the store and at the louder, brasher <a href=\"http://dogtownroadhouse.com/\">Dogtown Roadhouse</a> a few minutes\u2019 walk away, my body clock said \u201csleep\u201d. So I drove five minutes out of Floyd to <a href=\"http://www.bellalavitainn.com/index.html\">Bella La Vita</a> (doubles from $149+ tax B&amp;B), a guesthouse close to the Parkway and run with warmth and enthusiasm by Lisal and Matthew Roberts. The four individually themed rooms are spacious but full of homely touches. And they do a phenomenal home-cooked breakfast.</p> <p>Road trips can be beautiful, mysterious things, but they are often only a widescreen view of a world you\u2019re passing through, with little time to take in the detail, which is what made the visit to the <a href=\"http://blueridgefolklifefestival.com/\">Blue Ridge Folklife Festival</a> so rewarding. Amid the displays of hot rods and show cars, threshing and rock-crushing machines, molasses and apple butter making, and horse-pulling competitions was an array of music that gave everyone in the community a voice. I moved between the three music stages, listened to the bluegrass gospel of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tBKs71GwPM\">True Life Travelers</a>, the Virginia Piedmont-style blues of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0cVPqPLnXA\">Jeffrey Scott</a>, the \u201cOld Time Tunes and Songs\u201d of Gerald Anderson and Friends, and the \u201cSouthern Virginia African-American Gospel\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I_OxPsCpms\">the RC Gospel Singers</a>. Roddy was right, it was a pretty big deal, and as big and tasty a rural musical treat as anyone could handle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e88a1fd15c7de4214b593d15674248b626fb18d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e88a1fd15c7de4214b593d15674248b626fb18d/0_143_2256_1353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Horse Pullling competition at the Blue Ridge Folklife Festival, Ferrum, Virginia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horse Pullling competition at the Blue Ridge Folklife Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Hull/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In following the music of the mountains it was occasionally necessary to leave the Parkway, to stay on the Crooked Road. After Ferrum, this meant a blast along highway I-81, followed by such a meandering road that I wondered if I might meet myself coming back round it. Fortunately, no speed limits (or laws of physics) were broken in the search for Hiltons, home to the <a href=\"http://www.carterfamilyfold.org/\">Carter Family Fold</a> ($10 adults, $2 children).</p> <p>The musical legacy of the Carter, and Carter-Cash, family is as rich as any in US folk music. The Fold is not only a venue for a weekly celebration of the family\u2019s music, and Appalachian sounds in general, it also features the Carter Family Museum and the AP Carter birthplace cabin. Both can be visited before the 7.30pm shows, and during the interval. As the Mountain Park Old Time Band took to the stage at the 850-seat venue, I chatted to Rita Forrester, granddaughter of AP and Sara Carter, about the tribute the Fold pays to the family\u2019s songs and its overarching role in protecting the region\u2019s musical roots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"171e337b26eb15034c7ccedaf3cbf29eb8c8716f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/171e337b26eb15034c7ccedaf3cbf29eb8c8716f/0_346_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain Park Old Time Band on stage at the Carter Family Fold, Virginia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mountain Park Old Time Band at the Carter Family Fold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Hull</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abingdon and Bristol were on my horizon, but only after a night at the <a href=\"http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/virginia/hilton-garden-inn-bristol-TRIGIGI/index.html\">Hilton Garden Inn</a> (doubles from $120, room-only) on the outskirts of Bristol. It was one of those stays where I arrived so late I may as well have taken a seat for breakfast. It was, however, perfectly positioned for Heartwood, in Abingdon, which is the headquarters of the Crooked Road, as well as a venue and museum. I met Jack Hinshelwood, the Road\u2019s executive director, and he told me: \u201cIt\u2019s important to be sensitive about how the road is developed, so as not to damage the culture. We don\u2019t want tourism in a form that then kills what is being celebrated here.\u201d</p> <p>A great example of the respect Jack alluded to is at Bristol\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.birthplaceofcountrymusic.org/\">Birthplace of Country Music Museum</a> ($13.65 adults, $11.55 concessions, 5 and under, free). The museum, which only opened in 2014, is already an essential stop (Bristol also has its own fantastic annual outdoor <a href=\"http://www.birthplaceofcountrymusic.org/festival/\">music festival</a>) and celebrates the recordings made here in 1927 by Ralph Peer, a record executive from the Victor Talking Machine Company in New Jersey. Peer set up a portable recording studio, advertised for performers, and over two weeks recorded 76 songs by 19 acts, including Ernest Stoneman, the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. It\u2019s a fun and educational place that brings the \u201cBristol sessions\u201d to life through displays that allowed me to add vocals in a recording booth and play with recording desk sliders to create a mix for a song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4c5b0c08a6ec7e785f9cd1ffa8ca5e365ed9a09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4c5b0c08a6ec7e785f9cd1ffa8ca5e365ed9a09/0_183_4817_2890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Display of instruments at Bristol\u2019s Birthplace of Country Music Museum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Display at Bristol\u2019s Birthplace of Country Music Museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Staples</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Galax would come tomorrow, and also a return to the Parkway for a stop at the <a href=\"http://www.blueridgemusiccenter.org/\">Blue Ridge Music Center</a>. But road trips should have quirks: for me this was a stay in Wytheville, at the <a href=\"http://www.bollingwilsonhotel.com/\">Bolling Wilson Hotel</a> (doubles from $129+tax B&amp;B). Classy and understated, the hotel was a refuge from the interstate and blessed with superb Blue Ridge views from the Perch, its stylish rooftop terrace bar. The hotel is named after US president Woodrow Wilson\u2019s second wife, <a href=\"http://edithbollingwilson.org/\">Edith Bolling Wilson</a>, who was born in Wytheville. Opposite is a museum dedicated to her. Next door to that is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SkeetersWorldFamousHotdogs/\">Skeeter\u2019s World Famous Hotdogs</a> \u2013 fuelling locals and people like me since 1925. Quirky but good.</p> <p>After winning a satnav battle to get me back on the Parkway, I pulled in at the <a href=\"http://www.blueridgemusiccenter.org/\">Blue Ridge Music Center</a>. The centre has a small museum dedicated to old time and bluegrass history, but its jewel is the free, noon-4pm concert run daily from late May to late October. As a bluegrass band played in this intimate space, I listened to the performers just a few feet from me, who between tunes provided insight into a song or its arrangement. I also made a note, from what I learned in the museum. It was about how, though Scots and Irish heritage is strong in this region, the banjo had its origins in west Africa, as an instrument called a <em>xalam</em>. It made me think of the scope and diversity of music in general, and how playing it is a collective, unifying experience. But I also made a deal with myself: that the next time I come down this road, I\u2019ll bring my guitar with me.<br>\u2022 <em>Flights and itinerary assistance were provided by </em><em>Brand USA</em><em> and the </em><a href=\"http://www.virginia.org/\"><em>Virginia Tourism Corporation</em></a><em>.

This happened after <a href=\"http://www.law360.com/articles/794173/ill-sheriff-asks-high-court-to-review-sex-ad-case\">law enforcement</a> <a href=\"http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150817/NEWS07/150819867/cook-county-sheriff-targets-website-in-trafficking-fight\">officials</a> demanded that Backpage and Craigslist terminate personal ad sections that facilitate the illicit sex market. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://time.com/4022124/prostitution-nationwide-sting/\">sting operations routinely take place</a>, increasing the odds that the activities of pimps and their customers will be exposed.</p> <p>Despite successful government stings, pimps nevertheless continue to adapt, operate and thrive.</p> <p>As social scientists, we wanted to learn how they\u2019re pulling it off; we hoped to build on studies about how various criminals perceive and respond to the threat of arrest.</p> <p>So we went to the source: the pimps themselves.</p> <p>To recruit interviewees, we placed the following advertisement in the survey, escort and massage sections of Backpage:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Research team seeks to interview men 18 years or older about their experiences as managers in the erotica industry. Confidential in-person interviews last approximately one hour. Convenient (Chicago/Atlanta) location. Will pay $60 for completed interviews. For more information to see if you qualify, call \u2026 or email.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pimps who were interested either called our prepaid mobile phone or the email account attached to the project; they were then screened to see if they qualified. In Chicago, three interviewed pimps were paid $20 for each of the two additional pimps that they referred to us. A 25-year veteran sex worker referred three pimps.</p> <p>Pimps had several reasons for agreeing to the interviews. Some wanted their story in an academic book, while others believed the advertisement was actually a sex worker seeking a manager. Some simply thought the pay was worth an hour of their time.</p> <p>We ended up interviewing 71 pimps: 29 of them from April to June 2013 in a private university conference room in Atlanta and the rest from April 2013 to June 2014 in a Chicago public tea shop. Most lasted for about an hour and took the form of a casual conversation.</p> <p>The findings from these interviews \u2013 described in <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01639625.2015.1060810\">two</a> <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15564886.2016.1187694\">studies</a> published earlier this year \u2013 highlighted the various ways that pimps were able to subvert the law using language and technology.</p> <p>Of those we interviewed, 67% used the internet to solicit clients, and all but six of these pimps continued to use Backpage or Craigslist even though they knew law enforcement was targeting these outlets.</p> <p>Yet most continued to operate unabated. The secret, we discovered, was in the approach.</p> <p>Ten years ago, <a href=\"http://cad.sagepub.com/content/60/2/261.full.pdf+html\">a study</a> described how sex clients would often use code words to avoid being targeted by stings.</p> <p>After each sting, however, widespread media coverage often exposed the ways in which sex workers solicited clients \u2013 including the slang. It\u2019s now generally known that \u201croses\u201d is used to indicate the amount of money charged. For example, an ad might state 80 roses for BBBJ, which means $80 for a blow job without a condom.</p> <p>Many of the pimps followed the media coverage and discovered which code words the police had learned. To continue using these words, they realized, was obviously unwise. Most stopped using the known code words. A few pimps in the Chicago sample switched to hiding their advertising of underage girls with common, objectifying code words \u2013 \u201cdoll\u201d, \u201csweet girl\u201d \u2013 that are still often chauvinistically used to describe adult women in the United States. (Most pimps, however, didn\u2019t use minors as sex workers to avoid the long prison sentence, if caught.)</p> <p>In addition, the pimps didn\u2019t exclusively use the sites most frequently targeted by law enforcement. Many would diversify their ad placements, using sites on the deep web \u2013 sites that can mask original IP addresses and don\u2019t appear on standard search engines. Others advertised on specialty dating or pornography websites that catered to gay men or heterosexual adults.</p> <p>Sites like Backpage also have a number of different sections; the primary place for ads selling sex are in the \u201cadult\u201d sections. Not surprisingly, these are the ones the police are most likely to monitor. So some pimps told us how they would move ads on Backpage from sections that the police trolled to other sections such as \u201cservices\u201d or \u201cdating\u201d that received less scrutiny. Meanwhile, those still posting on Craigslist told us how they used the \u201ccasual encounters\u201d section when the \u201cadult services\u201d section was removed.</p> <p>Pimps also tended to use a number of additional strategies to avoid detection like avoiding references to location, using fake pictures of sex workers and minimizing written communication through text or emails. Technology like Google Voice, prepaid mobile phones and software that wipes data from hard drives were also used to hide their identities.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2012.660977\">Other</a> <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1996.tb01213.x/full\">social</a> <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1993.tb01131.x/abstract\">scientists</a> have found that drug traffickers and other criminals use strategies of \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy connections\u201d to avoid detection.</p> <p>The pimps we interviewed were no different. Many learned how to avoid getting arrested by simply bribing officials in the system. In fact, one-third of the pimps interviewed in Chicago said they had paid either a lawyer or police officer for information about how to lower their chances of detection and conviction.</p> <p>Pimps were more likely to say they have an inside legal expert if they earned over $100,000 or managed at least nine sex workers. Some of these inside legal experts were corrupt police officers who could pass along information about undercover operations that were being planned. Other pimps kept lawyers on retainers and were confident that the lawyer could successfully help them avoid having an arrest turn into a conviction. Some of these lawyers would even <a href=\"https://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/avoiding-an-online-prostitution-sting\">advise their clients</a> on how to tell whether an encounter is an undercover sting.</p> <p>Another strategy involved crafting a veneer of legitimacy. Pimps often claimed to run massage parlors or modeling agencies, using photos with props from these professions to show they were running an actual business.</p> <p>Finally, pimps used a number of tools to verify that clients and potential sex workers were trustworthy \u2013 and not undercover police officers. Clients needed to register on verification websites.</p> <p>Meanwhile, rating systems for both sex workers and clients were used to minimize violent or confrontational situations that might attract police attention.

Certainly in my lifetime.</p> <p>And better still, if the typical pattern of prelims continues in 2016 \u2013 one blow out, and one thriller \u2013 we are due for something special.</p> <p>To go back to that first point, I was thinking earlier that you have to go back to Victorian State Election day of 1999, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXs9DJjmxQo\">Carlton defied Essendon</a>, for a non-grand-final-final with so much to it.</p> <p>First the visitors. The people\u2019s champs. The Dogs. Their story is already staggering to the extent that they somehow hung on and clawed their way into contention after losing their stirring leader Bob Murphy within weeks of the season beginning.</p> <p>While 2016 has been an awful year in so many ways for human kind, on the sporting field it feels right the AFL may follow suit with Leicester in the Premier League or Portugal in the Euros. Or something like that.</p> <p>Two weeks ago when they bounced the Eagles in Perth they had their entire state with them. Last week their banner claimed 24 million Australians were in their corner when accounting for the best team of the modern era. Impossible as it sounds, that number will swell further tonight.</p> <p>If they can proceed to the last Saturday in September (or the first in October, but you know what I mean) from seventh on the ladder, it sets up a magical finale. We should be so lucky.</p> <p>Which isn\u2019t to speak ill of the Giants. Sure, they\u2019re the AFL darlings. And tonight they grapple with an unfamiliar role \u2013 the hunted. The hated. They also carry the weight of expectation and favouritism with all the vagaries that come with it. All within five years of joining the comp. Theirs, too, is a helluva story.</p> <p>Stadium politics dominated much of the early week, but the hosts earned the right to be exactly where they are this evening. The boutique 24,000-seater at the Showgrounds will heave like it never has been. A ground where the Giants have gone 6-2 this year.</p> <p>It was there that they accounted for the Doggies by 25 points the last time they met in round nine when Jeremy Cameron booted five. If he replicates that tonight, or even his burst from their first final where three of his four majors came in the premiership quarter, they\u2019ll be hard to catch.</p> <p>As will their carefully curated midfield, combining youth and experience. Stevie J is taking a seat tonight after smashing Josh Kennedy in their qualifying final, but the engine room has far more to do with Stephen Coniglio \u2013 their best in their six goal win against Sydney at the Olympic Stadium \u2013 or Callan Ward or Tom Scully or Ryan Griffen. They bat deep, with no one getting the ball from the guts with greater efficiency. </p> <p>And Cameron isn\u2019t alone up there inside 50 either. His twin-tower Jon Patton is a matchwinner in his own right, while Rory Lobb has been a revelation.</p> <p>Where the Dogs match up well is with their own relentless midfield. This is how they did Hawthorn in, the 23 point margin flattering the losers. The final five minutes of the third quarter last Friday night was frenetic as it was effective in banging home six unanswered goals. The Hawks had nowhere to turn.</p> <p>Oh. And then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://thearcfooty.com/2016/06/23/cant-stop-the-bont/\">Marcus Bontompelli</a>. If they were giving out Brownlow votes for last week\u2019s win he would have got all of them; a clearance masterclass putting him into yet another bracket of the most elite. All at age 20. Again, tonight?</p> <p>As ever with the Dogs, <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-finals-2016-what-makes-the-dogs-special-20160922-grm0jd.html\">the narrative is never far away</a>.

  "<p>A small town in Ontario, Canada, has prompted fresh scrutiny of the bottled-water industry after its attempt secure a long-term water supply through the purchase of a well was outbid by the food and drinks multinational Nestl\u00e9.<br></p> <p>When authorities in Centre Wellington, population of about 30,000, learned that Nestl\u00e9 had put a bid on a spring water well in their region, they scrambled over the summer to counter with a competing bid. The goal was to safeguard a water supply for the township\u2019s fast-growing population, Kelly Linton, the mayor, told the Guardian. \u201cBy 2041, we\u2019ll be closer to 50,000 so protecting our water sources is critical to us.\u201d </p> <p>Using a numbered company, the municipality submitted what Linton described as an \u201caggressive bid\u201d for the five-hectare site. \u201cWe put in more money than they did and we removed all conditions.\u201d He declined to specify the exact amount of the bid. </p> <p>An agreement forged with Nestl\u00e9 after its initial bid, made 18 months earlier, gave the company the right to respond. \u201cThey had the opportunity to match our offer and that\u2019s how we lost on that on that one,\u201d said Linton. </p> <p>The news was met with disappointment in the community. \u201cAs you can appreciate we aren\u2019t going to be outbidding Nestl\u00e9,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a small town we\u2019re using taxpayer dollars, so we have to be good stewards of that.\u201d</p> <p>Nestl\u00e9 Canada currently has permits that allow it to extract up to 4.7m litres of water a day from sources in Ontario. <a href=\"http://www.nestle-waters.ca/en/water-sources-n-quality/middlebrook-project/your-questions-our-answers\">On its website,</a> the company noted that its latest acquisition \u2013 the well also sought by Centre Wellington \u2013 would be a source to supplement other operations in the region, as well as support future business growth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-23T21:22:01.html\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-23T21:22:01.html\">map</a> </figure>  <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Nestl\u00e9 Waters Canada said it wasn\u2019t aware that the counter-offer was from the township of Centre Wellington until well after the purchase was made.</p> <p>The site, noted the statement, was formerly a permitted water bottling facility. \u201cThe former owner had the property on the market for over 10 years.\u201d </p> <p>Ontario\u2019s ministry of the environment and climate change has yet to approve their application to carry out a pump test, said the company. \u201cAny decision whether to draw from the source will not be made until we have conducted testing, validated by a third party, on the quality and quantity of the water. Nestl\u00e9 wants to ensure there is no negative impact on the watershed and surrounding ecosystem.\u201d</p> <p>The company, added the statement, would continue its \u201congoing dialogue\u201d with the community of Centre Wellington. </p> <p><a href=\"http://wellingtonwaterwatchers.ca/\">Wellington Water Watchers</a>, a volunteer-run organisation dedicated to the protection of water resources, said it would seek to block the company as it moves forward with its plans. \u201cWe are fighting tooth and nail to not allow that pump test to go ahead,\u201d said Mike Nagy of the group. </p> <p>The water in the well is artesian spring water, he said, making it particularly valuable to consumers outside of Canada. </p> <p>The failed bid comes amid growing calls for the Ontario government to reevaluate how it grants permits to the bottled-water industry. Last month, after a severe drought triggered questions about the millions of litres a day of water being sold to bottled-water companies in the province, Kathleen Wynne, Ontario\u2019s premier, promised a government review into the practice. </p> <p>Government policies, she noted, had failed to keep up with the times. \u201cThirty years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have envisioned an industry that took water and put it in plastic bottles so that people could carry it around,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On Friday, she reiterated her view that bottled water companies should be considered differently from other industries that use water, such as mining or construction. \u201cI think we have to look very closely at what those companies are paying, what they\u2019re allowed to take, and that\u2019s exactly the work the ministry of environment and climate change is doing right now,\u201d she told reporters. </p> <p>The province currently charges C$3.71 for every million litres of water, along with a permit fee of up to C$3,000 depending on the risk of environmental impact. </p> <p>Nagy, whose organisation is calling for an eventual ban on permits for the bottled-water industry, cautioned that price shouldn\u2019t be the only focus of the government\u2019s review. \u201cIf I stood on top of an aquifer and threw $100 bills on the ground, it\u2019s not going to create anymore water,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the levy and charges in the world will not create more water.\u201d</p>",

Obstetricians don\u2019t pause, mid-breech, to check their Twitter notifications; bricklayers can\u2019t demolish their wall-in-progress and start again. For 20 years I had a real job I was good at: fixing other people\u2019s novels. Now, however, that I work alone, making up stories, I am locked in a battle between self-doubt and self-discipline, and the former usually wins. I have the concentration of... oh, I like your shoes. It is so much easier to plummet down the sinkhole of Twitter, or clean the front door with baby wipes, or update one\u2019s log of Terrible Comments Made At Readings, or potter in the garden during the busy season (Feb-Oct), than to sit at one\u2019s desk in front of Draft 18/b, trying to scale the wall of self-loathing, certain that this novel is doomed.</p> <p>The solution is to get out.</p> <p>Some writers like cafes: the loving waiters included in their acknowledgements; the flapjacks. But I always sit by the loud idiot. Besides, my back is, even by writer standards, bad, and unsuited to distressed metal furniture. Where else is there?

There are always coughers and sniffers, odd regulars \u2013 Stompy Woman, Man Who Coughs Like a Sea Lion \u2013 but the prevailing atmosphere is of industrious near-quiet, and one is too visible to sleep or weep or pick one\u2019s split ends for long.</p> <p>Because I own a neolithic Nokia, and have downloaded <a href=\"https://freedom.to/\" title=\"\">Freedom</a> on my sexy MacBook, internet access is tricky.

  "<p>Prize-winning author Meg Rosoff was born into a nice Jewish family in Boston, Massachusetts, where the emphasis was on doing well at school and learning the piano. She knew her passion for horses was never going to result in actually having one, but managed her obsession with annual trips to pony camp. In <strong>Pony Tails</strong> <em>(Thursday, 11.30am, Radio 4) </em>she argues persuasively that the animals have a particular appeal to women either before or after their child-bearing years. She got back in the saddle again at the age of 48. \u201cIt was like being an alcoholic and coming back to drink,\u201d she says. In the programme, Rosoff visits a conference on pony books in Cambridge and finds other women like herself who still find that the classic horsey story \u2013 which often involves spotting the potential in a beast that nobody else fancies \u2013 speaks to their depths in a way that no other fiction quite does.</p> <p>The Harvesters by Pieter Bruegel the Elder lives in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Here, as one of the voices on <strong>Moving Pictures</strong> <em>(Monday, 4pm, Radio 4) </em>reminds us, the guards would probably shout at you if you got too close. Which would be a shame because \u2013 as another of the expert voices corralled by presenter Cathy FitzGerald says \u2013 in this kind of art there is simply no area of the canvas that the artist hasn\u2019t thought carefully about and which doesn\u2019t tell you something about life at the time it was painted. To appreciate that, you have to get closer than you would be able to in real life. </p> <p>Now, thanks to Google Arts &amp; Culture app \u2013 which offers you access to a high-resolution version of the picture on your computer or tablet while you listen to the programme \u2013 you can get microscopically close. Experts explain what the workers in the fields would have been eating, what particular animal-tormenting game was going on in the background and the significance of the ships back there in the haze. And sound effects add the sound of scythes, the wind in the corn, and the tweeting of the birds. As the commentary teaches, these aren\u2019t strictly necessary: this scene of apparent pastoral peace would in fact have been filled with the sounds of industry, labour and gluttony.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I sniffed cocaine to see what it was like. I don\u2019t gamble except on horses and I drink very much less than everyone else I know.

  "<p>Were Syrians wise to revolt? Aren\u2019t they worse off now? Such questions misapprehend the situation. Syrians didn\u2019t decide out of the blue to destroy a properly functioning state. The state had been destroying them, and itself, for decades. In <em>No Knives in the Kitchens of This City</em>, Khaled Khalifa, poet, screenwriter and Syria\u2019s most celebrated contemporary novelist, chronicles this long political, social and cultural collapse, the \u201cincubator of contemporary demons\u201d.</p> <p>The story stretches back to the first world war and forward to the American occupation of Iraq, but our narrator\u2019s \u201cill-omened birth\u201d coincides with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Syrian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat\">1963 Ba\u2019athist coup.</a> The regime starts off as it means to continue. The maternity hospital is looted and emptied of patients. The schools and universities are purged; only pistol-toting loyalist professors survive. Public and individual horizons shrink as the president\u2019s powers grow through emergency law, exceptional courts and three-hour news broadcasts covering \u201csacred directives made to governors and ministers\u201d.</p> <p>The novel follows a large, well-drawn cast \u2013 a family, their friends, enemies and lovers \u2013 back and forth across three generations. This multiple focus and enormous scope turns the setting, Aleppo, into the novel\u2019s central character. \u201cCities die just like people,\u201d Khalifa writes. So ancient neighbourhoods are demolished and fields give way to spreading slums.</p> <p><em>No Knives in the Kitchens of This City</em> won the <a href=\"http://www.aucpress.com/t-nmmdescription.aspx?template=template_naguibmahfouz\">Naguib Mahfouz medal for literature</a>. As in many of Mahfouz\u2019s novels, Khalifa\u2019s urban environment develops a power somewhere between metaphor and symbol: \u201cThe alley was witness to the destruction of my mother\u2019s dreams, and the idea of this alley grew to encompass the length and breadth of the country.\u201d</p> <p>During the early 1980s war between the regime and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood\">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, Aleppo became \u201ca place of retribution\u201d. This conflict was the setting for Khalifa\u2019s earlier prizewinner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/14/in-praise-hatred-khaled-khalifa-review\"><em>In Praise of Hatred</em></a>, but here the focus moves from political violence to the social and psychological violence \u2013 harassment, rape and suicide \u2013 that comes in its wake.</p> <p>The narrator\u2019s uncle, Nizar, is one of several gay characters. Scorned by half the family, once imprisoned for \u201csodomy\u201d and raped in jail by an imam, he finds brief freedom in Beirut, until his money runs out. Khalifa believes \u201cit is the duty of writing to help break down taboos and clash with fixed and backward concepts\u201d. He is by no means the first Arab novelist to write about homosexuality, but he treats the topic with greater sensitivity and sympathy than, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/23/alaa-al-aswany-interview-politically-egyptian-revolution\">Alaa al-Aswany</a> does in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/17/fiction.featuresreviews\"><em>The Yacoubian Building</em></a>.</p> <p>Nizar\u2019s niece, Sawsan, who is \u201cirrepressible\u201d, swings between the extremes available. As a student, she joins a regime militia, informs on her friends and forcibly removes hijabs. After sojourns in Dubai and Paris, she returns home, has her hymen repaired and immerses herself in prayer. Her brother, Rashid, an accomplished violinist, experiences a similar trajectory. At first he wears earplugs and disdains \u201cthe herd\u201d; later, he throws himself into it, pursuing jihad in occupied Iraq.</p> <p>Shame is a key theme, and the general rage for orthodoxy: sexual, religious and political. A woman is stripped naked in the street for refusing to wear a badge bearing the president\u2019s face. And Aleppo\u2019s \u201ccapitulation to shame [is] made manifest in the posters and slogans and symbols hung on its walls\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The writing is superb \u2013 a dense, luxurious realism pricked with surprising metaphors</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is not surprising, in this context, that the characters are often depicted toiling hard to forget their desires, ugly compromises or snatches of happiness. But their willed forgetfulness contributes to the city\u2019s destruction: \u201cAleppo itself was as ephemeral as the act of forgetting; anything which remained of its true form would become a lie, reinvented by us day after day.\u201d</p> <p>So, argues Khalifa, people must commit to a desperate remembering. The past is \u201cthe sole reason for living\u201d, narrated \u201cin revenge for a present\u201d too terrible to contemplate. The novel (and Khalifa too, writing from Damascus) recalls Aleppo\u2019s cinemas and haute cuisine, music recitals and bar culture, prostitutes and shrines. It often sounds like an elevated form of gossip, each story generating more stories, every anecdote opening into further digression. It has the sense, too, of a lament: four out of five chapters, with an obsessive circularity, begin with the narrator\u2019s mother\u2019s death.</p> <p><em>No Knives in the Kitchens of this City</em> is intricately plotted, chronologically complicated and a pleasure to read. The profusion of characters defuses its narrative urgency, but gives it psychological and social depth. The writing is superb \u2013 a dense, luxurious realism pricked with surprising metaphors. It is lyrical, sensuous and so semantically rich that at times it resembles a prose poem, an effect occasionally marred by slightly clumsy translation.

  "<p>Mae and I thought we were well informed when it comes to vaginas (between us, we have 58 years\u2019 experience of them), but the more we researched the subject for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/vagina-dispatches\">our new video series, Vagina Dispatches</a>, the more we discovered that, like most people, we don\u2019t know our asses from our elbows \u2013 let alone our vulvas from our vaginas.</p> <p>Does it matter that we don\u2019t know what a perineum is, never mind where to find one? It turns out it does. Even though there are lots of parts of our bodies we don\u2019t know well (neither of us can explain the full process from sandwich to stool), there is something particularly damaging about vagina ignorance.</p> <p>Despite the fact that we spend more time peeing or menstruating out of them than anything else, sex remains the primary association when people think of female genitalia. And that emphasis distracts from the stuff that really matters: health. Women (or, to be more specific, anyone with a vagina) can struggle to understand how much menstrual blood is too much, what healthy labia look like, or what to expect during childbirth. Those blind spots make it hard to understand when or whether we need treatment. So, in a spirit of generosity, we wanted to share some of the things we learned.</p> <h2><strong>1 That thing you\u2019re calling a vagina? It probably isn\u2019t a vagina</strong></h2> <p>You\u2019re likely thinking of a woman\u2019s external genitalia. But that\u2019s actually the vulva; the vagina is on the inside.</p> <p><a href=\"https://eveappeal.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Eve-Appeal-Vagina-Dialogues.pdf\">A survey released earlier this month by the Eve Appeal</a>, a gynaecological cancer charity, found that two-thirds of women were unable to identify the vulva. More shocking is that women know men\u2019s bodies better than they do their own: 60% of women could correctly label a diagram of male anatomy, but only 35% could do the same for female anatomy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44404539b3cc16200ceccbceed9d771c36dfa735\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44404539b3cc16200ceccbceed9d771c36dfa735/0_0_1920_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A diagram of women's reporductive system\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">According to a recent survey by Eve Appeal, half of women aged 26- 35 were able to label the vagina in a diagram like this one.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Laura Callaghan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, there are endless articles claiming every woman should have body confidence. Body knowledge, on the other hand, seems like a nice bonus. That emphasis is misplaced: if women don\u2019t know what their vulva is, how can they check it for changes in colour \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/gynecologic/basic_info/symptoms.htm\">a potential symptom of gynaecological cancer</a>?</p> <h2><strong>2 No one really knows what a female orgasm is</strong></h2> <p>The male orgasm isn\u2019t exactly ambiguous. But there\u2019s no standard way to measure a female orgasm, which means that research has begun to question whether some women are experiencing them at all.</p> <p>Dr Nicole Prause is a neuroscientist who founded <a href=\"http://liberoscenter.com/\">Liberos</a>, a research firm that studies sexual desire and function. In men, as well as ejaculation, there are regular, measurable muscle contractions. In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7458658\">a 1980 study</a> in the journal Archives Of Sexual Behaviour, 11 male participants all behaved in a similar way during orgasm: the muscles in their anus contracted in spasms that were 0.6 seconds apart and continued for 10-15 contractions. But in the women Prause has studied, while some had these same contractions, others reported an orgasm without any being measured. (How do they measure these? Using a butt plug that monitors sound waves.) We said we were interested in measuring our own orgasms, so Prause is sending us some. Stay tuned.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/sep/23/vagina-dispatches-part-one-what-vulvas-look-like\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/547h8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2741507\"            data-video-name=\"Vagina Dispatches episode one: the vulva \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e403a4e4b052c716b30dfa\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/22/160921VaginaDispatches_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/22/160921VaginaDispatches_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/22/160921VaginaDispatches.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/sep/23/vagina-dispatches-part-one-what-vulvas-look-like\">Vagina Dispatches episode one: the vulva</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>3 Orgasms can make you need a wee</strong></h2> <p>From a biological perspective, there has long been curiosity about what function the female orgasm serves (from our own personal perspectives, the case is closed). According to Prause, one reason might be that women who orgasm are more likely to urinate after sex. And urinating after sex is a great idea because it helps prevent bacteria from getting into the urethra, reducing the chances of a urinary tract infection. Win, win.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The clitoris is often depicted as a little button. A more realistic image would be similar to the Starship Enterprise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>4 You can build a vagina from a penis and scrotum</strong></h2> <p>At first glance, vulvas and penises look pretty different, but they are actually quite similar. That\u2019s because we all started out as foetuses with the same genitalia; our sex organs don\u2019t start to differentiate until the end of the first trimester (around about nine to 12 weeks). That skin fold line between the testicles? It\u2019s because the male scrotum is the homologue of the female labia majora. Learning that was a real \u201caha\u201d moment.</p> <p>We met Callie, an American trans woman who was waiting for bottom surgery, a procedure where a vulva and vagina are created from the penis and scrotum. Aside from price (the surgery costs around $20,000 and isn\u2019t always covered <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/resources/finding-insurance-for-transgender-related-healthcare\">by health insurance</a>), we were interested in knowing what concerned Callie when she booked her procedure. We\u2019d mostly been discussing aesthetics, so Callie\u2019s response caught us off guard: functionality. She is considering whether she wants a vagina that would self-lubricate (<a href=\"https://www.auanet.org/university/abstract_detail.cfm?id=V8-01&amp;meetingID=14ORL\">this can be possible using tissue from the anus</a>) and whether it would be painful to pee (the surgery is complex and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/08/transgender-journey-recovering-from-surgery\">recovery can take weeks</a>). In other words, really important health issues that most women take for granted. Prettiness? Not so much.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2016/sep/23/draw-a-vulva\">Draw a vulva | Vagina Dispatches</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>5 You can buy weed tampons</strong></h2> <p>Menstrual cramps affect up to 91% of women, and can have a <a href=\"http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/1/104.abstract\">huge impact on quality of life</a>. Given that so many women experience this pain, and that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072507/\">painkillers don\u2019t always work</a>, some women have tried alternative treatments including cannabis.</p> <p>There\u2019s very little scientific research into the effectiveness of cannabis in treating menstrual cramps, partly because that research would be illegal in many countries. But some entrepreneurial companies that are part of a growing US cannabis market are investigating. Once you\u2019ve confirmed that you\u2019re over 21 and a resident of either Colorado or California, the website <a href=\"http://www.foriapleasure.com\">foriapleasure.com</a> offers a four-pack of \u201cweed tampons\u201d, priced at $44 (\u00a333). It\u2019s not actually a tampon; it\u2019s a pessary containing cannabis oil.</p> <p>Actor Whoopi Goldberg has teamed up with businesswoman Maya Elisabeth (who used to sell award-winning edible cannabis) to market products they claim are designed to provide relief from period pain. Their company, <a href=\"http://whoopiandmaya.com/\">Whoopi &amp; Maya</a>, produces a bath soak, an edible spread (which \u201cmay be enjoyed plain with a spoon, on fruit or toast\u201d), a rub and a tincture.</p> <h2><strong>6 The clitoris looks like a spaceship</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019ve been looking at medical diagrams lately (just us?), the clitoris is often depicted as a little button. A more realistic image would be something similar to the Starship Enterprise. Underneath the labia, there are two long structures that fall on either side of the clitoris (the protruding bit). If you\u2019re interested in female sexual arousal, you should know about those \u2013 they\u2019re called the clitoral crura. They can become engorged with blood when a woman is aroused, which causes the vulva to expand outwards, creating a tighter vaginal opening (bonus fact: women have nearly as much erectile tissue as men).</p> <p>On the subject of sex tips: stop searching for the G-spot. Not only because it\u2019s weird to use terms for women\u2019s bodies that are named after men (the Gr\u00e4fenberg spot, after the German gynaecologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Gr%C3%A4fenberg\">Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg</a>, who also developed the IUD). It probably doesn\u2019t exist, at least not in the push-button way it\u2019s often imagined.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrurol/journal/v11/n9/full/nrurol.2014.193.html\">An article published in Nature Reviews Urology</a> in 2014, titled Beyond The G-spot, found that women can experience sensitivity in lots of different places, including but not always the area where the G-spot was thought to be (the upper side of the vaginal wall). In other words, it\u2019s complicated.</p> <h2><strong>7 Your vagina might benefit from a personal trainer</strong></h2> <p>Sex doesn\u2019t always feel good \u2013 especially if you have <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Vaginismus/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">vaginismus</a> (a painful condition that results in involuntary vaginal muscle spasm) or <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vulvodynia/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">vulvodynia</a> (chronic pain around the opening of the vagina).</p> <p>One possible treatment is pelvic physical therapy, which can involve external and internal massages of the pelvic floor area, and the use of dilators (they look like oversized plastic crayons) and lubricants. The treatment is frequently misunderstood, says <a href=\"https://pelvicguru.com/2013/08/05/10-common-misconceptions-about-pelvic-physical-therapy/\">Jessica Powley</a>, a pelvic physical therapist. For one thing, it\u2019s not just women, or postpartum women, who get this therapy; men can get it, too, to treat pelvic floor pain. You can also buy vaginal weights and create your own home gym to tighten your pelvic floor muscles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019re under 60, the best sex of your life may well be to come</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>8 Things change with age, but it\u2019s not all bad </strong></h2> <p>Ageing, and menopause in particular, causes a woman\u2019s oestrogen levels to decline. According to the <a href=\"https://www.menopause.org/for-women/sexual-health-menopause-online/changes-at-midlife/changes-in-the-vagina-and-vulva\">North American Menopause Society</a>, the vagina can become shorter and narrower in menopausal women who aren\u2019t sexually stimulated. Then, when those women do have sex, it can be painful. Their advice? Menopausal women should have vaginal sex on a regular basis. So if you\u2019re an older woman who enjoys sex, you should continue to have it regularly (hooray), and if you don\u2019t enjoy sex, don\u2019t bother (hooray, too).</p> <p>What\u2019s more, in 1998, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/29/science/older-people-enjoy-sex-survey-says.html?_r=1\">US National Council on the Aging</a> found that 70% of sexually active women over the age of 60 said they were as satisfied, or even more satisfied, with their sex lives as they were in their 40s (74% of men in the same age group said the same). So, if you\u2019re under 60, the best sex of your life may well be to come.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2016/sep/23/vagina-anatomy-quiz-dispatches\">Vagina 101: can you pass this anatomy quiz?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>9 Breastfeeding can make you horny </strong></h2> <p>We spoke to Christen, a performance artist and writer, who wrote about maternal sexuality in a one-woman show called BabyLove. She told us that she got aroused when breastfeeding; one time, she tried to use a vibrator while feeding, but got interrupted by a delivery man. She claimed lots of other women felt the same way. Of course we wanted to investigate.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sharecare.com/health/breastfeeding-a-baby/is-normal-sexually-aroused-nursing\">Many forums for mothers</a> confirm Christen is <a href=\"http://naturalparentsnetwork.com/sexual-feelings-breastfeeding/\">not alone</a>. In a 1999 study in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3431754/\">The Journal Of Perinatal Education</a>, the author, Dr Viola Polomeno, explained that sexual arousal during breastfeeding \u201cis a normal phenomenon\u201d, although women often feel guilty when it happens to them. Arousal can happen because there are some parallels between breastfeeding and having an orgasm: both situations involve contractions of the uterus, nipple erection and skin-to-skin contact, and both can involve strong, uninhibited emotions. Neither of us has ever breastfed, but if and when the time comes, boy is this information handy.</p> <h2><strong>10 You can make art with menstrual blood</strong></h2> <p>From Judy Chicago\u2019s 1972 installation <a href=\"http://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/2403\">Menstruation Bathroom</a> to <a href=\"http://www.ingridberthonmoine.com/work\">Ingrid Berthon-Moine\u2019s</a> 2009 work Red Is The Colour (photographs of 12 women wearing their menstrual blood as lipstick), lots of artists have explored the use of menstrual blood.</p> <p>We met Jennifer Lewis, who was one day removing her menstrual cup and wondered why the blood on her fingertips disgusted her. With the help of her partner Rob, she began taking photographs of her menstrual blood in water. We watched Jennifer and Rob using refrigerated bottles of the stuff to make <a href=\"http://www.beautyinblood.com/\">Beauty In Blood</a>. The images look beautiful, but if we\u2019re honest, the smell wasn\u2019t so pretty. We went there to challenge our attitudes because, like so many, we think of periods as a gross inconvenience. We both use a hormonal IUD that stops us menstruating, which has always just seemed like a bonus.</p> <p>Jennifer challenged these attitudes, not just because her art is beautiful, but also because she made us reconsider the health consequences of stopping our periods. Like us, Jennifer also used a contraceptive that stopped her period \u2013 until she found out it had caused her early-onset <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Osteoporosis/Pages/Causes.aspx\">osteoporosis</a>.</p> <p>When Jennifer told us this, we looked at each other wide-eyed. Even though we had been researching this subject for months, there was still so much we didn\u2019t know.

I probably played a couple of dozen games for them before we moved to Brockley, and sadly that was the beginning and the end of my football career. I was about eight.</p> <p>I\u2019ve looked out for them ever since. My dad was an Arsenal fan and would try very hard to cajole us all to go to the old Highbury with him. But my best friend, Barry Delaney, was a Liverpool fan and wouldn\u2019t allow me to support any other team. I\u2019ve always been a Liverpool fan, but it can be difficult to get to a game if you\u2019re not a season ticket holder; so about 10 years ago I started to go to the odd Dulwich match. You could always get a seat, because there would be only about 150 fans there.</p> <p>There are a lot of people here who want to develop the club as representative of the community, the whole community. We have a stand in aid of <a href=\"http://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/\">Black History month</a> and we want to kick homophobia firmly out of football. As a non-league club with those values and virtues, we aim to set an example to the country as a whole. When people come to Dulwich, they see a lot of banners, campaigns and collections. Our eventual plan is for a fan-owned club, and the <a href=\"http://dhst.org.uk/\">Dulwich Hamlet Supporters\u2019 Trust</a> is a vehicle for that. I\u2019ve been elected to the trust\u2019s board and my job is to expand the community aspect.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can go into the club bar after a game, have a pint of a local brew, and invariably the players will be next to you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People look at me and think, \u201cWhy\u2019s this guy supporting a seventh-tier club when he could be a Man U fan or something like that?\u201d For me, a local football club that\u2019s thriving and sustainable is quite amazing. When you go to a Premier League game, you don\u2019t really talk to the away fans. In non-league, you might be going to a stadium with only 100 people there, so you talk to the locals. You can go into the club bar after a game, have a pint of a local brew, and invariably the players will be next to you, perhaps also partaking in the local brew. If you\u2019re fond of a player in non-league, they really do have time for you. You can discuss the game with them \u2013 and even give them pointers as to where they\u2019re going wrong.</p> <p>I do have my favourite corner at the ground and I can\u2019t bring myself to move from it for superstitious reasons \u2013 even at half-time. There\u2019s a guy who has stood near me for seven or eight years. He has his coffee; I have my beer. I don\u2019t know his name; he doesn\u2019t know mine. But we chat about the game and have a great time. As long as I\u2019m around good people and I\u2019ve got my local pint, there aren\u2019t many other places on the planet I\u2019d rather be.</p> <h2><strong>Brenda Smith, 66, </strong><a href=\"http://www.somersetrebels.co/\"><strong>Somerset Rebels</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29ec95a9f6ae1c135d7731f8dea08d8ef0fabbc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29ec95a9f6ae1c135d7731f8dea08d8ef0fabbc0/36_235_3804_4755/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brenda Smith\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Both my mum and dad were keen on speedway motorcyle racing, so I was taken to watch <a href=\"http://bristolbulldogs.weebly.com/\">Bristol Bulldogs</a> at a very young age. I can dimly remember going to Wembley Stadium as a five-year-old in 1955 for my first world final. We went every year. I even remember the turnstile we always went in: C16, right next to the pit wall that we\u2019d lean over. In those days, the riders wore throwaway goggles. I\u2019ve got a collection of them, discarded by my favourite riders. They were like pop stars to us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our idea of a great holiday was to travel to various tracks: Monday Wimbledon, Tuesday Southampton, Wednesday New Cross</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1959, my sister was asked what she wanted for her seventh birthday. She wanted to go to Manchester to see her favourite team, <a href=\"http://www.bellevueaces.co/\">Belle Vue Aces</a>. It became an annual pilgrimage every August. My dad got only two weeks\u2019 holiday a year, and our idea of a great family holiday was to travel to various speedway tracks: Monday night was Wimbledon, Tuesday night Southampton, Wednesday night New Cross, Thursday night Oxford, Friday night back to Bristol and Saturday night Swindon. There wasn\u2019t speedway on a Sunday in those days, so we\u2019d rest and then we\u2019d be off to Exeter and Poole and elsewhere the following week.</p> <p>Twelve years ago, I made a pilgrimage to the <a href=\"http://www.goteborg.com/en/ullevi/\">Ullevi Stadium in Gothenberg</a>. Going there had been an ambition of mine since I was a teenager, because my favourite rider growing up was the five-time world champion <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ove_Fundin\">Ove Fundin</a>, who was Swedish. When I got into the stadium for the practice session, I was quite overcome. I had goosebumps. And last year I travelled all the way to Australia to watch four separate speedway meetings.</p> <p>It\u2019s such an exciting sport. The Oak Tree Arena, where the Rebels race, is acclaimed by the riders as one of the best tracks in the country. The racing\u2019s really close. It\u2019s not always the first out of the gate who wins. Don\u2019t forget, there are no brakes on these bikes \u2013 it\u2019s all about throttle control and the way they drift their bikes, the way they line up their wheels. To see our riders either do a cut-back up the inside or blast round the outside is just mind-blowing. When you get home, you can\u2019t go to bed \u2013 you\u2019re too hyped up by what you\u2019ve seen.</p> <p>I crave that speedway smell. It\u2019s addictive.

So when they were reformed as <a href=\"http://www.ilkestonfc.co.uk/\">Ilkeston FC</a>, a lot of people like me and my husband thought we should go and support them.</p> <p>I was astounded by the turnout. At that first game, there must have been more than a thousand people. Ilkeston Town\u2019s average crowd was about four or five hundred. I didn\u2019t buy a season ticket that first year, because I thought that when it got cold, my husband could go on his own. I don\u2019t know what happened, but within three months I was on the supporters\u2019 group committee, and a couple of months later I was organising the travel to away games.

At a match at Skelmersdale, we had three birthdays on the coach. One of the lads was turning 16, one was 50 and one was 80. It cost me a fortune in bunting and badges.

Our greatest rivals are Castleford, and their ground is barely two miles away.</p> <p>The population of Featherstone is about 10,000, so the relationship between the town and the club is utterly different from that in a big city. Many people think the only thing that can bring them glory is supporting a well-financed soccer team, but they\u2019re missing out. When I retired, I potentially had a lot of time on my hands. I\u2019ve never been the sort of person who can sit and do nothing. I used to write for the match-day programme quite a lot, and to my surprise the board asked me to edit the programme.

  "<p><strong>What is happening with the Chinese space station?</strong></p> <p>The nation\u2019s first prototype space station, Tiangong-1, or \u201cHeavenly Palace\u201d, launched into orbit in September 2011. The module reached the end of its service life earlier this year and was due to splashdown \u2013 eventually \u2013 in the Pacific Ocean. But at a recent press conference, the Chinese space agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/21/chinas-tiangong-1-space-station-out-of-control-crash-to-earth\" title=\"\">admitted</a> it had lost contact with the station. They did not explain what had gone wrong.</p> <p><strong>Does losing contact matter?</strong></p> <p>It depends what the Chinese planned to do next. If the agency was going to let the spacecraft simply fall to Earth in an uncontrolled way and burn up in the atmosphere, then the loss of contact means little. But if they had intended to perform a controlled de-orbit, that option is now gone. Controlled de-orbits tend to be reserved for spacecraft that pose a potential risk to people when they fall back to Earth. If the chances of someone being injured by components that survive the fireball of re-entry is greater than one in 10,000, then the spacecraft should be actively steered into a region of the South Pacific known in the business as the \u201c<a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/this-watery-graveyard-holds-161-sunken-spaceships-1703212211\" title=\"\">spacecraft graveyard</a>\u201d. The module is already below the altitude of the International Space Station (ISS) and so there is no risk of a&#xa0;collision on its way down.</p> <p><strong>What was Tiangong-1 for?</strong></p> <p>Unlike the massive ISS, which is the size&#xa0;of a football field and has the living&#xa0;space of a five-bedroom house, Tiangong-1 is a mere 10 metres long and 3 metres wide. The Chinese used the module to&#xa0;practise rendezvous and docking procedures, and several taikonauts, including two women, spent time aboard after catching a ride on the Shenzhou spacecraft. Losing control of&#xa0;the module is more of an embarrassment to the Chinese space agency than a&#xa0;blow to their space programme. Two weeks ago, in a long-scheduled launch, the Chinese put another space station module, Tiangong-2, into orbit, and a&#xa0;crew of at least two taikonauts is expected to visit as early as next month. The agency still hopes to build a&#xa0;55-tonne space station by 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/21/chinas-tiangong-1-space-station-out-of-control-crash-to-earth\">China's Tiangong-1 space station 'out of control' and will crash to Earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Will the stricken module survive re-entry?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.n2yo.com/?s=37820\" title=\"\">Satellite tracking radar</a> show the Chinese module at 380km high and travelling at 27,500km per hour. At that&#xa0;speed and altitude, it could lap the planet 5,000 more times before it starts to feel the drag of the upper atmosphere and begin its final descent. Most of the&#xa0;8.5-tonne module will burn up from aerodynamic heating in the&#xa0;Earth\u2019s atmosphere. But the Chinese space agency has conceded that some heat-resistant components may survive. \u201cThe module is predominantly a hollow shell, so&#xa0;there\u2019s&#xa0;a good chance a significant portion will burn up in the&#xa0;atmosphere. But there\u2019s also a&#xa0;chance some elements will survive down to surface,\u201d said Hugh&#xa0;Lewis, a&#xa0;space&#xa0;debris expert at&#xa0;University of Southampton.</p> <p><strong>Where will it come down?</strong></p> <p>No one knows. And the vagaries of re-entry mean it will be impossible to predict with accuracy, even in its final moments. Computer simulations cannot tell far in advance on which orbit a spacecraft will re-enter. The Tiangong-1 is moving fast, at a shallow angle relative to the atmosphere, and the height of the atmosphere at any point depends on the regional temperature. But even when an object has begun its descent through the atmosphere, the final resting place of debris is still hard to predict. How the spacecraft tumbles through the atmosphere has an influence on how it&#xa0;breaks up. The most space agencies can do&#xa0;is&#xa0;calculate a debris ellipse where fragments are expected to land.</p> <p><strong>Are we in danger?</strong></p> <p>Pieces of space debris fall to Earth every day, but most of these are small fragments. Now and again, whole satellites or rocket stages tumble out of orbit and break apart in the sky. The most dangerous uncontrolled re-entry happened in 1979 when Nasa\u2019s 85-tonne Skylab space station <a href=\"http://www.space.com/13049-6-biggest-spacecraft-falls-space.html\" title=\"\">came down over Australia</a>. In 2001, when the Russian Mir space station had reached the end of its life, Roscosmos de-orbited the 135-tonne outpost into the Pacific. But even with so much hardware raining from the skies, no one is known to have been hurt by falling space junk. \u201cIt is luck, but it proves that luck is on our side,\u201d said Lewis. The odds are wildly in favour of not being hit because most of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered with water, and most of the world\u2019s population is crammed into a small percentage of land. The chances of a specific individual being struck by falling debris is trillions to one, making death by lightning far more likely.</p>",
  "<p>The recent hot weather here in Cambridge has sent me back in my memory to Avalon, one&#xa0;of Sydney\u2019s northern beaches. When&#xa0;I was first a student, Avalon was the weekend gathering place for&#xa0;the Bellevue Hill Mob, a bunch of&#xa0;law students I knew at Sydney University. The Mob had more money than I did, but the Australian&#xa0;social system, such as it&#xa0;was, depended on the same sun shining copiously on everybody.

  "<p>Six months ago, Ibrahim Farouk, a 21-year-old university student who drove a minibus for extra money, started his day doing a routine job shuttling four neighbourhood men he vaguely knew around Cairo.</p> <p>His passengers that day \u2013 three members of a single family and a close friend of theirs \u2013 were known to be petty criminals and had a history of run-ins with the authorities. Two had served time in jail for stealing a wallet in 2001 and one had been a drug addict. The men\u2019s relatives say they were heading to a decorating job in the suburb of Tagammu al-Khamis, but the group never made it to their destination.</p> <p>They were killed in a hail of police gunfire. Within hours of their death, Egyptian authorities accused them of being part of a gang of thieves that targeted foreigners, and an alleged house raid linked them to a heinous act<strong>: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/egyptian-police-investigated-giulio-regeni-days-before-his\">the torture and murder of an Italian researcher named Giulio Regeni</a>. The battered and disfigured body of the 28-year-old Cambridge PhD student, who was pursuing sensitive research in Egypt, had been found in a roadside ditch between Cairo and Alexandria seven weeks earlier.</p> <p>Pro-government media quickly published graphic pictures of the blood-spattered bodies of the five dead Egyptians \u2013 Tarek Saad Abdel Fattah, 52; his son Saad Tarek Saad, 26; his son-in-law Salah Ali Sayed, 40; Mostafa Bakr, 60; and Farouk. Egypt\u2019s interior ministry said the men died in a shootout with police, even though the pictures showed no guns inside or around the minibus and witnesses described the men as trying to flee when the police opened fire. The bullets so disfigured Farouk\u2019s face that his fiancee initially said he was unidentifiable.<br></p> <p>Soon after that, the ministry said that Regeni\u2019s belongings \u2013 including his passport and a wallet \u2013 had been found in the home of one of the accused, who in death was unable to defend himself.<br></p> <p>In Egypt, officials may have had reason to hope that the identification of Regeni\u2019s alleged killers would put the case to rest. Experts and Italian officials had suspected from the outset that elements of the Egyptian state had carried out the murder, despite the government\u2019s staunch denials. The murder led to a major diplomatic incident between the two countries. </p> <p>In Rome the story that the men in the minibus had killed Regeni immediately smacked of a cover-up, according to a senior Italian official, and was quickly disregarded. Now, following months of acrimony between Egyptian and Italian officials over the still unsolved murder, the shooting has become a mere footnote in the tragedy.</p> <p>Egyptian officials have admitted that the group were unlikely to have had any involvement in Regeni\u2019s killing. Egypt\u2019s public prosecutor, Nabil Sadek, said earlier this month that while the case was still under investigation, the link between the five men and Regeni\u2019s death was weak.<br></p> <p>After initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/italy-recalls-ambassador-egypt-talks-death-student-giulio-regeni\">recalling its ambassador to Egypt at the height of diplomatic tensions</a>, Italy has since announced a replacement, though in a sign of the still-frosty relationship he has not yet been sent to Cairo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2e111040b98b36e60c412c6e0a33d6905583b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e111040b98b36e60c412c6e0a33d6905583b47/0_39_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Giulio Regeni\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giulio Regeni was a PhD student at Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raffaele Marchetti, a professor of international relations at Luiss University in Rome who has followed the case, said Italy had witnessed a slight improvement in Egyptian officials\u2019 cooperation in the ongoing investigation into Regeni\u2019s murder, and that there was an expectation that Egypt could still arrest an official, possibly a low level officer, which would acknowledge some state culpability.</p> <p>\u201cThis has not been formalised, of course, but if you add all the pieces that have been coming up in recent weeks, they point to the idea that, yes, there is the beginning of a recognition of an institutional responsibility,\u201d Marchetti said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the families of the five men are united by a sad fact. They do not have the money or the connections to seek justice in Egypt. Four relatives of the victims have also been detained without any assurances that they will be released. </p> <p>It is a bitter new reality for the family, compared with the their last gathering, on 2 March, when they met to celebrate the birthday of Tarek\u2019s wife, Mabrouka. Video footage of the party shows the family singing and clapping. Salah pulls faces when the camera is pointed at him, the candles on the birthday cake illuminating their smiles. His young brother-in-law Sameh, the person who would later identify Salah\u2019s body, stands in a corner sulkily. Less than two weeks later, three of them would be lying in Cairo\u2019s Zeinhom morgue. Two others would end up behind bars. </p> <p>Salah and Tarek had become close friends, working together for more than 15 years painting houses or renting and selling cars. Salahwould later marry Tarek\u2019s daughter Rasha when she was 14.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cMy brother and my husband were very close, they were always together,\u201d said Rasha, who is often reduced to tears when talking about her family. She said that the accusation that the group was a criminal gang hailed back to an incident in 2001, when Salah and Tarek were stopped at a police checkpoint after finding a wallet belonging to someone from the interior ministry, and subsequently imprisoned for two and three years respectively. </p> <p>\u201cEven Regeni\u2019s mother says the five who were killed were not the ones who committed this crime,\u201d said Um Yasser, the former wife of Mostafa Bakr, another victim. \u201cSo why did the police officers not even leave one of them alive to ask him this question?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/why-was-he-killed-brutal-death-of-italian-student-in-egypt-confounds-experts\">Why was he killed?

His dingy green-walled apartment is now almost stripped bare following a police raid, with the only signs of its former warmth the photos of his sons and daughter left on one wall. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Bakr was introduced to Tarek by a friend some years earlier, and had become a friend of the family. Like Saad and Salah, he had had his brushes with the law. He spent 12 years of his marriage in prison on a drug conviction. </p> <p>It was his son, who declined to give his name for fear of his safety, who would later identify Bakr\u2019s body, before taking a silver and turquoise ring from his father\u2019s dead hand in the morgue. He recalled with his eyes closed and a shudder how his father\u2019s right arm was broken from a bullet above the right elbow. Two more bullets shattered the front of his skull close to the hairline.. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>His family say his wrists were red as though he had been handcuffed. Sameh, who also viewed the bodies, said that Salah had been shot multiple times across the body and in the right ankle and that Saad\u2019s face showed signs of grazing and scars, as though he had been dragged along the floor.</p> <p>The police arrived at Bakr\u2019s family home by 10am on the day of the shooting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3b395fa54414c17628221af1275c57cdc032393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b395fa54414c17628221af1275c57cdc032393/495_114_3005_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paola Regeni, mother of Giulio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paola Regeni, mother of Giulio, during a press conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remo Casilli/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The house of Tarek\u2019s wife Mabrouka was also raided the same day, leading Egyptian police to declare that they had found Regeni\u2019s possessions and documents inside before arresting Mabrouka along with Tarek\u2019s sister, who is also called Rasha. The pair have been held since March, accused of handling stolen goods.</p> <p>The family said that many of the belongings reported to be Regeni\u2019s in photos taken by police following the raid were actually theirs. A wallet emblazoned with the word \u201clove\u201d belongs to Mabrouka, the watch belongs to Sameh, one wallet was Salah\u2019s and the telephone, headphones and brown aviator sunglasses were all Saad\u2019s, they said.</p> <p>It is not clear \u2013 especially since Egyptian officials now say the five were likely unconnected to Regeni\u2019s death \u2013 how the Italian researcher\u2019s passport, bank card and ID documents arrived at Tarek\u2019s sisters\u2019 apartment. There were no withdrawals from Regeni\u2019s bank account and Italian officials said his mobile phone has never been found. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they dragged us into this situation,\u201d said Sameh. </p> <p>Saeed Youssef, a defence lawyer who represents Mabrouka, Tarek\u2019s sister and two other family members still held in pre-trial detention, described the latest statement by Egypt\u2019s public prosecutor as an insult.</p> <p>Farouk, the minibus driver, had been with his fiancee, Aya Khalid, for eight years and was engaged for almost two. After his kiosk burned down last year, Khalid\u2019s father had given him the microbus to allow him to make a living driving people around. Khalid insists Farouk and the other four men knew each other from the neighbourhood, but that was the extent of their relationship. His bride-to-be had not picked out a wedding dress when he was killed, She had wanted to save the detail for last so that Farouk could choose it with her.</p> <p>Farouk\u2019s family describe his body as missing the left side of his face, and say that his legs showed signs of bruising and a severe beating. \u201cHe never hid anything from me,\u201d said his fiancee. \u201cI know for sure he never worked with these people, whether they are convicted or not. That was the first time.\u201d</p> <p>She said she hoped to bring charges against the police officer in charge of the case, but to do so would be to stand against a mass of state machinery. The officer in question is known locally by a nickname that translates as \u201cthe one who cracks the whip\u201d. </p>",

This time it is Jeremy Corbyn being denounced by Labour MPs and confronting the self-described party \u201cmoderates\u201d.</p> <p>Like many of the old left I frankly wondered about Corbyn when he stood \u2013 but in the end mostly found that the complete absence of personal ambition that had deprived him of experience for leadership was one of his foremost qualities, especially when faced with the blandly insincere, uninspiring, but patently ambitious New Labour clones who were competing with him.</p> <p>Even now, I cannot truly understand the depth of the Labour establishment\u2019s revulsion for Corbyn, because I have yet to hear or read a lucid case against his politics, except that he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-is-he-really-unelectable-as-prime-minister\" title=\"\">deemed to be \u201cunelectable\u201d</a>, which would be more convincing if it did not come from those who are working overtime to make it true.</p> <p>The inarticulate anger about his candidacy reminds me of what George Orwell wrote about totalitarian literary language, that it has \u201ca curious mouthing sort of quality, as of someone who is choking with rage &amp; and can never quite hit on the words he wanted\u201d.

When Kinnock was leader, reporters used to meet in the pub to sort out the \u201cline\u201d for events, even before they happened, and in one form or another I remember it was always \u201ca slap in the face for Kinnock\u201d. However, not even in the backstabbing tradition of the parliamentary Labour party were so many members so actively complicit in his attempted death by a thousand hacks.</p> <p>Militant was eventually beaten, by a combination of administrative action and membership revulsion at its eminently parodiable oratorical style, pseudo-scouse accents and rigid self-righteousness. It was what we would now call the soft left, and the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/17/labour-party-corbyn-tribune\" title=\"\">Tribune group</a>, that did much of the heavy lifting. We brought in John Prescott, Robin Cook and others to speak in the Militant Merseyside heartland and offer an alternative left vision to exorcise the ghosts of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_International\" title=\"\">Fourth Internationals</a>.</p> <p>If you want some flavour of that alternative vision it is worth looking at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWLN7rIby9s\" title=\"\">Kinnock\u2019s famous speech</a>, and even beyond his call \u201cto strip ourselves of the illusions of nuclear grandeur\u201d, to his stirring yet pragmatic invocation of Labour values. \u201cThere is no need to compromise values, there is no need in this task to surrender our socialism, there is no need to abandon or even try to hide any of our principles, but there is an implacable need to win, and there is an equal need for us to understand that we address an electorate which is sceptical, an electorate which needs convincing, a British public who want to know that our idealism is not lunacy, our realism is not timidity, our eagerness is not extremism.\u201d That was the Kinnock on whose team I worked for the 1987 election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference2\">Ed Balls: Labour's greatest hero is Nye Bevan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadly the softness of the left was its primary characteristic. After Kinnock, Tony Blair\u2019s people managed to swamp and dissolve the Tribune group and, in keeping with New Labour\u2019s attempts to emulate Bill Clinton in the US, turned the party into a PO box for corporate donations. They squeezed out \u201cspecial interest groups\u201d like the unions, and took the core electorate of the party for granted \u2013 while filtering out potential parliamentary candidates who might put Labour values above their career, thereby disenfranchising the membership.</p> <p>But as Kinnock went on to say: \u201cWe have voluntarily, every one of us, joined a political party. We wish a lot more people would come and join us, help us, give us their counsel, their energies, their advice, broaden our participation. But in making the choice to join a political party we took a decision, and it was that by persuasion we hoped that we could bring more people with us. So that is the basis on which we have got to act, want to act.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s sincerity and vision is reminiscent of Kinnock in that speech and of the party pre-Blair and Peter Mandelson: the soft democratic left of that era,with its concern for human rights and socialism, the heirs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference2\" title=\"\">Nye Bevan</a>. Corbyn has inspired hundreds of thousands of formerly disillusioned members and newly motivated activists, who are joining what they consider to be the reborn Labour party because they think that their views will now make a difference, not be ignored or pre-empted by controlling cliques from revolutionaries of the left or careerists of the right. Entryists hate such swelling membership rolls because they are inherently uncontrollable. They prefer a hollowed-out organisation they can control.</p> <p>So instead of engaging in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1954/feb/08/mainsection.fromthearchive\" title=\"\">McCarthyite</a> smears against the new and renewed members, calumniating them as entryists and disenfranchising them, those currently sitting on the benches of Westminster should be welcoming them and joining them on the streets to turn the tide for Labour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d316106ce2b3f82dea7e8e670f168084e31a2ba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d316106ce2b3f82dea7e8e670f168084e31a2ba1/0_42_4118_2471/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn confronted by reporters at a poster launch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corbyn confronted by reporters at a poster launch: \u2018Kinnock should recognise the media\u2019s treatment of Corbyn.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

It was allegedly started by a faulty Indesit tumble dryer (which is owned by Whirlpool), which was due to be seen by an engineer.</p> <p>More than 100 families were evacuated with 26 being found temporary accommodation in hotels, due to the damage caused to their flats. Nine families, including the Defreitases, who lived in the flat where the blaze started, are still unable to return home.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is most remarkable is that apart from three minor injuries, no one was hurt \u2013 though the trauma, especially for those who witnessed the worst of the fire, may well have a longer-term effect,\u201d Slaughter says.</p> <p>Whirlpool admitted last November that the fire fault exists and is caused when excess fluff touches the heating element. However, it has not issued a product recall, continuing to tell customers that \u201cyou may continue to use your tumble dryer while waiting for the modification; however, we require that you do not leave your dryer unattended during operation\u201d.</p> <p>The LFB has already advised consumers to stop using tumble dryers that are subject to product recall or safety notices.

A spokesman says: \u201cWe have carried out a thorough investigation of this fire. We are awaiting the final report but we still believe the cause to be the faulty tumble dryer.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Whirlpool is in the process of replacing or repairing more than 5m potentially faulty machines across the UK \u2013 under the brand names Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda and Proline \u2013 after identifying a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/24/indesit-and-hotpoint-issue-fire-risk-warnings-over-tumble-dryers\">safety defect</a> in November. More than 810,000 machines have since been repaired or replaced, Slaughter adds, leaving millions still at risk, with many waiting months for an engineer.</p> <p>Alex Neill, Which? director of policy and campaigns, says: \u201cWhirlpool must do more to treat customers fairly, and the government must review this case and the entire inadequate product safety system.\u201d</p> <p>Whirlpool is sticking to its existing position, though Peterborough trading standards, somewhat bizarrely, is handling the situation nationally because Whirlpool has its HQ in the city. A Peterborough council spokesman says: \u201cThe decision on action to be taken rests solely with Whirlpool. Our advice \u2026 is that the safety alert and maintenance programme Whirlpool has in place is proportionate and meets legal and regulatory requirements. The risk is assessed to be low, with a 0.025% incidence over an 11-year period. However, our advice is constantly under review.\u201d</p> <p>There are also concerns this could be the tip of the iceberg. The LFB estimates there is one fire caused by white goods every day in the capital. The Local Government Association, which represents all fire authorities, says there are three a day caused by tumble dryers in England and Wales.</p> <p>Lesley Shaw got in touch with Slaughter after a fire at her home in Stadhampton, Oxfordshire, last week. She says plumes of smoke were billowing from her five-year-old Hotpoint condenser dryer, which isn\u2019t on the list of faulty machines. \u201cI unplugged it but the smoke continued,\u201d she told Money. \u201cThe fire brigade told me to leave the house.\u201d Ten minutes later 15 firefighters attended, confirming that the blaze had started inside the machine, at the back.</p> <p>Whirlpool said: \u201cThe safety of consumers is our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that the modification programme is carried out in a safe and timely manner.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge everyone who owns an Indesit, Hotpoint or Creda dryer manufactured between April 2004 and September 2015 to check if their dryer is affected and then register for a free modification if it is.</p> <p>\u201cThey can do this using the model checker on two websites we have created,<a href=\"https://safety.hotpoint.eu/\"> Safety.hotpoint</a> and<a href=\"https://safety.indesit.eu/\"> Safety.indesit</a>, or via our freephone helpline on <a href=\"tel:0800%20151%200905\">0800 151 0905</a> for the UK or 1800 804320 for Ireland.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is a scene in Star Wars where Darth Vader and his entourage sweep through a corridor of the Death Star. As they pass, uniformed underlings step back against the wall and avert their gaze. Others busy themselves, prodding at terminals and frowning until the caravan of evil has gone. This is how I felt working in a multi-academy trust (a group of academies governed by a single set of directors, otherwise known as a Mat).</p> <p>My first contact with the trust was at a job interview. I knew that the school had been forcibly turned into an academy as the result of a poor inspection, but the headteacher was so warm and likeable that I accepted a senior leadership post without hesitation.</p> <p>I was surprised by the feel of the place \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like a school clawing its way back from chaos (and I\u2019ve worked in several of those). It felt like all it needed was some training to modernise its day-to-day teaching practice. The staff were already familiar with the high expectations and hard work required. Many key changes had begun to embed and these strategies only required minor adjustments and some focused monitoring to ensure that progress would be made. </p> <p>The first term passed enjoyably. The headteacher was a man with a well-set moral compass, a clear vision, expert knowledge of teaching and the soft skills needed to bond a team. </p> <p>Then it was mentioned that the school\u2019s membership of the trust would be legally formalised in the next term. At the time, no one was bothered. The trust\u2019s involvement so far had been limited to an inspection by their advisory team and a handful of headteacher meetings. </p> <p>But then it emerged that staff representatives would be required to attend a residential conference, hosted by the Mat, in a country hotel. As a member of the leadership team, my presence was mandatory \u2013 all senior staff needed to become \u201caligned\u201d with the organisation\u2019s values and priorities. </p> <p>When I arrived, I was astonished to see the number of attendees and the quality of guest and function rooms (this was a level of expenditure I had not come across while working in local authority schools). </p> <p>The CEO\u2019s opening speech was not so much eye-opening as hair-raising. It started with a regurgitation of some half-digested management buzz phrases, such as having a \u201cno-excuses\u201d culture. However, rather than meaning that all present would take full responsibility for pupil progress and wellbeing, this was presented as a means of introducing severe repercussions for not following orders. The room was silent. The CEO went on to outline the trust\u2019s vision for world domination as \u201ca solution provider for governments\u201d. </p> <p>Things then escalated into a half-shouted rant on the importance of people skills \u2013 imagine Basil Fawlty berating Manuel about the importance of being sensitive to the needs of colleagues and stakeholders. The subtext seemed to be that, although pupils, staff and parents were important, they were only important because they were the key to controlling as many schools as possible and, ultimately, moving the business to international status. By the end of the conference, I was deeply concerned about the nature of the beast I had been working for. </p> <p>What I saw back at school only confirmed my suspicions. Despite the school making good progress, the head resigned. Although the reasons were unstated, it seemed clear that he had fallen out of favour with the high-ups.</p> <p>The staff were devastated and we began to lose quality teachers (who were replaced by less effective but cheaper counterparts). The head was replaced by someone who only had two terms\u2019 experience as a deputy but who had the right connections in the Mat.</p> <p>We had three deputy heads in the next two years, and they were all woefully unequipped for the post. Their lack of experience and tendency to pull rank rather than manage effectively meant that morale plummeted even further and more resignations followed.</p> <p>Endless leadership meetings were given over to trivial nonsense \u2013 such as how best to hang paper showing modelled calculations on a string \u201cwashing line\u201d \u2013 at the expense of strategic actions. </p> <p>There grew a culture of back-stabbing, arse-covering, \u201cspinning\u201d of outcomes and bullying. People were claiming undue credit or slating colleagues to senior Mat staff to save their jobs. Leadership treated middle managers with contempt and the language around \u201cdifficult\u201d staff was completely unacceptable. I heard senior leader use the phrase \u201cI\u2019m going to get that bitch\u201d. </p> <p>Everyone worked in fear \u2013 the sudden disappearances of those (at any level) who fell out of favour could only result in this. The culture created even more of the deceit and aggression that had seeded it.</p> <p>The high staff turnover was very disruptive for the children, especially those whose needs required stability of attachment and predictable routine. Unsurprisingly, Sats results nose-dived.</p> <p>After two years I finally moved on. I resigned without a post to go to and my career progression has stalled because of this, but that will right itself in time. In my present job, I am happy in a way that I don\u2019t think I could ever be in an Mat.</p> <p>Working for a Mat taught me a great deal \u2013 being surrounded by such toxic working practices has strengthened my beliefs about what is appropriate in a caring, vocational profession. There may be Mats out there that understand how to embody the core values of learning organisations but, having spoken to many other teachers, I don\u2019t think my experience is uncommon. </p> <p>The extraction of schools from local authority control seems to have created a series of fiefdoms whose self-made princes are almost totally unaccountable. One of most troubling aspects of all this has been that the schools in the Mat I worked in are being improved at a slower speed than if they were in the hands of an effective local authority. </p> <p>I saw a struggling school built up quickly and effectively and then had to watch as it was systematically destroyed. A timely inspection visit would have prevented this, but conversion to academy status guarantees freedom from Ofsted for 12 months, in which time anything can happen. </p> <p>Prior to being part of an Mat, the school would have been regularly monitored by local authority advisers. The leader would have been held to account.

  "<h2>As new owners take over, life in a happy company has completely changed</h2> <p><strong>My company, which works for the NHS, has recently changed owners and TUPE regulations applied. Under these our jobs have transferred over to the new company and we have been told our terms and conditions will remain the same. But it\u2019s been a long, drawn-out process to get to this stage, with endless union negotiations and, whatever the regulations say, we don\u2019t know what this firm will be like to work for. Understandably, it has caused a lot of us stress with learning all new protocols, worrying about possible redundancies and coping with a different workload. </strong></p> <p><strong>More importantly, the atmosphere has completely changed. We were a relaxed happy team working in a caring profession. Now everyone appears touchy and withdrawn; some of my fellow workers don\u2019t even look at me when talking. I have been around a long time and cannot understand why people are acting like this.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>TUPE regulations, designed to protect the interests of workers when their companies change hands, can often, it seems, have unfortunate and unforeseen consequences. By force-fitting people into companies they did not choose, and which didn\u2019t choose them, the kind of atmosphere you describe can all too easily develop.</p> <p>The stronger the individual cultures that had evolved in the pre-merged companies, the greater the chances of a clash, with neither party comfortable with the new arrangement.</p> <p>Responsibility for easing the introduction of these new members of staff lies primarily with the management of the host company. But, given that they probably didn\u2019t welcome their arrival in the first place, it\u2019s not surprising, perhaps, that they allow open divisions to flourish. As long as there remains a palpable sense of two discordant camps, there\u2019s little hope for you of a return to a relaxed and happy team.</p> <p>You and your colleagues \u2013 from both companies \u2013 can go some way in helping yourselves. Never refer, as I just have, to \u201cboth companies\u201d. You are all now part of one unit. If everyone makes an effort to build relationships with individuals from \u201cthe other side\u201d the effect can be contagious \u2013 and a surprising degree of harmony achieved.</p> <p>With time, patience and bridge-building, you and your colleagues have the power to improve the atmosphere more than you think.</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry to put the onus so squarely back on you, but I think, realistically, that this is your most hopeful solution to your understandable unhappiness.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 I was on the other side of this when I worked for a huge firm that bought most of a tiny firm. I worked in business services, so had to bring them in line with our processes and procedures. It was horrible, really horrible. I was in the firing line for complaints and abuse from pretty much everyone. They didn\u2019t want to be there and they were obviously hacked off at having been \u201csold\u201d to us. As I was sorely tempted to say, I had no choice in this, either.</p> <p>Please remember there are people on the opposite side of your fence feeling the same way as I did. <strong>swgirl</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I must admit I don\u2019t have much sympathy here. The author states that not much has actually changed and that the perception of impending change is the driver of their fears. Whatever will be will be. What they can control is the quality of their current and future work. <strong>Tealeaftoerag</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I think things will simply improve as people become accepting of the new ownership and accustomed to changes that have, not unreasonably, come about as part of the new ownership. Just give it time. <strong>Starterforten</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019ve been through a TUPE and it was badly handled, with proposed \u201charmonisation\u201d that the company knew very well it couldn\u2019t legally do. I think all you can do is push up the management chain the feedback about morale and try to get something positive done. <strong>CorneliusAgain</strong></p> <h2>Facing redundancy, I have found a new job \u2013 but what do I do about my notice?</h2> <p><strong>I am facing the prospect of redundancy, with my employer in the consultation phase with the union. I will be asked to reapply for my position later this month. The first phase of people leaving will be in November.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have found a new job, but they would like me to start before my three-month notice period is up. I\u2019m being held to this three months, but am told that my company will explore options for an early release.</strong></p> <p><strong>When I raised the issue with my line manager he emphasised \u201coperational needs\u201d and said he couldn\u2019t see any way of handing my work over to someone else. I now fear the relationship with him is broken, but it has never been good. To me, he just seems to be holding on to resources as long as possible.</strong></p> <p><strong>If I do move without permission, I assume I will be blotting my record when it comes to future references, and anyway, I don\u2019t want to leave under a cloud. I have been there a long time.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>The excellent news is that you have found a new job. In any calculation from now on, please put the preservation of that job as your first priority. Your prospective employers say they would like you to start before your three-months\u2019 notice is up. That might mean \u201cideally but not essential\u201d or \u201cwe simply can\u2019t wait that long before filling this role\u201d.</p> <p>Without sounding as if you\u2019re half-hearted about the job, do all you can to find out their true position. If in doubt, don\u2019t put it to the test \u2013 err on the side of caution. If you decide to leave, say, a month early, make sure you finish all your ongoing projects and leave notes for your successor. Your concern about your future references is understandable, but I hope and believe it to be exaggerated.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Be upfront with your prospective employer. In the industry I work in, a three-month notice period isn\u2019t uncommon. It hasn\u2019t been an issue for me in getting job offers, or an issue for my employer waiting that long when recruiting. If they want you, then they want you. <strong>FatherChewyLouie</strong></p> <p>\u2022 You should have informed your prospective employer of your notice period and, although you may have hoped to negotiate an earlier leave date, been clear about this, too. Have you signed a contract with the new employer? I would always advise this before handing in your notice, with the start date left to be determined. If three months is standard in your profession then the new employer won\u2019t be able to rely on interviewing someone new and getting them to join before you could. Be honest and it will all sort itself out. <strong>AMDavis123</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your company sounds contradictory to me. It is threatening to make you redundant and yet is claiming it can\u2019t do without you. There will be even fewer people to hand over to when the job losses kick in. Of course, we all know logic doesn\u2019t feature in many corporate management arrangements. <strong>DrRachelHooke</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Go sick with a bad back or similar. <strong>bougival</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

  "<p>Sunday marks the end of the 30-year statutory embargo on the release of what could prove a treasure trove of documents dealing with the alleged misbehaviour of the former high court justice Lionel Murphy. </p> <p>These are what are known as the Class A documents that were collected by the parliamentary commission of inquiry that was established in May 1986 to examine 14 allegations against the high court judge. </p> <p>The commission of inquiry was wound up before it could report on the allegations because in July 1986, Murphy was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only a short time to live.<br></p> <p>In August that year, the Labor government introduced the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C00995\">Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (Repeal) Bill, to which assent was given</a> on 25 September 1986. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/01/lionel-murphy-drama-ended-with-a-whimper-rather-than-a-bang\">Lionel Murphy drama confirmed but much detail remains under wraps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Section 6 says that for 30 years after the commencement of the repeal act, no one other than a presiding officer of the parliament (the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the president of the Senate) is entitled to access the documents. </p> <p>From Sunday, the Class A documents can be released \u201cwith the written authority of the presiding officers\u201d.</p> <p>The Class B documents deal with the interpretation of section 72 of the constitution, dealing with the <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s72.html\">removal of judges on the ground of \u201cproved misbehaviour</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>It is the misconduct documents that are expected to open a treasure trove of historical interest. Murphy was the reformist attorney general of the Whitlam government and was appointed to the high court in 1975 to replace Sir Douglas Menzies. </p> <p>Justice Roslyn Atkinson of the Queensland supreme court broadly set out the history of the Murphy affair <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/journals/QldJSchol/2008/51.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=%22cth%20consol_act%20pcoia1986456%22\">in a speech to a law dinner in 2008</a>. </p> <p>In November 1983, The National Times<em> </em>broke a story that federal and NSW police had commenced a crime intelligence operation against a Sydney solicitor in which they bugged the solicitor\u2019s phone. </p> <p>The National Times<em> </em>claimed that the conversations showed the solicitor and others were involved in fixing judicial proceedings and providing prostitutes to a senior judge.</p> <p>In February 1984, The Age<em> </em>published a front page story with the headline: \u201cSecret tapes of judge, lawyer\u201d, with the sub-heading \u201cSydney solicitor\u2019s phone was tapped\u201d. </p> <p>The article said that an unnamed judge was taped talking to the solicitor about judicial appointments, politicians and other matters. There was also a conversation between the solicitor and the Sydney crime figure Abe Saffron, in which the judge was described as \u201cthe trump\u201d. The provision of \u201cgirls\u201d to the judge was also discussed. </p> <p>In March 1984, Don Lane, a minister in the Bjelke Petersen government said in the Queensland parliament that the judge involved in the illegally taped conversations was Justice Lionel Murphy of the high court. The solicitor was Morgan Ryan. <br></p> <p>Later the chief magistrate of NSW Clarrie Briese and the district court judge Paul Flannery alleged that Murphy had improperly attempted to influence them in relation to charges faced by Ryan. </p> <p>These allegations were investigated by two Senate committees, which split on party lines, although a majority on the second committee found that Murphy\u2019s conduct might have amounted to \u201cproved misbehaviour\u201d. </p> <p>In January 1985, the Commonwealth director of public prosecutions charged Murphy with two attempts of perverting the course of justice in relation to the criminal proceedings against Ryan, who was facing a retrial on an alleged conspiracy to obtain permanent resident status for 22 Koreans with the use of forged documents.</p> <p>This was the first time criminal charges had been laid against a high court judge, and in April 1985 Murphy was committed for trial. The prosecutor was Ian Callinan QC, himself later to be appointed to the high court, with Tom Hughes QC acting on behalf of Murphy. </p> <p> Murphy was acquitted on the count relating to Flannery but convicted on the Briese charge. </p> <p>The facts before the court were that Murphy had told the chief magistrate he was concerned about the conspiracy case against Ryan. Briese later told the High Court judge that he had inquired the magistrate hearing the Ryan case and it was likely that the accused would be committed for trial. Murphy replied: \u201cThe little fellow will be shattered.\u201d </p> <p>Later there was a telephone conversation in which Murphy told Briese he had spoken to the NSW attorney general who was in support of legislation to make magistrates independent, rather than employees of the government. According to Briese, the judge then said to him, \u201cAnd now what about my little mate?\u201d </p> <p>Various questions of law about the charges and the trial went to the high court and some were sent back to the NSW court of criminal appeal, which quashed Murphy\u2019s conviction and sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered a retrial. </p> <p>Murphy was retried before Justice David Hunt and a jury in April 1986. Again he did not give sworn evidence but made a statement from the well of the court. On 28 April 1986, he was acquitted of the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to Clarrie Briese. </p> <p>However, the matter did not rest there. The Stewart Royal Commission reported that the police tapes, the transcripts of which had been published by The Age<em>, </em>were genuine. There was a second confidential volume of the report by Justice Donald Stewart that allegedly contained more allegations against Murphy. </p> <p>In response to the judicial-political tempest that was adversely distracting the Hawke government, the cabinet agreed to create the parliamentary commission of inquiry, comprising three former judges, Sir George Lush, Sir Richard Blackburn and Andrew Wells QC. </p> <p>Murphy made an unsuccessful application to the high court seeking an injunction to stop the commission sitting on the ground that the legislation was invalid. </p> <p>In July 1986, Murphy knew he was terminally ill. He returned to the high court to sit, a move that was supported by the government, <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1986-08-20%2F0002;orderBy=_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;page=2;query=Dataset%3Ahansardr,hansardr80%20Decade%3A%221980s%22%20Year%3A%221986%22;rec=4;resCount=Default\">which moved to end the work of the parliamentary commission, against opposition protests</a>.</p> <p>In August 1986, Murphy released a media statement that said that in his view, \u201cpurported allegations ... are either untrue or do not constitute misbehaviour\u201d. <br></p> <p>The presiding officers have authorised the clerks of the Senate and the House of Representatives to access, after September 25, the commission\u2019s records. </p> <p>The office of Senator Stephen Parry, president of the Senate, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAs there is a considerable volume of material that could be of a sensitive nature, the task of reviewing, advising and determining appropriate arrangements for access to the records will take some time. The presiding officers will make known their decision on wider access to records of the commission in due course.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>A new line of \u201csadness madness\u201d perhaps but I\u2019m obsessed with headstones and upmarket fitted kitchens. I have many obsessions masquerading as hobbies \u2013 aircraft, classic cars, motorbikes, marathons, karate, Sammy Davis Jr. The eclectic list now includes headstones of the dead and worktops of the wealthy. In my barmy, bereaved world these are linked.</p> <p>Uncertainty over Helen\u2019s ashes continues to hurt. During her illness, I overcame my fear of needles, putting in lines and using syringes to save her extra hospital trips. Now I feel my indecision is failing Helen in this last chance to care for her mortal self.</p> <p>I share this with my friend Pete, a provocateur: \u201cYou want all the bloody answers, Adam, before you know the questions so end up doing nothing. You\u2019re becoming a control freak.\u201d</p> <p>I asked for it but I\u2019m pissed off. He laughs before nailing me with my own borrowed homily, \u201cOK, soft lad. You say the hard part of a marathon is not the last mile but the first step. You\u2019re avoiding this first step because you\u2019re afraid of failing to do what\u2019s right by Helen and the family. So you do sod all.&#xa0;All this crap about not wanting to think about the ashes because you don\u2019t see them as Helen is a sideshow. Just get on with it, involve them and make a decision \u2013 you\u2019ll know as you go if it\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>This is the toughest love anyone has passed my way in months \u2013 probably since Helen herself but Pete has gentle wisdom wrapped in hammer-to-the-head helpfulness.</p> <p>He has noticed something I thought hidden. In recent years, life has careered out of control due to the brutal stewardship of Helen\u2019s cancer. Since her death, I\u2019ve being desperately trying to reassert direction to the rudderless wreck of everything that Millie, Matt and I had thought of as normality. This \u201cif I can\u2019t control it, avoid it\u201d instinct means Pete is right and so leaves Helen\u2019s ashes heartbreakingly abandoned. No longer.</p> <p>I force my own hand and revisit the cemetery and possible plot \u2013 by a bench under the tree in the older part, with sounds of laughter from a primary&#xa0;school playground and trains full of life rushing by. It\u2019s beautiful, close enough to be easily accessible but not somewhere the kids need to face every&#xa0;day.</p> <p>I start visiting often. It\u2019s a quiet place to recalibrate when the whisky bottle has called. It\u2019s where, imagination fuelled by red wine, I first notice that the sea of granite and marble monuments, although lovely, look like upended, upmarket kitchen worktops. No criticism of anyone who has such a monument, but this image in my head became another barrier as such conformity jars with who Helen was.</p> <p>Worse still, every time I sat in someone\u2019s kitchen, I see in their granite or marble a mocking reminder of my inability to care for her ashes. So I started wandering through any cemetery I pass, looking for inspiration for memorials that shout \u201cHelen\u201d.</p> <p>In the end the solution was simple and Pete would approve because it came from others I\u2019d involved and love. I\u2019d invited Helen\u2019s parents, Ray and Barbara, and sister, Sarah, to view the cemetery and plot. It was never going to be easy, but they seemed good with it. Suddenly one of them said, \u201cAdam, come and look at this \u2013 it\u2019s&#xa0;very Helen.\u201d Sure enough, not 30 yards away from the plot sits a beautifully simple slate monument, a&#xa0;work of art as much as a memorial. It\u2019s like none I\u2019ve seen before and unlike any worktop I\u2019ve drunk coffee&#xa0;over.</p> <p>The search ends. The council\u2019s ever kind Claire confirms, \u201cThat was done by an artist rather than a memorial stonemason. I think he\u2019s in Wales but I\u2019ll get some details.\u201d And so the same evening I\u2019m swapping thoughts with a letter carver and designer who is understanding, sensitive and supportive in creating a memorial that is Helen. It\u2019ll take months, but that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve taken the first step of what is still a marathon of uncertainty and upset but do so in step with Helen\u2019s family. This makes the other 26.218 metaphorical miles to Helen\u2019s interment look a lot less daunting.</p> <p><em>Adam Golightly is a pseudonym</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mradamgolightly\" title=\"\">@MrAdamGolightly</a></p>",

Money was tight, but your father always paid you for the work you did on his farm. He paid a generous cash deposit on the mortgage for your first farm purchase in the 1950s. You were incredibly lucky to have received a large windfall soon after, when some of that land was earmarked for house building.</p> <p>In the early 1960s, your father advanced a large sum of money for you to acquire a second farm and your wealthy father-in-law frequently lent you equipment at no cost.</p> <p>It is accepted by all who know you that two unsuccessful marriages took a heavy toll on your wellbeing and finances, especially the second one.

Isy Suttie is in Dictionary Corner alongside Susie Dent, Jon Richardson has brought a Ouija board to assist him (\u201cat various points I may go into a trance-like state\u201d), and there are two faintly rude-sounding anagrams for you to untangle. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Alcatraz: Search For The Truth </h2> <p><strong>9pm, Blaze<br></strong>Blaze is US network A+E\u2019s first free UK channel (think a more outdoorsy Dave), and this is among its first docs. The Anglin brothers were sent to \u201cthe rock\u201d for robbing a bank with a toy gun in 1960, escaping with another prisoner, Frank Morris, in 1962. They were thought to have died in the attempt. Now their nephews present evidence that suggests they survived, and may still be alive. Despite its reality TV feel, this is an absorbing tale. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>The Gardens of Pompeii </h2> <p><strong>8pm, Sky Arts<br></strong>Since its burial by Mount Vesuvius in 79AD, Pompeii has existed in collective memory as the definition of desolation. This film reminds us, however, that Pompeii was not merely a living city, but one especially famous for its glorious flora; Pliny the Younger recorded 41 varieties of pears alone. In fact, the gardens were part of the reason for the city\u2019s pre-volcano status as a preferred playground for ancient Rome\u2019s hedonistic aristocrats. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f627608eddd5c7e9d745f63b00f4371cfbbc3d80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f627608eddd5c7e9d745f63b00f4371cfbbc3d80/0_0_2919_1752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I Walked with a Zombie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A creepy, shadowy twilight chiller \u2026 I Walked with a Zombie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Monsters<br>(Gareth Edwards, 2010, 11.25pm, Film4</strong><br>A sci-fi romance about a space capsule that has crashed in Mexico, spawning enormous alien beasts.
