  "<p>The FBI is investigating newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal server, its director has announced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/28/us-election-live-donald-trump-news-hillary-clinton\">FBI to reopen investigation of Clinton private email server \u2013 campaign live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The FBI had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">announced in July</a> that its investigation into the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s private email server had concluded with a recommendation of no criminal charges in the matter, although James Comey, the FBI\u2019s director, criticised Clinton as \u201ccareless\u201d.</p> <p>But in a letter sent to members of Congress on Friday, Comey said new emails had been discovered in an \u201cunrelated\u201d case.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cI am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d<br></p> <p>Comey added: \u201cAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and I cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.\u201d</p> <p>At an evening press conference in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton briefly addressed the letter to reporters. \u201cThe American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe director himself has said he doesn\u2019t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,\u201d she concluded, alluding to Comey\u2019s finding of \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">extremely careless</a>\u201d email practices but no criminal wrongdoing.</p> <p>Her rival, Donald Trump, also remarked on the letter, telling rallygoers: \u201cThe system might not be as rigged as I thought.\u201d</p> <p>A US security source firmly ruled out that the \u201cunrelated case\u201d Comey referred to in his letter was the investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee earlier this year. US intelligence officials have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">blamed Russia</a> for hacking the DNC and releasing its internal communications online.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The source, who would not speak on the record, said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to Clinton. Nor is the recent criminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/accused-nsa-contractor-harold-martin-ex-wife-interview-classified-information\">investigation into a National Security Agency contractor</a> accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data.</p> <p>Later the Associated Press, citing an unnamed official, claimed the newly discovered emails \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/792076589190316032\">did not come from her private server</a>\u201d.

The FBI director said then: \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes \u2026 our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was campaigning in Iowa. It was not immediately clear if she would address the matter publicly and she ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the airport tarmac. She did not raise the issue after taking the stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sticking with her routine stump speech.</p> <p>In Des Moines, she referred to the news only obliquely, saying: \u201cWe have got to keep our foot on the gas. Donald Trump says he can still win and he is right. You know this has been such an unusual election. I don\u2019t take any place, anyone or anything for granted. I am going to work as hard as I can until the end.\u201d</p> <p>Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, called on Comey to \u201cimmediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee chairmen\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cAlready, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is \u2018reopening\u2019 an investigation, but Comey\u2019s words do not match that characterization,\u201d he said. \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant.\u201d</p> <p>He added that he was \u201cconfident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate, Virginia senator Tim Kaine, told reporters he had to \u201cread a little more\u201d when asked about the matter on the campaign trail in Florida.</p> <p>The Dow Jones fell more than 100 points after the release of Comey\u2019s letter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/trump-responds-fbi-investigation-clinton-emails-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yj8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2850182\"            data-video-name=\"Trump gleefully responds to new FBI investigation into Clinton emails \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5813975ce4b08d944ba4bb6c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028Trump_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028Trump.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028Trump_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/trump-responds-fbi-investigation-clinton-emails-video\">Trump gleefully responds to new FBI probe into Clinton emails</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while at the state department has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/11/hillary-clintons-candidate-un-press-conference-republicans\">loomed over her candidacy</a> since before she even announced her intent to seek the White House in April. Clinton\u2019s use of a \u201chomebrew\u201d email server left emails containing classified information potentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/hillary-clinton-email-server-connection-vulnerable-to-hackers\">vulnerable to foreign hackers</a>, and her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">deletion of 33,000 emails</a> deemed personal has been a major campaign issue.</p> <p>Trump took the stage to a cheering crowd in New Hampshire shortly after the news broke. \u201cThey are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America,\u201d the Republican nominee said to loud chants of \u201clock her up\u201d.</p> <p>He continued to assail his rival in deeply personal terms. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before \u2013 we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office,\u201d Trump said. </p> <p>Trump, who has long claimed that the former secretary of state was only allowed to run for the White House because of a \u201crigged system\u201d, added: \u201cI have great respect for the fact that the FBI and Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, also pounced on the news while campaigning in Pennsylvania \u2013 bringing the crowd to its feet when informing supporters of the FBI\u2019s announcement. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe commend the FBI for having the courage to reopen this case, because no one is above the law,\u201d Pence said.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential nominee also called on the FBI to make public all emails pertinent to the investigation.<br></p> <p>In a statement, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, condemned Clinton\u2019s behavior. \u201cYet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame.

My school was almost breathtakingly monocultural and white: I was one of three Asian kids in the entire year level, and there were no black students whatsoever. </p> <p>This made it a problem when my teachers decided we were going to perform as Aboriginal people for the school\u2019s talent showcase. Every year level had a different act, and my grade\u2019s involved slathering on jars of school-issued black body paint over our semi-naked forms and singing Carra Barra Winna Canna, a song we assumed was Indigenous, written by a man named Rolf Harris, who we assumed was Aboriginal.</p> <p>We were wrong about Rolf Harris \u2013 on this, and on so many other things. </p> <p>As an adult who now knows better, I unreservedly apologise, especially to Indigenous Australians. And to anyone who asks me what are the dangers in not having cultural diversity in workplaces, schools and on media, all I need to do is show them the photo. <em>Benjamin Law</em></p> <h2>James Hennessy: Everyone had dressed as me</h2> <p>Last year, I made the crucial error of changing my Twitter avatar to a photo of myself throwing a quasi-ironic shaka on a beach in California while wearing sunglasses and a breezy grey singlet.</p> <p>After being mercilessly and deservedly ribbed for my blunder, I thought I was out of the woods.

We had been living in Sao Paulo for a few months, and life was pretty good, but we were young and didn\u2019t have much money so I always felt a little like a fraud among the fashion/art scene people of Brazil. This was highlighted most spectacularly at a party Vogue hosted.</p> <p>The invitations were of course in Portuguese, but we understood them to a point. The dress code said \u201cBlack Tie or Fancy Dress\u201d. I didn\u2019t have a tuxedo so was reluctant to go, but my wife was keen to make a good impression and encouraged me to go for the fancy dress option. I figured it would be fun and to be honest we didn\u2019t give it that much thought \u2013 we were from London, we went to loads of parties, we were used to this sort of thing.</p> <p>I opted for a pirate outfit: cut-off jeans, flip flops, and a hook hand and sword I had purchased from a local toy store a few hours before the party. Eye liner, eye patch, bandana. My wife wore a beautiful vintage ball gown. Ready to go.</p> <p>The party was held at Hotel Unique, a huge modernist luxury hotel and it was hosted by Naomi Campbell. Gilberto Gil was performing. We turned up on the red carpet, and not being celebrities we were of little interest to the paparazzi, but I did feel we had a certain presence and caught the eye. We entered.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying all 600 people turned and looked at me, but it did feel like that. The editor of Vogue rushed towards us. \u201cWhat are you doing ? Why are you dressed as a pirate? And why are you wearing flip flops to this party?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in fancy dress. On the invitation it said Black Tie or Fancy Dress \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? No, no, no. Black Tie or Dress Fancy \u2013 wear your finest clothes, or expensive robes. Not \u2018Fancy Dress\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>I pointed at guy dressed as a Sheikh. \u201cWhat about that guy, he\u2019s dressed up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s an actual Sheikh.\u201d</p> <p>On closer inspection, his robes were made of fine golds and luxury materials. We exchanged a nod of mutual respect (that\u2019s how I saw it).</p> <p>It actually worked out well; I brought a smile to faces, and got talking to lots of different people. We even met Naomi Campbell, who thought it was hilarious.</p> <h2>Lauren Hogan Ross: I pretended I genuinely misunderstood the invitation</h2> <p>A girl I knew in Year 12 threw a themed 18th birthday party: \u201cBritney Spears meets 1920s\u201d.

It was six or seven years after the riots, and I\u2019m a quick-to-laugh, gregarious kind of person, so the idea that anyone would confuse me with an actual bloodthirsty hooligan honestly didn\u2019t cross my mind. If anything, I thought I might get the odd high-five in solidarity against racism!</p> <p>The party was bigger than I expected and drew a wide cross-section of Sydney folk. \u201cPatriotic Australian,\u201d people would guess, only to quickly move on when they saw \u201cfuck off, we\u2019re full\u201d scrawled along my arm.</p> <p>On one side of the spectrum I was upsetting people who were rightly disheartened by the riots; on the other, I was pissing off rioter-sympathisers. Everyone in between just wanted to cut loose with reckless abandon, and my downer costume wasn\u2019t helping. </p> <p>In the wee hours of the morning, a guy tapped me on the shoulder. \u201cThat is a really, really good costume.\u201d He didn\u2019t high five me though, so I\u2019m still chalking this one up as a fail. <em>Niki Aken</em></p> <h2><strong>Adam Tingay: I crumbed myself</strong></h2> <p>The theme was nice and broad: \u201c\u2019Tis a silly place\u201d. So apparently when I go to my silly place I get crumbed. Shorts, shoes, three dozen eggs and five kilograms of breadcrumbs. </p> <p>I applied it on the lawn with the assistance of some friends and a drop sheet.

At the time, my friends and I were engaged in a constant battle of oneupmanship \u2013 who could go to the most extreme lengths? </p> <p>I realised my costume may not have hit the sardonic mark I was going for when I saw the other partygoers dressed in pyjamas, ugly wigs, garbage bags, bad \u201880s powersuits and ill-fitting bikinis. Two of the parents at the party pointed, scowled and shook their heads at my from across the room. </p> <p>I apologise unreservedly, and if you happen to be reading this and have any photos of me from that night, please, for the love of god, delete them.</p>",

I thought I heard it wrong.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI thought this would be a slam dunk for the government,\u201d said Tung Yin, a professor at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, who watched the case closely. \u201cWhen the occupation was winding down, I assumed [the defendants] would all plead guilty because I didn\u2019t see any defense.\u201d </p> <p>One of the jurors told <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/10/juror_4_prosecutors_in_oregon.html#incart_maj-story-1\">the Oregonian</a> that the government had failed to prove a key part of the conspiracy charge \u2013 that the defendants had the \u201cintent\u201d to keep federal employees from doing their jobs. </p> <p>\u201cIt should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove \u2018conspiracy\u2019 in the count itself \u2013 and not any form of affirmation of the defense\u2019s various beliefs, actions or aspirations,\u201d Juror 4 wrote in an email to <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/10/juror_4_prosecutors_in_oregon.html#incart_maj-story-1\">the Oregonian</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThat is always the hardest thing to prove in any criminal case,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cYou almost never have direct evidence of intent. As prosecutors, we always struggle with how we\u2019re going to be able to explain intent to the jury.\u201d </p> <p>Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife, who sat through many of the court proceedings, said she thought the prosecution\u2019s case was undermined by the fact that the US government had relied heavily on more than a dozen <a href=\"http://www.opb.org/news/series/burns-oregon-standoff-bundy-militia-news-updates/government-informants-defense-rest/\">paid informants</a> who were present at the refuge.</p> <p>Defense lawyers had repeatedly raised concerns about how those confidential informants may have influenced the actions of the defendants during the protest.</p> <p>\u201cThat really backfired on them,\u201d Angie said.</p> <p>The mother of eight also argued that the government had failed to make a case that her husband and their supporters had any \u201cintent\u201d to impede the government.</p> <p>Robert Salisbury, defense attorney for defendant Jeff Banta, who was one of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/11/oregon-militia-standoff-final-surrender-met-with-shouts-of-hallelujah\">final holdouts at the refuge</a>, said that the government might have been more successful if prosecutors had filed \u201ccriminal trespassing\u201d charges in state court.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a disaster.

  "<p>The Australian newspaper has run a curious item in recent times headlined \u201cMeanwhile, in Victoria\u201d. It contains stories about everyday state issues, but it also runs quirky items the paper thinks sets Victoria apart as somewhat of an oddity.<br></p> <p>In many ways, Victoria <em>is </em>an oddity. Daniel Andrews\u2019 government is unashamedly leftwing at a time when Australians are more familiar with Labor governments run by the party\u2019s right. We are used to a virtual Labor unity ticket with conservative governments about what economic responsibility means. And we have come to expect Labor to take modest steps on social issues that don\u2019t push the boundaries too far \u2013 it would have been courageous for Labor to support same-sex marriage a decade ago; it is not now. </p> <p>The Andrews government is in trouble over its poor handling of the never-ending Country Fire Authority dispute, and there are constant challenges over infrastructure priorities and growing worries about crime. But on social issues, its progress has been spectacular, and so far it appears not in the least wobbly in the face of a predictable backlash. </p> <p>Interest groups that have lobbied for years on gender and LGBTI issues in particular are finding a receptive government determined to make big leaps, to change the culture in fundamental ways.</p> <p>Will it succeed? Perhaps to an extent, but you can\u2019t accuse it of not trying. Is the government ahead of public opinion? Most certainly in some areas, particularly for people living outside the inner city for whom heteronormativity is not discussed routinely around the dinner table. No doubt there will be missteps and over-reaches \u2013 and too much trendy jargon \u2013 but you can\u2019t accuse it of complacency. </p> <p>The government\u2019s latest initiative is the <a href=\"http://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/health/Pages/respectrel.aspprogram\">Resilience, Rights and Respectful Relationships</a> program that will be mandatory for all school levels in government and Catholic schools from next year. Independent schools can use it if they wish. </p> <p>That the government scrapped religious instruction in state schools in favour of a respectful relationship curriculum took some chutzpah. The program was recommended by Victoria\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/royal-commission-into-family-violence\">royal commission into family violence</a>, which itself was a bold inquiry, followed up by considerable government funding. </p> <p>Respectful relationship classes in schools are having a moment. At the Coag family violence summit on Friday, the premiers of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania all spoke about programs under way or being implemented. Yet they come nowhere close to Victoria\u2019s almost $22m commitment over two years. In Victoria, the program is mandatory, comprehensive and firmly feminist in approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/31/i-hadnt-realised-how-absolutely-pervasive-family-violence-is-royal-commissioner\">'I hadn't realised how absolutely pervasive family violence is': royal commissioner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government says Respectful Relationships \u201cis about tackling family violence\u201d \u2013 it is stated as its primary purpose. That is a shame because, while there is lots of evidence that attitudes towards women are linked to intimate-partner violence, there is lots of evidence, too, indicating that other factors are also crucial, especially in advanced countries such as Australia. And perhaps it might have been useful to focus on preventing violence generally instead of violence against women. But those debates can be had again and again, and don\u2019t diminish the program\u2019s strengths.</p> <p>The family violence prevention group, <a href=\"http://www.ourwatch.org.au/\">Our Watch</a>, is an advocate for respectful relationship programs in schools as one way to reduce domestic violence and it has found its champion in the Victorian government. Our Watch has acknowledged that this approach is an experiment. Few countries have taken such a generational approach, to put together a program to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/19/australians-are-being-told-that-gender-inequality-is-the-root-cause-of-domestic-violence-but-is-it\">transform cultural attitudes towards women</a> specifically to reduce violence against women.</p> <p>Is it worth a go? Of course. We can\u2019t just keep responding to family violence with more laws, police powers and refuges, as important as they are. We need a big shift, a cultural breakthrough, to stop men beating up their wives and partners \u2013 and killing them in alarming numbers (and of course that applies to men being assaulted by their partners or ex-partners).</p> <p>And not only do we want them to stop happening; we want them to become culturally unthinkable. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448308/\">There is evidence</a> that well-designed school programs can reduce relationship violence for young people, who are more likely to be victims of violence than older people. </p> <p>There is worrying research, too, suggesting that many young people are holding on to antiquated ideas. One 2014 study found that a quarter of young people still believe that women who often say no to sex really mean yes. Victim blaming \u2013 maybe the woman provoked the violence \u2013 is still too common, and somehow, these views have to change.</p> <p>The release of the curriculum has led to some headlines in Victoria, of course, as superficial as they are predictable. The Herald Sun\u2019s resident warrior against social justice warriors, <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/rita-panahi/rita-panahi-on-safe-schools-and-gender-diversity-programs-in-schools/news-story/4d3d02c39f2d7a7f015e3c6c3796a567\">Rita Panahi, wrote that it was</a> the \u201ctype of ideologically driven sloppy thinking that belongs in a socialist alliance get-together, not in schools\u201d.</p> <p>You can pluck out a line or two that might make it look so. But look deeper. It\u2019s much more than a program to reduce violence against women, as vital as that is. It just might help our kids \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 to learn critical life skills. To be more resilient in the face of setbacks, protect themselves and others from harm, cope with challenges of modern life and respect each other\u2019s differences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/i-wrote-the-safe-schools-lgbti-program-tony-abbott-its-vital-and-it-changes-lives\">I wrote the Safe Schools program Tony Abbott. It's vital and it changes lives | Chris Bush</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Children in early primary school will talk about their emotions, learn relaxation techniques to cope with stress, about how to talk to themselves positively when they get angry or frustrated. They will start to learn about problem solving and when to ask for help if they need it.</p> <p>And they begin to think about gender stereotypes that are already embedded by the time they reach school. This is as relevant for boys as it is for girls. The materials for older students point out that young men experience violence at higher rates than young women, and that boys are especially vulnerable to being teased or bullied if they are not typically \u201cmale\u201d, especially if they are gay or transgender.</p> <p>For the little kids, it\u2019s about what\u2019s your favourite ice cream, what\u2019s your favourite playground game, or your favourite quiet time activity. Can boys and girls like different things? The same thing? It even throws in the old chestnut \u2013 is it OK for a boy to like pink and a girl to like blue? Why?</p> <p>In older year levels, the program introduces more complex ideas. By year 11 and 12, it\u2019s full on. How to cope with the stresses of study and exams, how to set goals, positive psychology, relaxation techniques, how to handle conflict in relationships, alcohol abuse, looking out for his each other\u2019s safety at parties, and what the law says on sexual consent and sexting. </p> <p>None of this should be controversial. It can\u2019t be a bad thing for young adults to think about how invisible LGBTI people can feel if our language, culture and discussions assume that the only \u201cnormal\u201d thing is to be heterosexual. Or to think about why the word \u201cgirl\u201d is often used as an insult, or why women are under-represented in our parliaments and earn on average 17% less for doing the same work. And most importantly, how these things might be challenged.</p> <p>We have been talking about these things for so long, and while much has changed for women \u2013 and men \u2013 much has not. Gender stereotypes and expectations, reinforced by the media and advertising, are often limiting even though we have had discrimination laws in place for a generation.</p> <p>We are living through a time of big social change, an impatient push by women, the LGBTI community and minority cultures for significant breakthroughs. It will take determined effort but despite pockets of resistance and the messiness of it all, many citizens are ready for it.</p> <p>It will be fascinating to see if this program shifts attitudes and reduces violence. We will only be able to tell if it persists for many years beyond the next election, and that is not assured \u2013 the Liberal opposition is muttering about \u201cbrainwash(ing) our children with propaganda\u201d.</p> <p>Yet the government steams on, at least so far. Its relationship program is just one item on its social agenda. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/15/australia-daniel-andrews-says-he-wont-take-advice-from-bigots-at-safe-schools-launch\">Andrews scoffed at the national fuss</a> over the Safe Schools program that aims to ensure a safe environment for LGBTI students and, again, get students thinking about stereotypes and discrimination.</p> <p>It is going ahead with Safe Schools without the changes the federal government insisted on, with Andrews saying he would get his policy advice from experts \u201cnot bigots\u201d. Victoria is also proposing to allow <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/gender-diverse-win-right-to-new-birth-certificates-20160817-gquvs8.html\">transgender people to change their birth certificates</a> without having to undergo reassignment surgery, an idea proving challenging, especially to some feminists.</p> <p>Before the end of the year, it will launch another first: a <a href=\"http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/gender-equality-strategy-to-be-launched-as-part-of-victoria-against-violence/\">statewide gender equality strategy</a>. This has been in preparation for months, with women\u2019s minister Fiona Richardson travelling around the state consulting more than 1,000 Victorians, including businesses, councils, community groups, indigenous organisations, the media, about how to address gender inequality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/03/rosie-batty-by-teaching-children-we-can-change-the-culture-of-violence-against-women\">Rosie Batty: by teaching children, we can change the culture of violence against women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The strategy will be launched as part of Victoria\u2019s 16 Days of Activism against family violence, a United Nations initiative.

You can argue that a focus on identity politics takes effort away from persistent economic disadvantage in some communities. And you can insist that governments should tread warily in trying to push through cultural change.</p> <p>Yet at a time when same-sex marriage has been delayed by awful politics in Canberra and when the domestic violence sector worries about momentum being lost as priorities shift and the media loses interest, the Victorian government is not playing it safe.

And yet that is only one of its achievements. It also, and perhaps more powerfully, grounds that placement <em>inside</em> a larger western artistic tradition, and utilizes the very tropes and techniques once used in exclusionary imagery to new, more moral ends.<strong> </strong>(The show opened last April at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Marshall\u2019s hometown; <a href=\"http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/first-lady-michelle-obama-visited-the-museum-of-contemporary-art/\">Michelle Obama made time to see it</a>.

Not the shades of brown skin we misleadingly call \u201cblack\u201d, but <em>black</em>. It\u2019s achieved through the admixture of several different pigments \u2013 coal black, or an ivory black produced from charred bones, or else something called <a href=\"http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=591544\">mars black</a>, which is made from iron oxide. The blacks gain further richness through blue or golden undertones, but no white is mixed into the pigment to model the actual flesh tones of African Americans.</p> <p>His small, breakthrough painting <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kerry-james-marshall-a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-shadow-of-his-former-self\">A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self</a> (1980) features a man whose jet-black skin just barely can be distinguished from the dark gray background. A fedora perches on his head cartoonishly, and teeth and eyeballs disrupt the crepuscular surface with shocks of white. Lean into this disturbing, uncanny work when you encounter the portrait in one of the early galleries here. At first the indeterminate, half-visible figure appears an instantiation of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man.html\">Ralph Ellison\u2019s invisible man</a>. Seen up close, the portrait\u2019s gemlike hardness recalls the exactitude, but also the opacity, of Flemish portraiture \u2013 and, indeed, this is a rare work done with old-style, fast-drying egg tempera, rather than the malleable acrylic he would later embrace. (The exhibition\u2019s title, Mastry, is a brilliant, misspelled rejoinder to the old designation of skilled northern European artists as masters.) This \u201cshadow\u201d of Marshall has been cast by Renaissance depictions and minstrel shows alike, and by the constraints of not just American life but European high art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06dc2ad5a7085c29681498ea05635b75fc09845e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06dc2ad5a7085c29681498ea05635b75fc09845e/0_0_3250_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Souvenir I, 1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Souvenir I, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Ziolkowski, \u00a9 MCA Chicago/Kerry James Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Marshall\u2019s uncanny, intense blackness has both a personal derivation and a conceptual underpinning. His figures are not faithful depiction of black individuals. They\u2019re signs, and they channel and frustrate a centuries-long history of representations of blackness as evil, inferior, or simply absent \u2013 before then, gloriously, asserting the prestige afforded to those representations as Marshall\u2019s rightful inheritance. Marshall paints barbershops and housing projects, spaces of black community and independence, and he also frequently turns to interiors: black people in bed, in their living room, reading a book, listening to music. But these depictions are not ends in themselves, any more than C\u00e9zanne\u2019s still lifes are advertisements for apples. His black-pitched portraits and genre scenes gain their force, rather, from the historical tradition they partially embrace, partially refute, and ultimately expand.</p> <p>Sometimes Marshall can dip into a citational mode that gets a bit facile, a bit look-what-I-know, as in a barbershop panorama that features a cartoon white girl in the manner of <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">the distorted skull in Holbein\u2019s Ambassadors</a>. He is far better when he trusts his art history to serve as the mood music for his contemporary visions, above all in the largest gallery of this retrospective: a suite of nine giant paintings of Chicago and Los Angeles housing projects, plus suburban landscapes that wink heavily at the pastoral tradition. A black family sprawled out at a lakeside picnic recalls, but hardly imitates, the bourgeois snackers of <a href=\"http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=7123\">Manet\u2019s D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019Herbe</a>; children in an LA project frolic in the grass like rococo pleasure-seekers, and paintball-like flowers stud the painting\u2019s surface.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8e47a6777ac79f27cf15d62a1c1697e353aca08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e47a6777ac79f27cf15d62a1c1697e353aca08/0_0_5233_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"7am Sunday Morning, 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">7am Sunday Morning, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerry James Marshall/Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These paintings draw on art history not as a crutch, and not as a clapback. They draw on the past as a set of procedures, which Marshall combines and reworks to depict black bodies with a sophistication and intricacy usually not afforded them. Only that way, Marshall seems to insist, can black lives be seen as lives that matter. You can neither junk the past nor outrun it, but you can recode its values, and make the past your own. (A pendant show here, Kerry James Marshall Selects, offers a revealing glimpse of the artist\u2019s sources and inspirations: a stern portrait from the workshop of Hans Holbein, flowing figure studies by Veronese, <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/491419\">a social-realist lithograph</a> by his former teacher Charles Wilbert White, and <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/267361\">a photograph of Gerhard Richter\u2019s wife, smudged with paint</a>.)</p> <p>The very conception of western artistic beauty, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124700316\">as the historian Nell Irvin Painter has written</a>, springs from a racialized misunderstanding of the Greek ideal, as 18th-century aesthetes elevated the white marbles they venerated into the very standard of elegance. (Greek marbles were initially painted, and the Prussians who were beginning to write art history were looking at Roman copies anyway.) That makes Marshall\u2019s multifarious visions \u2013 of black bodies convulsed with pleasure, black bodies racked with pain; black people as heroes, as everyday Joes \u2013 a necessary expansion of the vocabulary of art. But such representations, while necessary, are not sufficient in themselves, and it would be an insult to reduce Marshall\u2019s achievement to a mere emendation of past ills.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9490f4a92f1357736ad39e35cb9b6cfa2a2470c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9490f4a92f1357736ad39e35cb9b6cfa2a2470c4/0_0_7343_4922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vignette, 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vignette, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerry James Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Look, and look, and look again at the greatest of Marshall\u2019s series: his portraits of fictional painters, men and women alike, whose black skin is offset by palettes of seething rainbows of smudged pigment. A man with an afro looks directly at us, in an empty studio of chilly blue. A broad-nosed woman wearing a patterned smock stands before an in-progress canvas, seemingly a self-portrait, that slyly reveals a paint-by-numbers outline. The giant palettes they grasp by the thumbholes are old-style gestures, but these artists are undaunted by past achievements, and absorb all history as their skin absorbs all light.

For the Ancient Greeks, the victims of tragedy were guilty of <em>harmatia </em>\u2013 a fatal flaw that explained their circumstances. For Stoics in the West and a number of mystic traditions in the East, detachment from the physical world frees us from feeling tragedy. </p> <p>Regardless of the merits of these, they can serve as a smokescreen to a deeper, simpler and more uncomfortable point. Each of us is vulnerable to unfathomably bad luck beyond our imagining or control; to some extent, we are in the hands of a fate which isn\u2019t always kind. </p> <p>Being made aware of this can be nauseating.

It requires us to accept our vulnerability. </p> <p>It seems clich\u00e9d to suggest we need to \u201cembrace vulnerability\u201d in response to events like these, but if there\u2019s anything to be learned from Ardent Leisure\u2019s response over the last couple of days, it\u2019s that seeking to retain total control of our circumstances can have calamitous consequences. </p> <p>By seeking to \u201cget back to work\u201d, as Chairman Neil Balnaves said, the business response has been to regain a level of normality \u2013 of control. \u201cWe can\u2019t return the four lives\u201d, he said which, although heart-wrenchingly true, isn\u2019t really the point.

Planned, guarded responses may provide the illusion of control but they also appear insensitive and out of touch, which is probably a misrepresentation of both their intended message and their actual emotions at the moment. </p> <p>Crucially, recognising our limited control mustn\u2019t blind us to the things within our power. We aren\u2019t entirely passive to circumstances. We have a moral obligation to do everything within reason to minimise tragedies like this. Justice requires us to see if what happened could have been avoided: Was the maintenance up to date? Were staff members adequately trained? Could anything have been done to avoid what transpired? </p> <p>These are things Dreamworld does have control over and responsibility for, so it\u2019s both necessary and appropriate to see whether their procedures were alive to that responsibility and to hold any failures to account. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/dreamworld-tragedy-explainer-what-we-know-so-far\">Dreamworld tragedy explainer: what we know so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But investigations like this take time and justice also requires us to be responsive to fact, not speculation.

American Beauty as scripted by Beavis and Butthead.</p> <p>Based on the video game Postal 2, which is famed for its ultra-violence and scorn for politically correct mores, Postal stars little-known actor Zack Ward as the volatile, downtrodden Postal Dude, whose day goes from bad to worse after he\u2019s ridiculed at a job interview, cuckolded by his neighbour and thrown out of the local unemployment office. The original game sees the Dude running amok through a small Arizonan town filled with violent, gun-toting citizens, but Boll instead sets up a battle royale between Islamist terrorists (led naturally by a suspiciously American-sounding Osama bin Laden) and scantily clad, buxom cultist nut jobs. </p> <p>Boll\u2019s favourite trick is to repeatedly show us the Dude\u2019s morbidly obese wife in flagrante with various members of the local populace as her husband looks on in horror from the corner of his trailer.

But when the director treats us to a gratuitous shot of some actual rats within the first few moments, we are reminded this is a director on whom the concepts of subtlety and symbolism are somewhat lost.

Following a conveniently timed encounter with a fortune teller, she sets out on a quest to destroy her creepy father Kagan (Ben Kinsgley), a vampire who raped and then killed her mother.

  "<p>In the tech-utopia of the on-demand economy it is said all can have prizes. Those providing the services in this brave new world supposedly hail the freedom of flexible hours and benefit from the surge-pricing that allows them to hike charges as demand rises. Customers, say the futurologists, love the convenience. There\u2019s no doubt of the popularity of such apps as Uber, now the world\u2019s most valuable startup. More than 30,000 Uber drivers whizz around London alone. The rise of such \u201cgig\u201d jobs, where you start work by opening an app on a smartphone and end when you swipe out, has disrupted traditional patterns of employment.</p> <p>What today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\" title=\"\">landmark employment tribunal has done is challenge the business logic</a> that suggests Uber drivers are not toiling for the firm but entrepreneurs working for themselves. In Uberworld its drivers are customers who pay to access an app that links them with rides. Uber just takes a cut. Why, reckons the company, would it pay drivers wages or benefits when they are its clients? The judges have rightly refuted this key premise of the \u201cgig economy\u201d. Instead they ruled that Uber drivers are \u201cworkers\u201d who are entitled to the national minimum wage and holiday pay. The central question was one of control: the more autonomous a person is in how they do the job, the more likely they are to be self-employed. The drivers\u2019 testimony in the case was pretty damning. One said he was put under \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d to work long hours and accept jobs, adding there were \u201crepercussions\u201d from the company if he cancelled a pickup. He claimed that some months he earned as little as \u00a35 an hour, well below the national living wage. In a <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/mr-y-aslam-mr-j-farrar-and-others-v-uber/\" title=\"\">ruling that quotes Shakespeare and Milton</a>, the pithiest point was lifted from a Californian ruling: \u201cUber does not simply sell software; it sells rides.\u201d</p> <p>This is not the last word. The company has said it will appeal \u2013 and there are another three rounds to get through. Nonetheless the judgment clearly makes the case that Uber is in charge of its drivers\u2019 working lives and conditions. While the findings apply to just the two drivers who brought the case, it will embolden other Uber drivers to bring similar claims, as well as others working in the \u201cgig economy\u201d. In America new technology companies \u2013 such as online grocery store Instacart \u2013 have decided to change their<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-22/instacart-reclassifies-part-of-its-workforce-amid-regulatory-pressure-on-uber\" title=\"\"> workers\u2019 employment status</a> before being forced to.</p> <p>In Britain the backdrop to Uber\u2019s rise is the growth in self-employed workers \u2013 whose ranks are swelling while their incomes are shrinking. They account for more than one in seven of the workforce but earn <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37678065\" title=\"\">less on average than they did in 1995</a>. It cannot be right that a ever-larger slice of the labour market is without holiday pay or maternity leave. This moral sentiment will be tested next month when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/30/job-pay-workers-gig-economy\" title=\"\"> a slew of cases involving cycle couriers</a> in London dispute their status as self-employed contractors. Like the Uber drivers they want to be classified as workers, which would bring employment rights, including holiday pay. What is clear is that ducking out of paying benefits is not a fair route to profits. The lawsuits also raise questions over whether the tax incentive is right: at present a company pays 13.8% national insurance on employees\u2019 wages but none for the self-employed. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good that MPs and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/26/mps-inquiry-uk-working-conditions-pay-exploitation-gig-economy\" title=\"\">government will look at this</a>. As a first step we need to measure, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-department-releases-guidance-on-classification-of-workers-1436954401\" title=\"\">like the US authorities</a>, how big the gig economy really is. <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sharing-economy-87-brits-see-gig-economy-taking-over-9-5-working-days-10-years-1519860\" title=\"\">An estimated 6% of Brits are earning income</a> from gig-jobs.

In&#xa0;the last week, the Commons has seen ardent speeches in support of two good causes, to benches that were not full enough.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, made a fervent but vain case for her opposition day motion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/the-guardian-view-on-yemen-stop-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">to suspend support</a> for the Saudi-led forces in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen\" title=\"\">Yemen\u2019s civil war</a>, pending an independent, UN-led inquiry into whether bombings have breached international law. But 100 Labour MPs abstained or did not attend the vote \u2013 which was duly defeated \u2013 despite a three-line whip. They now <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/reign-british-neo-cons-and-party-war-128790447\" title=\"\">face criticism</a>; even the accusation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/emily-thornberry-labour-mps-blood-hands-yemen-conflict-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">of blood on their hands</a>. Some say they were told they could miss the vote; it is unclear why others failed to attend. In Ms Thornberry\u2019s words, the motion would have sent a message. Though admirable, it could change government policy only indirectly, by contributing to moral pressure. Absent MPs should have taken that chance to make an important statement, but their critics should acknowledge that they did not abandon an opportunity to halt arms sales there and then.</p> <p>A few days earlier, justice minister Sam Gyimah <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/21/chris-bryant-commons-plea-gay-pardon-law\" title=\"\">talked out</a> a \u201cTuring\u2019s law\u201d private members\u2019 bill to pardon men criminalised under homophobic laws which have been scrapped. Tory whips initially pledged to back SNP MP John Nicolson\u2019s bill, but switched support to an amendment to another bill. Though similar, it will mean that those still alive must apply for a pardon, instead of gaining it automatically. Had 100 supportive MPs been present, they could have brought the bill to a vote, allowing it to proceed to the committee stage for further discussion. Jeremy Corbyn, who has a commendable record of supporting gay rights, said that if he became prime minister he would ensure <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2063805/jeremy-corbyn-wants-to-introduce-a-gay-history-month-in-schools/\" title=\"\">not just a full pardon but an apology</a>. Yet he was one of the many absent, detained on constituency business.</p> <p>Both of these cases are disappointing. The private members\u2019 bill system needs an overhaul; the government should not have been so dismissive of <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/procedure-committee/news-parliament-2015/private-members-bills-government-response-observation-report-published-16-17/\" title=\"\">proposals</a> made this spring. And given the growing demands on MPs in both their roles, bills should not be scheduled on Fridays, when they are usually in their constituencies. It is right to hold MPs to account for their voting record.

About 55% of those sales were exports to Europe, meaning annual sales to the EU bloc in that year totalled \u00a32.9bn .</p> <p>The EU applies a 10% tariff to cars imported from outside the single market, meaning Nissan could face a \u00a3290m annual Brexit bill if no free trade deal is struck. It could also face extra customs and VAT costs. </p> <h2><strong>What can the UK offer Nissan?</strong></h2> <p>The prime minister could seek a special free trade deal with the EU for the automotive sector, on the basis that the UK is a very big destination for European car sales and that tariffs could harm EU manufacturers more. But if Theresa May has made promises to Nissan based on winning that argument, it is a very big gamble indeed. </p> <p>That implies some other form of support has been agreed for Nissan. The EU has rules curbing the use of state aid, to prevent countries propping up companies and industries to the disadvantage of competitors from fellow member states. However, there are exemptions available.</p> <p>One exemption applies to companies who operate in so-called assisted areas \u2013 regions deemed in need of economic support. This permits investment in areas such as training and job creation \u2013 two pledges rumoured to have been made to Nissan. </p> <p>Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant is bang in the middle of one of those assisted areas, meaning it can get grants of 10% of the value of an investment project.</p> <p>Other exemptions apply, including for research and development, investment in energy efficiency and relief from environmental taxes.</p> <h2><strong>So what\u2019s the problem?</strong></h2> <p>For a start, if Nissan really does expect a \u00a3300m hit, it\u2019s unlikely that existing exemptions could offset that, even if they were all applied at the maximum rate.</p> <p>\u201cMy feeling is that if it was within one of the exemptions, the government and/or Nissan would have said that,\u201d said one state aid lawyer.</p> <p>Another problem is that it is not just Nissan that wants help. While Nissan owns the largest car plant in the UK, it isn\u2019t the only carmaker here and the others will want similar guarantees and assistance. </p> <p>Other major sites include Vauxhall\u2019s plants in Luton and Ellesmere Port, Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s facilities in the West Midlands and Cheshire and Toyota\u2019s plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire. All of those fall within assisted areas too, meaning they have a good case for demanding their own pay-to-stay packages.</p> <h2><strong>Why do EU rules matter if we\u2019re leaving?</strong></h2> <p>If the UK isn\u2019t in the single market \u2013 so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2013 then World Trade Organisation rules on state aid would apply. These prohibit subsidies designed to boost exports, but are generally less stringent than the EU regime, which might indicate May would have a freer hand.</p> <p>But Caroline Ramsay, a state aid expert with law firm Pinsent Masons, says it is not that simple.</p> <p>\u201cWTO would make it easier to give state aid, but we\u2019re still going to have to negotiate a trade deal with the EU,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK\u2019s ability to do that will be severely impacted if it is not applying state aid rules of a similar nature to the EU.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>So what is May up to?</strong></h2> <p>One state aid lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the opacity around the promises made to Nissan suggest May has decided to improvise, without offering concrete terms.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps as part of the Brexit fever they\u2019ve just decided they won\u2019t follow the rule book,\u201d he suggested. But he warned: \u201cThat would be unwise. The EU won\u2019t engage with us if we\u2019re subsidising our businesses.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

Each of these animals suffered injuries, with some losing portions of their tongues and others needing amputations of their digits.<br></li> <li>In March, a primate fractured both legs after escaping through an unsecured door at University of California, Davis. Another primate was injured following a similar incident at the university in August.<br></li> <li>In May 2015, a USDA inspection found that staff at Primate Products, a Florida research lab, were removing the teeth of primates by hand, which may cause \u201cunnecessary pain and distress\u201d to the animal.<br></li> </ul> <p>Last year, Harvard University and the University of Oklahoma both decided to wind down their respective primate research programs.

  "<p>Weaknesses in Britain\u2019s border security may allow terrorists to get the guns they need to attack London, a report has warned.<br></p> <p>The report, for London mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan\">Sadiq Khan</a>, warns of rising firearms use in the capital over the summer, with the potential for weapons smuggled in by organised criminals being acquired by terrorists.</p> <p>The study by Lord Toby Harris says that a major terrorist attack could inflict a severe casualty toll on London, and makes 127 recommendations to limit the chances of violent jihadis striking, and to deal with the aftermath of a catastrophic attack.</p> <p>The report came as police revealed the scale of the terrorist threat facing Britain, from Islamist, Irish and other violent extremists.</p> <p>Deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu said police were dealing with \u201c550 live cases at any one time\u201d and had successfully foiled at least 10 attacks in the last two years. The Guardian understands that three of those have been in recent months, involving arrests in London, Birmingham and Cardiff.</p> <p>Basu, the senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism, said that vulnerability to radicalisation had been reduced in nearly 1,000 cases in 2015 by the police and others through the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf\">Prevent</a> scheme.</p> <p>Basu\u2019s comments emphasised the concerns about the scale of the threat, while the review by Harris tried to boost London\u2019s defences, with officials believing the capital is the target most coveted by terrorists.</p> <p>In his report, released on Friday, Lord Harris, a Labour peer and former chair of the body that oversaw the Metropolitan police, says more can be done to make it harder for terrorists.</p> <p>Firearms laws are tight in Britain, but there has been mounting concern among counter-terrorism officials about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/rising-number-of-guns-being-smuggled-into-uk-metropolitan-police-say\">increased smuggling of weapons</a>. Harris says: \u201cIn July and August the Metropolitan police recorded 202 firearms discharges, compared with 87 in the same months last year.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2015, the National Crime Agency intercepted a boat travelling from France containing firearms obtained by a UK-based organised crime group. Our borders are not as secure as they should be and much greater efforts should be made to prevent the illegal transportation of weapons and people into the country.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be naive in the extreme to assume that would-be terrorists will not attempt to exploit any such weaknesses.\u201d</p> <p>Police and MI5 have already seen a plot that saw terrorists get a gun from crime contacts as they planned to attack targets in London. That plot was disrupted, but the fear of a multiple gun and bomb attack was stoked after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/paris-attacks-shootings-explosions-hostages\">November 2015 Islamic State strike against Paris which left 130 people dead</a>.</p> <p>The Home Office said: \u201cOur Border Force officers use advanced technology to stop the smuggling of weapons into the UK and act on intelligence from a range of domestic and international sources to stop people abusing the border.</p> <p>\u201cThis government is also investing \u00a3130m over the next four years in new technology to help take on the ever-changing threat to our borders.\u201d</p> <p>Harris says that even with a speedy response and the neutralising of suspects within minutes, a Paris-style attack could leave \u201cdozens of people dead and seriously injured on the streets of London\u201d.<br></p> <p>The recommendations go beyond the powers of the mayor and include calls for tighter borders to plug vulnerabilities, including sea ports. The tone of the report and its recommendations appears different from views expressed by the Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party.</p> <p>The review recommends that doctors report patients showing signs of radicalisation, as called for by some police chiefs: \u201cThe Home Office should work with the Department of Health to ensure that the Prevent duty applies to GPs.\u201d </p> <p>The review wants greater measures in schools to protect against terrorism and says: \u201cAll schools in London [should] appoint a governor responsible for ensuring security and terrorism preparedness.</p> <p>\u201cThey should require all schools to have full preparedness plans in place, with requirements that they are tested. If the Department for Education do not consider this valuable nationally, the mayor should ensure it is implemented in London\u2019s schools.\u201d</p> <p>Harris also calls for measures to protect the mentally ill from terrorist propaganda. \u201cThere is a specific need to bolster community mental health services in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> to support vulnerable people who might be at risk of radicalisation,\u201d Harris urges.</p> <p>The Harris review says London\u2019s mayor should be given a seat at the table of the government\u2019s crisis committee, Cobra, and CCTV should be boosted, with police commanders having greater access to live pictures from the cameras in the event of a crisis.</p> <p>It calls for clampdowns on drones, amid fears they could be used to stage an airborne attack, and more barriers to stop a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/lorry-rams-bastille-day-crowd-in-nice-killing-at-least-70\">truck attack such as that in Nice, France, this year</a>.</p> <p>The London mayor will consider the review\u2019s findings.<br></p> <p>Conservatives in the capital said the review lacked focus. Gareth Bacon, who sits on the London Assembly, said: \u201cOf the 127 recommendations, nearly 50% are not even within the mayor\u2019s powers.</p> <p>\u201cThe danger of a review that is so slapdash is that it clouds what London\u2019s terrorism preparedness priorities truly are.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p></p>",

If fate is fickle, however, it could be over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/f1-lewis-hamilton-world-title-nico-rosberg-mexican-grand-prix\">Lewis Hamilton admits wresting world title from Nico Rosberg grip is tall order</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His battle with Nico Rosberg can still go to the wire \u2013 three races\u2019 time in Abu Dhabi. The German leads by 26 points, and even Mercedes one-twos in Hamilton\u2019s favour would still secure his first championship. But that would seem too straightforward an ending to a season during which the advantage between them has ebbed and flowed to dramatic effect and on Sunday the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez might yet host a further twist in this tale.</p> <p>If Rosberg wins here and Hamilton fails to finish or score a point, the title will belong to the German. If Hamilton wins and Rosberg endures a DNF, the gap between them will be down to one point. Neither Mercedes driver thus far has been able to lay claim to truly be the heir apparent. Rosberg opened with four wins and an advantage of 43 points but Hamilton came back at him with a run of six from seven and was 19 points to the better after the German Grand Prix. He did not win again, however, until the last round in Austin, with Rosberg\u2019s advantage regained through four victories.</p> <p>What has made these shifts so compelling and caused so much debate is that they have not been down solely to one driver simply gaining the upper hand on track. Without doubt fortune has not been kind to Hamilton. His early season deficit was prompted by ERS failures in qualifying for China and Russia, then he lost practice time in Singapore with a hydraulic issue, all setbacks that would be dwarfed by having his engine blow up while leading in Malaysia \u2013 an event that was as unlikely for the Mercedes hybrid power unit as it was crushing to the driver.</p> <p>The early-season failures were compounded by a penalty-enforced start at the back in Spa, while the only major mechanical issue Rosberg has endured was a gearbox problem at the British Grand Prix that caused him to finish third rather than second. After Malaysia Hamilton was vocal in his frustration that whenever a Mercedes power unit had an issue it was the one on his No44 car. He has a point; of the eight Mercedes-powered cars on the grid only his has needed replacements engendering&#xa0;penalties.</p> <p>But there have also been uncharacteristic problems in areas over which he does exercise control. An error in qualifying cost him Baku but poor starts are the real issue: five, in Australia, Canada, Bahrain, Italy and Japan. The change this season to only one clutch with the teams unable to change its settings once the car has left the garage, is one with which Hamilton has struggled and it has cost him.</p> <p>He must not let it happen again this weekend but how it plays out beyond that is made all the more compelling by taking place at the unique challenge of the Mexican Grand Prix. The daunting high-speed banking of the Peraltada may have been neutered but in almost every other way this track is still a ferocious test of car and driver.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/26/mexican-grand-prix-fans-passion-foundation-f1-future\">Mexican Grand Prix fans and passion lay foundations for long F1 future | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The high altitude and thinner air of Mexico City reduces aero effects. The turbo-chargers work harder to deliver the same level of power but with the drag reduced top speeds are high and may well better the upper limits of the current generations of cars \u2013 it will be at least around 227mph before braking into turn one. Equally, however, there is less downforce, to deal with a track that requires grip through the second half and particularly through the stadium section. The power unit is under pressure then, as are the brakes which are difficult to cool and the tyres face extra work from the lack of downforce and low grip levels. As engineering tests go, Mexico poses stern questions and having raced here only once before in the modern era, it remains to a certain extent an unknown quantity \u2013 if the dice are to roll, a DNF here for either contender would be more likely than Brazil.</p> <p>The tight corners, allied to lower downforce and higher top speeds, will demand the maximum from the drivers, with intense pressure on both this may well prove to be both a test of nerve and of will. Crucially, however, here Rosberg has an advantage. Hamilton cannot afford a retirement and should the German squeeze him and risk contact he will have to yield, not something the world champion will take to easily.</p> <p>There were questions about Hamilton\u2019s focus in the season-closing races after he had the title secured in 2015, all of which Rosberg won, beginning in Mexico but this year, with the title race in the balance, luck and judgment may play their part, but there will be no questioning the attention of either driver.</p>",
  "<p>Has Cue Card missed his chance? One of the most popular jumpers of recent years sets out on his eighth season on Saturday, with another tilt at the Cheltenham Gold Cup as his ultimate target, but the general view appears to be that, having fallen three fences out with the great race at his mercy in March, he is now too old to make amends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/17/cue-card-one-million-pound-bonus-cheltenham-gold-cup\">Cue Card going for a \u00a31m bonus for win in the Cheltenham Gold Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cue Card will turn 11 on New Year\u2019s Day, older than every Gold Cup winner since 1969. Kauto Star and Denman were repeatedly beaten in the race after reaching double figures. Why should he fare better?</p> <p>The answer, if there is an answer, is the astonishing durability Cue Card has already shown and those close to him have nothing but positive, even excited reports to offer of his preparation for Saturday\u2019s Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby. \u201cHe feels absolutely superb,\u201d says Joe Tizzard, the man who knows him best.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in his home work that shows us he won\u2019t be as good as he was last season. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be an issue. He\u2019s really enthusiastic. He doesn\u2019t show his age at all.</p> <p>\u201cThis time last year he had questions to answer. He\u2019d missed Cheltenham again; he\u2019d had breathing problems. Now he\u2019s in beautiful shape and just in the middle of April he was running as well as he ever has.\u201d</p> <p>Tizzard was Cue Card\u2019s jockey back in 2010 when the horse made his name as a 40-1 shot in the Festival\u2019s Champion Bumper who somehow hosed up by eight lengths. There have been six more Grade One wins since that day.</p> <p>But the image his fans cannot shake from their heads is of him stepping into Cheltenham\u2019s third-last, seconds after Paddy Brennan had edged him out and asked him to go up alongside the leader. It must have been a particularly awful moment for Tizzard, who quit the saddle two years ago and now assists his father, Colin, trainer of Cue Card and other classy chasers on the Dorset and Somerset border.</p> <p>\u201cThe initial feeling was one of huge disappointment because he was going so well,\u201d Tizzard says, pointing out that Cue Card would have landed a \u00a31m bonus had he won the Gold Cup. \u201cBut by 6am the next morning, after I\u2019d had a cup of coffee and thought about it, it was more like \u2018Thank God\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it could have been a lot worse. We were just glad he was able to get up.\u201d To the inevitable question about whether Cue Card would have beaten Don Cossack that day, Tizzard responds with a phlegmatic: \u201cIf you don\u2019t jump, you don\u2019t win. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>At least Cue Card was able to bounce back quickly with his Aintree success and the bookmakers expect something similar on Saturday, offering no bigger than 8-11 about him for the Wetherby feature. He is also favourite for next month\u2019s Betfair Chase and second only to Vautour in lists for the King George. But when it comes to the Gold Cup, expectations are lower; you can have 11-1 if you like, twice the odds available about his whippersnapper stablemate Thistlecrack, who jumped fences for the first time only this week.</p> <p>Where will Tizzard\u2019s loyalties lie if they meet in March? He laughs. \u201cWe\u2019ll accept what comes. Cue Card has been amazing to me personally and to the yard. He put us on the map. But I don\u2019t mind if they finish first and second, either way.</p> <p>\u201cI just want them both to get a clear round and let the best one win. I\u2019ll be cheering them both on. Look, it\u2019d be lovely to get them both there in the best possible form that we can. It\u2019d make for a huge race. The Gold Cup is the pinnacle for us.\u201d</p> <p>And will he be wishing himself once more on Cue Card\u2019s back when the gelding canters down to the start on Saturday? \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it was the first season. The first season I really missed it and you\u2019ll always have that \u2018It used to be me\u2019 factor.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot more nervous these days. Watching Thistlecrack I was a nervous wreck because I don\u2019t have control over it any more. As a jockey you might get butterflies before a big race but then the tape went up and away you went and did your job. Now I just watch and smoke.\u201d</p>",

However, suggesting that the pill isn\u2019t an almost perfect form&#xa0;of birth control tends not to go down very well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\">Male contraceptive jab almost as effective as female pill, trial shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is understandable. The pill has given women agency over their own lives like nothing else. And women don\u2019t&#xa0;want that great freedom to be tarnished. The advantages of an equally reliable male contraceptive, of course, are much less direct. If anything, the pill freed men from worry about contraception or \u201cgetting a girl pregnant\u201d to the extent that an unwanted pregnancy is often looked on as something that\u2019s entirely the fault of the fool who\u2019s <em>enceinte</em>. It\u2019s hard not to look on all those anti-abortionists and morning-after pill killjoys as people determined that foolish women should pay for their own singular mistakes.</p> <p>Yet a male contraceptive is simply more sensible, in biological terms, than a female one. In her book, <a href=\"http://www.sweeteningthepill.com/\" title=\"\">Sweetening the Pill</a>, and in numerous articles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/pill-linked-depression-doctors-hormonal-contraceptives\" title=\"\">Holly Grigg-Spall points out</a> that men have no fertility cycle, while women are only fertile for six days every month. Women take a lot of responsibility for those six days, while the constant risk is not from their ova but from ever-ready sperm.</p> <p>Grigg-Spall, who is a passionate advocate of raised awareness about the pill\u2019s risks to women, believes that its side-effects are minimised not just because of feminism, which cannot help but see the pill\u2019s advantages as outweighing its disadvantages, because they do, but also because of sexism, which tends to dismiss female problems as trivial and male advantages as important. It\u2019s hard not to agree with her, when comparing this latest research, in which side-effects were given such emphasis, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/women-taking-contraceptive-pill-more-likely-to-be-treated-for-depression-study-finds\" title=\"\">Danish research</a>&#xa0;published last month that linked the pill to depression and gained&#xa0;little more than shrugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"326f276d32f3b896d7d33acdae96480706182717\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/326f276d32f3b896d7d33acdae96480706182717/0_103_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Packets of pills\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shared responsibility for reproductive freedom still seems so far away.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Garo/Phanie/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it\u2019s precisely because hormonal contraceptives have side-effects, and that these vary from person to person, that a decent male contraceptive would be such a good thing. If one partner finds the side-effects unbearable, then the other can take up the mantle. If one partner has been on contraceptive hormones for a long time, he can give his body a rest and ask his partner to take her turn. A male pill would promote the idea of shared responsibility. Which in matters of sex and reproduction still needs <em>a lot</em> of promoting.</p> <p>The pill unleashed sexual freedom on a grateful world. It took a while for feminism to realise that this was not by any means always to the advantage of women. Ever since that time, discussion about the male pill has tended to focus on casual sex \u2013 whether a woman would trust a man who said he was on the male pill, since a lie wouldn\u2019t leave him up the duff. But the truth is that barrier methods remain necessary for casual sex, to protect against sexually transmitted diseases, whether other contraception is being used or not. Hormonal contraception for both sexes is at its most positive as a goal in stable relationships, where it is so important for responsibility and risk to be shared.</p> <p>Yet shared responsibility for reproductive freedom still seems so far away. One reason why the development of an effective male contraceptive has been painfully slow is lack of enthusiasm for the idea. Money for research isn\u2019t there because big pharma doesn\u2019t think men will be keen enough. The prospect of more equality, empathy and understanding between the sexes just doesn\u2019t thrill the&#xa0;market.</p> <p>Unlike Grigg-Spall, who had a terrible time when she was on the pill, and suffered major side-effects such as panic attacks, I\u2019m not against hormonal contraceptives, even if they are risky. I stayed on the pill for a long time, maybe too long, and eventually I couldn\u2019t face it any more. I\u2019d have very much liked it if my partner could have taken his turn too. That alternative wasn\u2019t available. But that isn\u2019t just scientific and pharmaceutical happenstance. I\u2019m troubled by the idea that risks women are routinely encouraged to take are risks that men are not willing also to take. There are related risks that men won\u2019t take either. Vasectomies are at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/24/solder-on-we-need-men-to-keep-getting-vasectomies\" title=\"\">historically low level</a>. Addressing this particular inequality is a huge step towards addressing many others.</p> <p>With double as many people willing to take a contraceptive pill, fewer women would have to suffer in silence for the sake of worry-free sex. I\u2019m sure that some men would be happy to take a hormonal contraceptive. But the market tells us that not nearly enough are interested, while research tells us that even when they are, they\u2019re too risk-averse for the idea to be driven forward with enough urgency.</p> <p>Reliable contraception is a Great Thing for humanity. It\u2019s about time that half of humanity stopped shirking and joined women in engaging in the physical challenges that are undertaken&#xa0;in embracing it.</p>",

After retiring at the rank of lieutenant, he took command of a military unit guarding the prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>King does not, therefore, conform to the Donald Trump caricature of those who protest against killings by police officers. And yet King knows what he knows. He will tell you about a preventable error by police that had deadly consequences on two occasions. It may, in fact, be the most serious single institutional failing in US policing to come to light since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-arrest-reporters-as-unrest-continues-over-michael-brown-shooting\">Ferguson, Missouri, erupted into civil unrest</a> in 2014.</p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/stephen-rankin-military-trained-officer-william-chapman\">first reported in June last year</a> that King, who then went unidentified, had warned senior commanders at Portsmouth police department about the dangers posed by one of the officers under his command. The officer was Stephen Rankin.</p> <p>Officer Rankin was receiving too many complaints about his use of force, King told them, such as using his Taser to shock a 60-year-old grandmother during a dispute about her car being towed, and wrestling a 15-year-old girl to the ground in a routine confrontation.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some people who come into law enforcement who are not suited for the job,\u201d says King, who is softly spoken but intense. \u201cStephen Rankin was one of those people.\u201d</p> <p>Rankin had the capacity to \u201ccause a riot at a church social,\u201d as King puts it. \u201cHe could go to any event and it would just escalate out of control in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Previously reluctant to speak publicly, King agreed to be interviewed for a powerful documentary, which builds on the Guardian\u2019s reporting, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/44/unarmed-black-male\">airs on BBC2 on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>King says he asked internal affairs investigators working for Portsmouth police chief Ed Hargis to look into the repeated complaints about Rankin\u2019s excessive force, but the officer was allowed to continue policing the public.

One morning last year, he did it again.</p> <p>\u201cWe missed an opportunity to get rid of this officer a long time ago,\u201d says King. \u201cAnd no one\u2019s better off because we didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>Portsmouth is an old harbour and plantation town, part of the Tidewater region, about halfway down the Atlantic coast. More than half of its 96,000 residents are black. Its colonial heritage and contemporary culture mix curiously. US naval vessels are still repaired and upgraded at its vast 250-year-old shipyard, which was once a useful outpost for the British crown. It is also the birthplace of Missy Elliott, the rapper and producer. Rankin, like many men in the area, landed in Portsmouth with the US navy. As a 22-year-old raised in California, he had met Cori Johnson, a 17-year-old rebel from an evangelical Christian family. He proposed after six weeks. They married and had a daughter. She followed him across the US on his naval postings and waited while he was deployed as a military policeman to Kuwait, to aid the US war effort in Iraq.</p> <p>Discharged in Portsmouth in 2007 after five years, Rankin decided to become a policeman. He was rejected by several departments for having used methamphetamine in his youth. \u201cI did it ONE TIME when I was 16,\u201d he complained later, on an online forum. But Rankin was eventually accepted at Portsmouth, a department with a strong military streak thanks to the local base.</p> <p>Johnson told the documentary makers that as complaints from the public about his violence piled up, Rankin said they merely proved he was doing his job properly. He also became obsessed with a particular premise for a police officer opening fire on a suspect. He would return to this hypothetical constantly in conversations with colleagues, she said.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019d be justified in shooting somebody if they put their hand on their waistband?\u201d he would ask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cc7743b599abb2ebc819404e5f8539e476e270a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cc7743b599abb2ebc819404e5f8539e476e270a/75_32_1731_1039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chapman\u2019s mother Sallie holding a vigil outside Walmart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chapman\u2019s mother Sallie holding a vigil outside Walmart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rankin\u2019s marriage began to deteriorate, and ended in divorce. King\u2019s efforts to have Rankin removed from the streets were in vain. But on the evening of 23 April 2011, Rankin answered a 911 call reporting someone banging on the front door of an apartment building in Portsmouth\u2019s historic Olde Towne area.</p> <p>Kirill Denyakin, a cook from Kazakhstan who was living in the town, had been drinking too much while out with friends. Denyakin had ended up outside the apartment building in question, where he had been staying, and began rapping incessantly on the glass door. Footage from a dashboard camera in Rankin\u2019s car shows the officer arriving in response to the 911 call and leaping over a grass verge. Seconds after he disappears from view, 11 gunshots are heard.</p> <p>Photographs taken at the scene showed that Denyakin ended up with his jeans around his ankles. Friends suggested he had been urinating. Certainly he had no weapon. But Rankin claimed he had been forced to fire his gun repeatedly because the 26-year-old turned, charged toward the officer aggressively \u2013 and reached into his waistband.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I read his statement in the newspaper, that he had said \u2018hand on the waistband\u2019, a chill went up my spine,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI realised this was not a standard line-of-duty shooting. I realised this was what he\u2019d been waiting for.\u201d</p> <p>King adds: \u201cI think you could have put 100 other officers in that same situation and you would not have had that same outcome.\u201d</p> <p>In those pre-Ferguson days, Rankin avoided criminal charges and the national spotlight. Denyakin\u2019s family sued in the civil courts for $22m (\u00a318m). After they rejected an offer of a small settlement, however, the jury at trial <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2012/03/jury-portsmouth-officer-not-liable-shooting-death\">sided with Rankin</a>, accepting his claim that he was forced to fire because he feared for his life, and awarding the family no damages. Denyakin\u2019s mother, Yelena, went home distraught and empty-handed. Denyakin\u2019s family had also come under attack in the comments section of the Virginian-Pilot, their local newspaper. \u201c22 mil wont buy your boy back,\u201d wrote one observer, under the username yourealythinkthat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3da782c63ef37aed6da0309d2bc4e871f95604e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3da782c63ef37aed6da0309d2bc4e871f95604e8/30_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kirill Denyakin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirill Denyakin was shot within seconds of Rankin arriving at an apartment where an inebriated Denyakin was banging on the door.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Video</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most Americans, the commenter said, could not hope to earn such a sum in their entire career, \u201clet alone a habitual drunk working as a hotel cook\u201d.

A long-dormant debate about race and policing was forced back to the top of the domestic political agenda. And the discord was about to enter a second phase. In Baltimore, Maryland, 22-year-old Freddie Gray had just died of a broken neck after being driven around shackled in the back of a police van without a seatbelt. Demonstrations turned into clashes with police, rioting and arson.</p> <p>It meant the country was already preoccupied by the in-custody death of a young African American man when Rankin took that early-morning 911 call and confronted 18-year-old William Chapman in the Walmart\u2019s vast car park.</p> <p>Rankin was not in a good mood. \u201cI hate this job,\u201d Rankin, who was 34, had told a colleague in a mobile message about an hour earlier. \u201cSeen too much bad and not enough good.\u201d The colleague brushed aside his complaints, but Rankin insisted. \u201cThe city sucks, but so does the rest of the world. People are just bad,\u201d he said. He made an allusion to the condemned biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p> <p>Then, as Rankin tried to detain Chapman, the 18-year-old defied him. \u201cTake your hand out your pocket,\u201d Rankin said, as they began to struggle at Rankin\u2019s squad car. \u201cTake your hand out your pocket.\u201d Rankin drew his Taser, which had an in-built camera that recorded their exchange. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna Tase me, cos you\u2019re not gonna arrest me for nothing,\u201d Chapman told him, before knocking the Taser to the ground. The pair split apart and stood face to face, separated by the car.</p> <p>What happened next is sharply disputed. A Walmart security worker, a young black man named Gregory Provo, said Chapman took a \u201cjab step\u201d \u2013 an upper-body jerk meant to make an opponent flinch. \u201cHe never charged, he just made a gesture,\u201d said Provo. Rankin and some white builders working nearby claimed that Chapman advanced towards the officer.

The number of officers charged with crimes for deadly shootings in 2015 across the country was three times higher than in recent years. Meanwhile, in Portsmouth, the white, male Republican prosecutor who oversaw Rankin\u2019s avoidance of charges for killing Denyakin was gone. In his place was <a href=\"http://www.portsmouthcwa.com/commonwealths-attorney\">Stephanie Morales</a>, a recently elected black Democrat, just 31 years old.</p> <p>In August last year, Morales announced that she would pursue criminal charges against Rankin for killing Chapman. The following month, a grand jury <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/03/us/virginia-police-shooting-murder-charge\">returned an indictment</a> of first-degree murder \u2013 still a highly unusual charge for a police shooting. Rankin was also terminated from his job.</p> <p>The documentary follows Rankin and the Chapmans through the murder trial, which spanned two sweltering weeks in summer. As a steady stream of controversial shootings by police continued to flow across the US, extensive security measures were installed at Portsmouth courthouse, where officers stationed on the roof scanned the area for potential danger.</p> <p>Rankin was protected by a coterie of armed deputies dressed like soldiers. \u201cWe had some pretty credible threats on our lives,\u201d said his second wife, Dawn.</p> <p>Funded by her friends and neighbours, Yelena Denyakin flew back to Virginia to see Rankin in the dock. Jointly determined to see him punished this time, Denyakin and Sallie Chapman, William\u2019s mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/william-chapman-kirill-denyakina-murder-trial-stephen-rankin-virginia\">forged an unlikely partnership</a> \u201cRankin didn\u2019t just kill my son,\u201d said Denyakin. \u201cHe destroyed our whole family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I get justice, then we get justice together,\u201d said Chapman.</p> <p>Unshaven and dishevelled, the former officer gave his first and only public interview for the film, breaking an unspoken omert\u00e0 among officers that typically follows deadly encounters. \u201cHaving to shoot someone,\u201d said Rankin, is \u201cnot as easy as it looks in the movies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd575e0b94659e29fe2cea9f0b2605e651443d1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd575e0b94659e29fe2cea9f0b2605e651443d1d/8_8_1046_627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The victim\u2019s mothers Yelena Denyakin and Sallie Chapman before Rankin\u2019s trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The victim\u2019s mothers Yelena Denyakin and Sallie Chapman before Rankin\u2019s trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While offering sympathy to the Chapmans, Rankin remains convinced of his propriety, and aggrieved at his treatment, which he contrasts with the \u201cthree weeks and a medal\u201d \u2013 paid leave and a commendation for bravery \u2013 that he claims ordinarily would be expected. \u201cI did exactly what I was trained to do,\u201d said Rankin. \u201cI did my job, and I really feel like I\u2019m being punished for doing exactly what I was supposed to do.\u201d</p> <p>Pre-trial wrangling resulted in rulings that jurors would not hear about Rankin\u2019s first deadly shooting. Nor, though, would they learn of childhood offences committed by Chapman, who was sent to a juvenile prison after bringing to school a cigarette lighter styled like a pistol.</p> <p>Inside the courtroom, America\u2019s troubling racial divide played out in miniature. Morales was joined in prosecuting Rankin by her black deputy; Rankin\u2019s attorneys were white. While one half of the public gallery filled each morning with Rankin\u2019s white supporters, Chapman\u2019s family filled the other side with black friends and activists. Even eyewitnesses and jurors divided along racial lines.</p> <p>The days were thick with tension. \u201cHe and his wife are sitting there peacefully,\u201d Yelena Denyakin said during one sunny lunch break. \u201cSoon their peace should come to an end.\u201d</p> <p>Morales, styled as naive by local media for daring to charge an officer with murder, was fighting for her political future. She faced off aggressively against attorney James Broccoletti, a grizzled veteran defending Rankin after getting a man cleared of murder despite his fingerprints being found on bags the body was wrapped in.</p> <p>Rankin, facing a potential life sentence if convicted, was clinging to his freedom, to his chances of working again as a police officer \u2013 and to his right to ever again own a gun.</p> <p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s not just me that\u2019s on trial,\u201d said Rankin. \u201cI believe it\u2019s all American police officers.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Unarmed Black Male will be broadcast on BBC2 at 9pm on Wednesday 2 November</p>",

Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u2019s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u2019s economic performance.</p> <p>Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency.

This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer.</p> <p>The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements.</p> <p>In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u2019s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view.</p> <p>Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable.</p> <p>We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5/0_39_1638_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u2019s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues.</p> <p>These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u2019s institutional strengths. </p> <p>The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers. In our opinion, significant net immigration into the U.K. over the past decade helped its economic performance.

On Thursday the World Anti-Doping Agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/27/wada-serious-failings-rio-2016-olympics-anti-doping\" title=\"\">published a report on the anti-doping programme at the 2016 Olympics</a>, written by a team of independent observers working in Rio this summer. It catalogued, in comprehensive detail, \u201ca number of serious failings\u201d in the anti-doping programme, which was so under\u2011resourced, badly designed and poorly administered that it was strained \u201cclose to the breaking point\u201d and would have \u201calmost certainly collapsed\u201d if it had not been for the \u201cinitiative, tenacity and professionalism\u201d of the men and women working on the ground during the Games.</p> <p>On Friday morning, less than 24 hours later, the IOC <a href=\"https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-welcomes-io-report-on-rio-2016-anti-doping-programme\" title=\"\">released a statement</a> welcoming that same report which, it says, \u201cshows that it was a successful Olympic Games with a successful anti\u2011doping programme\u201d. And it is true, within the report\u2019s 55 pages, it does say that there were some \u201cimpressive advances\u201d in certain areas of the anti-doping programme at Rio. Shut one eye, skim the first paragraphs, then skip the rest and you might reasonably conclude, as the IOC\u2019s medical and scientific director, Dr Richard Budgett, apparently has, that \u201cthe integrity of the programme was ensured despite some challenges the Organising Committee had to overcome\u201d.</p> <p>Surprisingly, however, the IOC\u2019s press department seems to have been the only media body who decided that the headline takeaway from the report was that everything is tickety-boo. The rest of the world\u2019s press were rather more preoccupied with other little details, like the fact that more than a third of athletes competing in Rio were not subjected to drugs testing before the Games in 2016 and that, of those, 1,913 were competing in one of the 10 \u201chigh-risk sports\u201d. Or that there was no out-of-competition testing for some events, limited in-competition testing in others and no in-competition blood testing in a third group, including weightlifting.</p> <p>Taken altogether, the report reads like something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/josephheller\" title=\"\">Joseph Heller</a> might have cooked up if he had set out to write a satirical novel about institutional incompetence in the Olympics instead of the air force. There was insufficient training for the staff, a shortage of IT equipment and an utterly chaotic schedule. There were neither hotels for the control officers, meal tickets for the chaperones or reliable transport for those working at night to get away once they had finished. The upshot was that there were days when 50% of the planned tests could not go ahead and at the end of the Games 500 fewer tests were conducted than had been intended.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/27/wada-serious-failings-rio-2016-olympics-anti-doping\">Wada reveals up to 50% of drug tests at 2016 Olympic Games had to be aborted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese various logistical issues,\u201d the report notes, \u201cwere foreseeable and entirely avoidable\u201d.

  "<p>I\u2019m 95 years old. I was born in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire, just after the end of the first world war, which rather loomed over my childhood. It was the period of the world slump, a time of strikes and unemployment. I had pacifist leanings, but spent five years in the army and, after finishing my degree in history and my diploma, I became a teacher, which I did for over 20 years, teaching English, history and French. I was also the principal of the Royal National College for the Blind, and the warden of an adults\u2019 education centre.</p> <p>My wife Rosemary and I live in Ludlow in Shropshire. We have four children and, as well as grandchildren, we also have four great-grandchildren.</p> <p>I voted Labour after the war. In 1953 I decided that growing inequality was the problem. This is now even more important, as the rich continue to get richer and we do nothing about collecting unearned income. I was attracted to the Liberals because of Lloyd George\u2019s people\u2019s budget, and I joined the Liberal party and started reading the Guardian. I wrote letters to the paper (and continue to do so), especially about land, and some were published. Taxation of land values is a cause we have to pursue. The sale of council houses made people think they owned the rise in land value, but they don\u2019t. I always felt that the only way of doing things was through politics. I stood for parliament in 1979 and blame myself for Mrs Thatcher\u2019s victory (I came second in my constituency).</p> <p>I was a councillor and involved with founding Home Start \u2013 a family support charity \u2013 in Ludlow. I also worked as a marriage guidance counsellor, was involved in the community centre, and helped set up the youth centre. The latter is desperately important in light of how badly we are treating so many younger people; look at child poverty and the housing crisis.</p> <p>I followed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers\">Panama papers</a> revelations about the hidden trillions salted into the rich end of society. Why we are not more outraged about this I don\u2019t know. Now in light of the ghastly Brexit decision we\u2019re in even more trouble. But I\u2019m still hopeful, which many of my contemporaries don\u2019t seem to be. We are kinder than we were. There\u2019s hope. The Guardian\u2019s way of dealing with politics, with the rational view that law, education and good government are the way forward has to be stood up for. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s press has done a grave disservice to this country. I\u2019ve been reading the paper for over 50 years so have seen lots of writers come and go. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Bartlett\">Vernon Bartlett</a> was an excellent foreign correspondent. These days, some of the younger journalists I find very good indeed.

  "<p>As a solicitor contacted by a friend of one of the men arrested in connection with the alleged plot in 2002 to kidnap Victoria Beckham, and asked to represent him, I recall when I attended Charing Cross police station where the suspects were being held following their arrest, finding to my surprise that the police that day knew about as much about the case as I did, or possibly a little less, as I\u2019d had the advantage of reading the story splashed&#xa0;across the News of the World that morning.</p> <p>This, of course, was because the case had been \u201cinvestigated\u201d and prepared by Mazher Mahmood, and then handed to the police as a fait accompli (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/21/fake-sheikh-mazher-mahmood-jailed-for-15-months\" title=\"\">\u2018Fake Sheikh\u2019 jailed for 15 months</a>, 22&#xa0;October).

Carefully wrap up the foil package, so no smoke can escape, and put the wok on a high heat. When the rice begins to burn and smoke, after four or five minutes (check by unwrapping a corner or by smelling), leave to smoke for four minutes, then open the foil and tip the potatoes into an oven tray.

  "<h2>India will not fear England spinners</h2> <p>Watching Tamim Iqbal tuck into England\u2019s spinners in the morning session, it was difficult not to fear for them in India. India have not lost a home Test since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/27/ian-bell-england-india\" title=\"\">losing to England in 2013</a>, winning every match bar one \u2013 and that was a washout. In Chittagong, the ball turned from the first over but in Dhaka, the pitch offered only intermittent help so Alastair Cook needed his spinners to give him control \u2013 and they could not. Though they improved in the afternoon session, the feeling persists that Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and chums will not afford them that opportunity, unlikely to be fazed by whichever of Adil Rashid, Gareth Batty and Zafar Ansari England select. So perhaps they might find variety by way of four seamers, relying on Moeen Ali and Joe Root for spin \u2013 at least they are already in the team as batsmen. Batsmen who have to face Ravichandran Ashwin in helpful conditions. <strong>DH</strong></p> <h2>Alastair Cook gets rumbled</h2> <p>At the toss, Alastair Cook was asked about his XI and, referring to the omission of Stuart Broad in particular, he explained that he was sure the team selected was capable of winning the game. The impression he gave, though, was of a man trying to convince himself, and in the television studio his old mate Matt Prior rumbled him immediately. The thing is, England, one up with one to play, had no choice \u2013 they need Broad fit and firing in India, particularly given the injury to Jimmy Anderson. But the fact remains that the best players should not have to miss series deciders in order to be protected from potential injury \u2013 it is not good for them and, more importantly, it is not good for the game. This is yet another reason why a Test championship is essential: central control of fixtures would facilitate more sensible and sensitive scheduling. <strong>DH</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/moeen-ali-fail-spin-words-five-bangladesh-wickets\">Moeen Ali fails to spin his words but turns up with five Bangladesh wickets</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Why Tamim Iqbal loves England</h2> <p>Tamim Iqbal does enjoy playing England. With his 104 here, three of his eight Test centuries have come against the current opponents, his average of 63.27 against them some 23 runs higher than his overall career mark. Only five men who have played a minimum of 10 innings against England have a higher average, and one of them is Don Bradman. It took him 19 balls to get off the mark here, but after that he played an innings of precise and controlled aggression, expertly locating the holes in England\u2019s attack then punching through them with gusto. The disappointment and frustration about Tamim was that he got out so quickly afterwards, bafflingly leaving a ball on off stump by Moeen Ali, lbw for 104: that is the fifth of those eight tons that have not gone beyond 109. Perhaps he needs a pep talk from Graham Gooch about daddy hundreds. <strong>NM</strong></p> <h2>Gary Ballance needs time out</h2> <p>Gary Ballance\u2019s recent Test numbers make ugly reading: since returning to the side in July, he has recorded scores of 6, 43, 23, 70, 28, 8, 17, 1, 9 and 9. Ballance actually played a couple of confident shots and was dismissed by a superb delivery from Mehedi Hasan, but the decision to keep him in the side after an indifferent summer looks more and more generous. He was pretty lucky to be selected for this tour, never mind this Test, having not scored a century since April 2015, in which time he has played 12 Tests and averaged just over 26. It does not help that as a batsman he is, shall we say, a \u201ctough watch\u201d, and when you start to pine for James Vince scoring an attractive 24 before nicking off, it is probably time to accept that Ballance needs a little time away from the Test team. <strong>NM</strong></p> <h2>Bangladesh need to play more Tests</h2> <p>Moeen and Ben Stokes did bowl superbly in that spell just before tea, but a few of Bangladesh\u2019s wickets were donated rather limply. At 171-1 the collapse was sudden but perhaps not unexpected: in the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/bangladesh-fall-short-as-england-secure-victory-on-final-day-of-first-test\" title=\"\"> first Test</a> they went from 221-4 to 248 all out in the first innings, then 227-5 to 263 all out in the second. A weak tail is one explanation, but it is also easy to forget that before the last game they had not played a Test in 15 months, and the diary ahead is not exactly full either. They have another two against New Zealand in January, one more in India shortly afterwards and that is it until after the Champions Trophy. Pickings remain slim, and they are not currently scheduled to play a series of more than two Tests until January 2019. There is talent in this team, but to improve they need to play more. <strong>NM</strong></p>",
  "<p>Gregory Pincus, the maverick scientist who co-invented the female contraceptive pill, first tried to come up with a male equivalent in the 1950s. Nearly six decades on we are still waiting.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\"> Friday\u2019s news</a> that male contraceptive jabs are almost as effective as the female pill is remarkable as much for the lack of progress it highlights as for the impressive result the trial delivered.</p> <p>There are genuine scientific reasons why creating a male pill is tricky. But today\u2019s results, together with a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3863448/Male-Pill-moves-step-closer-British-scientists-discover-way-stop-sperm-swimming-men-just-sex.html\">separate advance earlier in the week</a> , make it a good time to ask whether the main obstacles are technical or a lack of will to develop the drug.</p> <p>A central scientific challenge in developing a male pill is achieving the right balance of hormones that provides reliable and reversible contraception without inducing unacceptable side-effects. </p> <p>Getting this right is a tightrope walk and the research fell just on the wrong side of the line. The World Health Organisation decided to stop enrolling men on its trial earlier than planned after being alerted to side effects, including low mood, acne and higher than usual libido (today some coverage interpreted this as a bonus of the drugs, although there is no suggestion that this is how the men or their partners saw it).</p> <p>Participant safety must always be the first consideration when running clinical trials. It is worth noting, though, that three-quarters of the 300 men who took part in the trial said they would continue to use this method if they had the choice \u2013 and the decision to halt the trial was not unanimous.</p> <p>Richard Anderson, a professor of clinical reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh and a co-author, says: \u201cIt was a big disappointment when the trial was stopped, as the trial monitoring committee were happy with progress and safety, but another WHO committee made the decision.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists did not attempt to quantify whether the side-effects were comparable or worse to known side-effects of the female pill, but we know that these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/pill-linked-depression-doctors-hormonal-contraceptives\">can also be substantial</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many couples for whom the female pill is not an option,\u201d says Sarah Jones, a reader in pharmacology at the University of Wolverhampton, who is working on an alternative form of male contraceptive. </p> <p>\u201cIt has terrible side-effects as well for some women. It\u2019s not much of a choice. I\u2019m sure there are couples that would relish this [male contraceptives].\u201d</p> <p>A second challenge, for the male contraception, is that the hormones they normally rely on are quickly metabolised by the liver, meaning that it\u2019s difficult to package the drugs in a pill form. Again, it is worth noting that most of men on the trial said they would be happy to go forward with the injection method.</p> <p>Anderson and colleagues are due to start another trial using a similar hormone combination delivered through a gel that men could rub onto their chest each morning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\">Male contraceptive jab almost as effective as female pill, trial shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are also new findings suggesting that targeting the sperm directly \u2013 by using a fast-acting pill or a nasal spray that a man could take before sex, for example \u2013 rather than using hormones might work. Until now, this approach had eluded scientists, because sperm is so impenetrable \u2013 or, as Jones puts it, \u201cyou just can\u2019t get into the little buggers\u201d.</p> <p>She published findings this month showing that designer compounds could be smuggled inside sperm cells and target proteins that are required for the sperm to swim, essentially stopping them in their tracks.</p> <p>The progress convinces Anderson that a male contraceptive will be available eventually. \u201cIt\u2019s just disappointing that it\u2019s going so slowly,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Focus groups run by Anderson and others convince him that there is a clear and immediate demand. \u201cAbout 90% of women we saw at a family planning clinic said it was a good idea, to share the responsibility,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThey say: \u2018I\u2019ve done that [taken the pill] for 15 years and had a baby. Come on it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>However, funding from pharma companies \u2013 essential to run the trials involving thousands of men that would be required to get a product licensed \u2013 is not forthcoming.</p> <p>Herjan Coelingh Bennink, who until 2000 was global executive vice-president of the reproductive medicine programme at the Dutch pharmaceutical company, Organon, has offered an insider\u2019s perspective on why this might be the case.</p> <p>\u201cAt board level it was only middle-aged white males,\u201d Bennink <a href=\"https://mosaicscience.com/story/why-are-we-still-waiting-male-pill-birth-control-contraceptive\">told Mosaic</a> , an online science magazine produced by the Wellcome Trust, this year. \u201cI tried to explain how important it could be, but they never got further than saying to each other, \u2018Would you do it?\u2019 \u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t do it\u2019. It was not considered male behaviour to take responsibility for contraception.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson said that commercial factors may have also impacted the decision to shift away from developing a male pill. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced by that characterisation,\u201d he says. \u201cThough it probably does have a grain of truth,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, there are still scientific hurdles to be overcome before we have a safe, reliable male contraceptive.</p> <p>But science is not there to solve life\u2019s simple problems. When someone at the European Space Agency said let\u2019s chase down a comet 250m miles away and land a robotic probe on it, nobody said \u201cThat sounds easy \u2013 let\u2019s do it\u201d.</p> <p>If we\u2019re looking for reasons why we\u2019re still so far from equality in who bears the burden of birth control, let\u2019s not place lack of scientific ingenuity at the top of the list.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2016.

So when he was asked whether it was his \u201carm ball\u201d that dismissed Mominul Haque on Friday he replied all too candidly: \u201cNo, it was just a normal ball that didn\u2019t spin.\u201d He did concede he was \u201chappier about my bowling here\u201d, but then he had to add: \u201cI bowled some maidens and I don\u2019t do that very often.\u201d Not quite the self-assertive observation you expect from your premier spinner \u2013 even it is a correct one.</p> <p>Then Moeen was asked about some of the boundaries that Tamim Iqbal hit. \u201cThey were off good balls\u201d [the correct response \u2013 they were, yet Tamim was in such brilliant form that this could not deter him]. \u201cSo I did not get down on myself\u201d [another fine reaction]. \u201cAnd I get hit plenty of times anyway\u201d [wrong \u2013 keep that to yourself].</p> <p>One conclusion is that Moeen has become a rather better bowler than he thinks he is. His stock delivery is quicker than most; it carries venom; he spins the ball vigorously. Even he acknowledges \u201cthe pace I bowl is useful\u201d and he is right especially when he is operating on the turning pitches encountered in Chittagong and Dhaka. He is also correct to stress the need to be more consistent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/28/tamim-iqbal-england-spinners-bangladesh\">Tamim Iqbal tucks in and gives spinners and Alastair Cook food for thought</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He has tormented Bangladesh\u2019s left-handers.

On Friday he was better against the right-handers; he bowled exclusively around the wicket to them \u2013 usually the best option on a turning pitch \u2013 and his control improved as the match went about its metamorphosis.</p> <p>Moeen is as generous about his colleagues as he is modest about his own efforts.

To me, it smelled like trauma and humiliation.</p> <p>Then I turned 40 and my metabolism began to slow down. My waistline began to expand, my once razor-sharp lead-singer hipbones vanished into the mush, my face was getting doughy, and I found myself getting winded by routine tasks like climbing the stairs in the parking garage to get to my car at the end of the workday.</p> <p>I knew I needed to get some kind of fitness program in my life, but I was still terrified of going to the gym. What if I was terrible at it? What if people pointed and laughed? What if the deadlifting bros were homophobes who corner me in the locker room for some kind of public shaming? How would I handle that?</p> <p>I soon found out. My first go at introducing physical activity into my life was swimming, inspired by watching Michael Phelps compete in the 2008 Olympics. I remember seeing him on his starting block and thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t need for my body to look like that, but I just want to feel strong.\u201d<br></p> <p>I bought a day pass to the nearby university pool and decided to swim some laps. In a pair of Old Navy board shorts I lowered myself into the heavily chlorinated water and started to do a kind of modified breast-stroke because I\u2019d forgotten my goggles.</p> <p>After about 20 minutes, I got that unmistakable sinking feeling that comes from hearing someone laugh and realizing that they\u2019re laughing at you. A pair of young women were floating in the next swim lane, laughing and pointing at my awkward progress through the water.</p> <p>I swam a couple more laps, noting that a face burning with embarrassment can still be felt underwater. I wrote a short speech in my head and when I drew abreast of them, I said, \u201cI can hear you, you know. I may swim funny, but I\u2019m not deaf. You\u2019re rude, horrible people and I would like to remind you that you won\u2019t be young and beautiful forever.\u201d</p> <p>They rolled their eyes at me and went back to minding their own business, but I realized that the Worst Possible Thing had just happened. People made fun of me. It was embarrassing, but it wasn\u2019t fatal.</p> <p>That Monday, I bought a gym membership, signed up for sessions with a personal trainer and decided to go for it. To my surprise, not everybody at the gym was a \u2019roided-out bodybuilder or a hardcore Crossfitter. And there was a surprising lack of judgment from fellow gym-goers.</p> <p>It turns out that the rule of the gym is a lot like the rule of the dance floor. If you\u2019re paying more attention to how someone else is doing it than how you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re doing it wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/walking-with-crutches-illness-veteran-recovery\">I'm a veteran of many illnesses.

Local opponents to Bashar al-Assad seized half the city and for the first time since the uprising began in March 2011, faced attacks from government jets and helicopter gunships. Islamists, mainstream rebels and - for 10 months in 2013 - Isis have had control of the eastern half but the city has remained divided. Four years of war have taken a withering toll on one of the world\u2019s oldest cities, with Russian airstrikes since September 2015 causing intense devastation.</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rumours of a brewing rebel offensive have been circulating for weeks. Eastern Aleppo, under opposition control since 2012, was besieged in July. The siege was briefly broken by a rebel offensive, and then reimposed with the backing of Russian warplanes.</p> \n<p>The offensive began in the early hours of Friday. By the early afternoon the rebels had seized a district known as Dahiyat al-Assad, and begun shelling adjacent neighbourhoods in an effort to push further towards the besieged east. </p> \n<p>The aim appeared to be the creation of a corridor that would link rebel-held Aleppo to the surrounding countryside dominated by the opposition, though rebel commanders have not outlined their path for fear of compromising military operations.</p> \n<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, said more than 15 civilians had been killed and 100 wounded by rebel shelling of government-held western Aleppo. State media reported that five civilians were killed.<br></p> \n<p>The operation began with an assault that deployed artillery, rockets, ground advances and suicide bombers and is believed to involve thousands of opposition fighters.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cAll the factions are taking part,\u201d said one journalist who was accompanying the ground troops.</p> \n<p>Aleppo has emerged as a key focal point and symbol of the war. The conflict pits Syrian government forces and Iranian-backed militias from Iraq and Lebanon, supported by Russian fighter jets, against an array of rebel groups inside and outside the city. It is the last major urban stronghold in Syria that is partially under opposition control.</p> \n<p>Among the factions that appear to be taking part in the battle to break the siege are Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the former al-Qaida affiliate in Syria; the powerful Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham; and the Turkish-backed rebels the Sham Front.</p> \n<p>Footage from the battlefront showed tanks and rebel fighters advancing on the ground under cloudy skies which they hope will reduce the visibility of Russian and Syrian warplanes, as well as soldiers firing mortars. Residents have also burned tyres to obscure their view.</p> \n<p>The Syrian state news agency said that al-Qaida-linked terrorists had launched a wide assault west of Aleppo but that it had been repelled. </p> \n<p>Jabhat Fateh al-Sham was also a key element in the rebel offensive to break the siege in August. Its role will complicate the battlefield \u2013 though the group claims to have severed its links to al-Qaida, few believe that that would mean a change in ideology or loyalty.</p> \n<p>But it has emerged as a powerful fighting force against Assad and increasingly entrenched itself within the opposition, which has seen middling military support from its international backers.</p> \n<p>Ceasefire efforts brokered by the US and Russia have in the past aimed to isolate the group from other rebel fighters, but those have failed.</p>",
  "<h2>GOOD VIBRATIONS</h2> <p>Considering he\u2019s been working in English football for more than a year now, you could be forgiven for thinking that J\u00fcrgen Klopp might have figured out how things work by now. Nevertheless, with his relentless cheerfulness, ridiculously reasonable world view and ready supply of amusing quips, the manager steadfastly refuses to play the game preferred by many of his more dour, paranoid, miserable, infantile, argumentative, abusive, and intimidating counterparts at other top-flight clubs. Well, played by one of them.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, despite all available evidence to the contrary he continues to labour under the delusion that devoting hefty portions of one\u2019s money and leisure time to supporting a top-flight team is supposed to be \u201cfun\u201d, when in fact the default setting of most fans The Fiver sees at football is a kind of seething, red-faced outrage that occasionally boils over into the kind of full-on funk that prompts grown men to throw coins \u2013 their own coins \u2013 at each other, smash up porcelain and engage in other kinds of ludicrous behaviour that, if they\u2019re lucky, will be rewarded with the prize of a banning order that means they can devote their free time to more serene pursuits they might actually enjoy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/28/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Silly J\u00fcrgen. On Friday the Liverpool manager was at it again, prattling on about the \u201cpositive atmosphere\u201d currently enveloping Liverpool\u2019s training ground while telling hard-bitten hacks that \u201cyou can always have an optimistic view\u201d. Try telling that to miserable movie-maker Ken Loach, whose current gloomy cinema offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-manager-disaster-hotel\">I, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho</a> has been making headlines this week. The often harrowing story of a once proud manager forced to survive on handouts from an assortment of high-profile football clubs, Loach\u2019s film details the forlorn grind of a man cruelly exiled from London to live alone in a poorly appointed northern hovel while contending with the ludicrous number of injustices and humiliations visited upon him on an almost daily basis. Indeed, such are the hardships the t1tular character is forced to endure, it\u2019s small wonder several critics have dismissed the movie on the grounds of its preposterous implausibility.</p> <p>Anyway, back to J\u00fcrgen. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said of the good vibes emanating from Liverpool\u2019s dressing room. \u201cIt\u2019s not cool when you always think about football that you\u2019re 20% more upset, you should be feeling better. That\u2019s our job to do.\u201d The next step in his plan to make Liverpool fans feel even better involves a trip to Selhurst Park, where his team will take on a Crystal Palace side managed by a man who prefers to express his satisfaction through the medium of body popping. Alan Pardew, for it is he, will be hoping that Christian Benteke prompts some excruciating technical area dad dancing with a goal or two against his former club. Surprisingly, the man who sanctioned his sale to Palace was so effusive in his praise for the Belgian that it\u2019s a wonder he actually let him go this summer. \u201cWe had to make decisions,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen, by way of explanation. \u201cI\u2019m always honest. My door is always open. The agreement we have is work hard.\u201d While a willingness to graft and gegenpress has never been Benteke\u2019s strong point, you can bet he\u2019ll be straining every sinew come kick-off time on Saturday evening. </p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cThe UAE offer came and I was starting to think that if I go there, we must be honest, it is for fun and for money.

Someone of his stature and, frankly, quite iconic status engenders an excitement and vibe which was much needed for Singapore football in the early stages of the season. While the club could afford his wages, it would also send the wrong message to all the other players that one player is getting a super-scale salary while the others have to take a pay cut. It would create a social injustice\u201d \u2013 Tampines Rovers chief suit Krishna Ramachandra gets a bit too creative with his praise as he explains Jermaine Pennant\u2019s refusal to take a pay-cut from his reported \u00a323,000 per month salary.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cI did take my life into my hands and attend the West Ham v Chelsea match. Sadly, despite the powers that be blaming individuals and threatening life bans from \u2018football\u2019, the problems can be boiled down to mismanagement at best and downright greed at worst. To have four years\u2019 preparation ahead of handing over control of a stadium for regular football matches and still not have the facility for the police to be in attendance because their radios don\u2019t work is incomprehensible. To have that amount of time and not even consider that proper robust segregation is not something which means admitting that your fans can sometimes be a bit uppity is, frankly, disregarding people\u2019s safety. The inclusion of the two \u2018party decks\u2019 at either end of the stadium have caused problems; with the one at the away fans\u2019 end being one of the flash point locations as it was there that home and away fans were kept apart by means of a rickety fence and a line of yellow-jacketed youths. On that note, the employing of hundreds of enthusiastic foam finger waving theme park attendants as stewards has done little if anything to bring the unruly mob into line. In addition, the choice by the club to allow season-ticket holders to purchase up to six additional tickets when pre-booking their seats has meant that those traditionally only arriving at Upton Park for cup games or the odd fixture are now regular attendees, among which I am sure are many who Lady Brady would rather have not bothered. Looking at where the gaps were in the seats on Wednesday night, it is clear that she is probably more concerned with the number of empty \u2018posh seats\u2019 than those in the gods. Of the 45,000-odd who were there, there were around 200 involved in what the press is branding as \u2018trouble\u2019. Shouting and swearing and name-calling have been around in football since it was invented and came crawling out of the primordial mud, so those delicate souls complaining of noise and drunken behaviour can be excused as being numbered among the tourists, but there were a few (I saw two) seats thrown across the divide between rival sets of supporters and some coinage exchanged, some of which undoubtedly found its intended target. If the CCTV set-up is that good, and coupled with the evidence of the videotaping police presence, West Ham should be able to identify those involved from both sets of supporters, and set about banning them properly and making a show while doing it. The empty seats can then be offered to those of the many thousands, according to Brady, apparently on a waiting list for season tickets. Let\u2019s get back to talking about how inconsistent West Ham have been this season as quickly as possible because all this \u2018new stadium problem\u2019 coverage is frankly boring now\u201d \u2013 Andy Marriott.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/28/arsene-wenger-west-ham-crowd-trouble-harm-move-standing\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger worried West Ham trouble could harm move for standing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cRe: the banning of unsavoury attenders at the Taxpayer Dome.

  "<p>Islamic State fighters have taken \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people hostage and are herding them towards the city of Mosul for use as human shields as the battle for the militant group\u2019s last major Iraqi stronghold intensifies, the United Nations has said.</p> <p>Isis also shot dead at least 232 civilians on Wednesday, the UN said on Friday, in its latest warning of atrocities by the group that has embraced rule by terror since it swept to power across the region. More evidence of crimes is likely to be unearthed as the self-proclaimed caliphate recedes into the desert.</p> <p>Some of the latest victims are understood to have refused to comply with orders to leave their homes, and others were former members of the Iraqi security forces, who Isis may have feared would rise up against the group as its enemies advanced.</p> <p>Speaking at a news conference, UN spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the hostage-taking was aimed at making certain parts of Mosul \u201cimmune from military action\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIsil\u2019s depraved, cowardly strategy is to try to use the presence of civilian hostages to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military action, essentially using tens of thousands of men, women and children as human shields,\u201d Shamdasani said, using a different term for the group. </p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/isis-islamic-state-us-raqqa-mosul-syria\">offensive to reclaim the city</a> paused on Friday to allow Iaqi forces to deal with attacks to their rear, there are growing concerns about the fate of civilians who have been living under Isis. They face a grim choice between retreating into Mosul to serve as human shields, waiting out fierce fighting in their homes, or fleeing to areas where they fear being targeted as collaborators or supporters of Isis.</p> <p>The battle pits up to 6,000 Isis fighters dug in around Mosul against 30,000 troops from a broad coalition including the Kurdish peshmerga, the Iraqi army and special forces, Shia militias allied with Iran, US warplanes and military advisers, and Turkish forces positioned to the north of the city.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/25/how-important-is-mosul-for-isis-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5964y\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2838855\"            data-video-name=\"How important is Mosul for Isis? \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580f58d5e4b01c528432c62e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/25/161025mosulv2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/25/161025mosulv2_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/25/161025mosulv2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/25/how-important-is-mosul-for-isis-video-explainer\">How important is Mosul for Isis?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>On Friday, Shia militias said they would soon attack to the west of Mosul, currently the only open route out of a city now surrounded on three sides, and reportedly used by Isis to transport some commanders and their families to Syria.</p> <p>People trapped along the path of Isis\u2019s retreat say the group is branding anyone who refuses to head to Mosul with them an \u201capostate\u201d, a crime carrying the death penalty under Isis rule, making fleeing to relative safety of government-controlled areas a risky gamble.</p> <p>\u201cDaesh detains families or sometimes just young people as they withdraw from an area. My brother was in the village of al-Hood and is one of those that they have taken.

We have to decide whether to go to the army side or stay where Daesh is. Daesh considers anyone who leaves the land of caliphate as \u2018apostate\u2019 so they force people to go with them as they withdraw towards Mosul.\u201d</p> <p>So far the UN has details of about 8,000 families who have been shifted from villages on the eastern and southern edge of Isis control towards the suburbs of Mosul and the city itself.</p> <p>But those figures likely represent a minimum number of victims, Shamdasani said. \u201cThese reports ... do not mean there are not more civilians who have been killed, more families displaced.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/fears-battle-for-mosul-open-new-front-wider-sunni-shia-conflict-iraq-turkey\">Fears battle for Mosul could open new front in wider Sunni-Shia conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One place Isis is thought to have taken hostages is the town of Hamam al-Ali, a stronghold for the group which had about 23,000 residents before the Mosul offensive.

The buses and trucks have been struck when empty, and far from civilians, he said.</p> <p>Inside the city, residents said displaced people were arriving in their hundreds and moving into empty public buildings and offices, living in appalling conditions as chillier autumn weather sets in.</p> <p>\u201cCongestion is increasing in the city, since the military operation began, hundreds of families from villages around Mosul began to come to the city and they are housed in schools and empty government buildings,\u201d said Issa, a teacher in his 30s, who lives in the west of the city.</p> <p>He did not know if they had chosen to leave their villages or had been forced out by Isis, but said their situation in Mosul was dire, with most struggling to feed themselves or stay warm.</p> <p>\u201cThey live under difficult conditions and we are helping them as much as we can by giving them food, water, blankets and other needs. They are scared.\u201d Former members of the security forces among the new arrivals have been taken away by Isis, he added, and their current location is unknown.</p> <p>There have also been reports of revenge attacks on men and boys believed to have fought for Isis or supported it, by the forces closing in towards Mosul.

For many workers this is a rigged economy, where bosses can weasel out of paying the minimum wage or providing basics such as holiday pay and rest breaks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\">Uber loses right to classify UK drivers as self-employed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Technological change should be a force for good. But increasingly employers are using it to duck their responsibilities. If you are a \u201cself-employed\u201d driver at Uber you can become a virtual a slave to the app. Miss a job alert and you can be \u201cdeactivated\u201d without appeal. Fail to keep up your rating and you can be cast aside at any moment.</p> <p>Being kept on a leash is not my definition of self-employment. Genuinely self-employed contractors can refuse jobs, set their own hours and subcontract work to others. That freedom to work when and how you want is why some self-employed people choose to give up the security that comes with a regular job. The security of knowing that if you fall sick, or just want to take a holiday, you don\u2019t have to jeopardise your livelihood.</p> <p>But if you work at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/20/self-employment-status-hmrc-who-is-next-analysis\" title=\"\">firms like Uber or Deliveroo</a> you enjoy none of those freedoms, and none of that security either. It is small surprise that many feel powerless and unable to speak out.</p> <p>Today rosters are increasingly devised by computer and announced to workers with little or no notice. For many, working in the gig economy the only contact they have with their employer is through an app on their phone. This new model of working has led to a more atomised workforce. One where co-workers don\u2019t regularly meet or share facilities. If you work for the likes of Uber you are very much a lone agent competing against others for jobs.</p> <p>This has created a severe imbalance of power. It makes collective bargaining for fair pay and decent conditions far harder and gives companies more scope to reward executives and shareholders, while keeping pay down for their workers. Unions are not luddites. We recognise that the world of work is changing. But advances in technology should be used to make work better, not to return to the type of working practices we thought we\u2019d seen the back of decades ago, and which trade unions were formed to fight against.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da39ddccf6743cf8c28fd17a90fafe98ac5b73c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da39ddccf6743cf8c28fd17a90fafe98ac5b73c3/0_205_5271_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deliveroo worker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deliveroo: next on the list for unions?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what needs to change?</p> <p>Precarious working has rightly shot up the political agenda, thanks in large part to the work of unions. GMB and Unite deserve huge credit for shining a light on working conditions at companies such as Uber, Asos and Sports Direct. The government announced this month a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/i-tell-theresa-may-working-lives-review-modern-employment-zero-hours-flexibility\" title=\"\">independent review into employment regulations</a> for the new economy, led by the RSA\u2019s Matthew Taylor.</p> <p>We want this to be a no-holds barred investigation into employment practices at the sharp of the end of the labour market. And, crucially, one that recognises the important role unions can play in dealing with the problem of insecure employment.</p> <p>The TUC has long called for the introduction of modern wage councils. They\u2019d work in specific sectors, like private hire, to set minimum pay and conditions. This would help stop some of the worst exploitation and increase transparency. We also want rules on \u201cemployment status\u201d \u2013 including the definition of self-employment \u2013 to be tightened up. This is far too much of a grey area, which has allowed unscrupulous bosses to cut corners.</p> <p>All working people should benefit from the same basic rights at work, including paid holiday, maternity/paternity leave, and protection from unfair dismissal. The law should presume that an individual is an employee, unless the employer can demonstrate they are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/uber-drivers-court-tribunal-self-employed-uk-employment-law\" title=\"\"> genuinely self-employed and running a business of their own</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBogus\u201d self-employment doesn\u2019t just affect workers. It hurts the public purse too, as it allows companies to avoid paying national insurance contributions for their workforce. That can be worth millions.</p> <p>We need to think more broadly about how technology can empower workers rather than enslave them. Cast your minds back to the 1960s and 70s. Then, people speculated that new technology would create in its wake a more leisured society. The reality has been anything but. It\u2019s not just Uber drivers who are affected by this. Try telling the Amazon worker monitored every minute by GPS or the young professional checking their emails at 2am that they have been liberated. We\u2019ve got to get the pendulum swinging the other way.</p> <p>Part of that thinking must include how trade unions can take advantage of new technologies to organise workers. So that even those on the margins can have a collective voice. Whether it\u2019s Deliveroo workers, Uber drivers or freelancers in the US, we\u2019re already seeing what this might look like. Digital has huge potential for workers just as it does for employers.</p> <p>That we are in the midst of a technological revolution every bit as transformative as the industrial revolution is not in doubt. The lives, life chances and livelihoods of millions of workers are in a state of flux. Our role isn\u2019t to try to stop this progress, it\u2019s to make sure that technology is used to make working people\u2019s lives better, and to make sure the gains from new technology are fairly shared. The battle around Uber <a href=\"https://campaign.goingtowork.org.uk/petitions/uber-uk-give-your-drivers-decent-working-conditions?source=guardian\" title=\"\">is far from over</a>, and unions will be staying with it for Uber workers today and for the rest of us tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Up to 1,500 offenders are to be fitted with satellite-tracking tags in a Ministry of Justice trial intended to provide a viable alternative to custody and stabilise the relentless rise in the prison population.</p> <p>The 12-month satellite-tracking trials, already under way in two parts of England, come as the latest prison population figures published on Friday show that inmate numbers have risen by more than 1,000 in under two months to 85,108, a new record.</p> <p>Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the rapid increase in inmate numbers since early September was unusual and is placing additional pressure on an overstretched system already experiencing record levels of violence, self-harm and suicide.<br></p> <p>The GPS monitoring tags, which are fixed to the offender\u2019s ankle, will be used to enforce exclusion zones such as a particular address, a place such as a town or a football ground, or a number of locations such as train stations, airports or city centres.</p> <p>The tags can also be used to create an inclusion zone that the offender is not allowed to leave, such as a building, city or even country, and can be used to ban them from associating with other people who are also tagged. Up to 50 exclusion or inclusion zones can be created, which can be limited by time, day or a particular date.<br></p> <p>The tags are designed to be difficult to remove and require two hours\u2019 charging every day. The official guidance says GPS-tagged offenders will be banned from \u201cunsuitable activities\u201d, including water sports such as diving and surfing, as well as contact sports such as football, rugby, hockey and kickboxing, because they risk hurting themselves or damaging the tag. They may also have problems visiting some hospitals as the tag may interfere with medical equipment.</p> <p>Ministry of Justice guidance on the details of the trials published on Friday says that a monitoring centre, staffed 24 hours a day, records the movements of tagged offenders, reports alerts and responds immediately to breaches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2830029e144139ad39cc357e87c949fc2b563cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2830029e144139ad39cc357e87c949fc2b563cd4/0_238_3936_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MoJ cited the case study of a convicted football hooligan banned from the Madejski stadium in Reading on match days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MoJ cited the case study of a convicted football hooligan banned from the Madejski stadium in Reading on match days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trials are taking place in eight police force areas across the Midlands and south-east England. </p> <p>The pilot scheme is available to encourage courts to make greater use of bail rather than prison remand and community and suspended sentences, and as a sentence in itself. They will also encourage prison governors to make greater use of early-release schemes, prevent recalls of those already out on licence, and could lead to the parole board ordering the release of more inmates on indefinite public-protection sentences.</p> <p>Plans to introduce satellite tracking of offenders were first announced 12 years ago, but official trials in 2007 raised the question of whether the benefits could be delivered at a price that justified a national rollout of the scheme. The renewed attempt to introduce the next-generation tags was first raised by David Cameron in his speech on prison reform in February.</p> <p>The MoJ guidance says \u201cthere is real potential for electronic monitoring to act as a tool that could help stabilise demand on the prison estate. It will be critical for decision-makers that we demonstrate that GPS tagging is a viable and useful alternative to custody. The pilots will also test whether satellite tags do modify the behaviour of offenders.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/04/scotland-introduces-alcohol-tests-gps-tracking-tagged-offenders\">Scotland to introduce alcohol testing and GPS tracking for tagged offenders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Case studies cited by the MoJ include a convicted football hooligan who is banned from the Madejski stadium in Reading on match days. The tag will warn the offender if he approaches the exclusion zone around the stadium and alert the monitoring centre if he goes into the off-limits zone.</p> <p>In a second example, the GPS tag can be used to keep a convicted burglar out of jail but allow him to keep his job, even though his workplace is in the middle of a number of residential areas where he was caught burgling. The GPS tag would allow him to go work on a prescribed route, but if he wanders off into any of the nearby banned residential areas the monitoring centre is alerted.</p> <p>The first pilot area covers Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Leicester and the West Midlands, and the tags are being trialled for court-imposed bail, community and suspended sentence orders and in parole board cases. In the second pilot, covering Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, the satellite tags are being used in prison-recall cases, early release and home-detention curfew cases, and parole board cases.</p>",
  "<p>One of the frontrunners to become the new Ukip leader has used his official campaign launch to defend Donald Trump and to call for a national referendum on banning women from wearing the niqab.</p> <p>Speaking in front of a few dozen supporters at a pub in Westminster, Raheem Kassam also appeared to cast doubt on the veracity of women accusing the US Republican presidential candidate of sexual assault, and said he did not believe Trump had anti-Muslim views.</p> <p>Kassam, 30, a former staffer for Nigel Farage who now runs the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/london/\">UK arm of the rightwing US news network Breitbart</a>, is second favourite with bookmakers behind Paul Nuttall, an MEP and deputy leader, to be voted the next Ukip leader.</p> <p>Suzanne Evans, a former Conservative councillor who compiled the party\u2019s 2015 election manifesto, is also standing.

And we shouldn\u2019t be trying to drag this party to the squishy centre ground. </p> <p>\u201cWe should be proud of what I call Faragism \u2013 a belief in your country, a belief in your culture, a belief in the people of this great nation.\u201d </p> <p>Kassam\u2019s candidacy has attracted immediate controversy, notably over his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">prolific and often robust Twitter feed</a>, which has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/raheem-kassam-ukip-leadership-election-twitter-deleted_uk_580cf387e4b056572d82f392\">included a deeply personal insult against Nicola Sturgeon</a>, for which he again apologised.</p> <p>He has also attracted attention for his appreciation of Trump \u2013 Kassam\u2019s campaign slogan of \u201cMake Ukip Great Again\u201d echoes the Republican candidate\u2019s motto.</p> <p>While describing his slogan as \u201ca bit tongue in cheek\u201d, Kassam reiterated that he would supported Trump in the 8 November election, saying: \u201cI hope he wins over crooked Hillary, certainly.\u201d</p> <p>Kassam told reporters after his speech: \u201cI\u2019m not endorsing him. What I\u2019ve said it that I prefer him to win than Hillary Clinton. I\u2019ve got no problem with endorsing him, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think my endorsement makes any difference either way.\u201d</p> <p>He declined to condemn Trump\u2019s policies, such as the mooted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">proposal to bar all Muslims from entering the US</a>, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t believe he has anti-Muslim views.\u201d Kassam added: \u201cI can see where his supporters\u2019 frustrations were in supporting the blanket ban, but I think we have a much better plan of how to deal with radical Islam.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the series of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault, Kassam said he had doubts about the claims, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s strange that somebody who was a celebrity for so many years only has these things come out right at the tail end of a presidential campaign.\u201d</p> <p>It was possible that the women \u201cdid not feel that he had enough support to speak out\u201d in the past, he added.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.makeukipgreatagain.com/\">Kassam\u2019s personal manifesto</a> is strongly rightwing, including massive cuts to the foreign aid budget, and a focus on cutting immigration and measures targeting elements of Islam, including an end to forms of halal slaughter.</p> <p>Kassam, who was brought up in a Muslim family but says he now has no religious faith, said he supported a referendum on banning the use of the niqab, the most conservative form of Islamic dress for women, which covers the face. </p> <p>\u201cI think most people in this country are OK with the hijab,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would want a referendum on the niqab.\u201d</p> <p>After James resigned, the immediate favourite to replace her was Steven Woolfe, a former barrister and now an MEP. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/ukip-mep-steven-woolfe-quits-party\">he left the party</a> in the wake of a scuffle with a fellow Ukip MEP, Mike Hookem, amid a dispute about Woolfe\u2019s admission he had almost defected to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Woolfe spent three days in hospital after the fracas, and said Hookem had punched him. However, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/ukip-blames-mep-steven-woolfe-row-hookem-european-parliament-police\">party investigation into the incident</a> said Woolfe appeared primarily to blame. </p>",

  "<p><strong>My sister is a bright graduate who has always been stubborn and single-minded, and needed intense, passionate relationships. When she met her husband and they married and had kids, I assumed she had at last found happiness. But for the past two years she has embarked on an affair with someone she met at work.</strong></p> <p><strong>She is being very open about the affair, with our family and with her husband. She says the other man needs her and she needs the romance of it as marriage isn\u2019t enough. He comes to their house and she expects her husband to socialise with him. My brother-in-law has agonised about the situation but doesn\u2019t want to leave his house and family. He expects, as we all do, that eventually it will fizzle out. But it hurts him.</strong></p> <p><strong>I am starting to worry for the children, who are aware of Mum having this \u201cfriend\u201d (we found out from the kids that she recently took them away for a weekend with the other man) and starting to get old enough to realise something is going on, and also relationships between my sister and our wider family. My parents have tried but failed to talk to her about it and she is impossible to talk around on any subject, consistently of the view she is right and we are wrong. Her argument is that because her husband is \u201cOK\u201d with this, we should all be too. To keep positive relations with her, my parents are being asked not only not to judge but also to accept what she is doing, which I consider unreasonable.</strong></p> <p><strong>She has always had this stubborn character, but about five years ago self-diagnosed herself with a condition [details not published]. When you read about women with this condition, it does help to understand her. She has refused to seek any professional advice for it, preferring to do her own reading. But she is bright and I feel, on some level, she must know that the situation is hurting her husband. I haven\u2019t got involved so far because I know she will simply shut down communication once we try to discuss it. </strong></p> <p><strong>Is there any way we could get through to her the damage she is doing to those around her for the sake of her own happiness? Or do I simply sit on the sidelines, supporting her husband and my parents and waiting for the inevitable fallout? &#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Open or polygamous marriages are the way some people operate their relationships, of course, but it does need both sides to agree. And it doesn\u2019t sound as if this is happening here.</p> <p>Although I think affairs between a couple are private, this isn\u2019t really an affair she is conducting in private. She is asking you all to, in effect, join in \u2013 to accept another partner in her life when, it seems, her own partner does not. You are right that you cannot stop her, but she cannot make you approve of the situation if you do not.</p> <p>I contacted the psychotherapist Julia Cole (<a href=\"http://www.bacp.co.uk\" title=\"\">bacp.co.uk</a>), author of After the Affair, who thought what was \u201cinteresting is that, usually when people have affairs, there is a \u2018bubble\u2019 effect, which protects them from what\u2019s happening in the real world. But that isn\u2019t happening here.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel there is something very gauntlet-throwing about her \u00adbehaviour, almost as if it were a cry for\u00a0help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat I think is happening here is that this is like a defence mechanism. Your sister is not having to deal with issues with her husband. My feeling is that this [the affair] is some sort of smoke screen for your sister, diverting her from something else that\u2019s going on. I would like to think whatever she\u2019s diverting from should be the focus.\u201d</p> <p>Any idea what that might be?</p> <p>We both felt that the self-diagnosis of a condition was a red herring, as Cole puts it. And no justification for her behaviour.</p> <p>I feel she isn\u2019t taking responsibility for her behaviour at all \u2013 is she usually like this? Or is she absolving herself, now, of responsibility because she is usually the responsible, sensible one? There is something about her behaviour, as if she is saying: \u201cI\u2019m different and I don\u2019t have to live by normal rules.\u201d I feel there is something very gauntlet-throwing about her behaviour, almost as if it were a cry for&#xa0;help.</p> <p>Of course, your primary concern seems to be for her children. I asked Cole how she thinks they may be feeling. \u201cQuite confused \u2013 they may start asking difficult questions soon. They may even start regressing.\u201d</p> <p>What to do? Cole recommends, as your sister seems to have quite black-and-white thinking, asking her \u201cvery specific questions, such as \u2018How do you think this is affecting your husband/your children?\u2019 Not in a guilt-trip way but in the spirit of inquiry. Some people just don\u2019t understand how they can affect others.\u201d</p> <p>Cole advises that if your sister is just defensive or dismissive, you could gently press further by saying something like: \u201cHave you noticed your husband is much more sad than usual?\u201d If she says \u201cno\u201d, you could then try saying something like: \u201cI\u2019ve noticed it. I wonder why you haven\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>If your sister really will not take responsibility that her behaviour is hurting her family, all you can do is offer them support \u2013 but try making it clear you don\u2019t take sides and you are there if she wants to talk. \u201cYou could also,\u201d says Cole, \u201cencourage your brother-in-law to get counselling on his own.\u201d</p> <p>The pertinent question I would ask your sister is: \u201cHow would you feel if your husband were doing this?\u201d</p> <h2>Your problems solved<br></h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU, or email annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

  "<p>One of the recurring concerns in recent years has been about whether local newspapers are carrying out one of their key public service functions: the coverage of courts.</p> <p>In 2009, there were four separate claims that papers were failing to report court cases adequately. The Press Association\u2019s managing director, Tony Watson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/07/pa-trinity-mirror-trial\">told a committee of MPs looking into the future of local press</a>: \u201cThings have got so bad in the regional press now courts and councils are not getting covered sufficiently\u201d.</p> <p>Marcel Berlins, the legal commentator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/06/berlins-writ-large-court-reporters\">wrote in the Guardian</a> of there being too few reporters to perform the \u201cimportant task\u201d of being \u201cthe eyes and ears of the public in our courts\u201d.</p> <p>Lord Judge, then the lord chief justice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/16/keep-reporting-courts-council\">told a Society of Editors conference</a> that the absence of reporters in courts was a problem for the practice of open justice (a speech also touched on by Joshua Rozenberg, <a href=\"http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/analysis/why-newspapers-lack-interest-in-court-reporting/53266.fullarticle\">writing for the Law Gazette</a>).</p> <p>And Nick Davies, in his book Flat Earth News, asserted that it was \u201cimpossible to escape the conclusion that the number of court stories in both national and regional newspapers has fallen dramatically\u201d.</p> <p>In the seven years since, there has been plenty of anecdotal support for those views but precious little academic inquiry. Now come two small studies, <a href=\"http://thejusticegap.com/2016/10/half-local-newspapers-dont-court-reporter/#\">reported in outline on The Justice Gap site</a>, which indicate that the situation has anything but improved.</p> <p>They were conducted by Brian Thornton, a former BBC2 Newsnight producer who now lectures in journalism at Winchester university.</p> <p>In the first, regional and local editors were approached to answer a set of questions and 57 took part, although not all of them answered every question. <br></p> <p>They were asked whether they agreed or not with a statement made by Berlins in the 2009 article I mentioned above: <em>\u201cIt is abundantly clear that the courts are no longer being properly reported\u201d.</em></p> <p>Of the 55 who answered, 56% agreed (with 11% strongly agreeing) while 44% disagreed (with 6% strongly disagreeing). <br></p> <p>In real terms, that equates to 31 editors agreeing and 24 disagreeing. The sample is obviously small, given that there are, say, 1,000 editors across Britain. So I think it fair to see this as an indication, a pointer, rather than any kind of conclusive proof. More details from this survey can be found below.</p> <p>In a separate piece of research, Thornton updated a 2012 study carried out by a Birkbeck law school professor, Leslie Moran, which looked at the coverage of the courts in the national and regional papers on a single day.</p> <p>Moran considered the content of eight nationals (Guardian, Times, Independent, Telegraph, Financial Times, Express, Mirror and Sun) plus five regionals (London Evening Standard, Manchester Evening News, Birmingham Mail, South Wales Echo, and Western Mail). He counted 82 court stories in those titles with a 27,225 total word count.</p> <p>When Thornton repeated the exercise four years on, he found 57 court stories with an 18,954 word count. In both instances, that represented a 30% decrease. </p> <p>But the fall was greater in the regionals, down from a total of 30 reports to just 18, some 40% fewer. A snapshot, of course, but it does imply a continuing decrease in court coverage. </p> <p>Thornton, in noting that fewer court proceedings were being observed by anyone outside the legal profession, is alarmed that there was \u201cvirtually no lay oversight, no-one to highlight problems or malpractice\u201d. </p> <p>He says: \u201cThe fact that the media is engaging less and less with the everyday workings of the criminal justice system means that journalists are increasingly unaware of what actually happens in such important settings as crown courts or coroner\u2019s courts. </p> <p>\u201cI would argue that this ignorance is dangerous because it spreads to the public. If the public aren\u2019t being informed about what\u2019s happening in courts, how can they be expected to know?\u201d</p> <p>One of his major worries about a lack of court coverage is the loss of historical records. This poses a problem for anyone investigating miscarriages of justice, he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf newspapers are reducing the number of court reporters, along with reducing the number of stories they cover, then there is a growing number of cases that will be lost completely to the collective memory.</p> <p>\u201cHundreds and hundreds of cases each year will go unrecorded \u2013 bizarrely becoming essentially secret trials because no one will have any information about them\u201d.</p> <h2><em>Here are some of the results of the editors\u2019 survey:</em></h2> <p><strong>Is there a dedicated court reporter at your newspaper?</strong> No, said 56%.<br></p> <p><strong>If you do not currently have a dedicated court reporter, did you have one in the last five years?</strong> 8% said that in the last five years they had a dedicated court reporter, but didn\u2019t have one now.</p> <p><strong>If there is a court reporter at your paper, how often does he/she attend court?</strong> Once a week, said 62%. </p> <p><strong>How important is it to have a dedicated court reporter?</strong> 42% said it was useful, but not essential; 33% said it was very important; 21% said it was important; 4% said it wasn\u2019t important.</p> <p><strong>If your newspaper covers court cases, where do you get your stories?</strong> 59% said they get their stories from a mix of reporters and agencies; 38% said it came entirely from their court reporter; 5% said they got it only from agencies.</p> <p><strong>Instead of sending a reporter or using agency copy \u2013 have you ever relied on a police press release for your court report?</strong> 55% said they would, 45% said they would not.</p> <p><strong>Has your court reporter at the paper used Twitter to report on a court case?</strong> 44% said they never have; 22% said rarely; 22% said sometimes; and 12% said often.</p> <p><strong>Do you think the courts are generally positive to journalists reporting on cases?</strong> 92% said they were.</p> <p><em><strong>NB:</strong></em> I appreciate the work done by Thornton, but I think we need comprehensive research - at courts and in newspaper offices alongside content analysis - to discover the true state of affairs. </p>",

Although the boys\u2019 lawyer appealed the sentence, arguing it was far too lenient, the supreme court released El Hassine on bail a few months later, in clear breach of the verdict.</p> <p>Five years on, with the help of lawyers and activists, the boys have taken their case to the regional court of the <a href=\"http://www.acerwc.org/\">African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child</a>, a body of the African Union. Rights groups representing the brothers are arguing that Mauritania has failed to prosecute those responsible for enslaving them effectively.

Women usually carry out domestic tasks around the house, including raising the children of the families to whom they are enslaved. Forced marriage is common \u2013 as is physical abuse and rape \u2013 and any child born of such a marriage becomes another slave, by default.<br></p> <p>Despite current legislation criminalising slavery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/modern-day-slavery-in-focus+world/mauritania\">laws are rarely enforced</a>, said Sarah Mathewson, Africa programme manager at <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/english/what_we_do/descent_based_slavery/slavery_in_mauritania.aspx\">Anti-Slavery International</a>, which helped take the original case to the Mauritanian court in 2011.

Can the proposal given by Heathrow to the airports commission be built and keep charges flat, no it can\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The IAG boss added that a runway could be built by Heathrow if there was \u201csome radical change in their [the management\u2019s] behaviour and thinking\u201d, but repeated: \u201cI\u2019m personally not confident they can do it.\u201d</p> <p>Insisting that \u201cthere will be no ability for Heathrow to hike charges\u201d, Walsh said: \u201cIt\u2019s a significant new challenge for the airport and not one they have had to face up to in the past.</p> <p>\u201cIf the argument is that the third runway is positive for the UK economy we\u2019ve got to make sure that it is for the benefit of customers and not for the shareholders.\u201d </p> <p>Heathrow is owned by Spanish conglomerate Ferrovial and the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Singapore and China, along with two pension funds. </p> <p>The airport said it intended to keep charges low.<strong> </strong>\u201cAs our biggest customer, Heathrow has been listening to IAG about the cost of the current proposal for expansion. Heathrow is determined to work with all our airline partners to deliver expansion as cost efficiently as possible \u2013 keeping landing charges low and delivering value for our passengers,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p> <p>Walsh once championed a third runway but refused to be involved in the latest lobbying after the coalition government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/24/third-runway-heathrow-scrapped-baa\">scrapped expansion plans in 2010</a>. But, he said: \u201cIt represents an opportunity for BA as clearly its current schedule would operate better if operated over three runways and it gives BA and other airlines an opportunity for expansion which we don\u2019t have today.\u201d<br></p> <p>He suggested BA could maintain or increase its dominant position at the London hub because of a relaxation of rules after Brexit. While it could only have received a minority of new slots under EU rules, Walsh said that by the time a runway was built, \u201cslot allocation rules will have to be determined\u201d and government \u201cwill have more flexibility\u201d.</p> <p>Walsh said air fares could rise in near future because of the effect the Brexit vote had on the value of the pound. </p> <p>\u201cConsumers are looking at price increases. Ticket prices have been declining and will continue into Q4 [the rest of 2016]. But in time if sterling continues to be weak, you are looking at increases in fares,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The drop in sterling contributed to a 3.6% decline in profits for IAG in its last quarter, which covers the most lucrative summer season. In the months to September, operating profits dropped to \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31.1bn), as revenues fell 4% to \u20ac6.5bn.</p> <p>\u20ac162m of that was directly attributed to the currency fall for IAG, whose revenues mainly accrue through pounds spent on BA fares. <br></p> <p>Although the short-term impact of the EU referendum was a dent to profits, he said: \u201cLonger-term a weaker pound will mean the BA cost base is better. Our principal competition is US carriers on the transatlantic routes and we\u2019ll have a lower cost base. It\u2019s swings and roundabouts.\u201d</p> <p>An uncertain operating environment, terror attacks and air control strikes were also blamed by IAG as it downgraded its 2016 profit forecast once again, this time to \u20ac2.5bn, a figure that would still represent year-on-year growth of between 7% and 8%. </p>",
  "<p>On the eve of the home match against Crystal Palace last weekend, the players and staff of Leicester City interrupted their final training session to stand in a circle and observe a minute\u2019s silence in memory of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, whose 70-year reign had ended with his death a few days earlier. The following day, on the pitch at their stadium, they posed for a rather unusual pre-match team picture. Front and centre, held by their captain, Wes Morgan, was a large gold\u2011framed photograph of the monarch. The players were wearing black armbands.

The protests in 2010 against the Glazer family\u2019s financial stewardship of Manchester United, symbolised by the wearing of green and yellow Newton Heath FC scarves, quickly died away. But in a wider and more profound sense the ownership of clubs rooted in their communities by foreign entities, whether as investment vehicles or trophy purchases, may be having the effect of disengaging the emotions of the domestic football fan base from the game as a whole. In the phrase currently fashionable in political debate, it is \u201chollowing out\u201d the feeling that fans have for their sport.</p> <p>What is to be made of the situation in the West Midlands, a virtual petri dish for the ownership of English football clubs by Chinese businessmen, with Guochuan Lai at West Brom, Paul Suen Cho Hung at Birmingham City, Tony Xia at Aston Villa and Guo Guangchang at Wolves? If any of those owners were to bring real success to their clubs, they would receive the grateful adoration of their season-ticket holders. But the suspicion that they are not in it simply for the pleasure of owning a football club, or even for the local prestige that motivated the chairmen of earlier eras, is seeping like a slow-acting poison into the body of the league.</p> <p>Perhaps it helps to explain the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/sky-sports-bt-sport-people-switching-football-off\" title=\"\">recently announced decline in TV&#xa0;viewing figures</a> for live matches transmitted by Sky and BT this season. No doubt several factors are in play, including the feeling that the introduction of the regular Friday night match has finally created a surfeit of live football. The rebranding of the unloved League Cup as the EFL Cup has succeeding in making the competition even more of an irritating irrelevance, cluttering up the fixture list in a way that no major American sport would permit. And there may also be a growing boredom with the domination of the narrative by the small group of celebrity managers \u2013 Mourinho, Guardiola, Klopp, Wenger, Conte, Pochettino \u2013 at the top clubs, created and fuelled by the media.</p> <p>By other measurements, the Premier League is as healthy as it is wealthy. TV income continues to enrich many participants, deserving and otherwise. Stadiums remain full because fans are committed to their individual clubs. For the television audience, however, there seems to be a growing resistance to the relentless hysteria of the promotional buildup.

  "<p>An unusual election year has ushered in an unusual silence: the issue of abortion, almost always a cause for pitched battles between presidential candidates, has been all but invisible on the national stage as the campaign between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton draws to a close.</p> \n<p>There have been moments of high drama. Trump\u2019s call for \u201cpunishment\u201d when women get abortions in illegal circumstances collided with Clinton\u2019s demand, unprecedented for a major party presidential candidate, to roll back a 40-year restriction on public funds for abortion. And the third presidential debate saw Trump unleash an inflammatory line of attack, saying Clinton supported policy allowing doctors to \u201crip\u201d infants out of the womb days before birth.</p> \n<p>But contrast that with 2012, when the Republican ticket struggled to escape accusations that the party had waged a war on women\u2019s reproductive health. This year, only a handful of ballot races have revolved around issues of abortions.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s causing major abortion rights groups, a fixture in modern politics, to readjust.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-abortion-coalition-public-funding-planned-parenthood\">Trump forms anti-abortion coalition and would ban public funding for procedure</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cTrump\u2019s record with women took up a lot of air in this election,\u201d said Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman for Emily\u2019s List.

Some of its canvassing is aimed at discouraging support for Clinton. But a substantial proportion is aimed at keeping control of the Senate seats, in states such as Missouri and Florida, that are crucial to a Republican majority. </p> \n<p>These canvassers are highlighting Clinton\u2019s longtime support for abortion rights, said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for SBA List, including her \u201cextremist\u201d vote as senator in 2003 against a ban on a method of second- and third-trimester abortion. </p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s record as an anti-abortion rights crusader, by contrast, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-abortion-coalition-public-funding-planned-parenthood\">much shorter</a>. In an August 2015 primary debate, Trump said he could not commit to defunding Planned Parenthood without considering how the organization was \u201cgood for women\u201d. He did not commit to stripping Planned Parenthood of federal funds until this past February. Then, in April, Trump suggested that as president he would make no effort to overturn Roe v Wade. \u201cThe laws are set,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we have to leave it that way.\u201d He reversed himself one month later, telling Fox host Bill O\u2019Reilly that as president he would nominate \u201cpro life judges\u201d to the supreme court. </p> \n<p>But the reaction of pro- and anti-abortion rights activists alike has been to gloss over Trump\u2019s bumpy journey on abortion rights. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/planned-parenthood-state-repeal-abortion-restrictions\">Planned Parenthood: eight states now striving to repeal abortion restrictions</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe can only go by what he has said in this campaign,\u201d Long said. \u201cThat has ranged from saying that a woman should be punished for having an abortion\u201d if the procedure were illegal \u201cto taking advice, we assume, and talking points from anti-choice politicians like Mike Pence\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt his sincerity,\u201d said Quigley of Trump\u2019s current anti-abortion views. \u201cIn the third debate, you could really feel his passion.\u201d Trump himself, she added, has acknowledged that he is a convert to the cause. </p> \n<p>Still, it was only nine months ago that Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of SBA List, <a href=\"https://www.sba-list.org/home/pro-life-women-sound-the-alarmdonald-trump-is-unacceptable\">pleaded</a> with Iowa caucus-goers in an open letter to \u201csupport anyone but Donald Trump\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pressed on this, Quigley replied: \u201cWell, when it came down to a general election scenario, and we had two candidates, there is no question.

Asked about abortion late in a pregnancy, Trump opened up an inflammatory line of attack. \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying,\u201d Trump said, \u201cyou can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clinton shot back that many terminations late in pregnancy take place when \u201csomething terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">Clinton condemns Trump's abortion 'scare rhetoric' in debate question</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cUsing that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The exchange concerned one of the least understood and most controversial types of abortion \u2013 those taking place when the fetus approaches or passes the point of viability.</p> \n<p>It is a topic wracked by falsehoods. Wallace raised the issue of \u201cpartial birth abortion\u201d, a political term that doesn\u2019t readily correspond to a specific medical procedure, but which Congress nonetheless banned more than a decade ago. In 2003, the ban was upheld by the supreme court. </p> \n<p>Clinton has never campaigned on overturning the ban, but as a senator she voted against it. In the final debate, she explained that she voted \u201cno\u201d because the bill didn\u2019t make an exception for the health of the mother. Prior to the debate, she has said she supported \u201clate-pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump, meanwhile, has committed to signing a ban on abortion in the 20th week of pregnancy \u2013 before a fetus is viable outside the womb. </p> \n<p>But his suggestion that pregnancies are ended days before a pregnancy is full term doesn\u2019t appear to be supported in fact.</p> \n<p>The percentage of women having abortions past the midpoint of their pregnancy is very small. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6410a1.htm\">latest estimate</a> by the CDC is that fully 98.7% of abortions take place before 21 weeks\u2019 gestation. Most fetuses are not viable outside the womb for another three weeks. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights thinktank, estimates that proportion of terminations after 20 weeks is slightly higher, or about 15,000 procedures every year.</p> \n<p>Clinton\u2019s remarks, which characterized these terminations as being done in cases of severe fetal anomaly, do not fully capture what we know about later abortions. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-feminism-election-jessica-valenti\">Grab Trump by the ballot: either our bodies are our own, or they\u2019re not</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe know very little about women who seek later abortions,\u201d reads a 2013 study published in the journal of the Guttmacher Institute. \u201cBut data suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.\u201d (The study characterized \u201clater abortions\u201d as those taking place after 20 weeks.)</p> \n<p>Dr Warren Hern, who is one of only a handful of doctors in the country performing third-trimester abortions, agreed to speak in as much detail as he could about his own patients. </p> \n<p>Hern estimates that in a majority of his later abortion cases, the women are there because of a severe fetal anomaly. The rest of his clients are a mix. Hern objects to the term \u201celective abortion\u201d. \u201cIt makes it sound like you decided to have curls instead of bangs as a hairdo,\u201d he said. But he allows that many \u2013 although not a majority \u2013 of patients having later abortions are not there because of fetal anomaly.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout doing the kind of analysis I would need to do to be sure, I would say that more than half of the patients who come in [post-viability] are there because of fetal abnormalities, and this was a very desired pregnancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other, smaller proportion are usually very young women, 12 or 13 years old, who are victims of sexual assault, of incest. Or they are adult women who have been told by a doctor they can\u2019t get pregnant, or who thought they were post-menopausal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hern says he turns many women away. For one, after about 33 weeks, termination carries more serious risks. </p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the things I have to decide is, first of all, do I feel comfortable ending the pregnancy at a late stage when there is no obvious problem, such a fetal abnormality or a rape? If I have someone who\u2019s 33 weeks pregnant, and she should have had this done four or five months ago, I\u2019m not going to do that, because there\u2019s a certain amount of risk involved.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump, he said, \u201cis totally and abysmally ignorant about this subject. His statements are highly inflammatory and obscene and designed to inflame his followers, who don\u2019t need to be inflamed.\u201d</p> \n<p>But it is unclear if Trump\u2019s comments won him any followers.</p> \n<p>Wallace also asked Trump whether or not he wanted Roe v Wade to be overturned. Trump declined to answer, saying the issue \u201cwill go back to the states\u201d.

Its backdrop is the country\u2019s chronically sub-par performance in the biennial world Olympiads, which its team has not won since 2002 despite being regular top seeds. The 2016 Russian superfinal, which ended in Novosibirsk on Thursday, lacked players from the world top 10, since Sergey Karjakin is preparing for his world title match in New York next month while the former champion Vlad Kramnik is rumoured to be helping Karjakin.</p> <p>It was still a formidable contest with a first prize of one million roubles (around \u00a313,000). Its winner was also awarded a Renault Kaptur car worth about the same amount, whose subliminal message was to highlight the world title candidates in Moscow earlier this year where Karjakin thought he had won a BMW but it turned out to be just a test drive.</p> <p>All 12 GMs at Novosibirsk had ratings in the 2700s or 2600s and the tournament took a peculiar course. Until a combative final round the draw percentage was very high, around 75%, there was a seven-way tie for the lead with four rounds to go and the only player who got detached from the peloton was the local representative and the lowest ranked, Dmitry Bocharov. He was singled out as the fall guy whom everybody tried to beat and who lost five games. Bocharov\u2019s 2611 rating would still make him top seed in many western opens. Peter Svidler has won the championship seven times., breaking Mikhail Botvinnik\u2019s recprd six-timer in the Soviet era, but he is now one of the most popular online tournament commentators and has lost some of his playing edge. The other co-favourite, Alexander Grischuk, left his effort too late and had to settle for second. In their individual game, the pair opted for the once highly regarded but now overly drawish Ruy Lopez, Marshall Attack, and Grischuk produced a strange Na3 novelty, returning the Marshall gambit pawn (Bxa3 bxa3 Nxc3) to acquire the bishop pair.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/21/rameshbabu-praggnanandhaa-world-grandmaster-record\">Leonard Barden on Chess</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The final leading scores were Alexander Riazantsev 7/11, Alexander Grischuk and Evgeny Tomashevsky 6.5, Svidler and Vladimir Fedoseev 6.</p> <p>Riazantsev, the new champion, is 31.

Called Energy East, it would take tar sand oils across Canada to the Atlantic, where it would be shipped to the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The North Dakota oil boom began in 2006 with the discovery of the Parshall oil field in the Bakken shale and the use of new fracking and horizontal drilling technology, which could force oil from formations that could not be previously tapped. The Bakken formation is the biggest oil producer in the US, along with Texas\u2019s Eagle Ford, but <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/energy_in_brief/article/shale_in_the_united_states.cfm\">production has peaked</a>.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a7a817a-4863-11e6-8d68-72e9211e86ab\">US shale oil remains relatively cheap</a> to produce and there are signs <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/two-years-into-oil-slump-u-s-shale-firms-are-ready-to-pump-more-1474968601\">output is set to increase</a>.

  "<p></p> <h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>A Ukip leadership election always generates its fair share of eccentric candidates, and this month\u2019s crop \u2013 the last leader lasted only a few weeks \u2013 is no exception. Take the leather-jacketed John Rees-Evans who strolls around like a Channel 5 news presenter on fast-forward i<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwIjyvpyGt0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">n his YouTube campaign video</a>. \u201cHey look at me, I just talked to a Muslim woman for a couple of seconds, so I must be OK.\u201d Rees-Evans has an interesting past. When he was standing for the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC17ZHU_ZNU\">he told protesters outside his office</a> he had a horse which a donkey had tried to rape. Rees-Evans also has a home in rural Bulgaria which has been described as a fortified compound with a shooting range where the former soldier takes pot shots at paper portraits of terrorists. The last time he went to Ikea, Rees-Evans persuaded the sales assistant it would be safer to let him carry his handgun, in case terrorists laid siege to the building.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>One of the features of the Commons debate that followed the government\u2019s decision to build a third runway at Heathrow was just how poor many MPs\u2019 geography is. To listen to most of them speak, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that Gatwick was a world war two aerodrome with a grass runway that was stranded miles out in the sticks with no transport links to anywhere. The <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-10-25/debates/4D74A7CB-8921-48BD-9960-FD15D5D1EEDF/AirportCapacity\">most bizarre intervention</a> came from Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP for Reigate, who said: \u201cAs everyone who uses the Brighton main line will know, the Gatwick proposition, frankly, was not practical. Local authorities would have had to have found housing for the workforce to support the Gatwick option.\u201d For the record, Gatwick is situated near Crawley, about 20 miles south of London and there would have been no need to create a favela for those building a new runway.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Literary critics have often tended to turn their noses up at humorous fiction; when a review describes a book as \u201ca comic masterpiece\u201d, it generally means that one or two readers may \u2013 if they\u2019re lucky and in a good mood \u2013 smile once or twice while they\u2019re reading it. So the choice of the Man Booker judges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/25/paul-beatty-wins-man-booker-prize-2016\">to award the prize</a> to Paul Beatty\u2019s The Sellout was both welcome and overdue. But the organisers\u2019 decision, taken in 2014 to see off the perceived threat of the Folio prize, to widen the eligibility to any book written in the English language has backfired badly. Not so long ago, the announcement of the longlist, shortlist and winner provoked \u2013 if not a national debate \u2013 at least widespread interest, with authors that many readers recognised and enjoyed well represented.

Now it feels as if the Man Booker operates increasingly in a vacuum for the benefit of its own literary in-crowd.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Brexit means Brexit. Or so we\u2019ve heard the prime minister say often enough over the past couple of months. There have been the occasional variations of soft Brexit, hard Brexit, bankers\u2019 Brexit and people\u2019s Brexit, but the message has been essentially the same that Brexit means Brexit. Until just recently. Now it turns out that Brexit means Breakfast. The first person to say so was Andrew Davies, the Welsh Tory leader, at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham earlier this month. Now the Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is at it. During the course of a rather dull and vague speech about the impact of Brexit on the economy to a surprisingly full house at the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, McDonnell <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/oct/27/labour-to-warn-theresa-may-against-bankers-brexit-politics-live?page=with:block-58120609e4b0219a00d39468\">three times declared</a> the country was \u201cheading towards a chaotic breakfast\u201d.

The prospect of the evenings drawing in at 4.30 in the afternoon is so miserable. And unnecessary. We\u2019re told that the reason the clocks need to go back is to accommodate a few farmers in Scotland who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to keep track of their sheep and that the price of a few extra children being killed on the roads on their way back home is one well worth paying. But what was devolution for if not to allow Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales the freedom to choose their own timezones? Let them set the clocks to whatever time they feel like. It\u2019s hardly a major inconvenience for the rest of us to adjust our watches when we travel across the borders. The Americans and the Australians manage different time zones with no trouble; so what makes Britain too feeble-minded to do the same?</p> <p><strong>Digested week digested: </strong><strong>\u201cBritish Airways regrets to announce that Flight BA1964 to New York will be delayed until 2030 at the very earliest\u201d</strong></p>",

And if decades of training provided by the British to the Saudi pilots hasn\u2019t prevented these supposed errors by now, it seems rather unlikely that it will in the near future.</p> <p>In any case, this misrepresents the true nature of the British role. When the intervention began, then foreign secretary Philip Hammond pledged to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/11500518/UK-will-support-Saudi-led-assault-on-Yemeni-rebels-but-not-engaging-in-combat.html\" title=\"\">support the Saudis in every practical way short of engaging in combat</a>\u201d, including \u201cspare parts, maintenance, technical advice, resupply\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/british-technical-support-saudi-op-yemen-hammond-210205762.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma&amp;ref=gs\" title=\"\">logistical support</a>\u201d.

The Saudis and their allies can only wage this war because the Anglo-American suppliers of their air forces are providing active, material support. And British and American politicians can only collude in these outrages because the political cost on them so far has been low.

  "<p>I was sitting near the front of a business jet my company was delivering from our factory in Brazil to New York. It was 29 September 2006. There were two pilots up front and five of us in the cabin. Soon we were cruising over the Amazon jungle at 37,000 feet and 500mph. The skies were clear; the plane was beautiful. I remember saying to Henry, a colleague, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d</p> <p>I was standing up getting a phone charger from my bag when all of a&#xa0;sudden \u2013 <em>bam!</em> \u2013 I felt an impact. I&#xa0;stumbled a little but then the plane&#xa0;returned to flying straight and level. It was as if we\u2019d hit a&#xa0;speed bump at 100mph. I returned to my seat in stunned silence. As&#xa0;I&#xa0;was strapping in, Henry said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been hit.\u201d I&#xa0;looked out the window on the left side and saw that&#xa0;the winglet, the bit that curves up at the end of the wing, had been sheared off. The metal was separating and there was a&#xa0;sheen of fuel. I&#xa0;remember staring at that wing, expecting the worst. I&#xa0;thought about my kids and hoped they weren\u2019t going to read about me dying.</p> <p>The pilots found a military airport deep in the jungle. It was straight ahead but we were a little too high, so we had to fly past and make a turn above the treetops: we&#xa0;had no way of knowing if the wing would hold up. But after the longest 35 minutes imaginable, we landed. There was such an incredible sense of relief.</p> <p>The soldiers looked stunned to see us, as if a UFO had landed. Outside the plane, we could see the tail had also been damaged; it was a&#xa0;complete mystery as to what had happened. As we speculated over pizza in the barracks, where we had no phone signal or internet access, the only Portuguese speaker in our group came over and said, \u201cGuys, I\u2019ve some news\u2026 There\u2019s a missing airliner.\u201d The hairs on my arms still stand up when I&#xa0;remember that moment. People were crying, praying.</p> <p>We later learned that we had collided head-on with a Boeing 737 operated by Gol, a Brazilian airline, with 154 people on board. The winglet on our plane had taken off the left wing of the bigger plane, which immediately started to spiral and broke up. It took three minutes for the pieces to crash into the jungle. Nobody survived.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/16/experience-flew-solo-round-world-hot-air-balloon\">Experience: I flew solo around the world in a hot-air balloon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To this day I cannot fathom how, at that altitude and speed \u2013 a closure rate of 1,000mph \u2013 two planes could have contact head-on and not both crash. People don\u2019t just walk away from that. It happened so quickly that even the pilots didn\u2019t see anything.</p> <p>It was then Brazil\u2019s worst aviation disaster and it triggered a&#xa0;national crisis. The next evening, we were flown out by military jet in a&#xa0;lightning storm to be interviewed by federal police in another town. We watched as they brought our black box in. By the time they had found&#xa0;the wreckage of the other plane, the government had already declared us guilty.</p> <p>In Brazil, the military oversees accident investigation and air traffic control, and we worried that the investigation would be tainted. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/18/turbulenttimes\">The&#xa0;pilots\u2019 passports were confiscated</a> and I ended up camped out with them on the top floor of the Marriott hotel in Rio. I&#xa0;thought they might be killed if they went to jail, because the hysteria and propaganda were so great.</p> <p>After two months, their passports were returned. Meanwhile lawyers descended on the families of the victims. The investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board later found that <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/ntsb-loss-of-39effective-air-traffic-control39-at-root-of-2006-legacy-600-gol-737-320034/\">air traffic control failures</a> were to blame; but the situation in Brazil hasn\u2019t yet been fully resolved for the pilots, who were acquitted in absentia of all but one charge, of safety failure, in 2012 by a&#xa0;Brazilian federal court. They still fly today, but if they land in Brazil they could face arrest.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to be happy about survival when it\u2019s attached to the deaths of so many others. It never leaves you. I have a piece of that wing in my office and I look at it every day. It\u2019s a reminder of how fleeting life can be. After the accident, I was focused on our own survival and the wellbeing of the pilots. But since then I\u2019ve felt only a&#xa0;growing sadness for the families of the victims.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Simon Usborne</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

What\u2019s hard is getting people to listen to it. I\u2019m not going to mislead anybody, there are a lot of podcasts out there. What anyone has to do to get anyone to listen to it, who knows? I don\u2019t know. Before you were chosen by a network or a label or a comedy club and given an opportunity, here it all rests with you and how you find your way out of the tremendous pile of stuff. That\u2019s the trick. I think that once you start having big ideas about how much money you\u2019re going to make from your podcast, or how you\u2019re going to get this or that out there or what needs to happen and a lot of energy goes into that, it sort of amplifies the possibilities for disappointment. It\u2019s a difficult entrepreneurial venture, but we didn\u2019t go into it because of that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/14/fifty-best-podcasts-bob-mortimer-john-oliver-jemaine-clement-serial\">The 50 podcasts you need to hear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Podcasting is a great technology. It\u2019s a medium that anyone can do and you can just throw your hat into the ring. But getting people to it, that is just as hard as anything else you can create and put out in the world. But with podcasting you don\u2019t have much to lose. Just temper your expectations and try to create what you want to create. Figure out how to get people to hear it and like it. Don\u2019t think that you necessarily have the million-dollar idea or that everything is going to turn around. Just do the best that you can do and try to realize your vision and see if other people like it. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s on them. And if that bothers you, well, you can just keep trying to get people to like you, I guess, but that\u2019s never been my approach.<br></p> <h2><strong>Lauren Lapkus, With Special Guest: \u2018</strong>The secret to podcast success is making it fun for yourself\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b16f3a886c7355d7897d55166f28d9d4534d6158\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b16f3a886c7355d7897d55166f28d9d4534d6158/0_30_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Lapkus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren Lapkus: \u2018The connective tissue between storytelling, advice and comedy is passion.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the perks of my show\u2019s format is that I don\u2019t have to prepare in advance. My guest is the host, and they determine the theme of the show and the character I\u2019ll play. They don\u2019t tell me anything until we\u2019re already recording, so the show is fully improvised. But I do 10 hours of vocal warm-ups before each show and refuse to record until I\u2019ve done a thousand crunches in total silence. Because the guest is playing the role of the host, it\u2019s important for them to feel as comfortable as possible \u2013 choosing a theme and character for themselves that they enjoy makes it much easier to jump right into the conversation. I\u2019ve never felt like anyone did a bad job at that, though! I\u2019ve been lucky to have a ton of amazing performers on my show. </p> <p>The secret to podcast success is sticking with it and making it fun for yourself. The podcasts that keep my attention are those where I can feel the hosts and guests are enjoying themselves or are really passionate about the subject matter. The connective tissue between storytelling, advice and comedy is passion. </p> <h2><strong>Aaron Mahnke, Lore: \u2018</strong>I spend 30 to 40 hours preparing each episode\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d0fb6734400b08cf9dabfb710161bee814ea5c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d0fb6734400b08cf9dabfb710161bee814ea5c0/0_79_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Mahnke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Mahnke: \u2018All successful podcast do one thing: they deliver consistent quality content that exceeds the listeners\u2019 expectations\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no secret or magic pill to ensure a podcast\u2019s success, but there are some best practices. I think all successful podcast do one thing: they deliver consistent quality content that exceeds the listeners\u2019 expectations. I spend 30 to 40 hours preparing each episode \u2013 that includes research, reading, planning, writing, recording, producing and launching the episode. The rest of my time is spent on the television show, press interviews, live shows, bookkeeping and admin, and fan email. I get hundreds of those each month. I started Lore by accident, and have just been trying to figure it out as I go. The fans are amazing, though, and they\u2019re like cheerleaders. This is a non-stop job, and it\u2019s growing every day, so having them along for the ride to cheer me on is powerful. </p> <p>There\u2019s one thing that makes me subscribe to a podcast: quality. I give a lot of shows a try. A friend will recommend a show, or I\u2019ll see one highlighted in an article online, and I\u2019ll click the link. So I\u2019m happy to try things out. But if it\u2019s not good, I won\u2019t come back.

Don\u2019t be self-conscious. Don\u2019t worry about whether you sound like this person or that person or what level of expertise you\u2019re on \u2013 just do it. Just jump in. It\u2019s really important to train your audience to expect something that is going to be delivered on schedule. If you have a weekly show, deliver it weekly. I am very meticulous with regard to my preparation before interviews. I spend a lot of hours researching and finding just random interviews and anything random that I can find about my guests to bring a different texture, a different element to the interview. I want to make my interview with my guests really unique. It\u2019s all about preparation.</p> <p>A podcast can be a very intimate experience with your audience, your listeners. Be forthcoming and honest with your audience, particularly when it comes down to your personality that\u2019s involved in the podcast. Let them know your shortcomings and let them endear themselves to you and let them feel as if they can champion you as you champion your audience.</p> <h2><strong>Linda Holmes, NPR\u2019s Pop Culture Happy Hour: \u2018Embrace other podcasts\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c8abd105fef56a32963d872ecc072121aca0c09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c8abd105fef56a32963d872ecc072121aca0c09/0_79_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Holmes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Holmes: \u2018Think about where you want the show to end up.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry French/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Modest expectations are a very important starting point, especially with conversation-based podcasts. People have a really inaccurate understanding of how much work they are, both from a content point and especially from a production standpoint. People don\u2019t understand that people who produce high-quality chat shows spend a lot of time editing and cutting them. Don\u2019t be in the position of thinking that for the low, low price of a couple of hours of work a week you can make something that is going to make something that sounds like it came out of BuzzFeed. </p> <p>When you\u2019re starting a podcast, think about where you want the show to end up and what you can do to get yourself to that point. Think about who you want involved in your show and what kind of quality control you want to put on it. There is so much benefit in embracing other podcasts, other people who make podcasts.

  "<p>There\u2019s a big debate in the world of obesity treatment. Does it help to inform someone they\u2019re obese, or does it cause unnecessary distress?</p> <p>Those who believe the former will be buoyed by a new study, published in <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31893-1/fulltext\">the Lancet medical journal</a> on Tuesday, which attracted excited news coverage. With usual restraint, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2040836/gps-must-prescribe-free-weight-watchers-sessions-to-fat-patients-to-save-the-nhs-billions-each-year/\">the Sun shouted</a>, \u2018HONESTY IS BEST POLICY: GPs must TELL patients they\u2019re fat\u2019, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/24/gps-should-not-worry-about-offending-obese-patients-finds-study\">the Guardian announced</a>, \u2018GPs should not worry about offending obese patients\u2019. Both took their lead from <a href=\"http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=169249&amp;CultureCode=en\">the Lancet\u2019s own press release</a>, which stated \u2018the findings should provide reassurance to doctors who rarely talk to patients about their weight for fear of causing offense\u2019.</p> <p>But does the study support this conclusion? And can, as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37717594\">the BBC declared</a>, a 30-second chat really<em> </em>trigger weight loss? The answer as ever requires delving beyond the headlines. </p> <p>The study, led by a <a href=\"https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/news/gp-referral-to-weight-loss-programme-is-effective-acceptable-and-takes-30-seconds\">team from the University of Oxford</a>, was a <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/316/7126/201\">randomised controlled trial</a> of GP-led referral to commercial weight loss programmes. Patients with an obese body mass index were recruited while waiting to see their GP, and given an envelope to take into their appointment. The GP opened the envelope, and depending on whether the patient had been randomly assigned to the intervention or control group, reacted accordingly. In both situations, the GP spent around 30-seconds recommending that the patient lose weight. Those allocated for intervention were referred to a commercial weight loss programme and helped to book their first appointment, while controls were left to their own devices.</p> <p>That difference - whether the patient was actively helped to book onto a commercial weight loss programme or was left to their own devices - is what the study primarily tested. Not the effectiveness of the 30-second chat, and certainly not whether it\u2019s helpful telling patients they\u2019re obese.</p> <p>The trial\u2019s reported success is because those who received the intervention lost an extra 1.4kg (3.1lb) after 12-months compared to those who received the control. But since all the participants received a 30-second chat, it\u2019s impossible to say whether this was itself useful, as there was nothing to compare it to. Although the control group were 1kg (2.2lb) lighter at the end of the study than they were at the beginning, this might not be that surprising, because of a statistical quirk called <a href=\"http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/215.full\">regression-to-the-mean</a>, first described by statistician Francis Galton, <a href=\"http://www.dcscience.net/Senn-2011-Francis-Galton-and-Regression-to-the-Mean.pdf\">who found that tall parents had children who were, on average, shorter than their parents</a>. This law of measurement occurs because any extreme value (one far away from average) is more likely to be a high water point than a true extreme. Think how often you\u2019ve discovered an amazing new dish at a restaurant, only to find it disappointing the second time around. Along with the placebo-effect, this is one of the key reasons why a control group is so important. </p> <p>So, to the question of whether a 30-second chat can trigger weight loss, the answer is maybe, maybe not. We know only<em> </em>that a 30-second chat followed by immediate referral to a commercial weight loss programme can lead to modest weight loss over a period of 12-months. It\u2019s a substantial leap from there to concluding that GPs can talk freely to their patients about their weight without fear of causing offense.</p> <p>The study did ask participants whether they found the chat \u2018appropriate\u2019 and \u2018helpful\u2019, and almost all participants agreed. But this does not prove that all such conversations are appropriate and helpful. First because the results can\u2019t be interpreted beyond the brief and highly scripted discussions in the study. Second because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias\">questionnaires are highly susceptible to bias</a>, depending on factors such as wording and how, where, and by whom questions are asked. To avoid this, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758883/\">the gold-standard approach to testing the pros and cons of a new intervention are in-depth (qualitative) interviews</a>. Research of this type was planned in the <a href=\"http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-14-393\">study protocol</a>, but was not included in the final publication. <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016937\">Qualitative research is considerably more difficult to publish in leading medical journals</a>. The Lancet will hopefully welcome these results when they are available, and afford them with same publicity as they have the numerical findings.</p> <p>Another difference between the <a href=\"http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-14-393\">protocol</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31893-1/fulltext\">the publication</a> includes what\u2019s been explicitly highlighted as a potential \u2018competing interest\u2019. In the protocol the authors state under \u2018competing interests\u2019 that, \u2018Slimming World and Rosemary Conley\u2026 agreed to fund free treatment courses for NHS patients participating in the trial\u2019. In the article, they state under \u2018acknowledgments\u2019 that, \u2018the weight loss programmes\u2026 provided by Slimming World and Rosemary Conley Health\u2026were donated to the NHS\u2019. Semantic differences aside, the study has provided excellent marketing in the media and in the wording of the \u2018typical\u2019 GP conversation, which asked, \u201cDid you know the best way to lose weight is to go to [Slimming World or Rosemary Conley]\u2026?\u201d. Rival weight-loss companies may dispute this, especially those that advocate more drastic methods such as meal-replacements. But the bigger issue, and perhaps the key limitation with spending just 30-seconds on something as complex as obesity, is what was not said.</p> <p>As most who\u2019ve tried to change their weight will affirm, the biggest challenge isn\u2019t so much the initial weight-loss, <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph53/evidence/evidence-review-1c-431707935\">but keeping it off</a>. In fact <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759019/\">the single best predictor of future weight gain is to currently be on a diet</a>. How then should a GP respond when the same patient returns after a couple of years having regained their weight, or gained even more? And what impact might this have on the patient\u2019s self-esteem, and their trust in their doctor? Until such questions are answered, I think GPs are right to pause and think carefully about how and when to raise something as sensitive as obesity.</p> <p><em>Dr Peter Tennant is a University Academic Fellow in Healthcare Research and Statistical Epidemiologist at the University of Leeds.

  "<h2><strong>Never go \u2018event\u2019 shopping</strong></h2> <p>Having to buy something for a particular occasion is everything that shopping for clothes shouldn\u2019t be. The clue is in the words \u201chaving to\u201d. As soon as the search for something to wear becomes a necessity rather than a treat, it loses 90% of the appeal. What should be an opportunity to indulge morphs into a task where the odds are stacked against you. Either you will have a specific vision of what you are looking for in your role as the bride\u2019s mother, or for an appearance at an ex-boyfriend\u2019s 30th, or your best friend\u2019s second wedding in Warsaw \u2013 or you will have no idea at all of what you want.</p> <p>Both situations are unsatisfactory. The first is unlikely to succeed, since invariably the piece that you have fixed on in your mind will be impossible to track down, or if you do manage to discover your vision, there is a good chance it won\u2019t look the way you thought it would. The alternative condemns you to trailing round websites or stores in a state of increasing desperation, faced with the multitude of choice and product, and becoming more confused and hot and bothered as the hours pass.</p> <p>Experience has taught me to avoid this, but even so, just before the round of fashion shows, when I am away for a month with engagements day and night in a world where everyone is looking at each other\u2019s clothes, I often get caught short and end up wandering in a daze around a department store on a Saturday afternoon.</p> <h2><strong>If you love it, buy it</strong></h2> <p>This leads on from the above. Sometimes you walk into a shop and see something that you know is right for you. You don\u2019t even have to try it on. Buy it. It may have no immediate use, whether it be yet another pair of black trousers, or a flimsy summer holiday dress when holidays are a million months distant. But no matter. You won\u2019t regret it, and when the time comes that you do need a new pair of trousers and you have exactly that hanging in the cupboard, or when you are packing for a holiday and have something you have never worn ready for the sun and sea, you will simply be happy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I buy things on impulse, rather than need, I have a different emotional relationship with them. They are for pleasure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If I buy things on impulse, struck by a coup de foudre rather than need, I have a different emotional relationship with them. They are for pleasure, rather than for work. Most of my favourite clothes have been bought like this \u2013 often when travelling.</p> <p>There is little that gives more pleasure than snapping up something you know you will love wearing when you didn\u2019t expect to. Last spring, I bought a navy coat when I had two others in my wardrobe at home, both tired and faded, and it seemed an erratic extravagance. Now the days are shortening and the temperature has dropped, it\u2019s a relief I don\u2019t have to schlep out and find a new coat when I\u2019ve got no time. There\u2019s one already there, just waiting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57f769457cf57f7af747deb79ac3b4f9abe9b3ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57f769457cf57f7af747deb79ac3b4f9abe9b3ae/119_34_1798_2935/613.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandra Shulman\" width=\"613\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandra Shulman at the Business of Fashion gala dinner, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Heel height is key</strong></h2> <p>The look of an outfit is transformed by heel heights. This is one of the areas of fashion in which I am the least comfortable playing around. Although I can see the way varying heights will make an outfit more contemporary, I find it hard to move away from my comfort zone of slim 85-90mm heels. Any higher and I think I look ludicrous: towering platforms on me have the whiff of a mutton alert, even if they have fashion kudos. Ever since, aged 12, when I opened the front door to the shortest girl in the class and realised she was taller than me, I have abandoned flat shoes.</p> <p>Even so, the success of the simple pairing of a skirt and sweater is often to do with those heels. One of the things fashion does to move on is alter proportions, which means that, for example, the calf-length sunray pleated skirt, currently in every high-street store, worn with a pair of mid-height courts will now look Princess Di 1980s (and not in an ironic fashion way). The same skirt with substantial wedges, or hefty flatforms, or high skinny heels, will be on trend. It is up to you whether that is your intention, or whether you are happy to adopt the style of a female scout leader at a garden party. In which case, to perfect the look, add a blazer that covers your bottom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2906d874483bd747541c5144b5e2688f8dffed07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2906d874483bd747541c5144b5e2688f8dffed07/14_122_485_291/485.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandra Shulman at a magazine shoot in 1980.\" width=\"485\" height=\"291\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a magazine shoot in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: alexandravogue/instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>You will always be tempted to replicate what you wore at 17. This is not always a mistake</h2> <p>There is a maxim that you should not wear again a look that you are old enough to have worn first time around, but that is nonsense. It\u2019s perfectly possible that something that suited you then will also suit you now, although it may need a careful recalibration. If you feel at home, that will go a long way to making you look good.<br></p> <p>Age and appearance are uncomfortable bedfellows, and I think when most of us look in the mirror, we still see ourselves through a forgiving filter that knocks off at least a decade, and in my case probably several more. This is nature\u2019s way of letting us down gently, and is supported by the way we view old friends and family through a similar lens. So long as you bear this in mind, there is no reason not to make a beeline for the kind of look you adopted at 17.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My tie-dye is just about acceptable if I fling a well-cut jacket over a tie-dye shirt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was a teenager in the mid-1970s, and I have only to glimpse a high-waisted, flowing hippy gown, a Biba-style suede boot or a rainbow stripe to get a craving. My complete weakness is for tie-dye, and I find it almost impossible to resist; I can spot a tie-dyed fabric from several hundred metres. There was a satisfactory moment a couple of years back when there was lots of graded colour around \u2013 referred to as ombre \u2013 which ticked my tie-dye box in a sophisticated and subtle way, but sadly it seems to have disappeared for now. It doesn\u2019t take a therapist to understand the Proustian hit I get eyeing the colourful patterns, which take me back to when I started going out with boys and suddenly the world seemed a much more exciting place. I spent hours with a plastic washing-up bowl and boxes of Dylon, tying and untying white T-shirts and leaving them to brew overnight, hoping for the perfect mixture of swirl and starburst.</p> <p>If the 80s was your teen moment, it\u2019s likely to be a bat-wing sleeve or padded shoulder and oversized jacket (very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements\">Vetements</a>, which makes it very now) that beckons you from across the shop. And if your personal style initiation was 90s, it\u2019s likely to be the grunge staples of a slip dress and check shirt that perform the same call to action.</p> <p>It\u2019s fine to keep buying whatever this might be; you just have to wear it differently. A head-to-toe retread of how you looked when you got your O-level results is probably not a wise route, but everything can be updated by mixing it up with more contemporary pieces. My tie-dye is just about acceptable if I fling a well-cut jacket over a tie-dye shirt, but looks tragic if I wear it with a khaki parka or, heaven forbid, the Afghan coat it would have been paired with back in the day.</p> <h2><strong>Loose clothes don\u2019t make you look slimmer</strong></h2> <p>Loose clothes look best on beanpoles. If you are larger, huge amounts of material hanging around the place does no favours and won\u2019t disguise the fact you are of a fuller figure. Tents are for sleeping in and not for wearing.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t do the maths</strong></h2> <p>You might think you can rationalise buys through calculating wear per pound, but it\u2019s not worth the trouble. Like politicians, we can always find a way to massage the figures to come out with the result we want. The other day, I fell in love with a handbag in Milan. It was incredibly expensive. I spent three days doing the maths \u2013 adding in the cost of the coat, pair of shoes and book that I didn\u2019t buy in the following days \u2013 so I could place this saving against the cost of the prospective bag. Then, naturally, I added in how many years I would carry this bag, and how, in 10 years, it would still be doing good service, while also converting euros into pounds (currently a profoundly depressing experience), and trying to work out whether there would be a price advantage to buying it in Italy, where it was produced, rather than back home. Doing the maths made what was a luscious indulgence into a balance sheet and made the notion of this bag an additional stress. I didn\u2019t buy it, but I\u2019m still not sure that was the right decision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e55f39d4c99abd244796562e03e0866297c21dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e55f39d4c99abd244796562e03e0866297c21dd/34_23_1895_2809/675.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian West and Alexandra Shulman at Vogue\u2019s centenary gala dinner\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Kardashian West and Alexandra Shulman at Vogue\u2019s centenary gala dinner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Black is a double-edged sword</strong></h2> <p>We tend to think that black is the sensible choice: doesn\u2019t show the dirt, teams with everything, doesn\u2019t shriek in the way a colour does and so can be worn more often without everyone thinking you are wearing the same old thing. But it can be so dull. There\u2019s a reason so many shop assistants, bank clerks and waitresses are told to dress in black, and that is so that they don\u2019t shine. They merge, anonymously and unthreateningly, into the background.</p> <p>You have to spend only a few days at the international fashion shows to go off black. While the catwalks are covered in wild and fantastic colour and fabric, the audience are likely to be wearing all kinds of expensive black that is certainly chic and fashionable, but looks as if everyone has turned up in school uniform.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, black clothes are like a sartorial painkiller: they simply remove the pressure and get you through the day. Whenever buying black, spend the most you can afford. There\u2019s something about better quality fabric that gives black a depth and richness the cheap stuff doesn\u2019t have. Black velvet looks good on everyone, as does black cashmere; black nylon less so. And you can spin it either way. Go for glam with a red lip and let your jewellery do the talking, or go for the palely interesting, I-am-not-making-a\u2011fuss-about-how-I-look styling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52b9dcb240d43e28547f99b274420af44a6a8374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b9dcb240d43e28547f99b274420af44a6a8374/69_225_2032_2911/698.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandra Shulman at the Vogue 90th anniversary party\" width=\"698\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandra Shulman at the Vogue 90th anniversary party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>You can\u2019t beat a good dress</strong></h2> <p>Having watched the catwalk shows for next spring/summer, one point I have taken away is that everybody was showing dresses. Some seasons it is trousers that win the day, but next year, hurrah, dresses rule. This is good news, because it is a fact (and when it comes to fashion, there are not many facts) that you can\u2019t beat a good dress. I am amazed how many more compliments I get for dresses than for any other item in my wardrobe, in particular from people who wouldn\u2019t normally notice. Dresses do the business in so many ways and, because you don\u2019t have the trouble of teaming separates, they are easier to put on in the morning and cut the need for extra decisions.</p> <p>Dresses come in many guises. I\u2019m not particularly fond of the corporate power dress, but I understand why it has become popular: a body-skimming, block-colour item with a bit of helpful stretch has become a female alternative to a man\u2019s suit. Think of those Silicon Valley powerhouse women such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/marissa-mayer\">Marissa Mayer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sheryl-sandberg\">Sheryl Sandberg</a>, who appear as beacons of magenta or cyan. Or, closer to home, any number of television presenters and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/karren-brady\">Lady Karren Brady</a>.</p> <p>But these dresses have no charisma and bind rather than free. A really great dress is likely to be in print, and while it may fit tightly, it is more likely to have flow and flare. It has its own movement and slides over the form without bandaging it. The perfect dress feels as if you are wearing nothing bar a skim of fabric on your skin. Clonk around in brogues and a buzz-cut if you don\u2019t want to look too girly, but in a good dress you should feel liberated and \u2013 if I dare use such an old-fashioned and divisive adjective \u2013 pretty.</p> <p>I have hundreds of dresses collected over the years that I find hard to get rid of, even when past their first flush of youth. I can be brutal with jackets, trousers and skirts, but dresses often carry with them a sense of promise I don\u2019t want to lose. It\u2019s usually of a life I don\u2019t have, something that exists solely in bright days and gleaming sunsets, where there is always a party of friends to go to or a picnic on a lawn. Some, like the one in colourful, raw patterned linen from <a href=\"http://www.zeromariacornejo.com/\">Maria Cornejo</a>, get packed up from summer to summer, waiting for the heat to return; others, such as a pair of silk tea dresses I bought last May, will hang year round to be worn with sweaters and boots. This winter, I have two floral dresses that have seen me through the fashion shows and will now move away from their tour of duty to civvy life for years to come. At any rate, that\u2019s the plan.</p> <p>\u2022 Inside Vogue: A Diary Of My 100th Year, by Alexandra Shulman, is published by Penguin at 16.99.

  "<p>Lindsey Snell knew she was being hunted. A Syrian contact<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>had told her that militants had already arrested her fixer Abdullah, but they were coming for her next. This was Jabhat al-Nusra territory. No armed group, certainly not the smaller and more moderate one she was with, would be able to stand up to what was then al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate in Syria. </p> <p>The rebel faction she was with tried to protect her, moving her from one house to another in the small village in the countryside of Aleppo where she was staying. As the minutes ticked by, she furiously sent text messages to her emergency contacts and tried to hide some of her footage, shoving hard drives and a secondary camera underneath a wardrobe. She kept her main camera and laptop in plain sight though \u2013 hiding everything would be too suspicious. </p> <p>When they did arrive, 10 men, most in military gear and a few in robes, demanded that she come with them, and that she turn over her phone. She asked to use the bathroom first and panicked for a moment in front of the sink. She deleted as many photos as she could, particularly a few of Idlib, a city near Aleppo that is Nusra\u2019s stronghold. She was afraid that if they saw those images, they would think she was a spy. </p> <p>\u201cI thought I was screwed, that they were probably going to hold me for a year or two until someone paid my ransom,\u201d she told the Guardian. </p> <p>Snell, a 32-year-old year old journalist originally from Daytona, Florida, would be detained by these Nusra militants for about two weeks in July, before she escaped and made it to the border with Turkey. There, anticipating freedom, she instead again became a captive, but this time, of the government. Turkish authorities arrested her on 6 August for illegally \u201centering a military zone\u201d. Turkish authorities held her for about two months, before freeing her and deporting her back to the US on 12 October. </p> <p>Her story of being doubly detained by both militants and the Turkish government in quick succession is remarkable, as very few journalists detained in Syria have made it out alive to tell their story of captivity. In her first interview since being deported out of Turkey, Snell told the Guardian her story and addressed the accusations of recklessness thrown at her from fellow journalists.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been calling me reckless since I started \u2026 I faced derision from some other journalists for going. At this point, almost all foreign journalists had stopped going,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"507b608725d56bcf49706ab417d307939a119513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/507b608725d56bcf49706ab417d307939a119513/0_0_1052_1056/996.jpg\" alt=\"lindsey snell syria\" width=\"996\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo taken by Lindsey Snell of a young boy she said had been injured by Russian cluster bombs in the town of Kafr Halab, Syria, in mid-July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Snell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snell said she left for Syria in mid-July to film the toll of Russian and Syrian airstrikes on civilians, which have relentlessly pounded hospitals, schools and markets. It was her seventh trip to the country as a freelance journalist since 2014, three years after the start of the war. She has filmed more than 30 video dispatches from Syria, some of which have aired on Vocativ, MSNBC, Fusion and the Discovery Seeker Channel. One of her pieces, on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/134215817\">Aleppo schools hit by airstrikes</a>, won an Edward R Murrow award this year.</p> <p>Snell was embedded with Thuwar al-Sham, an Islamist faction that operates in the Aleppo area. Thuwar is active in areas where Nusra had the ultimate authority, and Snell said her fixer arranged for her to get the necessary permission to film. </p> <p>Nusra has since rebranded itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (the Front for the Conquest of the Levant) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">claims it has ended its links with al-Qaida</a>, though experts say the group is effectively still the same. </p> <p>\u201cMy focus in this trip was on doctors, hospitals and rescuers,\u201d Snell said. \u201cThese are hospitals where the patients are more than 95% civilian. These aren\u2019t hospitals for militants.\u201d</p> <p>She filmed for about three days before she was kidnapped. In that time, she said she saw children whose limbs had been blown off by Russian cluster bombs, and talked to doctors who were frustrated by the lack of support and supplies they were receiving from the international community, in part, they believed, because of the presence of Nusra in their area. </p> <p>Snell said she was staying in Kafr Halab, a village in the western countryside of Aleppo, when Nusra seized her. According to Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, the group Snell was with wouldn\u2019t have been in a position to resist Nusra, and even having permission from someone within Nusra itself wouldn\u2019t have guaranteed her protection. </p> <p>\u201cThe militant landscape is just so complex, so factional, that even when you\u2019ve got an organization like al-Nusra, there are multiple different subtractions within that can essentially act like a law and order within themselves,\u201d he said . </p> <p>A JFS spokesman said they couldn\u2019t provide any information as the incident occurred under the \u201cnow defunct Jabhat al-Nusra administration\u201d.</p> <p>Snell said that after the militants seized her, they interrogated her and then kept her in a house for a week before taking her to a \u201ccave-like\u201d prison when she was kept in a cell by herself for two days. Most of her captors, she notes, were foreigners, including an Iraqi, a Tunisian and a German. They asked her questions about her work and her religion (Snell converted to Islam a year and a half ago when she married her husband in 2015). However, as the fighting to break the siege of Aleppo began to intensify, they moved to a home with women and children \u2013 the wives, sisters and children of Nusra fighters.</p> <p>Snell said there were five women in the house at any given time, and that the ones that weren\u2019t pregnant were breastfeeding newborns. They were all Syrians, and Snell describes them as \u201ckind but guarded\u201d. One of them asked her for her family contacts. Over a few days, she was able to gain their trust, and they let her use their cellphones. </p> <p>\u201cI used one of their phones sporadically when they\u2019d let me. They had app blockers on everything but the internet, so I made a Gmail and emailed my husband a couple times,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Snell\u2019s husband, Suliman Wardak, told the Guardian that the FBI was in close contact with him during this period, and that the US government was planning a rescue attempt, but both he and Snell said one was never attempted. The US government declined to comment.</p> <p>Her emergency contact for the trip, freelance photographer <a href=\"https://joeyl.com/overview/category/quick-portfolio\">Joey Lawrence</a>, who has himself done work to Syria, was also involved.<strong> </strong>He had consulted with Snell before making his own trip to Syria in March 2015.</p> <p>He had been in touch with Snell in the days leading up to her capture. Once she messaged him saying she had been kidnapped, he contacted the Committee to Protect Journalists and the <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/hostage-recovery-fusion-cell-established\">Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell,</a> a government entity that includes the DoJ, the state department and the Treasury. </p> <p>The Hostage Cell and the CPJ were actively working to secure her release during the two weeks Snell was held captive in Syria, Lawrence said.<strong> \u201c</strong>I believe they did everything in their power to help her,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Hostage Cell wouldn\u2019t comment on Snell\u2019s case, but said the agency dedicates \u201csignificant interagency attention and resources to safely bring [Americans held hostage abroad] home\u201d.</p> <p>Ultimately, Snell said she was able to use her own contacts to arrange a rescue by a man affiliated with another allied Islamist group, Ahrar al-Sham. He agreed to wait for her with a motorcycle by a nearby road on a given night. She just had to get there first. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f127f6d0b325463399c83d32668105c9b7128686\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f127f6d0b325463399c83d32668105c9b7128686/0_0_600_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"lindsey snell\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lindsey Snell with photographer Jake Simkin in the countryside of Aleppo in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Jake Simkin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snell said she had adopted a cat during her first days of filming, and the militants let her keep it while she was detained. Before she left the house, she said she let the cat out first, so that if she was stopped, she could just say she was looking for it. The house was not well guarded, Snell said, as many of the fighters had been called to the frontline. </p> <p>Snell said she managed to leave the house, walk 10 minutes across a field of olive trees, and to the man waiting on the motorcycle. </p> <p>\u201cI was terrified. If they caught me I\u2019d be placed in really bad conditions for the duration of my captivity,\u201d she said. </p> <p>From there, Snell said the man who rescued her took her to a house near the border with Turkey, where she hid for two days before a smuggler took her to the border area. Once she was on the Turkish side, Snell said she briefly got into a car with a woman from the US consulate and men in jeans she thought might have been US special forces, but that the Turkish guards made her get out and ride with them. Turkish authorities interrogated her, arrested her and brought before a judge.</p> <p>Snell had left Turkey just before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-coup-attempt\">failed 15 July coup</a> against Erdogan\u2019s government and returned in the middle of an ongoing crackdown during which authorities have thrown hundreds of Turkish journalists in jail. The US government\u2019s efforts to get a US citizen safely out of Syria ended up being used against her. Turkish media portrayed her as a US spy, at time when the same media was alleging that the CIA had been behind the coup.</p> <p>Snell said the conditions in the Turkish prisons where she stayed were worse than what she had encountered in Syria. During her first 17 days of her 67-day detention, she was kept in solitary confinement at Iskenderun prison. She took up smoking Winston cigarettes to pass the time. Fluorescent lights beamed down on her 24 hours a day. She sweated puddles. Her body was covered in a heat rash. </p> <p>Snell said she wasn\u2019t told why she was freed and ultimately deported. Kemal Kirisci, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, said he suspects that Snell\u2019s release could have been due to negotiations between the US and Turkish governments, or been part of a recent push to release some suspects caught up in the post-coup sweep. </p> <p>Despite this, Snell\u2019s ordeal is not yet over. Her husband, an Afghan national, flew to Istanbul soon after she was arrested in Turkey to help work with her lawyers and secure her release, and was himself detained by Turkish authorities on 22 August. He has alleged that Turkish authorities accused him of being involved in the coup, and are preventing him from leaving the country. </p> <p>For now, Snell is considering her options and said she is taking the time to recover at home in New York City. But ultimately, she\u2019s frustrated that her kidnapping and detention in Turkey have drawn more attention than any of the work she did in Syria. </p> <p>\u201cThe story of my kidnapping and arrest got exponentially more attention than my many stories about Assad and Russia\u2019s relentless airstrikes on Aleppo\u2019s civilians,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat makes Syria different from any other story? It\u2019s the most volatile situation for civilians on earth, and it\u2019s not supposed to be covered?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As a choreographer, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui has always been drawn to the big idea, taking abstract theories about culture, religion and evolution as the starting points for his work. Sometimes his creations flounder under the weight of their intellectual exposition. But in Fractus V, which is structured around the writings of Noam Chomsky, the ideas form a fluid medium in which the buoyant dance can play.</p> <p> It is a deliberately masculine work; all nine of its dancers and musicians are men. But it also embraces an exhilarating diversity of styles, and as so often with Cherkaoui\u2019s work, it delivers its most emotional charge at the point where those styles meet. In Fractus V, that point comes at the beginning and end of the work, where all the cast join together in a soaring polyphonic song. It\u2019s a marvellous braid of sound, fusing Middle Eastern influences to a wildly ecstatic pitch, and as a fierce expression of unity it resonates across the work, providing a rich context for the fragments of Chomsky text that are narrated throughout.</p> <p> Chomsky\u2019s thesis is that we live in a world where language and information are manipulated by governments to become tools of political control; where freedom of thought has to be preserved by collective resistance. And for Cherkaoui, this principle of collaboration is the choreography\u2019s driving force. He expresses it through images of marvellous ingenuity, slotting his dancers together into multi-limbed patterns and constellations, but also through a constant swapping between forms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4252ad4714ded68fc403354b9cc9458638ab47e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4252ad4714ded68fc403354b9cc9458638ab47e4/0_118_4785_2870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fractus V\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drawn to the big idea \u2026 Fractus V.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Cherkaoui himself performs a duet with the flamenco dancer Fabien Thom\u00e9 Duten, his soft fluid body steeled with witty swagger and strut. Elsewhere, the dance morphs into circusy backflips and breakdance spins, while the musicians provide their own brilliant fusion of oriental jazzy and percussive sound.</p> <p> There\u2019s also a dark underbelly of violence to this community, as the men descend into precision-choreographed gun battles and fights. But as with the best of Charkaoui\u2019s work, Fractus V is a thrillingly expansive watch, large with possibilities and potent with ideas.</p> <p>\u2022At Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, until 28 October.

We interviewed Dr Coutinho who felt that having periods is unnatural and spoke to artist Jenn Lewis, who strongly disagreed. A number of commenters were inclined to agree with Jenn, as they wrote in to tell us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first episode in this series was about appreciating the natural beauty of the vulva. Having a period is natural, too.</p> <p>\u2013 Camille (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/videos/1490883294272066/?comment_id=1491069710920091&amp;reply_comment_id=1493522497341479&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\">on Facebook</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p>Mae and I explain in the video that we have a hormonal IUD which stops our periods. Viewers also had some valuable thoughts about this method of contraception:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wanted to point out that there are IUDs that aren\u2019t hormonal and don\u2019t affect the period. I have used a copper IUD (commercial name Paragard) for years and years, I love it because it very effectively and conveniently does the job of birth control and does not change my hormonal balance in the process. Your show gives the impression that IUDs are beneficial because they affect your hormones and stop your periods, first and foremost. Because some women don\u2019t want to tamper with their hormones, you may be discouraging them from IUD use. </p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s true.

Within a day or two, increases in progesterone seem to suppress sex drive (estrogen has the opposite effect) so women are typically horniest between days 13 and 15 of their menstrual cycle. Those days just so happen to also be the window when women are ovulating and at their most fertile.

  "<p>When I first told the council I was homeless I was 16. It was cold, dark and I was alone. I didn\u2019t have any belongings, but I had been staying at friends\u2019 houses so I was clean and hadn\u2019t been sleeping rough. I was forced to declare myself homeless when a brick was thrown through a friend\u2019s window by a family member, and their safety was compromised. I waited to see the housing officer in my busy London borough, but when he arrived I was quickly dismissed on the grounds that I didn\u2019t \u201clook homeless\u201d. What did I need to do to look homeless enough? I asked him. Did I need to be attacked? Raped? He looked at me, in his own helpless way, and shrugged.</p> <p>That was 10 years ago. Today, Bob Blackman\u2019s <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/homelessnessreduction.html\" title=\"\">homelessness reduction bill</a> will have its second reading in parliament. The main features of the bill are to remove the \u201cpriority need\u201d category, and the requirement of being physically homeless before you are housed. Councils will have a duty to help those at risk of homelessness 56 days in advance, and to provide them with support for a further 56 days to secure accommodation. The government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-support-new-legislation-to-reduce-homelessness\" title=\"\">has announced its support</a> for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/immoral-housing-policy-punish-poor-councils-poverty-people-losing-homes\">Our immoral housing policy is set up to punish the poor | Matt Wilde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And something certainly needs to be done. <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/homeless-def-numbers.html\" title=\"\">Homelessness has doubled</a> since 2010 and seems be on course to rise further. And the proposals in the bill sound like good ideas in principle. The priority need list puts those who fit a certain criterion (those with children, mental health problems or other vulnerabilities and those under the age of 18) in a position to be housed quicker. However, <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/publications/MysteryShopping_Report_FINAL_web.pdf\" title=\"\">in practice</a>, this often turns into an easy excuse to turn people away without letting them speak to an officer, which they are entitled to, amid high housing pressures.</p> <p>The other requirement to be axed, being physically homeless, cuts short the prospect of a preventative system. So those who see the possibility of having nowhere to live looming are told to come back when they are actually homeless and the situation might be harder to remedy. On a very basic level, the process requires homeless people to demonstrate they are homeless while obscuring this fact by asking them a set of unrelated questions. As a woman in BBC2\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/19/council-house-wait-50-years-barking-and-dagenham-councillor-documentary-london-no-place-to-call-home\" title=\"\">documentary on the housing crisis</a> in Barking and Dagenham put it: \u201c[It] is crazy.

It is said to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/welsh-law-early-support-prevents-homelessness-crisis\" title=\"\">led the culture change</a> away from box-ticking to actually helping people in flexible and creative ways. There are, however, concerns about the ability to implement the policy in areas like London where there are huge housing pressures. The problem there is that there isn\u2019t the place to put people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/cambridge-benefits-cut-welfare-under-25s-education\">I worked hard to get into Cambridge. But I needed benefits too | Poppy Noor</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/cambridge-benefits-cut-welfare-under-25s-education\" title=\"\">I went through the system</a> at a much more forgiving time, and fit both criteria: physically homeless because I was on the street with nowhere to go, and a priority need as a young woman fleeing domestic violence. Still it took three months for the council to accept I was entitled to housing. I spent three years in \u201ctemporary accommodation\u201d \u2013 never intended as a long-term solution by its very definition. Eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/university-immigrant-effect-education\" title=\"\">I went to university</a> and I was taken off the housing list. That means that now, 10 years later, I have been pushed into private renting and still battle homelessness one pay cheque at a time. The issue was then, as it is now, not that housing officers didn\u2019t want to help: they just had nowhere to put me.</p> <p>The officials in Barking and Dagenham\u2019s documentary spell out the problem very clearly. Policies like the right-to-buy scheme have depleted council housing stock, while successive governments have not been committed to replenishing it. This is combined with soaring rents and house prices that people can no longer afford; insecure wages and a tattered welfare system that means people turn up to the council with nowhere to go. This is not the story of unwilling bureaucrats, but of the concept of housing as a commodity rather than a right. Mandating staff to house people when they have nowhere to put them cannot change this issue. Priority or no priority, the question remains: where will the people go?</p>",

Picking spinners for the sake of it doesn\u2019t cut it on the subcontinent. Here, off the top of my head, are the bowlers who have won Tests in India in the last twenty five years:<br></p> <ul> <li>2012: Swann and Monty.</li> <li>2006: Anderson and Flintoff, with Udal the exception that proves the rule.</li> <li>2004: McGrath, Gillespie, Kasprowicz and a bit of Warne.</li> <li>2000: Donald and Pollock.</li> <li>1999: Wasim, Waqar, Saqlain, Shoaib.</li> <li>1998: Kasprowicz and Warne.</li> <li>1994: Walsh and Kenny Benjamin.<br></li> </ul> <p>\u201cEvery single one of them was world class, and several were all-time greats. On that evidence, Batty and Ansari, being defensive bowlers primarily, won\u2019t be of much use. England\u2019s strategy, while they wait for Anderson to get fit, should be to pick Broad and Finn for the new ball, and prepare Stokes to bowl a lot of reverse swing. Root\u2019s offspin might do a holding job, and Rashid and Moin should be asked to attack and try to bowl magic balls. For specific batsmen, there could be specific tactics, like Nasser / Giles had for Tendulkar in 2002.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5813097ce4b01c528432d8a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T08:18:51.913Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>51st over: Bangladesh 196-4 (Shakib 2, Mushfiqur 0) </strong>Bangladesh were going so well, but while England haven\u2019t bowled terribly, at least two - perhaps all three - of the wickets to have fallen in the last hour have been more or less donated.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5813085ee4b01c528432d8a1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T08:16:45.015Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

And if you\u2019re on a standard variable rate (SVR), you should be able to save money by switching deals.\u201d</p> <p>Many lenders\u2019 SVRs are around the 4.5% mark, says Peter Gettins, product manager at broker London &amp; Country Mortgages, while two-year fixed rates can be as low as 0.99% (with arrangement fees of around \u00a31,499). \u201cEven fee-free loans are at 1.60%, so it\u2019s entirely feasible that you could quickly cut your rate by 3%,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>For example, on a \u00a3150,000 mortgage, with 20 years of the term remaining, a 4.5% loan means a monthly repayment of \u00a3949. Remortgage to a 1.69% deal with no fees to pay, and that drops to \u00a3737 a month. That\u2019s a saving of \u00a3212 a month, and \u00a35,088 in two years. </p> <p>\u201cTen-year fixed deals are also cheap, with the lowest under 2.5%,\u201d says Boulger. \u201cAnd seven-year deals start with 1.99% (Coventry building society), which after three years charges an early redemption fee of only 1%, if you decide to move home or remortgage.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Where to start: </strong>Check the rates available on <a href=\"http://moneyfacts.co.uk/compare/mortgages/\">best-buy tables</a> and comparison sites, and put your details into <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-rate-calculator\">mortgage calculators</a>  to see how much better off you could be.</p>",

Kitto showed promise once more, and all of the Adelaide youngsters who came in offered hope for the future, but you very much wonder what a Cirio or Henrique might have brought to that last ten minutes.</p> <p>Van \u2018t Schip will take that, you\u2019d hazard, after City\u2019s FFA Cup heroics midweek.

  "<p>Things were already pretty bad for the Russian blogger Ruslan Sokolovsky, who could face <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/05/pokemon-go-russian-youtuber-ruslan-sokolovsky-five-years-jail-church\">up to five years in jail</a> for playing Pok\u00e9mon Go in a church. But on Friday they got even worse when a court in his home city of Yekaterinburg jailed him before his trial. His offence this time? Breaking the rules of his house arrest by speaking to his girlfriend.</p> <p>Sokolovsky filmed himself playing Pok\u00e9mon Go in Yekaterinburg\u2019s Church of All Saints in August and posted the video to YouTube. He said he had been inspired by watching a television news segment warning people they could be fined or imprisoned if they played the game in churches. </p> <p>At the beginning of the video, before entering the church, Sokolovsky says to the camera: \u201cFor me this is total nonsense. Who on earth would be offended that you walked around a church with your smartphone? How on earth would they lock you up for that?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfMn1yahGYk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PfMn1yahGYk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Sokolovsky playing Pok\u00e9mon Go in the Church of All Saints</figcaption> </figure>   <p>His confidence turned out to be misplaced. He was arrested in early September and charged with inciting hatred and offending religious sensibilities. If convicted he could face up to five years in prison.</p> <p>A judge ruled Sokolovsky should be held under house arrest while awaiting trial, and he was forbidden from using the internet or speaking to witnesses in the case. But on his birthday he apparently received a visit from his girlfriend.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even really speak to her. She said happy birthday, and I asked her to leave. And then a policeman showed up,\u201d Sokolovsky told the court on Friday, local news agencies reported.</p> <p>Sokolovsky had previously criticised the Russian Orthodox church in his video blog, and his case recalls that of the punk collective Pussy Riot, who spent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\">two years in prison </a>for performing a \u201cpunk prayer\u201d in Moscow\u2019s biggest cathedral. The charges against Sokolovsky relate not only to the Pok\u00e9mon video but also to others he has produced. A date for the trial has not yet been set.</p> <p>Pok\u00e9mon Go has not been officially released in Russia, and while thousands of young Russians are obsessed with the game, some officials and commentators have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/why-is-russia-so-distrustful-of-pokemon-go\">highly sceptical</a>, suggesting it might be a front for either the CIA or Satan.</p> <p>A Russian senator, Frants Klintsevich, said in July: \u201cI have the feeling that the devil himself has come through this mechanism and is trying to destroy us spiritually from within. But I understand it\u2019s difficult to control this sphere. It seems this is the work of people outside the country who understand that in a year or two, the consequences will be irreversible.\u201d</p>",

Davian ventures on a quest to learn the truth of his powers and defeat an invading army.

  "<p>Construction projects can often be besieged by problems.

Clients are increasingly wanting to speed up their time to market, and designs and systems are growing in complexity, with buildings being assembled in new ways,\u201d says Sue Klawans, a senior vice president and director of operational excellence and planning at <a href=\"http://www.gilbaneco.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gilbane Building Company</a>, a Rhode Island construction management firm, which tested Microsoft\u2019s augmented reality (AR) headset HoloLens a few months ago. \u201cWe knew we needed to continue offering our team members the tools and technology to support the evolution of how we build.\u201d</p> <p>The market for digital AR tools is growing. Earlier this year, Californian startup <a href=\"https://daqri.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daqri</a> launched a smart helmet similar to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">HoloLens</a> and designed specifically for industrial settings. Meanwhile, apps like <a href=\"http://smartreality.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SmartReality</a> from JBKnowledge, allow users to hold a smartphone or tablet over designs or plan files and see 2D drawings projected as 3D models.</p> <p>AR is making it easier not only for planners and architects to collaborate with contractors, but to reassure clients and address any concerns they may have. Klawans says its immersive nature means they can \u201cinteract with their building and give feedback on the design before ground has been broken\u201d.</p> <p>The technology\u2019s capacity to deliver cost savings and reduce the chances of a build falling behind schedule can also lead to less cautious investors.</p> <p>\u201cUsing AR to showcase a building or piece of infrastructure to potential investors in its proposed real-world location will help them understand how that asset will connect with its surroundings,\u201d says Dominic Thasarathar, construction industry strategist at <a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Autodesk</a>, the software company that provides the building visualisation data for Gilbane\u2019s system to work. \u201cSuch as what the view from the 30th floor of an apartment block might be like. This will make it a more attractive prospect.\u201d</p> <p>There are signs that, beyond bringing flat blueprints and designs to life in front of clients, reducing on-site problems and easing investor worries, AR could provide an end-to-end service. Software is being developed that enables companies to show clients what the inside of a build will look like when furnished a certain way or the finishing touches have been applied to the outside. Of course, virtual reality allows this to be done before a project has been completed and sometimes in more detail, but viewing it outside its context and environment has its limitations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-the-new-creative-mind\">What does artificial intelligence mean for the creative mind?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe beauty of AR is, if you go to a property that\u2019s just been built and you\u2019re not sure how your car will fit, you can stand outside the property and, with your car loaded into the software, position it on the driveway,\u201d says James Barry, head of visualisation at <a href=\"http://www.areasq.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Area Sq</a>, a London-based office interior design firm passionate about the benefits the technology can have. </p> <p>Area Sq is yet to use AR commercially \u2013 it has already integrated VR into its services \u2013 but is considering adopting it soon. Barry says that he expects the ability for clients to picture fittings and materials in place will be powerful. He adds that AR will not only be effective at bringing clients on board from an early stage, but at being a pipeline tool.</p> <p>It makes sense. The technology is already being used to market and sell products to homeowners and shoppers. Apps such as <a href=\"https://www.dulux.co.uk/en/articles/the-dulux-visualizer-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dulux Visualiser</a> enables users to hold phones up to a wall and picture how they would be painted a certain colour. And Ikea allows them to scan images from its catalogue and picture them in their house before they decide to buy. </p> <p>Maximilian Doelle, the chief prototyper at <a href=\"https://www.kazendi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kazendi</a>, the first UK developer for HoloLens, built the HoloLiving app, which allows users to virtually furnish a room, for its client Selligent. He says that the furniture industry, along with the construction sector, will benefit hugely from placing images and virtual objects in the real world. The caveat though is that 3D graphic designers may add things that, while they look good virtually, can\u2019t be replicated in the exact same way. \u201cThere could end up being a discrepancy for customers, between what they expect to see and what\u2019s actually there,\u201d Doelle adds.</p> <p>A true marker of AR\u2019s ability to innovate and provide an end-to-end service may well be whether it will then be used to sell a piece of real estate. Could the future showroom see prospective buyers wearing a headset or walking round viewing it through a smartphone? Not as things stand, says Doelle, but as visuals become more photorealistic and software more sophisticated, the possibility of it being used to sell homes won\u2019t be far off.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>In the 1980s, I lived in some pretty shady places. After finishing at Sunderland Polytechnic I moved back to London and lived above a pawnbroker on Willesden High Road with my best friend and now business partner Richard. I got a job at <a href=\"http://www.joeallen.co.uk\">Joe Allen</a>\u2019s as a waiter and bartender, kind of by accident, and I started to get interested in food. I became really good at one-pot specials and classic dishes, with simple market ingredients \u2013 a good stew, tagliatelle al ragu, carbonara, risotto \u2026</p> <p>Living above a pawnbroker\u2019s, there was a stream of interesting characters milling around the entrance to our flat. A lot of petty criminals used to think our place was connected to the shop, so we\u2019d get broken into about once a week. They\u2019d quickly realise though that there was nothing to steal.</p> <p>It was a three-bedroom flat set over two levels, with pretty nasty decor \u2013 heavy curtains and old furniture; it may have had patterned wallpaper. It definitely had a psychedelic paisley patterned carpet. What made it our own was the music we were listening to, and the posters. We were still kids \u2013 I was 22. Although, I still listen to the same things: The Smiths, Echo and The Bunnymen, Orange Juice and Stone Roses. Lots of Stone Roses, Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, Van Morrison, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. It was the era of VHS, and we had a video rental shop opposite us.

My wife would probably concur \u2026</p> <p>It was a good time. We\u2019d eat in once or twice a week. There was a great music venue, the Mean Fiddler, a couple of miles away; we\u2019d go and see bands there. It felt like a home. And it\u2019s where it all started. Richard and our other flatmate, Graham, started their own ad-sales business in our living room, with our old dial phone. I thought I was just doing something to tide me over, but now I run a business and operate 10 restaurants \u2013 so I\u2019d started my career too.

I consulted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/oct/18/elizabeth-david-60-years\">Elizabeth David</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anna-del-conte\">Anna del Conte</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=The+Silver+Spoon&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\">The Silver Spoon</a>. I decided, after trying various recipes, that cream was not necessary, egg yolks were better than whole eggs, and a combination of parmesan and pecorino gave the dish a lovely balance. The recipe below is the result of those experiments. It is important not to cook the yolks, so they must be added while the pan is off the heat, otherwise you end up with a scrambled egg appearance. The addition of the pasta cooking water takes a bit of practice \u2013 you want to loosen the sauce and make it yellow and glossy, not thin and watery.</p> <p>I love cooking at home. I spend all my working hours managing my restaurants, but cooking for my family is relaxing. My children are unfussy and adventurous \u2013 they\u2019ll eat anything I make for them. Lately they\u2019ve started getting into spice and chilli, and Mabel, my youngest, is a huge Japanese fan \u2013 udon, sashimi, sushi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca3834c385e107c3e67665d75d48acb0b324e2a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3834c385e107c3e67665d75d48acb0b324e2a0/0_0_2000_1331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spaghetti carbonara is Russell Norman\u2019s Taste of Home \u2013 the dish he keeps coming back to.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Norman: \u2018Spaghetti carbonara is one of the dishes I used to make a lot when I was teaching myself classic Italian dishes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Spaghetti carbonara</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>400g dried spaghetti<br>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br>150g pancetta, cut into thick, short matchsticks<br>Black pepper<br>4 large egg yolks, beaten<br>100g parmesan, grated<br>20g pecorino, grated<br>1 Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti according to the packet\u2019s instructions.</p> <p>2 Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan and saute the pancetta until it is starting to crisp and is turning golden brown.</p> <p>3 Just before the spaghetti is done, scoop out a cupful of the cooking water and set aside.

Then in June, a companion bill was introduced in the House, but there has been no movement in Congress since.</p> \n<p>His first adoptive parents, a strict couple, relinquished custody to the state of Oregon\u2019s foster care system in 1985, when he was around 10 years old, after deciding they didn\u2019t want him any more. After bouncing around foster homes, he was adopted into the Crapser family. Those parents were eventually arrested in 1991, charged with 34 counts of rape, sexual abuse and criminal mistreatment, including extreme physical assault. They were eventually found guilty of 12 of those charges. Adam Crapser was 17 at the time.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t understand that I didn\u2019t ask to come here [US],\u201d he said about his adoption. \u201cI got placed with some idiots but I went on to live my life the best I could.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Most people don\u2019t understand that I didn\u2019t ask to come here.

  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s letter resides in a box now, a consequence of three house moves across Europe, but Steven Defour has not forgotten the message that arrived from Manchester United when his career was in peril, nor has he had the opportunity to thank the sender in person.

It was simply a release to leave Anderlecht after two years of torment following his return to Belgium from Porto, though it is only from a distance that Defour realises how profound the impact was. Disillusionment had set in before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/steven-defour-burnley-sean-dyche-record-signing\" title=\"\">Burnley\u2019s manager convinced him to join</a> a newly promoted Premier League club instead of taking the riches on offer at Al-Jazira in the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>\u201cIn the summer I thought this was probably my last chance to move to the Premier League so when the opportunity came I had to take it. I also thought a third year in the Belgium league might not be good for me,\u201d he says, with some understatement.</p> <p>\u201cI was two years at Anderlecht and really disappointed in football <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/26/standard-liege-fans-stadium-ban-defour-banner\" title=\"\">because I was criticised a lot by part of the supporters</a>. Also the Belgian media said two years at Anderlecht and no championship trophy with Defour as the biggest transfer \u2026 I was an international when I arrived but wasn\u2019t any more. It weighed heavily on me. The UAE offer came and I was starting to think that if I go there, we must be honest, it is for fun and for money. It could be easier. There were some problems with the transfer and then Burnley came in. The manager came and convinced me.</p> <p>\u201cHe came to Belgium and it was a new challenge for me to play for a club that was not competing for a title. I wanted to show myself in the Premier League and Burnley made it clear they wanted me really bad so I took a chance. I wasn\u2019t having fun in the game any more. That is why I wanted to get far, far away from Belgium and when Burnley came I thought: \u2018If this works out really well maybe I can finish what I was after in the beginning.\u2019 It\u2019s enough to play. The circle is complete. For the moment it is going pretty well.\u201d</p> <p>Anderlecht\u2019s hardcore never accepted Defour on account of his Standard Li\u00e8ge background. Li\u00e8ge\u2019s \u2018Ultras Inferno 96\u2019 greeted their revered former captain with a notorious banner that featured his severed head and the words \u201cRed or Dead\u201d on his return to Stade Maurice Dufrasne in January 2015. His dismissal in that 2-0 defeat, receiving a second yellow card for kicking the ball away into the crowd, prompted Anderlecht fans to hurl seats on to the pitch and condemnation from Belgian politicians and FA officials.</p> <p>\u201cAt that moment I didn\u2019t think much of the banner because I was in the game,\u201d the midfielder insists. \u201cBut the atmosphere was really violent [the Anderlecht goalkeeper Silvio Proto was pelted with objects after seven minutes]. They were dropping [smoke] bombs. It was dangerous. I knew the game couldn\u2019t be controlled and I spoke to the referee. Everybody said I got sent off because I was angry with the picture. I wasn\u2019t. I saw the picture and then I was in the game. It was just certain decisions of the referee. He didn\u2019t have the match under control.

Another league and Super Cup double followed 12 months later when United were among several heavyweights tracking the young midfielder. One of the most gifted talents at the start of a new era for Belgian football, however, was also one of the most unfortunate. A week before his Champions League debut Defour shattered a metatarsal in his right foot against KV Mechelen, his hometown club. Three operations followed and while they would have major repercussions for Defour\u2019s career, he is grateful to have one.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an open fracture and you could see the bone. There was no bone after they dealt with it. There was a two\u2011centimetre hole where the bone should be. To fill it in they took a bone graft from my hip and mixed it with cement. It was the last phase of the experiment with me. The doctors had tried it on people with really bad fractures from accidents and the doctor said: \u2018If this doesn\u2019t work, you have to stop playing.\u2019 If it didn\u2019t work they said the bone would keep breaking from the impact of playing football.</p> <p>\u201cI was really down because of missing out on the Champions League and I knew that a lot of clubs were following me. I felt really, really bad. One day I received a letter from Sir Alex Ferguson wishing me well. That was a surprise because not everybody gets a letter from Sir Alex Ferguson when they are injured but I knew from a year before that Manchester United were following me closely. It was still a surprise to receive the letter and I wrote one back to him to say thank you, but I\u2019ve not met him to say it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/15/sir-alex-ferguson-steven-defour\">Sir Alex Ferguson left embarrassed by leak of letter to injured transfer target Steven Defour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I look back at that time now, I don\u2019t think I got back to the level I was before. When I left Standard Li\u00e8ge for Porto I wasn\u2019t ready physically because of the injury but I had to leave. I didn\u2019t play as much as I\u2019d hoped in Porto, maybe 50%-60% of the games. I wanted to play all the time and that is why I decided to go back to Belgium to get my level back up.\u201d</p> <p>Ferguson never followed up the get\u2011well letter with a contract offer \u2013 there was a chance to join Everton in 2009 but Standard would sanction the deal only if they failed to qualify for the Champions League \u2013 and team-mates Marouane Fellaini, Axel Witsel and Dante have enjoyed the career trajectory many envisaged for Defour. They remain friends \u2013 he has been in contact with Fellaini before Saturday\u2019s potential reunion \u2013 and there is no bitterness as he considers what might have been.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I look at the careers they have had I just think I got injured at a bad moment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt stopped my evolution and to get back was hard. The injury healed but I was still in pain. My big toe on my right foot is smaller than the one on my left and after the injury the physiology of my body changed. I started to run differently, I stopped using muscles I used and working muscles I had not used before, so I got several pulls and ruptures.</p> <p>\u201cI had to find a new way of running and of playing football. I was finding that in duels or in games, where I used to be 100% I was now two seconds late. That made me crazy inside. Maybe if I didn\u2019t have the injury I would have been where they are but you never know. That is the past. Now I am here and trying to get my level back.\u201d</p> <p>Defour has Ferguson to thank for a thoughtful letter but he is indebted to Dyche for a belated ticket to English football and reawakening his passion for the game. Even Turf Moor is part of the attraction. \u201cIt is really old-fashioned, English style, I love it. The manager said I had everything to win, that you are going to play in the Premier League and everybody is going to watch you. He was really ambitious and convinced we can do something with this team. He is straightforward, honest and he wants us to be a team. It is the first time I am playing for a team that is really that \u2013 a team. There is no little group. Before I had a Spanish side or a Portuguese side or an English side, different ethnic groups.

  "<p>With the situation in Syria desperate and with so much riding on the relief effort to compensate for the lack of a political settlement, the pressure on aid agencies, particularly the UN, is immense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/un-hires-assads-friends-and-relatives-for-syria-relief-operation\">UN hires Assad's friends and relatives for Syria relief operation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the bravery of workers on the frontline is not in doubt, there have been bitter arguments about a number of fundamental issues, raising the prospect that the situation is worse than it seems. Here are some of the key questions.</p> <h2><strong>How many people need aid?</strong></h2> <p>There is an enormous discrepancy in numbers, particularly the figures relating to \u201cbesieged\u201d areas.<br></p> <p>For instance, the UN began referring to rebel-held eastern Aleppo as besieged in the past few weeks \u2013 three months after the area last received a significant supply of humanitarian aid.<br></p> <p>As with other aid organisations, the UN uses a formula to identify places under siege. It asks three questions:</p> <ul> <li>Is the area surrounded by armed actors?</li> <li>Can humanitarian assistance regularly enter?</li> <li>Can civilians, the sick and wounded enter and exit?</li> </ul> <p>Applying this criteria, the UN estimates that 586,200 people were living in 17 besieged areas in Syria in September. It believes that a total of 4.88 million were living in \u201chard to reach\u201d locations.</p> <p>But these numbers are disputed by other organisations, which use similar formulas and get much higher numbers.</p> <p>Advocacy group <a href=\"http://siegewatch.org/#7/35.111/38.540\">Siege Watch estimates</a> that 996,975 people are living in 39 besieged areas, not including 275,000 under siege in Aleppo.<br></p> <p>The group says the extra 21 areas are surrounded by government forces. It believes that another 1.4 million people are at risk of siege.</p> <p>Those figures are supported by another well-established international NGO working in Syria, which spoke to the Guardian but does not want to be named.<br></p> <p>According to this organisation, there are between 1.2 million and 1.3 million people under siege, which increases to 1.5 million if Aleppo is included.<br></p> <p>Separately, <a href=\"http://activityreport2015.msf.org/country/syria/\">M\u00e9decins San Fronti\u00e8res estimates</a> that 1.5 million are living in besieged areas.</p> <p>A source told the Guardian that UN hubs outside Damascus had privately agreed with the higher counts, but felt unable to challenge the official UN figures, which are set by the organisation in the Syrian capital.</p> <p>The UN said: \u201c[We] are aware that different aid groups use different definitions and have access to different data sources. Differences of opinion do occur.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"875f7e6ed82fbb79751ed9b3fd98b88e55d40d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/875f7e6ed82fbb79751ed9b3fd98b88e55d40d9c/0_23_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Syrian Arab Red Crescent aid convoy arrives in Ghouta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Syrian Arab Red Crescent aid convoy arrives in Ghouta.

All were accepted, but only six convoys made it to their destinations.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This is not untypical; most months, an initial \u201cnote verbale\u201d (third-person note) grants permission for almost all the requested locations, but this is then denied further down the line.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The initial approval, therefore, does not reflect how much aid is delivered: usually about 20-33% of locations are reached.</p> <p>But when the UN gives monthly updates to the security council, it routinely leads with figures relating to convoy approvals.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In July, for instance, the UN said of the \u201c35 locations, 34 have been approved for access, representing approximately 75% of total beneficiaries targeted\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Later, the organisation concedes that only nine locations were reached.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3130bdc0eb36e7c4bb5e81c0e4921e6b1c56709\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3130bdc0eb36e7c4bb5e81c0e4921e6b1c56709/0_176_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A UN flag lies next to a destroyed aid convoy outside Aleppo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A UN flag lies next to a destroyed aid convoy outside Aleppo.

This travelled from Damascus through 23 checkpoints and across frontlines to reach an area 22 miles (35km) from the Turkish border.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Similarly, UN documents seen by the Guardian said the UN favoured cross-line aid deliveries from government-held western Aleppo to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, because this was the \u201cpreference of the government of Syria\u201d.</p> <p>The Syrian regime also makes requests of the UN. In May, the president, Bashar al-Assad, asked for deliveries to Palmyra, al-Qaryatayn, Bloudan and Houla. </p> <p>In August, Syrian authorities asked the UN to deliver assistance to 41 locations outside the proposed plans. None of them were thought to be in greatest need or under siege.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a355bd12385d014907dfbae0e1079221b7f855\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a355bd12385d014907dfbae0e1079221b7f855/0_389_2734_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aid convoy prepares to depart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aid convoy prepares to depart for Madaya and Zabadani.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) withdrew its participation in a convoy to Moadamiya on 19 September after only 10% of proposed supplies were allowed through. The Syrian government also removed 11.5 tonnes from World Health Organisation (WHO) medical supplies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/oct/30/syrian-families-moadamiyah\">Syrian families flee besieged Moadamiyah \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Items of food in the Moadamiya convoy were destroyed by Syrian soldiers at a checkpoint on the way into the area and rejected. A subsequent convoy reached the area with new supplies.<br></p> <p>Convoys to Madaya and Zabadani in September had half their medical supplies, 1.5 tonnes, removed.<br></p> <p>As a result, 64% of WHO health supplies in Syria have gone to government-held areas since January.<br></p> <p>This number is backed up by UN reporting, which suggests that as many as 3 million of the 4.3 million people reached with aid supplies in Syria each month are in government areas.<br></p> <p>Due to the lack of medical supplies in besieged areas, it is often necessary to move patients across conflict lines.<br></p> <p>But permission is routinely delayed or denied. Patients and family members have to be cleared by Syrian security services before being given permission.<br></p> <p>Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, said medical evacuations from eastern Aleppo during the recent pause were scuppered by both parties, including rebels.</p> <p>\u201cObjections by two non-state armed opposition groups, namely Ahrar al-Sham and Nour al-din al-Zenki, scuppered these plans,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe United Nations made every effort to get assurances from all parties, only for the parties to then fail to agree on each other\u2019s conditions about how evacuations should proceed.

It\u2019s not true that they can say they have reached that amount of people when they go with their trucks ... and drop them there hoping they are going to somehow be delivered to the target individuals in the besieged areas,\u201d they said.<br></p> <p>One former UN employee in Damascus said field visits were nearly impossible and oversight of the projects funded by the UN was minimal as a result.<br></p> <p>A senior humanitarian worker in Syria said there was a particular problem with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which has been criticised for its apparent closeness to the Syrian government.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you keep saying SARC is not politically biased and you\u2019re reaching the majority of those in besieged areas, that is a lie,\u201d they said. Cross-border aid partners said there needs to be more rigorous assessments on the ground.</p> <p>Fadi Al-Dairi, the founder of Hand in Hand for Syria, said: \u201cWhen we deliver aid in the opposition areas, we do a \u2018needs assessment\u2019. We send in someone to check on the needs and then again to ensure the people received the aid. We are not seeing the same from the aid being distributed from the GoS [government] side.\u201d </p> <p>Advocacy group Siege Watch recently recommended that the UN monitor its aid programmes using independent third parties to ensure that supplies are being received by those most in need. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30d99937538e72ec8c8dbf107f91f487014ae83c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30d99937538e72ec8c8dbf107f91f487014ae83c/30_158_5314_3188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The aftermath of an airstrike on a hospital in Aleppo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aftermath of an airstrike on a hospital in Aleppo.

According to the NGO Physicians for Human Rights, at least 705 medical workers had been killed in Syria by March. This included 346 deliberate or indiscriminate attacks on 246 medical facilities.</p> <p>MSF said 23 Syrian health staff they were supporting were killed and 58 wounded in 2015. Sixty-three hospitals and clinics backed by MSF were bombed or shelled on 94 separate occasions in 2015, 12 of which were completely destroyed.</p> <p>The Syrian government and its allies have been responsible for more than 90% of recorded hospital attacks and more than 95% of medical personnel killings.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>That number has increased exponentially in recent months, according to UN reports; in July, 44 hospitals or health facilities were targeted or attacked. There were 55 attacks against medical facilities in August.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>SARC has had 53 staff and volunteers killed during the conflict. </p> <p>One NGO working in Syria told the Guardian about 40 of its aid trucks have been hit by airstrikes in Syria.

But this is a new strategy.</p> <p>Until now, the UN has not been in the habit of apportioning blame for violations, saying it has to work with all sides in the conflict to remain impartial.</p> <p>One senior UN official told the Guardian: \u201cSometimes we feel that the ire of many understandably outraged people is directed at the UN instead of those parties that are inhibiting the access, or sponsoring or committing the atrocities against civilians.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe really want it to be clear that working with the system to try to reach locations from within Syria is unbelievably challenging.

Whether it\u2019s telling bankers they\u2019re right, and nothing will change, or telling the public they\u2019re right, and a revolution is at hand, the party is not just picking sides, but creating them.

The fact that the party is shot through with its own destructive ideological divisions only makes matters worse.</p> <p>The real risk is that Labour is seen as a party of middle-class messiahs, who see the country as divided between their disciples and the rest. The \u201crest\u201d being, by definition stupid, greedy, racist, immoral and always and for ever wrong. According to much post-Brexit analysis, many of those who don\u2019t agree with Corbyn\u2019s Labour chapter and verse are those living in the much-touted \u201cheartlands\u201d, which are currently reported to be turning hard to the right.</p> <p>So things don\u2019t look good for the left, or British society as a whole.

I doubt it. There\u2019s far too much to gain from the divide-and-conquer strategy currently in play, and far too much to lose from not getting in on it.</p> <p>Politicians are not famous for long-termism, but they ignore these warnings at their peril. British society is sick; it has been for a long time. The Brexit vote and the discourse that followed have made the symptoms acute.

Bryan was very funny and charming.</p> <p><strong>Joe</strong>: I\u2019m an enormous fan, and have been for years. I travelled down from Newcastle specially, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He was so passionate about acting that at times it felt as though I was at a motivational speech!</p> <p><strong>Vivienne</strong>: What really impressed me was how much he made everyone feel included. He stood up from his chair and almost acted the anecdotes as he told them. It was a a packed theatre and this drew everyone in. </p> <p><strong>Sarah</strong>: It was amazing! I am considering retraining as an actor and this was incredibly interesting and useful.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>He gave a lot of advice to aspiring artists\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c2a96e5cc6e2d5a91d85eca0907b971f20397cc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2a96e5cc6e2d5a91d85eca0907b971f20397cc0/381_535_116_145/116.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Allen\" width=\"116\" height=\"145\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Allen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Allen/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>JA</strong>: I wasn\u2019t expecting him to give advice, but it was fantastic to hear what he had to say. </p> <p><strong>PJ</strong>: The story of how he got to where he is now is applicable to lots of industries. He spoke about not having an end goal but just focusing on the present. This is something that is even relevant for me in the legal profession.</p> <p><strong>VW</strong>: It was fascinating to hear about how his father\u2019s drinking and violence fuelled his determination not just to be an actor but a star. Bryan said his greatest achievement was that he was a working actor at 25, and felt he had achieved his dream by focusing more on the here and now.</p> <p><strong>SK</strong>: It was interesting to hear him discuss the glitz and glam that lots of people perceive to be a part of the industry, and to emphasise that it\u2019s not a good reason to consider a career in acting. This kind of event gives you a real insight into life in the film industry, straight from the horse\u2019s mouth.</p> <h2>\u2018Breaking Bad was only part of his story\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f9ba54c3553b4a751e940e0ba0e4a4e697191180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9ba54c3553b4a751e940e0ba0e4a4e697191180/538_0_716_895/400.jpg\" alt=\"Vivienne Windle\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivienne Windle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>VW</strong>: The venue was packed, and there were lots of Breaking Bad fans in attendance. But he managed to cater to them without making it the focus of the whole evening. I loved his anecdote about how he used to adopt an English accent for auditions, and would love to have asked him more about his parents and how they influenced his career, mainly because my parents were in theatre, too.</p> <p><strong>JA</strong>: I first came across him via Breaking Bad, but I wasn\u2019t expecting how much more there was to him as an actor. He was very vocal about the frame of mind he got into for certain scenes. I would liked to have asked him specifics about certain scenes in Breaking Bad and how he prepared for them.</p> <p><strong>PJ</strong>: I\u2019d love to see him in some historical dramas. He is an incredible character actor. I was interested to know if there was anyone from history he\u2019d like to play, or any untold stories he\u2019d like to tell. He spoke a lot about his characters and I bet there are some interesting people he could depict.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f83bdbe0f1b9cb98f106dbcac179522db4e7663\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f83bdbe0f1b9cb98f106dbcac179522db4e7663/480_36_822_1028/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Kemp\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Kemp</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <h2>\u2018He has got a lot of his bigger parts later in life\u2019</h2> <p><strong>SK</strong>: Cranston is 60 now and got a lot of his bigger parts later in life.

  "<p>Marianito sat in the clinic office looking downcast. He\u2019d been referred to me in the primary care clinic because of fights at school. Despite complaints from the school about aggression, to me, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, he presented as a soft spoken and quiet 12-year-old of Salvadorean parents. After telling me a little about his favorite video games, he told me that some of the kids at school \u201chave been messing with me\u201d because \u201cI\u2019m fat and I smell.\u201d <br></p> <p>Marianito was morbidly obese, and to make matters worse for a twelve-year-old, he had a condition called encoporesis, in which he would have bowel movements without warning at school, leading to bad smells and social humiliation. <br></p> <p>Aside from a regimen with his paediatrician to improve his bowel control, and psychotherapy, it seemed to me that increasing his exercise to address his mood, social isolation, and obesity, might benefit him. Marianito brightened a little when we discussed the idea of getting involved in a sport. He admitted that he was often bored at home, and would really like to get involved with football especially, or maybe play soccer. <br></p> <p>As I explored exercise possibilities with his mother, it became clear that the simple plan of more exercise in the fresh outdoors was a seeming impossibly idea. His mother worked two jobs, and was not often home when Marianito was awake. The pair lived in a large low-income housing development outside of Washington, D.C. There were no parks nearby save the small patches of grass off the walkways in the development. Plus, the mother did not want Marianito walking any distance on his own. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2016/jun/14/are-hispanics-less-likely-to-get-diagnosed-with-adhd-in-the-us\">Are Hispanics less likely to get diagnosed with ADHD in the US?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are bad people who live in our neighbourhood,\u201d she said. She relayed to me a story about her other son, who was now living with a girlfriend, who\u2019d gotten beaten up nearby when coming home.<br></p> <p>Paying for an extramural team was also not an option. How could they pay the fee to be on the team? How would he get to the practices? <br></p> <p>As I considered Marianito\u2019s predicament, I became interested in the issue of greenspace in communities, and the impact this can have on children and adolescents in urban environments. <br></p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(16)30172-1/pdf\">creative study in the July issue</a> of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry examined levels of aggression in 1,287 twins and triplets in Southern California born between the years of 1990 and 1995. The authors used satellite imagery to find an aggregate measure of vegetation called the Normalised Differential Vegetation Index (NVDI) surrounding the home. The study found that both in the short term (6-months to 1-year) and the long term (1 to 3 years), having greenspace within 1000 meters was associated with reduced aggressive behaviours in this group of 9 to 18 year olds. Even when authors controlled for things like socioeconomic factors, age, gender, race, self-rated neighbourhood quality, maternal depression, traffic density, and even ambient temperatures, the difference in aggressive behaviours remained. In the sample studied, boys, people with lower perceived neighbourhood quality, children born to mothers who smoked, and those with lower socioeconomic status were more likely to be aggressive. <br></p> <p>The authors estimated that the benefits of increased greenspace was equivalent to 2 to 2.5 years of behavioural maturation. The actual individual-level difference in aggressive behaviours was relatively small, but when looked at in the aggregate the difference from a public health perspective was impressive. <br></p> <p>What is it about greenspace that may result in reduced aggression? Does having a field or park nearby simply allow kids to get more physical activity? Is there something about the presence of trees and grass? Or, presuming adequate safety measures, does greenspace provide a place for children and adolescents to interact socially?<br></p> <p>Several recent studies have found that exercise reduces depression and anxiety in adolescents, factors which may be contributing to aggression. For example, <a href=\"http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(16)30170-8/pdf\">a meta-analysis in the same journal</a> reported that aerobic exercise at least three times per week for 7 weeks had moderate effects on depression in adolescents ages 13 to 18. <br></p> <p>Is it exercise alone that provides the benefit or the natural surroundings? BMC Public Health published another <a href=\"http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com.ezp.welch.jhmi.edu/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-10-456\">systematic review</a> which found that there seems to be a benefit to physical activity in a \u201cnatural environment\u201d over that of a \u201csynthetic environment\u201d like a gym. Potential factors suggested by other authors include decreased noise density and reduced air pollution with greater vegetation. Alternatively, there may be still unseen/undetectable factors that make the families who live near greenspace different from families who don\u2019t. <br></p> <p>Certainly for Marianito, having a park nearby would be no panacea. For example, there was a sense of hopelessness emanating from the mother-son pair \u2013 the feeling that problems were insurmountable \u2013 something to work on in therapy, and potentially, to help the mother get into her own treatment.</p> <p>Elections, Syria, and the health of presidential candidates \u2013 these are the current obsessions of America\u2019s divisive politics. But if adding greenspace in cities could result in less depression, less aggression, better health of urban youth \u2013 isn\u2019t this a policy many of us could get behind? Marianito, for one, would be grateful. </p>",
  "<p>As the Obama administration confirms that premiums for some health plans under the Affordable Care Act will increase by an average of 25% next year, families like the Marshes are just grateful to have health insurance.</p> <p>Jerry Marsh, 62, is covered by Medicare because of a disability, but his wife, Kerri, was uninsured until the Affordable Care Act \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare legislation, which has drastically reduced the number of uninsured in the US, stopped insurers denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, and allowed children to remain on their parents\u2019 policies until age 26, but has faced criticism for the cost of premiums and deductibles \u2013 went into effect. She is a homeschool teacher for their 11-year-old grandson, who has learning difficulties.</p> <p>Marsh, a health insurance navigator, said Kerri\u2019s current coverage would cost $18 more a month next year because of the premium increases. \u201cWe can live with that, that\u2019s a $20 bill; if people went out having beers or something, you\u2019d spend that real quick,\u201d Marsh said. </p> <p>The family\u2019s experience challenges the narrative pushed by Obamacare opponents this week after the Obama administration confirmed on Monday that marketplace health insurance premiums would increase, on average, 22% this year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/03/obamacare-marketplaces-exchanges-insurers-subscribers-competition\">Obamacare 'on the cusp of falling apart' as insurers flee health exchanges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s over for Obamacare,\u201d said Donald Trump at a rally in Tampa, Florida, on Monday. </p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee has made premium increases a central piece of his campaign this week. \u201cIt\u2019s killing our businesses. It\u2019s killing our small businesses.

And up to 2.5 million people may be eligible for a subsidy but don\u2019t know it, according to HHS.</p> <p>Rebecka Brayton, an insurance navigator for Wyoming Health Council, said her clients were not concerned about the premium increase, which is about 9% in her state, according to KFF. \u201cSo far, I have not had negative feedback on the increase; I am very sure that is because it\u2019s so small in our state and the offset of the tax credits,\u201d Brayton said in an email. </p> <p>She said that while the state has some of the most expensive insurance in the country, it receives money that helps reduce consumer costs. </p> <p>For instance, one man who lost his job came to her concerned about the price of his Cobra coverage, a health insurance option that lets people who have lost their jobs continue to use the same coverage that their employer offered. But Brayton ended up finding him a marketplace plan that cost less than half as much as the one he had while employed, with a lower deductible and prescription drug costs. </p> <p>But not everyone qualifies for financial assistance that can bring the premium rate down. \u201cA concern is that some of the people who are higher income, but are not high income, will be hit hardest by this increase,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, associate director at KFF. </p> <p>Shela Bryan, a 63-year-old maintenance supervisor in Georgia, makes just over the $47,520 limit to qualify for a subsidy. Bryan <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/15/news/economy/obamacare-premiums/\">told CNN Money</a> that the cheapest policies she could find amount to more than a quarter of her yearly income, or double her mortgage. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they think anyone can afford that,\u201d she said. </p> <p>That is why some people are choosing instead to pay the tax penalty handed down to people who choose to be uninsured. </p> <p>For the first year that people were required to have coverage, 8.1m tax returns included penalties for not having coverage in 2014, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/us/obamacare-affordable-care-act-tax-penalties.html\">according to the New York Times</a>. A preliminary report for 2015 said that 5.6m returns included penalties. </p> <p>At the same time, people like Kerri Marsh who use the marketplaces are getting health insurance they would not have without Obamacare. </p> <p>Nearly half of adults in marketplace plans were uninsured before getting the new insurance, according to <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2016/may/ACA-tracking-survey-access-to-care-and-satisfaction\">an April 2016 survey from the Commonwealth Fund</a>. And a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/health/immigrants-the-poor-and-minorities-gain-sharply-under-health-act.html\">New York Times</a> analysis showed that Obamacare brought \u201chistoric\u201d increases in coverage for people who have been traditionally left behind by the health care system. </p> <p>\u201cAll you\u2019ve seen in the last couple days, is that they [the premiums] are going up 30%, 40%, 50%,\u201d Jerry Marsh said. \u201cThat type of thinking is what will hurt some people.\u201d</p>",

  "<p> When FC Dallas lifted the Supporters\u2019 Shield on Sunday, it was hard not to view it as a job mostly done, but not fully complete yet. Their hunt for the treble is still on. They secured the US Open Cup in September, the Shield in October, and have their sights firmly set on lifting the MLS Cup in December for an season that would be unprecedented in US soccer. On top of that, last Thursday they advanced to the quarter-finals of the Concacaf Champions League. It has been a special season for Dallas, a season where almost everything has gone right, and the seeds of their long-term, youth-focused philosophy have finally started to bear fruit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/26/mls-play-offs-roundtable-winners\">MLS play-offs roundtable: our writers pick the postseason winners</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The man behind all of this is the Colombian \u00d3scar Pareja, who played for Dallas from 1998 to 2005, joined the backroom staff immediately after retiring, ran their academy, and finally become their head coach in 2014, a job it seemed he was always destined to inherit. There were stints in between with the USA Under-17 team, and two mixed years as head coach of the Colorado Rapids, but he always looked desperate to come back to Dallas, a place where he feels most at home. There\u2019s an extreme level of mutual comfort: Dallas has been inMLS for 21 seasons, and Pareja has been involved in 16 of them.</p> <p>Because of Dallas\u2019s commitment to nurturing and fostering their own young talent \u2013 their insistence on playing their kids \u2013 it is fitting too that Pareja\u2019s nickname is <em>Papi</em>. He is the father, the grand architect of their whole program. He crafted their system and has shepherded many their bright, young talents through the ranks. The program is designed in his image, and is a beacon for those who see American, homegrown talent as the way forward for MLS.</p> <p>While the idea of MLS as a retirement league propped up on the tired legs of ageing European stars is outdated, Dallas is standing out even in this new \u2018MLS 3.0\u2019 climate, with their unflinching commitment to their youth programs and their academy. They run a single program, with a single philosophy, throughout all their age groups, and start inculcating players as young as 10. In a US soccer landscape where youth development is often fragmented between high school, local travel teams, pay-to-play programs, and various semi-pro academies, FC Dallas is unique in its top-down adherence to a single philosophy.</p> <p>And that approach has already paid dividends. If the senior team has won a double this year, then the academy has also won a double of its own, claiming the 2016 U-16 and U-18 national titles. But the main focus in Dallas is on development, not winning. As the current academy director Luchi Gonzalez told the league website: \u201cWinning a championship is an amazing honor, but our ultimate goal is a day where we can sign a player to the first team.\u201d They have hit that goal again and again, signing 15 homegrown players since they retooled their academy in 2008. And it is not just FC Dallas that wants to sign players from their academy, earlier this year Schalke swooped in to sign their starlet Weston McKennie, and current Bournemouth player Emerson Hyndman is another prospect who spent significant time in the Dallas youth system.</p> <p> Their system is unparalleled in the US, and it clearly deserves all the plaudits heading its way. But when you zoom out from the hothouse, fevered atmosphere around the academy, the most intriguing signing Dallas might have made is not one from their youth team to their senior team, but one who was without a club at all, and last played in the Guatemalan league. </p> <p>On 15 September, FC Dallas announced that they had just signed Carlos Ru\u00edz, who was without a club since May, for a second stint at the club. 15 September also happened to be Ru\u00edz\u2019s 37th birthday. In fact, Ruiz is old enough that in his first stint with the Dallas, he played in the same team as Pareja.</p> <p>Ru\u00edz is the ultimate MLS veteran. He holds the record for most postseason goals and is 10th on the alltime MLS career goalscoring charts. But it\u2019s also his style of play and his demeanor, as much as his age, that sets him apart from the FC Dallas setup. He is a master of the dark arts, and is adept at drawing free kicks and wearing defenders down with bitty, attritional fouls throughout the game. He will do anything to win, and his nickname, <em>Pescadito</em>, or little fish, comes from his habit of flopping to the ground to try to con a free kick for his team. If the FC Dallas academy \u2013 with its lofty ambitions and surety in doing things the right and proper way \u2013 is philosophy, then Ru\u00edz \u2013 with his gamesmanship and poacher\u2019s instinct \u2013 is pure, unabashed pragmatism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/19/fc-dallas-mls-homegrown-players-academy\">How FC Dallas and their homegrown model could revolutionize US soccer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The marriage of the two can be thrilling to watch. On 16 October, Ru\u00edz scored an 89th-minute winner to propel Dallas back to the top of the table and give them control of the Supporters\u2019 Shield race again. It was a goal of unexpected grace, an agile, little first time dink over the \u2018keeper at full speed. If Dallas are going to win the treble, they might first look back at the moment that secured them the double and be grateful that Pareja added experience to his roster, steel to his silk.</p> <p>The signing of Ru\u00edz might be less perplexing when placed in the overall schema of Dallas\u2019 plan, though. If one of the core tenets of any academy system is the maximization of local and available talent, Dallas has done an excellent job of recruiting in one of the Latino soccer hotbeds of North America, then that belief can undergird a whole system.</p> <p>An academy is all about success delayed, inching towards a future. It is about the flurry of small gains building into something greater. It is this same incremental approach that allowed Dallas to find their center-back pairing, Matt Hedges and Walker Zimmerman, through the college draft, a player acquisition method most teams treat haphazardly.</p> <p>As Matthew Doyle, a senior editor of mlssoccer.com, pointed out in his final day round-up: \u201cThey don\u2019t leave any stone unturned. That\u2019s why they\u2019re champions.\u201d</p> <p>And with their star playmaker Mauro D\u00edaz out for the playoffs, Dallas is going to have to start finding solutions throughout their roster, and it would surprise no one if they called upon Ru\u00edz to add to his record postseason goals tally. They make an unlikely couple \u2013 <em>Papi y Pescadito</em>, the philosopher and the pragmatist \u2013 but Dallas hope they can remain in love just long enough to win them the treble.</p>",
  "<p>There can be few things in life more satisfying than watching years of hard work culminate in one fleeting but beautiful moment. In 2006 Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman stood in the technical area at Gelsenkirchen and experienced just that, bathing in the warm glow of fulfilment as he saw the stars align in 54 glorious seconds.</p> <p>Two years earlier, P\u00e9kerman had been entrusted with the Argentina job, succeeding Marcelo Bielsa, with whom he shared many deeply held beliefs about how the game should be played. The appointment made perfect sense. P\u00e9kerman could try to improve on the fine but flawed work of his meticulous predecessor but better still, he would be working with players whom he had helped to sculpt into steely winners in his role as the under-20 coach. </p> <p>Between 1994 and 2001 he oversaw a golden era of Argentinian youth football, winning the World Youth Championship three times in four tournaments. It was an unprecedented period of success with Juan Pablo Sor\u00edn, Esteban Cambiasso, Pablo Aimar, Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme, Javier Saviola and Maxi Rodr\u00edguez among the players whom P\u00e9kerman schooled in a highly effective form of possession football that he hoped would serve Argentina well in the future. Underpinning his philosophy was the keenly held belief that a composed approach will always be rewarded more richly than a hurried one. </p> <p>This was something he tried to drum into his under-20 players on a personal level as well as a tactical one. He left Aimar, among his most heralded players in 1997, on the bench for the final of the World Youth Championships in Malaysia, apparently with the sole intention to teach him the lesson that haste, whether on the football pitch or in progressing a career, isn\u2019t always the best way forward. Having had to wait for his chance to manage Argentina after a career that weaved in and out of football following the early curtailment of an undistinguished playing career, P\u00e9kerman knew the value of patience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/golden-goal-gary-mcallister-liverpool-everton-april-2001\">Golden Goal: Gary McAllister for Liverpool v Everton (2001) | Sachin Nakrani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were signs in the buildup to the 2006 World Cup that Argentina could be a force with a manager at the helm who knew the players so well. None more so than at a raucous Estadio Monumental on 8 June 2005, when just under 50,000 fans bore witness to a devastating first-half display in which Argentina danced around a spellbound Brazil, their rhythmic passing providing a joyous backing track as they raced into an insurmountable 3-0 lead against the world champions to seal World Cup qualification. There was also a rare glimpse of peak Riquelme, with the enigmatic playmaker swivelling away from Roque J\u00fanior with graceful ease before unleashing an unstoppable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRtiFKbVxng\">25-yard strike</a> into the top-left corner.</p> <p>Freeing Riquelme to influence games as a menacing metronome was the chief reason that P\u00e9kerman\u2019s side were so easy on the eye in Germany. There had been criticism in Argentina that Riquelme was often allowed to get away with too much in matches, paying scant regard to tracking back and scoffing at the idea of winning back possession. But the truth is that by playing one or both of Cambiasso and Javier Mascherano behind him, most of the time Riquelme didn\u2019t need to. </p> <p>When Mascherano stole the ball with Ivory Coast on the attack and Argentina just 1-0 up in the first group game in Germany, they looked perfectly set for a blistering counterattack. Instead, Argentina took eight considered touches, never accelerating the move until within striking distance. It was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnQkUuSv7_k&amp;app=desktop\">Riquelme\u2019s wand of a right boot</a> that set up Saviola to stab home. The patient approach had worked again and given us a hint of what was to come. It appeared P\u00e9kerman had come up with the magic formula. The murmurings of approval for Argentina\u2019s style of possession football afterwards would become a chorus following the game against Serbia and Montenegro.</p> <p>Among Argentina supporters there was a whiff of anticipation about what was possible against Serbia and Montenegro. Two years earlier the same sides, containing a good portion of the players lining up in Gelsenkirchen, had met at the Athens Olympics, which Argentina went on to win. The score? <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkYdkFTWKg\">Argentina 6-0 Serbia and Montenegro</a>. </p> <p>Perhaps that is why Argentina had a swagger about them from the start. Six minutes into the game, a delicious move on the left resulted in Saviola bursting into the box, where he poked the ball across to Rodr\u00edguez to jab home and prompt Diego Maradona, high up in the stands, to begin just the first of his many crazed celebrations that evening. It would take a further 24 minutes for the lead to be increased, but it was a period in which Argentina\u2019s grip on the game became so unbearably tight that something had to give. It did. \u201cThe most beautiful goal,\u201d as Hern\u00e1n Crespo described it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0270ac7bb4065526a597879e622bf58dd2dc521\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0270ac7bb4065526a597879e622bf58dd2dc521/0_0_1620_2048/791.jpg\" alt=\"Diego Maradona\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diego Maradona celebrates during Argentina\u2019s mesmeric display of possession football against Serbia &amp; Montenegro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Achim Scheidemann/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It begins in much the same way as the second goal scored against Ivory Coast, with the opponents\u2019 pocket being picked while on a dangerous-looking attack. On this occasion it is Rodr\u00edguez who does the pilfering, chasing back and hooking the ball away from Mateja Kezman, in full gallop. He then shows he has the intelligence to match his industry, drifting off into space and dragging three opponents to the left of the pitch before popping a little pass back to Sor\u00edn, who takes them out of the game by coming back inside. </p> <p>The patient passing continues over to the right-hand side of the pitch, with Mascherano, Riquelme and Cambiasso all getting a touch and appearing to move in slow-motion as their opponents huff and puff around them. The ball, now on first-name terms with Argentina\u2019s midfield, is worked back over to the left in sophisticated style, never in danger of being stolen away. It\u2019s at this point that you become aware that the unhurried movement of both players and ball has begun to mesmerise. </p> <p>There is an opportunity to quicken the attack as the ball arrives over on the left again but these Argentina players, schooled as they have been by P\u00e9kerman to be patient at all times, show their intelligence, choosing to eschew the first opportunity to attack down the left wing and instead frustrate their opponents to the degree that five Serbia and Montenegro players are drawn towards the ball as Argentina play it backwards again. Now, this is when the slow-slow-quick approach kicks in, with Mascherano fizzing a pass out to Sor\u00edn, who is hugging the touchline, before finding Saviola, the catalyst for the deadliest part of the attack. He bursts inside from the touchline and plays a cute one-two with Riquelme, who for all his influence on the game, plays only a minor role in this wonderfully-crafted goal. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COe5Y29-BZY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/COe5Y29-BZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Saviola picks up the return from Riquelme (pass 22 in case you\u2019re interested) and curls the ball out towards the edge of the box, where Cambiasso is lurking. It\u2019s not an easy pass to control, bouncing awkwardly in front of a player who had only come on 12 minutes earlier, as a substitute for the injured Luis Gonz\u00e1lez, and had never been famed for his attacking prowess. But sometimes in life, moments arrive that hint at perfection and must not be undone. There is a sense that Cambiasso was acutely aware of this as his first touch, a feathered dink with the outside of his left foot, feeds Crespo perfectly. The big striker then shows incredible deftness himself, taking one delicious touch with his left instep, delaying to allow Cambiasso to catch up, and then teeing him up with his right heel. Impeccable link-up play. </p> <p>Crespo said afterwards that he knew that something great was happening as the move was gradually and skilfully stitched together behind him. Perhaps Cambiasso did too, and it is why, when the series of 25 passes was nearing its glorious end, neither player dared shirk the responsibility of seeing to it that it was given the final flourish it deserved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/26/golden-goal-faustino-asprilla-colombia-argentina-1993\">Golden Goal: Faustino Asprilla for Colombia v Argentina, 1993</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is utter joy and intense relief as Cambiasso drills the ball high into the net. In some ways goals that are built through patient passing moves are similar to 147 breaks in snooker. As they reach their denouement, the pressure mounts. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin it,\u201d must have been the recurring thought as Cambiasso and Crespo realised it was up to them to do justice to what had gone before them. They did not. As Cambiasso raced off to celebrate, clutching his shirt with two hands, P\u00e9kerman roared his approval from the sidelines, having watched his team score a goal that he had helped make possible by drumming into them the value of possession when many were still kids.</p> <p>It would have particularly pleased P\u00e9kerman that it was Cambiasso, the epitome of a team player, who was in the right place at the right time to score one of the great team goals. There were echoes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/carlos-alberto-eternal-captain-scorer-brazils-beautiful-goal\">of the recently passed</a> Carlos Alberto\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh6b-Y_enJM\">iconic goal for Brazil in the 1970 World Cup final</a> in Cambiasso\u2019s effort, only with an even greater number of passes and a finish that was not as emphatic but still thoroughly assertive. A decade after it was scored, this goal is now seen by many as being the precursor to tiki-taka, when possession itself became a potent weapon in football.</p> <p>It still haunts many Argentina fans that the class of 2006 did not go further than the quarter-finals, with P\u00e9kerman accused of blundering against Germany, going against his principles and substituting his pass master Riquelme for the more defensive qualities of Cambiasso in the 80th minute and thus ceding the attacking initiative. Germany went on to equalise as Argentina became far less assured in possession. They lost on penalties, of course. Worse still, they disgraced themselves as a fight broke out at the end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9c6249796d988d97abcbb41d4e1bab17039e835\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c6249796d988d97abcbb41d4e1bab17039e835/0_27_2334_1400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fight breaks out at the end of Germany\u2019s victory over Argentina on penalties at the 2006 World Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fight breaks out at the end of Germany\u2019s victory over Argentina on penalties at the 2006 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>P\u00e9kerman resigned after the defeat. It is a great shame. His methods had imbued Argentina with the kind of on-the-ball authority that would serve Spain so well in their period of domination between 2008 and 2012. But P\u00e9kerman can be proud that his team created something wonderful in Gelsenkirchen, something he deserved to oversee and take credit for given his key role in developing the players who made it happen. The fact that it took a while to arrive made it all the more beautiful.</p>",
  "<p>Naomi Alderman was 200,000 words into her latest novel when she realised she was going to have to junk it. She\u2019d started it in 2013, put it aside, then picked it up again the following autumn. \u201cIt was a dark time. I thought \u2018I don\u2019t know how to progress this\u2019,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThen on 20 December, when the year was the darkest it could be, I decided I had to throw it all out.\u201d She ran the decision past two writer friends who had read it. \u201cThey both said that it was very brave, but they didn\u2019t say not to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Fewer than 2,000 words of that original draft have made it into Alderman\u2019s fourth novel, <em>The Power</em>, but the earlier work is acknowledged with a private joke.

What starts out as a fantasy of female empowerment deepens and darkens into an interrogation of power itself, its uses and abuses and what it does to the people who have it.

I like putting something really brand new into my brain.\u201d</p> <p>Alderman\u2019s passion for learning goes back to her earliest days as the daughter of an academic historian and an artist. Her parents are \u201cunorthodox orthodox jews\u201d who brought her up to be intellectually curious but culturally conservative. When she was seven, her father, Geoffrey, brought home a Spectrum 48K computer which came with a booklet explaining basic programming. \u201cI\u2019d always really enjoyed playing text adventures so I did a bit of programming my own dungeons.\u201d</p> <p>She went from a state Jewish primary school in Colindale, \u201cthe poor man\u2019s Hendon\u201d in north London, to the highly competitive private secondary, South Hampstead High School. Her parents were both from solidly working class backgrounds. \u201cWe weren\u2019t particularly wealthy so I was quite out of place,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat these schools do, if you come from a background like that, is essentially a process of deracination. For years I looked down on my mother for shopping at Asda, and now I feel very ashamed of it.\u201d</p> <p>Her home life in her teens was overshadowed by \u201ca lot of shocks and alarms\u201d, not least the suicide of her uncle when she was 14 years old, which traumatised her parents and \u201cbroke\u201d her grandmother. \u201cIt meant that I didn\u2019t have a significant period of adolescent rebellion. To rebel you need to feel safe that your parents will still love you and that they\u2019ll be OK, and after my uncle\u2019s death it was very clear to me that my family were not OK, so I was a very good girl. I remember sitting in the locker room at school to have a cry because I couldn\u2019t do it at home.\u201d</p> <p>School, however, was \u201ca very nurturing place\u201d: she found a group of friends, wrote \u201ctwo and a half chapters of a novel about a girl who could control probability\u201d, and flourished academically. It wasn\u2019t until she landed a place to read PPE at Oxford that she found out how hard it could be to live by different rules.</p> <p>On arrival, she was excited to discover a room full of state-of-the-art computers. \u201cI recognised it as my place: I thought I could go there and play these games I hadn\u2019t played before, but I found it full of blokes swapping pictures of topless women, and I was this good orthodox girl.\u201d</p> <p>The college kitchens wouldn\u2019t cook kosher food, so she ate at the Jewish Society six days a week and submitted to a double foil-wrapped baked potato on the seventh day so that she could have some vestige of college life. On the eve of each sabbath, she would leave her files in the library and her toothbrush in the bathroom, to avoid having to carry them around \u2013 from time to time she would find the toothbrush missing, her papers torn.</p> <p>Many years later, at a college reunion, \u201cthis bloke sitting next to me turned to me and said, \u2018Me and my friends used to mess with your Jewish stuff on the sabbath\u2019, and I thought, what you are confessing to is antisemitic bullying. It\u2019s really shocking to me that he didn\u2019t start by apologising.\u201d</p> <p>She had enough confidence to write a novel in her first year (\u201cIt was not very good but I finished it\u201d) but she found Oxford \u201can abusive place\u201d, both socially and academically. \u201cI think on some level I emotionally collapsed \u2013 not in a dramatic way, just a long, slow leeching out of my confidence in my abilities.\u201d Surprisingly, she would go on to idealise it in her second novel, <em>The Lessons</em>, the story of a lonely physics student who becomes entranced by richer, more sophisticated friends. \u201cA good read if not unique,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/04/lessons-naomi-alderman-book-review\">concluded one reviewer</a>, perhaps intuiting that this was not the story she really needed to tell.</p> <p>After university she briefly worked as a PA at a children\u2019s publisher, then talked her way into a job editing publications for an international law firm, which sent her to its New York office. There she became involved in fan fiction, after receiving \u201ca call from God\u201d to attend a<em> Buffy the Vampir</em><em>e Slayer</em> conference in Nashville, Tennessee, \u201cwhich changed my life by making me think of this show I loved in new, critical, ways\u201d.</p> <p>New York also introduced her to orthodox gay and lesbian people \u201cwho had these terrible stories: rabbis who said if you didn\u2019t marry and have children you were completing Hitler\u2019s work\u201d.

It placed a New York Jewish lesbian at the heart of a novel set in the north London home of an orthodox rabbi, offering a rare glimpse into a hidden world. It won an Orange award for new writing and its longevity was recently confirmed when the film rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/05/rachel-weisz-rachel-mcadams-adaptation-naomi-alderman-disobedience\">were bought by Rachel Weisz</a>.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Richard Dawkins calls God \u2018an imaginary friend\u2019, and it\u2019s supposed to be insulting, but I hear voices all day long</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book caused some distress in orthodox circles. When one Jewish paper refused to review it, Alderman\u2019s father \u2013 a leading authority on English Jewry \u2013 leapt to its defence in the Jewish Chronicle, though even he conceded that it was \u201cperhaps just a little too authentic\u201d. More importantly, it marked the end of her own life as a practising Jew. \u201cI went into the novel religious and by the end I wasn\u2019t. I wrote myself out of it.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back on why that decision was so long in coming, she says, \u201cI think some people\u2019s brains have more of a natural bent towards God than others. Richard Dawkins calls God \u2018an imaginary friend\u2019, and it\u2019s supposed to be insulting, but I hear the voices of imaginary people talking in my head all day long. I don\u2019t have a problem with it. Also I valued being able to look at the world slantwise. I have a suspicion of lockstep and everyone looking in the same direction: that\u2019s a key character trait in me.\u201d</p> <p>Though no longer a believer, Alderman has continued to be fascinated by religion. Her third novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/06/liars-gospel-naomi-alderman-review\"><em>The Liars\u2019 Gospel</em></a>, published in 2012, told an alternative life of Christ in which Jesus has become the Jewish preacher Yehoshuah, son of Miryam, who may or may not be a worker of miracles. It, too, caused offence in some quarters. \u201cI love a bit of blasphemy,\u201d she jokes, though there was nothing superficial about her engagement with the Bible. \u201cHanging over the bare bones of Alderman\u2019s revisionist narrative, like the perfume of roasting meat over a sacrifice, is the poetry of Christian doctrine and myth,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/06/liars-gospel-naomi-alderman-review\">Guardian reviewer Tom Holland</a>. \u201cBefore writing it I felt oppressed by Christianity because it\u2019s responsible for so much persecution of Jews; since I wrote it I think of Jesus as my friend. I haven\u2019t allowed him into my heart, just into my sitting room,\u201d she says. She has two more scripture-wrangling stories in mind, one about St Paul and one about Constantine.<br></p> <p>In <em>The Power</em>, a convent gives sanctuary to the newly empowered young women when the male establishment is hunting them down, and \u2013 despite the doctrinal problems that they pose \u2013 goes on to preserve their stories and to sanctify their conclusion that God must be female.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that the novel seems<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood\"> Atwoodesque</a> in its evocation of a closed order of women. It developed after Alderman was \u201cadopted\u201d by Margaret Atwood in a mentoring scheme for young writers, and is dedicated to the novelist and her husband Graeme Gibson, \u201cwho have shown me wonders\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/06/liars-gospel-naomi-alderman-review\">The Liars' Gospel by Naomi Alderman \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe one thing Margaret directly suggested was the idea of a convent,\u201d she says. It was a eureka moment which sparked one of the lateral synapse bursts that characterise Alderman\u2019s way of being. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in who gets to tell the story, and of course the last time we rescued ourselves from dark ages, monks were very important. Think how much of what we do is just copying out the story again with different characters and a different place, and how much we are shaped by that. And God knows, Hollywood is full of repeated stories.\u201d</p> <p>Besides the games and the original fiction, she has also written a Doctor Who novel, <em>Borrowed Time</em>, which was published between her second and third books, and which she regards as a form of fan fiction. \u201cThe Doctor is god, by the way, in the same way that Apollo or Hercules are gods or demigods.

  "<p>Let\u2019s jump right in with the bad news: nobody called all six games correctly in our Pick Six contest last week.

The answer is that they would have been correct, and picked up a point that nobody else got. Instead, in the end, they went for a Seattle win and get nothing, just like the rest of us.</p> <p>Full standings below the line shortly. For now, here are this week\u2019s games:</p> <h2><strong>Washington @ Cincinnati Bengals (Sunday 9.30am ET/1.30pm GMT)</strong></h2> <p>The final London game of 2016 has the makings of another close one. Indeed, the headline statistics for these teams are strikingly similar. The Bengals average 392.6 yards of total offense per game, of which 276.9 come through the air and 115.7 on the ground. Washington\u2019s corresponding numbers are 391.4, 277.7 and 113.7. The two defenses are just as hard to separate \u2013 from a production standpoint, at least \u2013 so where do we find an edge? The one big concern I have from Washington\u2019s standpoint regards the availability of Josh Norman, who has travelled to London with his team-mates but still needs to clear NFL concussion protocol before he being allowed to play on Sunday. Without him, the already daunting task of slowing down AJ Green would start to look even more ominous. </p> <p><strong>Bengals to win</strong></p> <h2><strong>Detroit Lions @ Houston Texans (Sunday 1pm ET/5pm GMT)</strong></h2> <p>Brock Osweiler\u2019s return to Denver went just about as badly as it could: the Texans signal-caller averaged a pathetic 3.2 yards per passing attempt against his former employers. But the Broncos\u2019 defense, at its best, can make even the most talented quarterbacks seem inadequate. The same cannot be said for Detroit, who recently gave up 321 yards and three touchdowns to Case Keenum. Osweiler would not need to match those numbers to give his team a chance, but he might need to take on a more prominent role than he has thus far in order to help his coaches reduce the workload for the team\u2019s banged up tailback, Lamar Miller. Houston\u2019s own No2-ranked pass defense will present Matthew Stafford with a sterner test than he has faced all season, but he hasn\u2019t had many bad games yet, since pairing up with Jim Bob Cooter. </p> <p><strong>Lions to win</strong></p> <h2><strong>Seattle Seahawks @ New Orleans Saints (Sunday 1pm ET/5pm GMT)</strong></h2> <p>I know some of you will look at this game and wonder why I\u2019ve included it. Few would disagree that the Seahawks are a better team than New Orleans. But allow me to sow a seed of doubt in your minds, by observing that Russell Wilson has won only nine out of 19 career games that kick off at 1pm ET (playoffs included). It is an extraordinary statistic, when you consider that his overall record as an NFL starter is 57-22-1. The discrepancy is not all down to Wilson\u2019s performance, of course, but reflects the challenge all west coast teams face when travelling to play games that would be kicking off at 10am back home. One imagines that Drew Brees might feature pretty highly on the list of quarterbacks that defenders wouldn\u2019t want to face when they\u2019re still rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Is it enough to make me pick New Orleans? Not quite, but I do expect this to be a close one. </p> <p><strong>Seahawks to win</strong></p> <h2><strong>Oakland Raiders @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Sunday 1pm ET/5pm GMT)</strong></h2> <p>Another west coast team facing a road game in the early time slot, the Raiders\u2019 body clocks should be in better shape, given that they have been staying out in Florida since before their win in Jacksonville last weekend. A perfect 4-0 on the road, Oakland will hardly fear a visit to Raymond James Stadium, but might have some concerns about how to slow down the well-balanced offense that the Bucs have rolled out these last couple of weeks. Jacquizz Rodgers has run the ball better than Tampa had any right to expect since stepping into the lineup \u2013 he made an astonishing 97 yards after contact against the 49ers \u2013 and might be the greatest beneficiary of an ankle injury to Raiders defensive tackle Stacy McGee. I also like Jameis Winston\u2019s prospects of having a big day against what remains statistically the worst pass defense in the league. </p> <p><strong>Buccaneers to win </strong></p> <h2><strong>New England Patriots @ Buffalo Bills (Sunday 1pm ET/5pm GMT)</strong></h2> <p>At the start of this month, the Bills beat the Patriots 16-0 in New England. Now all they need to do is to repeat the trick at home. Ah, if only it were as straightforward as that sounds. The Patriots who got shut out in that first meeting had Jacoby Brissett at quarterback and an undercooked version of Rob Gronkowski at tight end. The Bills themselves will get an important player back on Sunday, as two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Marcell Dareus makes his season debut. But to stand a chance against New England, they will need to control the clock as they did in that first meeting. That would be no small task under any circumstances, but only looks trickier for the fact that both of their top two running backs \u2013 LeSean McCoy and Mike Gillislee \u2013 have been limited in practice this week by injuries. </p> <p><strong>Patriots to win</strong></p> <h2><strong>Green Bay Packers @ Atlanta Falcons (Sunday 4.25pm ET/8.25pm GMT)</strong></h2> <p>A year ago, the Falcons started 5-0 before collapsing to finish 8-8. This season, they raced out to an impressive 4-1 start but have since lost two games on the bounce. Is this the start of another maddening slide into mediocrity, or merely a bump on the road? For now, I am inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. The Falcons lost by just two points in Seattle \u2013 one week after a draining road win over Denver \u2013 and in overtime at home to San Diego. There is still a lot to like about a team boasting the league\u2019s most prolific offense (for both yards and points scored), but certainly there is pressure on Atlanta to win this week and stop familiar doubts from creeping back in. In years gone by, I could not have backed Matt Ryan to win a shootout with Aaron Rodgers under such conditions. But the simple fact is, this season, he has been the better quarterback. </p> <p><strong>Falcons to win </strong></p>",

  "<p>If you were to be presented with a scene of unimaginable gore, where several of your fellow-humans were being hacked to death and their entrails and vital fluids scattered liberally around the room, your immediate reaction would presumably be to run away from this horror, and try to find safety (assuming you <a href=\"http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/5487/why-does-the-the-sight-of-gore-causes-nausea-vomiting-and-or-fainting\">weren\u2019t busy vomiting</a>). It would be a bit weird, alarming even, if you were to offer to pay to watch this scenario, possibly while eating popcorn or nachos (which may also lead to vomiting if taken to excess). </p> <p>And yet, countless people technically do exactly that. The Saw franchise alone has grossed close to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_(franchise)#Box_office\">a billion dollars at the box office</a>, and that\u2019s just one series of horror films, just at the cinema. There are far more options and formats out there, all dedicated to presenting people with scenes of intense gore and/or fear. And people lap it up (not literally, that would be awful). The point is, there\u2019s clearly a huge market for things which should logically scare or repulse us.</p> <p>The best example of this is Halloween, which is going on around us right now. A celebration of all the things that should scare us. The fact that it\u2019s warped into an occasion dedicated more to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2013/10/25/dishing-the-dirt-on-halloween-candy-consumption/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.co.uk/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/\">sugar consumption</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sparklingstrawberry.com/categories/Sexy-Halloween-Costumes/\">questionable \u201csexy\u201d attire</a> is immaterial; we created an occasion to celebrate things that should, by rights, scare us. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44d2f1e71ee01f21d7dae97f5d79e56d6522b2a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44d2f1e71ee01f21d7dae97f5d79e56d6522b2a2/0_252_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boy (8-9) with scary costume for HalloweenEB3ACE Boy (8-9) with scary costume for Halloween\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cAAAAAH! A child! And the inevitable loss of freedom and crushing weight of responsibility such a thing would bring! RUN!\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But <em>why</em> do people get such a kick out of fear? Looked at one way, it makes no logical sense. Fear is an unpleasant sensation, evolved to make us wary of and able/willing to avoid dangers. This is obviously a vital survival trait, and as such it\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.brainfacts.org/sensing-thinking-behaving/mood/articles/2015/fear-and-the-brain-an-introduction/\">very deeply entrenched in the workings of our brains</a>. Humans are very quick to fear things, and from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/jun/28/phobias-rationale-irrational-fears\">phobias</a> to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/oct/16/social-anxiety-mundane-terrifying-psychology-stress\">social anxieties</a>, even the most seemingly innocuous occurrence can trigger an unpleasant fear reaction. The vomiting reaction to gore also underscores our fundamental disgust response, again a very powerful reaction <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/emotions/disgust.shtml\">supported by fundamental brain processes</a>. These things have evolved over millions of years, to keep us safe, healthy and alive. Thus far, they seem to be doing a good job.</p> <p>Why, then, do the same brains that induce these intensely negative reactions, also motivate us to seek them out? There are a few possible explanations. </p> <p>At the most basic level, there\u2019s the excitation-transfer theory. Being scared and triggering the <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/fear2.htm\">fight-or-flight response</a> is incredibly stimulating, having <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response#Emotional_components\">a number of definite effects on our brain\u2019s workings</a>. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103172800052\">Excitation-transfer theory</a> argues that the stimulation experienced via fear is essentially transferred to other experiences, which may not be similar in any way. Basically, scary things make everything else more \u201cvivid\u201d, and this is exciting and appealing. </p> <p>This is quite a simple explanation though, and humans are more complex than that. Another argument is that we all have these dark impulses or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199505/forbidden-thinking\">forbidden thinking</a>\u201d, and having some form of outlet for this is a good thing. People regularly wonder about stealing, attacking, cheating, and worse. If you\u2019ve ever stood next to someone by a high drop and thought \u201cWhat would happen if I just pushed them off?\u201d then you know what this is like. Some argue that indulging in horror and other \u201cvideo nasties\u201d <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/11045833/James-Foleys-murder-and-the-psychology-of-our-fascination-with-the-gruesome.html\">provides an outlet for this thinking/compulsion</a>, meaning we\u2019re less likely to act on it overall.</p> <p>Of course, the counterargument is that it <a href=\"http://www.simplypsychology.org/Systematic-Desensitisation.html\">desensitises us to such stimulation</a>, meaning we need more intense, visceral entertainment to provoke the same, original reaction. Many people have commented on how modern horror is a far more gruesome, bloodier affair than that from previous decades. Are we seeing desensitisation on a cultural scale?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77a7e2163adde588e98813d7d109ef30f744f7a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77a7e2163adde588e98813d7d109ef30f744f7a5/0_547_3767_2258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Child dressed up as ghost draped with white sheet that has facial features cut out, extending arms to the sides, front view.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ghost, or melting Klansman? Either way, it\u2019s disturbing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Crawford/Getty Images/Dorling Kindersley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another possibility involves <a href=\"http://neuroscience.mssm.edu/nestler/brainRewardpathways.html\">the reward pathway</a>. This is the vital region of the brain that produces pleasure and good feeling whenever we do something that the brain fundamentally \u201capproves\u201d of. Drink water when you\u2019re thirsty, eat a high-calorie sweet foodstuff, have an enjoyable sexual encounter with someone you find attractive (or not, up to you), these are things that the brain recognises as positive behaviours, so encourages you to do them again. These things may not be \u201cpositive\u201d in the moral or societal sense, we\u2019re talking at a more primitive, physiological level. </p> <p>Another thing the brain probably considers a positive behaviour is \u201cavoiding death\u201d. When you\u2019re experiencing high levels of fear, the more fundamental brain processes think you\u2019re in danger. Then you\u2019re not scared any more (e.g. because the film ended). Whatever it was you did to escape the scary situation, the brain likes it, so provides a reward. And thus, people experience enjoyment and pleasure from being scared, and happily pay for the privilege by buying films or books that scare us, or join in when everyone runs around scaring everyone else. </p> <p>Some people take it beyond even this, putting themselves in actual danger by engaging in extreme sports or similar. These people are officially described as having the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/sensation-seeking\">sensation seeking</a>\u201d personality trait. More often, they\u2019re labelled \u201cthrill seekers\u201d. There\u2019s even evidence to suggest that such people have genetic properties that compel them to risk their necks, having different expressions of dopamine receptors, which are <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/26294-ski-genes-thrill-seeking.html\">crucial for the reward pathway</a>.</p> <p>It only works up to a point, though. And this point is how much control we have of the situation. Even the most dedicated thrill seeker will train and use the best equipment; they don\u2019t randomly hurl themselves off cliffs or out of planes. And the more mainstream horror-lovers may indulge in the most gruesome of entertainments, but they know that at any point they could leave the cinema, stop the DVD, put the book down etc. <em>Actually</em> being in the same room as a vicious serial killer would not be a popular pastime, and genuine beyond-your-control dangers don\u2019t tend to make people happy. They cause <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/#.WBCyfforLcs\">things like PTSD</a>. </p> <p>It seems our brains do enjoy being scared.

  "<p>Just like the concept of the cocktail itself, Halloween is not technically speaking an American invention, but also like the cocktail, you can\u2019t deny that American culture perfected it. </p> <p>Halloween and mixed drinks therefore go together like the peanut butter and chocolate in a Reese\u2019s cup \u2013 especially after the neighbourhood\u2019s children have slipped into a diabetic coma from eating the spoils of their trick or treating. </p> <p>In the spirit of the holiday, here are four tricks that will help make your adult libations a real treat this Halloween. <br></p> <h2><strong>1. Put an eyeball in your highball</strong></h2> <p> As the old bartender\u2019s saw goes, you take your first sip of a drink with your eyes \u2013 which is usually just another way to say that visual presentation is important. But you can make this saying somewhat more literal by garnishing your Halloween drinks with edible \u201ceyeballs\u201d, which can be made either sweet or savoury to match your drink. </p> <p> For <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=188qPek61r4\">sweet eyeballs</a>, you\u2019ll need tinned and pitted lychees, fresh blueberries and some strawberry or raspberry jam. Drain the lychees, then stuff a little jam into each lychee\u2019s pitting hole until they\u2019re half-filled. Place a blueberry in at the front of each hole, which will become the eyeball\u2019s iris and pupil. If you like, you can paint some more jam around the exterior of the eyeball for an extra-grisly \u201cfreshly plucked\u201d effect. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMEuVY_jFi_/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Ihr sucht noch nach einer schnellen und einfachen Halloween Idee oder wollt einfach mal Freunde und Familie etwas erschrecken?

Wash the radishes and trim their tails, then lightly peel them, leaving flecks of the red skin behind. Slice the top off each radish, leaving a flat surface. Slice the olives in half to create a green iris and red pupil. Then, with a paring knife, carefully carve a small divot in the flat surface of each radish for the halved olives to sit in. </p> <p> If you really want to camp up the horror quotient, pair them with one of these two bloodthirsty classic cocktails: the blood and sand (sweet) or the bloody Mary (savoury).</p> <p><strong>Make it at home: blood and sand</strong></p> <p><strong>22.5ml scotch whisky<br>22.5ml sweet red vermouth<br>22.5ml cherry brandy (preferably Cherry Heering)<br>22.5ml freshly squeezed orange juice (or blood orange juice)</strong></p> <p> Build all ingredients in shaker.

Make a shimmering witch\u2019</strong><strong>s potion</strong></h2> <p> Whoever came up with the idea of Viniq liqueur was really on to something, at least as far as presentation goes. This shimmering, swirling liqueur might be a little bit, ahem, <em>de trop</em> for most bars, but it\u2019s perfect for adding a bit of supernatural sparkle to your Halloween cocktails. The only problem? It\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.delish.com/cooking/videos/a43113/is-viniq-shimmery-vodkadelish-or-not-delish/\">not to everyone\u2019s taste</a>.</p> <p> You can get around that, though, by cutting out the middleman and going straight to the source of the shimmer: lustre dust (also known as pearl dust). Without this flavourless, edible powder (readily available in cake decorating specialty stores), Viniq would simply be a plain old mixture of flavoured vodka and moscato. Which means that you can apply the same shimmer to just about any translucent drink.

The gas itself (carbon dioxide) is harmless, but if any of that dry ice gets inside you or your guests, your night of spooky revelry could be cut short by a real horror show: a trip to the emergency room.</p> <p> The safer way to achieve that cool effect is to <a href=\"http://honestlyyum.com/6804/halloween-pumpkin-punch/\">create a multilayered punch bowl</a> that keeps the dry ice separate from the actual drink. Start by carving the top off a large pumpkin, and hollow it out to fit a large metal kitchen bowl. (Don\u2019t use glass \u2013 it could break from the extreme cold of the dry ice.) Using tongs or thermal gloves, place small chunks of dry ice inside this bowl, then place another, slightly smaller, metal kitchen bowl on top. Fill this bowl with a punch of your choosing, and when you\u2019re ready to serve, pour a small quantity of warm water in between the rims of the two bowls to activate the dry ice. If your cauldron stops smoking, add some more warm water or dry ice. (If you have small children at your Halloween party, keep the smoking cauldron out of their reach.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.359375% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMD4LKbgLqC/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Halloween weekend is coming \ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf3d We&#39;re open 7/7:  Tomorrow and saturday 9 - 19h Sunday 10 - 13h Monday 31 october 9 - 18h Tuesday 1 november 10 - 13 h ICE CUBES-CRUSHED-DRY ICE-ICE BLOCKS-ICE BUCKET \ud83c\udf2a\ud83c\udf2a\ud83c\udf2a Rue De La Glaci\u00e8re 38 Bruxelles - Ijskelderstraat 38 Brussel - parking \ud83c\udd7f\ufe0f \ud83d\udc7bWelcome\ud83d\udc7b #halloween #laglaci\u00e8re #ice #dryice #glacecarbonique #droogijs #ice #open #pumpkin #horeca #ijskelderstraat #ruedelaglaciere #effects #halloween16 #brussel #bruxelles #belgium</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by La Glaci\u00e8re \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea (@laglaciere) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-10-27T09:01:33+00:00\">Oct 27, 2016 at 2:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p> Now that you know how to make your cauldron, what should you put in it? It\u2019s easy to scale up simple mixed drinks such as the spritz Veneziano or Pimm\u2019s cup to punchbowl sizes: for \u201cpart\u201d, simply read \u201cbottle\u201d. But if you\u2019re after something a little more fancy (but nonetheless easy), whip up a pisco punch \u2013 the famed drink of pre-prohibition San Francisco, with which Rudyard Kipling was so taken that he claimed it was \u201ccompounded of the shavings of cherub\u2019s wings, the glory of a tropical dawn, the red clouds of sunset and the fragments of lost epics by dead masters\u201d.</p> <p> <strong>Make it at home: pisco punch</strong></p> <p><strong> 700ml (one bottle) Peruvian pisco<br>480ml still or sparkling mineral water<br>360ml freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice (strained)<br>240ml pineapple syrup (see below)<br>120ml Lillet rouge or Dubonnet (optional)</strong></p> <p> To make the pineapple syrup, peel a whole fresh pineapple and cut it into small (one inch) chunks. Place these chunks in a bowl and cover with a simple syrup made from two parts raw sugar to one part hot water. Place overnight in the refrigerator. Strain the syrup from the pineapple and keep the pineapple chunks for garnishing individual cups of punch.</p> <p> To make the punch, simply combine the ingredients in the punch bowl just before your guests arrive. For the pisco, look for a high-quality Peruvian one \u2013 Campo de Encanto is a recent entrant on the market and is now widely available. Make sure the lemon or lime juice is squeezed just before mixing into the punch \u2013 it can develop off flavours if prepared too far in advance. The mineral water is traditionally still, but can be sparkling if you\u2019d like a few bubbles. </p> <p>San Francisco bartender Duggan McDonnell adds a splash of Lillet rouge to his pisco punches to imitate the long-lost secret ingredient and red hue of Duncan Nicol\u2019s original pisco punch (the very one that inspired Kipling\u2019s reveries on the subject). If you can\u2019t find Lillet rouge, Dubonnet will perform the same trick, just a little less admirably.</p> <p> <strong>Pair it with a film: </strong>Justin Kurzel\u2019s 2015 adaptation of Macbeth \u2013 even if the Weird Sisters of Kurzel\u2019s film never actually say the famous \u201cDouble, double, toil and trouble\u201d line. </p> <h2><strong>4.

Stripping away the humanity of Jews, Slavs and other \u201cundesirables\u201d was a precondition to murdering them. In the Polish town of Poznan in October 1943, Heinrich Himmler officially <a href=\"http://ww2history.com/key_moments/Holocaust/Himmler_s_Posen_speech\">confirmed</a> the Nazi Holocaust. \u201cWe must be honest, decent, loyal and comradely to members of our own blood and to nobody else,\u201d he declared.</p> <p>There is no systematic industrialised attempt to exterminate millions of people today, but hundreds of thousands have perished in Syria\u2019s killing fields, and the UN describes the treatment of Yazidis as genocide.

It has had wide resonance in popular culture, from influencing Tim Burton (especially Edward Scissorhands, 1990) to appearing on the single for the Bauhaus track Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dead.

Dracula was Universal\u2019s most successful film of the year and cemented the wardrobe of the vampire in the popular imagination while making an overnight star of Bela Lugosi, who even insisted on being buried in one of his capes. The white tie and bat-like cape was borrowed from an earlier stage version of the production, also starring Lugosi, in which the high collar aided his on-stage disappearance. Vampires, with their capes, tailoring and impeccable aesthetic sense are undoubtedly the supernatural beings with the most sartorial flair.</p> <h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>Bride of Frankenstein </strong><strong>(James Whale, 1935)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8454c7f57215ec8122e54386db54158b9f80c8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8454c7f57215ec8122e54386db54158b9f80c8d/0_0_1972_2456/803.jpg\" alt=\"Bound to be frightening \u2026 Elsa Lanchester in the 1935 version of Bride of Frankenstein\" width=\"803\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bound to be frightening \u2026 Elsa Lanchester in the 1935 version of Bride of Frankenstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clothing the undead was vital to the Universal horror boom of the 1930s, and many films were given their signature looks through the combination of Vera West\u2019s costume design and Jack Pierce\u2019s makeup. Pierce\u2019s design for the Monster in Frankenstein (1931) made Boris Karloff an overnight star and became the defining look for the Creature first imagined by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley in 1818. West, head of Universal\u2019s costume department from 1928, costumed some of Hollywood\u2019s earliest monsters and accompanying damsels in distress. The Horror-obsessed Mulleavy sisters behind the Rodarte label drew on ideas of assemblage and construction for autumn/winter 2009, including Karloff\u2019s Frankenstein. \u201cFranken-Green\u201d was a key colour, and strapped leather resembled straitjackets and body bags. The Monster also resurfaced for summer 2013 courtesy of Christopher Kane, who used nuts and bolts as fastenings, complete with prints of Karloff in his finery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecefa44a083d8d64dc6789a2c71aac64856e46a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecefa44a083d8d64dc6789a2c71aac64856e46a1/0_0_1697_2992/567.jpg\" alt=\"Damsel in distress \u2026 Rodarte fashion show, autumn/ winter 2009\" width=\"567\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damsel in distress \u2026 Rodarte fashion show, autumn/ winter 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most chic character in Bride of Frankenstein (1935) is Elsa Lanchester as the Monster\u2019s Mate.

The Birds (1963), starring Tippi Hedren and costumed by Head, inspired the violent imagery at Alexander McQueen\u2019s collection for spring/summer 1995 that turned models into living roadkill. The sharp tailoring that Head required her leading ladies to wear has become an enduring reference. McQueen \u2013 with a background in tailoring \u2013 was often inspired by Head\u2019s costuming, and even pastiched the Vertigo (1958) poster for one of his show invites.</p> <h2><strong>5. </strong><strong>Rosemary\u2019s Baby </strong><strong>(Roman Polanski, 1968)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56c2bab1c1b6b98fa4a342692b04420b636db447\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56c2bab1c1b6b98fa4a342692b04420b636db447/0_0_720_600/500.png\" alt=\"Doris Day meets horror \u2026 Mia Farrow in Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968).\" width=\"500\" height=\"417\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doris Day meets horror \u2026 Mia Farrow in Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gothic look of horror was eschewed from the 1960s, as Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho (1960) marked a turning point in which the monster without became the monster within, less easy to identify through costumes or makeup. Roman Polanski took this approach when adapting Ira Levin\u2019s novel Rosemary\u2019s Baby for the screen in 1968, telling costume designer Anthea Sylbert to think of Doris Day movies to make the ghoulish events of the film more striking in their contrast. The resulting candy-coloured 1960s wardrobe and distinctive Vidal Sassoon pixie cut sported by Mia Farrow has found its way to the catwalk via designers such as Joseph Altuzarra and Tata Naka.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ea52869c93cfe381f3a187b893ce635e0ba5361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea52869c93cfe381f3a187b893ce635e0ba5361/0_0_2815_4256/661.jpg\" alt=\"Baby pink \u2026 The Altuzarra 2015 spring/summer show referenced Anthea Sylbert\u2019s costumes for the 1968 film Rosemary\u2019s Baby.\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baby pink \u2026 The Altuzarra 2015 spring/summer show referenced Anthea Sylbert\u2019s costumes for the 1968 film Rosemary\u2019s Baby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>6. </strong><strong>The Wicker Man</strong><strong> (1973)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ce73175c3f986e1cdcc4607b9a68490f12f054e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ce73175c3f986e1cdcc4607b9a68490f12f054e/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Lee in the 1973 film The Wicker Man\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Effigy in style \u2026 Christopher Lee in the 1973 film The Wicker Man.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/British Lion/StudioCanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"09f2d356cd6e58e6c6b8597068e516592256a03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f2d356cd6e58e6c6b8597068e516592256a03c/0_0_2491_3872/643.jpg\" alt=\"Wicked wicker \u2026 Gareth Pugh\u2019s show autumn/winter 2007 collection referenced The Wicker Man\" width=\"643\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wicked wicker \u2026 Gareth Pugh\u2019s show autumn/winter 2007 collection referenced The Wicker Man.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The folk horror subgenre flourished in the late 1960s and early 70s, focusing on cults, superstitions and imagined pagan rituals. The Wicker Man (1973) is the best-known of these films, which investigate the darkness that can lurk behind the facade of a rural idyll. Designer Gareth Pugh cites The Wicker Man as a constant source of inspiration, and in his autumn/winter 2007 collection, the square-shouldered silhouette paid homage to the effigy itself. Luella Bartley also turned to the film the following year in a collection inspired both by Britt Ekland\u2019s character in the movie, and the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic in Cornwall.</p> <h2><strong>7. </strong><strong>The Stepford Wives </strong><strong>(Bryan Forbes, 1975)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b989f95eb12e2a5ad7369011ce3f29e8080910c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b989f95eb12e2a5ad7369011ce3f29e8080910c9/0_0_3420_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Stepford Wives, 1975\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Domestic dystopia \u2026 The Stepford Wives, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the dystopian suburbia of Stepford, Connecticut, the men systematically murder their wives and replace them with compliant and pneumatic domestic-goddess robots. The costume, designed by Anna Hill Johnstone, play a key role, marking the women\u2019s transition from human to robot. The book and film drew heavily on Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique (1963), which shattered the illusion that American housewives were gripped with domestic bliss. The Stepford Wives has been used as a reference for designers keen to emulate the chiffon and florals of the mid-0s. Orla Kiely mixed Stepford Wives with the preppy, Palm Beach styles of Lilly Pulitzer for spring/summer 2016 resulting in maxi hemlines, cotton lace dresses and an abundance of frills.

The film begins in a nightclub with post-punk band Bauhaus singing Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dead, neatly linking the film\u2019s cinematic heritage with stylised goth subcultures. With stars Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie, it\u2019s little wonder that the movie has had an enduring influence on style. Deneuve was dressed by Yves Saint Laurent for her role, while Milena Canonero \u2013 who had designed for boutiques before moving into costume \u2013 was responsible for the remainder of the wardrobe. Preen took The Hunger as its starting point for its pre-autumn 2013 collection, resulting in a \u201cNew Wave edge\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2013/preen-by-thornton-bregazzi\">according to Tim Blanks</a>, with fabric texture inspired by the film\u2019s lighting. But it was Alexander McQueen who took the film as his central inspiration for his spring/summer 1996 collection The Hunger. Towards the finale, a transparent plastic bodice filled with live worms acted as a reminder of the mortality that escapes Deneuve\u2019s Miriam\u2019s lovers, entombed in coffins throughout most of the film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81e94b2a3f5e32fb8955cd6ab52b797a17451182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81e94b2a3f5e32fb8955cd6ab52b797a17451182/0_0_3131_5000/626.jpg\" alt=\"Worming its way into the imagination \u2026 Alexander McQueen\u2019s 1996 collection The Hunger\" width=\"626\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worming its way into the imagination \u2026 Alexander McQueen\u2019s 1996 collection The Hunger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Munns/PA Archive/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>10. </strong><strong>Twin Peaks</strong><strong> (David Lynch, 1990)</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdb353f1aee4ead6674aaf72f0b7baa53607dbf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdb353f1aee4ead6674aaf72f0b7baa53607dbf6/0_0_2746_1832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haute horror \u2026 David Lynch\u2019s TV series Twin Peaks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haute horror \u2026 David Lynch\u2019s TV series Twin Peaks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not strictly film, but David Lynch\u2019s seminal TV series has had a resounding impact on the world of style, and the correlation between high fashion and haute horror is evident in the collaboration between Lynch, and Carol Lim and Humberto Leon at Kenzo.

  "<p>Iranian authorities executed three Turkish nationals for drug trafficking last year only 11 days after a high-profile visit to Tehran by Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, it has emerged.</p> <p>Iran \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/iranian-stars-shahab-hosseini-campaign-save-lives-convicts-on-death-row\">executed nearly 1,000 people last year</a>, more than any other country apart from China \u2013 usually refrains from sending foreign nationals to the gallows, especially in cases involving countries with which Tehran has maintained friendly relations. <br></p> <p>The family of a 46-year-old man, Faruk G\u00fcner, a father of nine children, confirmed to the Guardian that he was executed. He was a lorry driver working between Afghanistan and Turkey who passed through Iran. \u201cWe tried for four years to save him. They didn\u2019t tell us that he was going to be executed. They hanged him in the morning; we got the news in the afternoon,\u201d G\u00fcner\u2019s brother said. <br></p> <p>The information about the executions was first received by the Norway-based <a href=\"https://iranhr.net/en/\">Iran Human Rights</a> (IHR), which closely monitors Iran\u2019s use of capital punishment. The group said two other Turkish nationals, identified as Mehmet Yilmaz and Matin, whose surname is not known, were executed at the same time. Activists say drug traffickers do not usually receive a fair trial in Iran.<br></p> <p>Most executions in Iran are for drug offences. As a neighbour of Afghanistan, a leading supplier of the world\u2019s drugs, Iran faces big challenges at home, with a young population susceptible to an abundance of cheap and addictive drugs. However, the alarming rate of executions has sparked a debate inside the country and parliamentarians are considering a proposal to replace the death penalty in such cases with imprisonment.</p> <p>The three Turks were executed in April 2015, a little more than a week after Erdo\u011fan met with Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, and the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in Tehran. <br></p> <p>The countries, which have maintained good ties for several decades, have been at odds over regional issues in recent years and relations were frosty at the time of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s visit. However, they have since improved. Iran firmly backed Erdo\u011fan against the failed coup attempt earlier this year and Turkey is realigning itself towards Russia, Tehran\u2019s main ally. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/iranian-stars-shahab-hosseini-campaign-save-lives-convicts-on-death-row\">Iranian stars campaign to save lives of convicts on death row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>IHR said the convicts were executed at Vakilabad prison in the eastern city of Mashhad after being arrested separately for alleged drug trafficking. \u201cThese three prisoners were reportedly not granted their last prison visit with family members before they were executed,\u201d it said. \u201cAdditionally, close sources say that the Iranian authorities did not inform their families of the executions\u201d until late April but \u201ctheir bodies were reportedly returned to Turkey\u201d in May. </p> <p>G\u00fcner\u2019s brother said his family\u2019s pleas to Iranian as well as Turkish authorities fell on deaf ears. \u201cWe asked help from many places; nobody helped us,\u201d he told the Guardian via telephone. \u201cWe found a lawyer and we went to Iran; we tried to prove that he was innocent, but one day they just executed him. This is inhuman. He had nine kids.\u201d </p> <p>The Turkish foreign ministry did not respond to emails seeking its reaction on the news and on why it did not publicise the executions at the time. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey think that they are Muslim, but they are not. If my brother were in Israel, even in Israel, he would be alive,\u201d G\u00fcner\u2019s brother said. \u201cWe asked help from Turkish authorities; they didn\u2019t help. We couldn\u2019t even see him for the last time,\u201d the brother added. \u201cThere are no laws in Iran. If he were in another country, at least we would be able to see my brother for the last time. They just executed him without telling us. Everything happened suddenly.\u201d</p> <p> Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, IHR\u2019s spokesman, said it was not clear if the cases were discussed by the Turkish president in Tehran. \u201cIt\u2019s also unclear whether the Turkish government took any action to help save their lives. [The] timing of the executions and lack of public reactions by the Turkish government is highly questionable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Michael, Mehmet Yilmaz\u2019s son, told the IHR: \u201cI travelled to Iran seven times in order to deliver my dad\u2019s medication to him. The Turkish authorities did nothing for my dad. All they did was introduce our family to a lawyer. The Iranian authorities confiscated my dad\u2019s truck, which was worth 80,000 Turkish lira (\u00a321,000). My family is currently still paying off the truck through monthly instalments.\u201d <br></p> <p>Madyar Samienejad, who monitors the human rights situation in Iran, said more than 450 people have been put to death in the country this year. He said at least 264 of them were executed for drug offences. Iran has also been reported to have executed at least seven people who committed their crimes while they were under the age of 18 - two of those executions have been confirmed.The execution of juveniles is prohibited under international law. </p> <p>\u201cMore than any other time, people in Iran, including those in the government and the judiciary or media, are debating whether to abolish [the] death penalty,\u201d Samienejad told the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cOn 26 October, [reformist newspaper] Etemaad ran a front-page editorial on abolition of [the] death penalty, which talked about how ineffective this punishment has been. It\u2019s the first time this debate is taking place at such a national level and it\u2019s a positive development highlighting the work of abolitionist activists.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>England\u2019s vast grouse shooting estates receive millions of pounds in public subsidies according to an investigation by Friends of the Earth.</p> <p>Thirty of the estates received \u00a34m of taxpayer\u2019s money between them in 2014, the year examined by the pressure group, including one owned by the Duke of Westminster, the richest landowner in Britain with land holdings estimated to be <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/sunday-times-rich-list-2015-top-25-richest-people-uk-2016-4/#7-charlene-de-carvalho-heineken-and-michel-de-carvalho-19\">worth \u00a39bn</a></p> <p>The campaigners, who argue that grouse moor management harms the environment and wildlife, found the moors cover over half a million acres, an area equivalent to all the land within the M25, Greater London and parts of the home counties. </p> <p>The estates are owned by a mixture of lords, dukes, earls and barons as well as bankers, businessmen and firms based in offshore tax havens. </p> <p>MPs will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/07/mps-to-debate-ban-on-grouse-shooting\">debate the issue of grouse shooting</a> on Monday, as the result of an official <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125003\">petition backed by more than 120,000 people</a> which demands a ban on driven shooting, where beaters flush birds towards the guns. </p> <p>The petition claims the management of grouse moors leads to the illegal killing of birds of prey such as hen harriers, which prey on grouse, and the legal killing of foxes, stoats and mountain hares. It adds that the heather burning involved could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/543de6d2-aeec-11e5-993b-c425a3d2b65a\">worsen flooding</a> and climate change.</p> <p>\u201cThese shocking new figures reveal the true, horrifying scale of grouse moors in England and the madness of the current farm payments system that subsidises them,\u201d said Guy Shrubsole of Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>\u201cInstead of handing out taxpayers\u2019 money to billionaires and offshore firms to indulge in an elite sport, the government must reform farm payments so public money is spent on public goods \u2013 like tree-planting, restoring wildlife habitats, farming sustainably and preventing flooding downstream,\u201d he said. The future of the \u00a33bn a year the UK receives in EU agricultural subsidies is a key part of the Brexit debate.</p> <p>Amanda Anderson, director of the <a href=\"http://www.moorlandassociation.org/\">Moorland Association</a>, said driven grouse shooting played an important role in conservation: \u201cAlmost two-thirds of England\u2019s upland sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) are managed grouse moors. Management has helped conserve this unique landscape, whereas elsewhere in Britain it has been lost to afforestation, windfarms or overgrazing.\u201d</p> <p>Grouse shooting in England and Wales leads to more than \u00a315m a year being spent in rural areas and supports more than 1,500 jobs, according to Anderson. She said: \u201cThere is no place for the illegal killing of any wildlife and no place in the Moorland Association for a grouse moor owner or manager found to have broken the law.\u201d</p> <p>The Friends of the Earth investigation took a <a href=\"http://www.moorlandassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Figure-1-Breeding-Merlin-2008-2011.pdf\">Moorland Association map</a> showing \u201ckeepered grouse moors\u201d in England and compared it with government datasets and satellite images, which show where burning has taken place, to calculate the area. It found <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/page/map-grouse-moors-england\">550,000 acres of grouse moor</a>, all in the north of England.</p> <p>FoE then used Land Registry data to identify 30 of the grouse moor estates, which cover 300,000 acres of the total.

It was revealed in September that a billionaire <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37493956\">Saudi prince received \u00a3400,000 a year</a> to subsidise a farm where he breeds racehorses. </p> <p>The National Trust and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/14/post-brexit-farming-subsidies-must-protect-nature-84-groups-say\">many green NGOs</a> have argued for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/04/national-trust-calls-for-complete-reform-of-british-farm-subsidies\">complete overhaul</a>, ending payments for simply owning land and only rewarding farmers who improve the environment and help wildlife.

  "<p>The death of a gay professor could propel Taiwan into becoming the first Asian country to legalise same-sex marriage by the end of next year.<br></p> <p>More than 80,000 LGBT activists and supporters are expected to take to the streets of the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, on Saturday for what is expected to be Asia\u2019s largest ever gay pride parade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/no-room-in-indonesia-for-gay-rights-says-president-spokesman\">'No room' in Indonesia for gay rights, says president's spokesman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The annual event of 14 years will have its usual celebratory feel. But this year revellers march in the knowledge that they may be on the cusp of making civil rights history in terms of marriage equality.</p> <p>It would be a hard-fought victory for Taiwan\u2019s LGBT community, but also one tinged with sadness after the suspected suicide of Frenchman Jacques Picoux, on 16 October became a rallying call against the failure of the government to make progress on legalising same-sex marriage.</p> <p>Picoux, 67, who taught French at the National Taiwan University, died after falling from the tenth floor of his Taipei apartment block. Friends believe he had taken his own life.</p> <p>They blamed depression after the death last year by cancer of his Taiwanese partner of 35 years, Tseng Ching-chao.</p> <p>Picoux had reportedly been crushed when his lack of legal status denied him the right to participate in crucial medical decisions in Tseng\u2019s final moments. He later found himself with no legal claim over the property they shared.</p> <p>After his death the gay community lashed out against the government led by president Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected in January on a pledge to boost equality rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/lgbt-rights-chinese-student-qiu-bai-homosexuality-desciptions-textbooks\">Chinese student lodges suit over homosexuality terms in textbooks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow many more human lives do we have to lose as a result of the government\u2019s gross negligence?\u201d charged prominent rights group, the Taiwan LGBT hotline association.</p> <p>However, Picoux\u2019s personal tragedy generated such public sympathy that lobby group Pride Watch Taiwan, has described it as a \u201cpivotal moment\u201d in the gay rights movement.</p> <p>A new draft bill tabled by the ruling Democratic Progressive party [DPP] on Monday to amend family law in favour of LGBT rights was a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d, they said. </p> <p>\u201cWe actually can see that there are about 66 legislators who will probably vote yes on marriage equality,\u201d said Pride Watch activist, Cindy Su. \u201cThat\u2019s a majority of 58.4%, the first time in Taiwanese history that we have more than half,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Recent polls also show a public majority in favour of same-sex marriage.</p> <p>Sitting in her parliamentary office, the DPP\u2019s Yu Mei-nu, who drafted the new law, freely admits that she would not have such strong support if it had not been for Picoux\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThis story touched people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe LGBT group were very angry. It has put a lot of pressure on our party and on other parties.\u201d</p> <p>Taiwan\u2019s progress towards legalising gay marriage is largely down to Yu\u2019s efforts.</p> <p>Under the previous administration, ruled by the Kuomintang party, she steered a similar draft law through two years of negotiations, only to have it collapse when legislators were too afraid to turn up for a final vote.</p> <p>Yu admits she felt \u201csomewhat upset\u201d, but believes it prepared the ground for future success.</p> <p>\u201cThis time it is time,\u201d she said. Taiwanese society and the parliament were more ready to accept changes to the civil code to grant gay couples equal rights in marriage, parental authority and freedom from discrimination in adoption cases.</p> <p>Yu is optimistic the law can be introduced as early as next year.</p> <p>Jay Lin, the organiser of Taiwan\u2019s first awards ceremony for promoting LGBT rights, which was due to take place on Friday, said much still had to be done to break down societal taboos about gay relationships, but conceded that Picoux\u2019s death had softened public attitudes. </p> <p>A day after Yu\u2019s bill was published, Picoux and Tseng\u2019s ashes were scattered together in the sea on Taiwan\u2019s southeast coast.</p> <p>\u201cThat tragedy really brought it home. It\u2019s not just legislation or a piece of paper, it\u2019s about love and commitment and not being able to fulfil that,\u201d said Lin.</p> <p><em><em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. </em></em><em><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is <a href=\"tel:1-800-273-8255\">1-800-273-8255</a>.

The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women.

Ken Bone, for those not up on the latest internet memes, is a man fond of a red sweater who asked an anodyne question about energy policy in the second presidential debate. The internet instantly turned the man into a meme. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g540n3sLh68\">Ellen created a brilliant dance-off between him and Hillary Clinton.</a> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/10/15/the-rise-and-fall-of-ken-bone-this-is-what-happens-when-real-humans-become-internet-memes/\">Salon claimed</a> he \u201crepresented the humanity lacking in this year\u2019s election\u201d. It follows, therefore, that this internet hero had to become a sexy Halloween costume.</p> <p>In so far as we need to find humanity in the crappy year that is 2016, then Ken Bone is a great character to dress up as for Halloween. But we don\u2019t need to sex him up to do so. There is no sexy Ken Bone for men. There is no sexy nurse for men. Or sexy doctor. And so far I haven\u2019t seen male costumes coming with <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a5973947/dripping-blood-choker-asos/\">collars of \u201cblood\u201d around their neck.</a></p> <p>Look, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being sexy. And let\u2019s face it, for singletons, there is no better strike rate for pulling than a drunken dress-up party, in which case we should all dress in the sluttiest, sexiest, most flattering costumes we can find. But those three adjectives are not the same thing, and that\u2019s my point. </p> <p>What we are now served up for Halloween is a cartoon cliche version of sexy that is pretty much the only choice for female costumes, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-stiffelman/daughter-wants-inappropri_b_12517160.html\">even for eight-year-old girls. </a></p> <p>Right now, we\u2019re having a moment. Donald Trump has exposed in all its ugliness the deep-seated misogyny that exists in our society. His crude treatment of women has forced thousands of women to talk about their harassment and humiliation at the hands of men. What struck many of us about the infamous Trump-Billy Bush recordings were not just how disgusting it was but also how common it was.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/trump-has-crossed-a-line-his-views-are-as-old-as-misogyny-itself\">As Suzanne Moore pointed out</a>, we\u2019ve heard men talk about women like this our whole lives. We can\u2019t put all this back in the closet. We can no longer ignore how women have been treated as not quite equal, and judged \u2013 always \u2013 first and foremost on how we look. We\u2019re more than our bodies. </p> <p>No matter how hilarious sexy Ken Bone is, now seems the right time to ditch the sexy Halloween costume and just dress up as some awesome women, scary or not. And what a year for it \u2013 we\u2019ve had female Ghostbusters, and Jane Got a Gun, Alice Through the Looking Glass and Eleven from Stranger Things. And none of these are exactly a turn-off. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/trump-has-crossed-a-line-his-views-are-as-old-as-misogyny-itself\">So Trump has crossed a line?

At the party, a man approached me, pointed his finger in my face and growled, \u201cYou ruined my family\u2019s life.\u201d In retrospect, the latex mask may have been a step too far. </p> <p>But the mask did not go to waste.

Backpackers have been attracted to work on farms as a way of extending their visas.</p> <p>While the NFF opposed the 32.5% rate, it has supported the revised measure of 19% with a 95% tax on backpackers\u2019 superannuation earnings when they leave Australia. The bills also increase the passenger movement charge by $5.</p> <p>Fitzgibbon would not commit to blocking the backpacker tax bills and associated tax increases in the Senate. The decision has yet to go to the Labor caucus.<br></p> <p>Fitzgibbon says the fact that the government has tied the backpacker tax to an increase in the passenger movement charge and a 95% tax on working holiday makers\u2019 superannuation on the way out of Australia makes the decision difficult.</p>"
