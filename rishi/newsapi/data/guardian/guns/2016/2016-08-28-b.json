  "<p>The federal government will kick off the first week of the 45th parliament by introducing 25 bills, including its omnibus savings bill, tax cuts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/29/coalition-rejects-labors-call-for-media-ownership-review-before-changing-laws\">changes to media ownership controls</a> and industrial relations changes.</p> <p>But some of the biggest stoushes in the new parliament will be about the superannuation changes that are still being debated in the Coalition party room and the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the fate of which is unclear until Labor announces if it will block it.</p> <p>The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government would introduce bills for tax cuts to middle-income earners,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/06/company-tax-cut-plan-will-cost-482bn-over-10-years-treasury-reveals\"> the $48bn 10-year company tax cut</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/malcolm-turnbull-demands-support-from-opposition-for-savings-measures\">the $6.5bn omnibus savings bill</a> on Wednesday and Thursday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/indigenous-mps-to-meet-youth-in-push-for-constitutional-recognition\">Indigenous MPs to meet youth in push for constitutional recognition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cormann told Radio National among the first to be introduced would be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/21/behind-the-industrial-relations-bills-that-could-trigger-a-double-dissolution-election\">bills to create two tougher union watchdogs</a>, the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission, which triggered the double-dissolution election.</p> <p>The government will also make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/22/turnbulls-cfa-laws-unveiled-but-expertquestions-constitutionality\">changes to the Fair Work Act to boost the bargaining position of Country Fire Authority volunteers</a> locked in an industrial dispute in Victoria.</p> <p>Asked whether the government was genuinely involved in a give and take, Cormann said it was \u201cduty bound\u201d and \u201chonour bound\u201d to attempt to pass its legislative agenda, although there may be negotiation in the Senate.</p> <p>The Coalition government, which has 30 votes in the Senate, needs nine votes from the Greens, Labor or minor parties to pass legislation.</p> <p>The Coalition party room will thrash out its differences on superannuation reform on Monday. The government\u2019s restive backbench has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/22/scott-morrison-rejects-backbench-call-for-1m-non-concessional-super-cap\">called for the proposed $500,000 lifetime non-concessional cap on after tax contributions to be increased</a>.</p> <p>The Greens have warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/greens-say-they-wont-back-watered-down-superannuation-changes\">they won\u2019t support watered down changes</a>, whereas Labor has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/bill-shorten-offers-malcolm-turnbull-compromise-on-superannuation-changes\">proposed a compromise to ditch the backdated application of the cap</a> to 2007, which the government rejected.</p> <p>Cormann said the government had taken a package of reforms to the election to make superannuation fairer and more sustainable but would not explain how it would resolve demands for changes to the policy.</p> <p>On Sunday Malcolm Turnbull said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/28/malcolm-turnbull-contradicts-tony-abbott-claim-coalition-control-budget-repair-45th-parliament\">the \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the $6bn superannuation package was \u201cbroadly accepted\u201d</a> and changes to the $500,000 cap were only worth $500m.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/industry-funds-back-super-package-as-turnbull-flags-compromise-20160827-gr2tqz#ixzz4IfVq0F3r\">Industry Super Australia has backed the changes</a>. Its chief executive, David Whiteley, told the Australian Financial Review that they \u201cimprove the equity of the system and, while the package isn\u2019t exactly how we would design it, it strikes a reasonable trade-off between competing priorities\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday the opposition leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, played down the importance of the government\u2019s legislative agenda.</p> <p>\u201cThese 25 bills, things like levies in the agricultural sector and the statute amendment bill, may well be worthy but I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d trumpet them as the centre of your agenda,\u201d she told Radio National.</p> <p>Wong said the push to introduce 25 bills was an attempt \u201cto demonstrate a legislative agenda, particularly when [the government] are all at sea on superannuation and are particularly divided on that issue\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt says something about them that their biggest focus is the extent of the concessions they can give the highest income earners in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if Labor would back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/22/senior-labor-mps-want-to-keep-welfare-payment-they-previously-wanted-to-scrap\">scrapping of the energy supplement to 2.2 welfare recipients</a> as part of the $6.5bn omnibus savings bill, Wong repeated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/23/labor-says-act-consistently-cuts-cormann-wibble-wobble\">Labor\u2019s position would reflect its position before the election</a>, suggesting it would accept the cut.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/29/coalition-rejects-labors-call-for-media-ownership-review-before-changing-laws\">Coalition rejects Labor's call for media ownership review before changing laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The proposed marriage equality plebiscite is shaping up as a key battle in the new parliament. Cormann said he \u201cdid not take it as given\u201d that the plebiscite enabling legislation would be blocked because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/28/marriage-equality-bill-shorten-signals-labor-will-block-plebiscite-saying-pm-would-stuff-it-up\">Labor had not taken an official position</a>.</p> <p>He said the government would \u201ccross that bridge when we get there\u201d if the popular vote were blocked. On Sunday Turnbull refused to rule out a parliamentary vote if the plebiscite were blocked.</p> <p>But on Monday, the education minister, Simon Birmingham, told Sky News a plebiscite was \u201cthe only way\u201d same-sex marriage would be achieved in the next three years, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/blocking-marriage-equality-plebiscite-could-delay-it-for-years-liberals-warn-labor\">a number of Liberals warning it would be off the table if the plebiscite were blocked</a>.</p> <p>Wong said the plebiscite was \u201ca political deceit, imposed by Tony Abbott and the conservatives\u201d, criticising it for being \u201cexpensive, divisive and non-binding\u201d.</p> <p>She said the only thing stopping marriage equality was that Turnbull lacked courage to allow a free parliamentary vote.</p> <p>Pushed on whether Labor blocking the plebiscite would delay marriage equality for three years or more, Wong said she did not accept that delay would result because community pressure could force Turnbull and Liberal moderates to allow a free vote.</p>",
  "<p>It is easy to regard Johanna Konta\u2019s impressive rise from nervous underachiever to genuine contender for major honours as the result of a dry, programmed preparation, as is often reflected in her language.</p> <p>The word \u201cprocess\u201d has become an almost parodic feature of her lexicon. She talks about staying in \u201cthe moment\u201d, and any attempt to pierce her carefully constructed psychological armour is met with polite deflection. But she is no robot, whatever the impression of her archer\u2011like serve and clean, well-chosen ground strokes.</p> <p>It becomes obvious in conversation with Konta that there is still a lot of emotion bubbling under, the jitters that her one-time Fed Cup captain Judy Murray said always sublimated her considerable potential. If those nerves did not jangle still, Konta would struggle for motivation under pressure \u2013 which will no doubt arrive at various \u201cmoments\u201d when she begins her US Open campaign on Monday against Bethanie Mattek-Sands. It is likely to be on one of the big show courts, possibly even Arthur Ashe. The pressure and the spotlight will be fierce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/24/johanna-konta-venus-williams-stanford-classic-final\">Johanna Konta beats Venus Williams in first WTA final to win Stanford Classic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The American \u2013 who, with Jack Sock, beat the British No1 and Jamie Murray on her way to gold in the mixed doubles at the Rio Olympics \u2013 is Konta\u2019s polar opposite, rushing towards flamboyance and gestures, dressed confidently, it seems, in a variety of publicity-grabbing outfits.</p> <p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t played each other ever and now we are playing each other twice in three weeks,\u201d Konta said with a laugh. \u201cShe is playing very well, she has an incredible amount of experience, she is coming off the back of something that is incredibly inspirational and life\u2011changing so I think it\u2019s no secret that a lot of American players play better here. I\u2019m expecting a very inspired Bethanie and I will do my best. She is a popular player and a gold medallist so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an incentive for it to be a big court. Whatever we\u2019re on, we\u2019ll make it a good one.\u201d</p> <p>Where Mattek-Sands has a look-at-me attitude to life and her career, Konta prefers the quieter route to prominence. \u201cI haven\u2019t really looked at myself as someone that needs to prove a point to anyone,\u201d the British player said.</p> <p>\u201cI look to constantly be a better version of myself every time I step out on court. That has come out with some good wins and good things on paper but if my ranking were to drop or to rise, it wouldn\u2019t affect my goals or how I want to keep improving. That\u2019s why I employ the people I employ, for me it\u2019s about working on the here and now, working on the process that matters to me but in terms of what my forehand looks like or how much or how many points I need to defend here or there, that\u2019s not my job.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/21/johanna-konta-wimbledon-tennis-interview\">Johanna Konta: \u2018You\u2019re going to go through phases of hating the sport\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Did she recognise change in herself over the past year or so, rising from the outer reaches of respectability in the rankings to No14 seed here, and almost crashing the top 10 in Canada a few weeks ago? She also has the considerable financial incentive of $3.5m (\u00a32.6m) prize money to go with this title, as well as a slice of the $1m available for being near the lead of the US Open series bonus challenge. \u201cI\u2019m exactly the same person,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely older and that much wiser as well, I hope.</p> <p>\u201cI think I have had a lot of experiences in a short space of time at this level. There wasn\u2019t so much of a warm-up period [in her career]. It was very much just on the WTA Tour this year and that has been an incredible experience, one that I hope to continue every year for the rest of my career. Otherwise I think I\u2019m just as happy, hard-working and motivated as I was last year.</p> <p>\u201cI do feel that this year has gone very, very quickly, it just feels like so much has happened in such a short space of time. But I hope to be feeling the same way this time next year.</p> <p>\u201cThe tour keeps moving, tournaments keep coming and going, and I think the better job I do of staying present and healthy and enjoying what I\u2019m doing the more reasons I give you guys to write about me.\u201d</p>",

With this background in mind it is essential that the party acts in a proportionate, fair and lawful manner in dealing with our client,\u201d writes his lawyer.</p> <p>Draper is complaining that he does not know what he has been suspended for.

  "<p>Arrangements for the rehearing of the Jim Best case could shortly become a matter for the law courts. Solicitors for the Lewes trainer, exasperated by what they see as intransigence from the British Horseracing Authority, are expected to take the matter to the High Court if no progress is made in discussions between the two sides.</p> <p>However, the prospect of agreement seems remote in view of the BHA response when asked to comment on the possibility of litigation. A statement from the regulator insisted it would not agree to change either the date of the rehearing or the proposed panel members, while noting that Best\u2019s team is allowed to appeal to the panel itself on those subjects.</p> <p>It is understood that Richard Wilson QC has been instructed on Best\u2019s behalf. According to the Legal 500 guide to barristers, his reputation is \u201cfor being cogent and determined in court \u2026 His arguments are regularly described as \u2018admirable\u2019 and \u2018attractively presented\u2019 by judges\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/adam-brickell-bha-jim-best-\">Adam Brickell\u2019s departure from BHA may not be the last after Jim Best case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The timing of the rehearing is the principal source of contention, with the BHA pointing out that the week beginning 19 September was identified months ago as a potentially appropriate time, with all relevant parties asked to keep it clear in their diaries. Since then, however, it has emerged that the BHA\u2019s disciplinary practices and procedures would be reviewed by an independent person, Christopher Quinlan QC, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/27/british-horseracing-authority-bha-publish-quinlan-review-disciplinary-process\" title=\"\">report is to be published on 30 September</a>.</p> <p>The Quinlan review took on even greater significance a week ago, with the news that the BHA\u2019s integrity director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/adam-brickell-bha-jim-best-\" title=\"\">Adam Brickell, would leave the organisation</a> in mid-September. While the authority insists Brickell\u2019s departure has nothing to do with the disaster his department has become this year, it will not go ahead with the necessary reshuffle of responsibility until officials have had a chance to consider the implications of Quinlan\u2019s report.</p> <p>Quinlan could recommend change in the way the BHA appoints disciplinary panel members, the qualifications needed to sit on a panel, the BHA\u2019s approach to disclosure, the use made of expert evidence and the manner in which the BHA presents its cases. He may also have something to say about whether it is appropriate for the BHA to use a QC, Graeme McPherson, who is also regulated by them as a licensed racehorse trainer. McPherson has so far represented the BHA at every stage of the Best case.</p> <p>Best\u2019s solicitors argue that, after months of vexed proceedings, it would be folly for the BHA to rehear the case in the week of 19 September, with the clear possibility that an overhaul of the system may be recommended the following week. They have also raised queries about the suitability of two of the three panel members named by the BHA but have been told the regulator is no longer willing to debate such points and that the only recourse is to take such concerns to the panel itself.</p> <p>If Best presses ahead with his action, it could be heard in the High Court as early as next week. His lawyers would argue that the rehearing has not been arranged in the manner envisaged at the appeal hearing in May, when the regulator\u2019s prediction was: \u201cThis is not a case where anyone would be imposed on Mr Best or where the objective observer would be able to say, \u2018Oh, the BHA has picked its own chairman.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The BHA\u2019s Robin Mounsey said: \u201cFollowing clear direction from the appeal board, which stated that a rehearing of the Jim Best case was in the interests of British racing, the BHA has sought to put together a suitably qualified panel, in accordance with the rules of racing, and meeting the appeal board\u2019s direction that it should be of unquestionable independence.</p> <p>\u201cAs Mr Best chose not to accept our offer to use Sport Resolutions to convene a panel, the BHA has proposed a provisional panel. A process exists which allows the parties to formally raise a challenge to any panel member, a process which, if followed to its conclusion, would see an appeal board ruling on the suitability of the panel. This process is fair and transparent and will ensure the appointment of a suitably qualified and impartial panel.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing of the rehearing has been proposed for several months, with all parties having stated their and their legal advisers availability for dates in September, which they were then asked to hold. Any challenge from Mr Best to the timing and/or final composition of the panel is in the hands of the chair of the disciplinary panel, who will make the necessary directions as to how to proceed.\u201d</p> <p>Best was charged with ordering a jockey to stop two of his horses in December. He was initially found in breach and banned from racing for four years but that verdict was quashed at appeal on the grounds of apparent bias relating to the chairman of the original panel and also because the published reasons were insufficient to support the verdict.</p>",

  "<p>Julian Borger\u2019s analysis of the UK government\u2019s response to a UN request for documents relating to the 1961 crash that killed the second UN secretary general is welcome (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/dag-hammarskjold-crash-ban-ki-moon-un-investigator\" title=\"\">Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld: Ban Ki-moon seeks to appoint investigator for fatal crash</a>, theguardian.com, 25 August). Was it Hilary Benn\u2019s pertinent parliamentary question to the foreign secretary that finally prompted a response after seven months? This delay begs the question whether the FCO should be charged with coordinating searches of government records, given its own abysmal record-keeping history. Guardian readers may remember that its concealment of tens of thousands of records <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/mau-mau-high-court-foreign-office-documents\" title=\"\">came to light five years ago</a> only after the court success of veterans of the&#xa0;Kenyan struggle for independence.</p> <p>The FCO now admits it holds several hundred thousand documents contrary to UK public records legislation. Despite its claimed commitment to full transparency, its history does not inspire confidence. Professor Tony Badger, its independent reviewer charged to oversee the release of hitherto hidden records, recognises that this \u201cnewfound transparency\u201d will not easily sway doubters. We should ask if the UK Freedom of Information Act is fit for purpose, given that its numerous exemptions can encourage public authorities to reject requests for information.</p> <p>The UN legal counsel asked at least twice for confirmation that the \u201csearch across all relevant UK departments\u201d had included the intelligence and security agencies. That question remains unanswered. In April this year, when Vice News tackled the FCO on this, it was told, \u201cit is the longstanding policy of successive British governments not to comment on intelligence matters\u201d. Can the UN\u2019s straightforward query really be considered counter to our national security? <br><strong>Dr Mandy Banton</strong><br><em>Senior research fellow, Institute of Commonwealth Studies</em></p> <p>\u2022 The US and British responses to the efforts by the United Nations to further explore the circumstances of the plane crash at Ndola should be an embarrassment to all citizens in these countries (and elsewhere), who have an interest in seeking clarification of what happened. The reports so far already present sufficient evidence that there is more to it than what the official government responses are willing to admit.</p> <p>This form of denial through non-compliance with legitimate demands for access to information is tantamount to obstruction and sabotages the sincere efforts to bring closure to one of the unsolved cases involving western states and their security operations. Such an arrogant attitude further dents the image of those who claim to be among civilised nations then and now. <br><strong>Henning Melber</strong><br><em>Senior adviser/director emeritus, The&#xa0;Dag&#xa0;Hammarskj\u00f6ld Foundation</em></p> <p>\u2022 Julian Borger\u2019s report shows clearly that the responses from the UK and US governments to the UN\u2019s undersecretary general for legal affairs\u2019 request for added transparency was underwhelming to the point of disrespect. When asked to explain the presence of US Air Force Dakotas at Ndola airport at the time of Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s intended arrival, the US claims \u201cthe USAF has not found any documents or information regarding the presence of any US Air Force aircraft there\u201d, despite copious evidence including witness reports by RAF personnel to the contrary. As Ban Ki-moon asked the question of the US government broadly, not just the USAF, Kafka would have relished such absurdity. The UK\u2019s response does not impress either, taking seven months to restate its earlier opaque stance, unable to release retained information without redactions.</p> <p>Ban Ki-moon describes his pursuit of the truth as a \u201csolemn duty to his illustrious and distinguished predecessor, to the other members of the party accompanying him and to their relatives\u201d. What will his successor do? On behalf of colleagues on every continent, UNA Westminster, which maintains an information service on this issue (<a href=\"http://www.humanrights2008.org.uk/\" title=\"\">www.humanrights2008.org.uk</a>), has asked all candidates if they will agree to pursue the issue with equal courage. I commend Danilo T\u00fcrk and Dr Luk\u0161i\u0107 (since withdrawn) for their confirmation but, after a month, I still wait to hear from the others. Does their delay suggest oversight or herald an innate lack of commitment and courage to confront powerful states which when needed was so memorably manifested by Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld?

  "<p>Ian Traynor, who has died aged 60 of cancer, was the Guardian\u2019s Europe editor and one of the great journalists of the period following the end of the cold war. An outstanding linguist, Ian was a man of the European continent and a passionate believer in the cause of its union, on the basis of both his professional experience and personal essence. In a recent conversation, he and I wondered how we would have reacted to being told in 1991, in the ruins of Vukovar, the town in eastern Croatia devastated by Serbian forces \u2013 which Ian covered unforgettably \u2013 that within 25 years this place would be in the European Union, but Britain would be on its way out.</p> <p>In 2003, Ian was appointed Europe editor, based in Zagreb and later in Brussels, where, said his colleague Simon Tisdall: \u201cHis performance was truly outstanding. No other correspondent could surpass his understanding and contacts.\u201d</p> <p>My first proper meeting with Ian came soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the edifice of communism continued to collapse in Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s Romania. It being Christmas, people tended not to want to go, apart from Ian, myself and our Hungarian deputy foreign editor, Nick Dallman. The time came for me to relieve Ian in Bucharest, so he might cover other parts of the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/28/ian-traynor-european-editor-of-the-guardian-dies-aged-60\">Ian Traynor, Europe editor of the Guardian, dies aged 60</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Journalists were holed up in the plush Intercontinental hotel in the capital \u2013 apart from, typically, the Guardian, which Ian had headquartered in the cheaper, peeling Continental hotel, also home to a Securitate secret service sniper\u2019s nest. I arrived off a night train into the weirdness of slushy Bucharest to find Ian sitting alone in the hotel bar smoking a cigarette.</p> <p>\u201cHi there,\u201d he said in his laconic Scottish timbre, \u201cwelcome to Romania \u2013 it\u2019s fucked, and there\u2019s shooting from the hotel, which is returned; the Washington Post guy left when a bullet hit his bedhead. Also, we have to file from a Bulgarian telex machine with several keys missing. The coffee\u2019s good, would you like one?\u201d Ian imparted this information deadpan; the whole place was like a black-and-white newsreel movie from another time anyway, and had he not devoted his life to journalism, he would have made a magnificent actor.</p> <p>But that was never going to happen. Ian was born in Penilee, south-west Glasgow, the son of Tommy, a toolmaker, and his wife Phemie (Euphemia). When he was 12, the family moved to East Kilbride, south of the city, and Ian went to Holy Cross high school, Hamilton. As a boy, he read George Orwell and mapped out his life in accordance with an acquaintanceship with the writing of James Cameron: he knew exactly what he wanted to be \u2013 the foreign correspondent he became.</p> <p>By the age of 16, Ian was proficient enough in Russian and German to win a place at Glasgow University, from which he dropped out, later taking a place at Aberdeen, where he graduated in modern languages. His best friend there was the eventual BBC correspondent Angus Roxburgh, who remembers discovering, on a Russian faculty camp, that Ian played the guitar: \u201cI was playing Joni Mitchell\u2019s California, a very difficult bit, and Ian just joined in. He was better than me, and we\u2019ve always kept playing together. He had a wonderful style, and loved Dick Gaughan, John Martyn and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/05/bert-jansch\">Bert Jansch</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Ian joined the BBC monitoring unit at Caversham Park, near Reading, translating and analysing media information from the USSR \u2013 different work before the internet, which involved finding sources as well as understanding them.</p> <p>He was among the first to foresee the end of the cold war and, in 1987, Ian\u2019s rare talent was spotted by the Guardian\u2019s foreign editor, Martin Woollacott, who recruited him to the paper\u2019s foreign subeditors\u2019 desk. Woollacott soon dispatched his protege to cover the stories himself: the Solidarity strikes in Poland during 1988, then the fall of the Berlin Wall. Thereafter, as East Europe correspondent and editor, Ian sailed and navigated the currents and rip-tides of events across the continent.</p> <p>When the euphoria of reunified Europe crashed into the nightmare of post-Yugoslavia, Ian was one of what became the \u201cGuardian triangle\u201d of reporters (usually two of us on the ground), with Maggie O\u2019Kane and myself \u2013 later supplemented by Julian Borger.</p> <p>By the war\u2019s end in 1995, Ian had based himself in Vienna, but now moved first to Bonn and then Berlin when it became Germany\u2019s capital once again, with the title of Central Europe correspondent. From there, Ian guided his readers through the way in which the organism of a newly expanded EU evolved around the German powerhouse.</p> <p>In 1999, Ian moved to Moscow. He charted the rise of Vladimir Putin and, as so often, was first to ring the warning bells. However, writing in 2000 about Putin\u2019s redrawing of the map of Russia, Ian could not resist observing, in apparently deadly earnest, that: \u201cMr Putin\u2019s writ does not run in Bashkortostan.\u201d</p> <p>Ian wrote straight, however contorted the story, and lucidly. \u201cHe was the opposite of a sensationalist,\u201d said Roxburgh. He could read a situation with uncanny sagacity; his editor for many years, Paul Webster, recalled him as \u201ca rare combination of intellectual and foot-in-the-door hack. He was a very brave man but there was no trace of bravado \u2013 he felt it was his duty to provide testimony.\u201d</p> <p>Roxburgh remembered: \u201cThis figure arriving at our compound in Afghanistan, having walked across the Panjshir Valley for three days without food or water, on the verge of collapse \u2013 I made him a cup of sweet tea. He was tenacious, to put it mildly.\u201d</p> <p>Ian\u2019s devotion to \u201cthe story\u201d made him the most collegial reporter of all, as eager to help other people \u2013 including me on many occasions, even the opposition \u2013 write good narrative as to write it himself, a rare quality. Tisdall recalled him as \u201ca slightly self-effacing figure, not given to self-promotion or self-advertisement in a media world where willingness to blow one\u2019s own trumpet became, increasingly, the principal measure of individual worth. Perhaps this is one reason why his work was not sufficiently recognised in terms of prizes and gongs. Another was his plain-spoken intolerance of bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>The never-dull press corps when we were in Bosnia had at its kernel an antagonism between Ian and a particular expert who would argue that intervention against the Bosnian Serbs would set the region ablaze. Ian disagreed, and when Nato began its tardy, limited air strikes in 1995, the Serb leader, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, capitulated immediately. Ian, vindicated, leaned across a table and told his colleague: \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be a prophet, you got to get it right.\u201d</p> <p>On another occasion, his drollness surfaced when Ian and I were driving through yet another incinerated town, levelled into the dust of its own charred masonry, in horrified silence \u2013 until Ian leaned back in his seat, staring out, and said quietly: \u201cWhat is it the Serbs have got against roofs?\u201d</p> <p>Ian\u2019s son, Paul, described his father as \u201ca man of many words unless he wanted to be a man of few. If he didn\u2019t need to say more than he had to, he wouldn\u2019t. Personal back and forths after months of incommunicado would usually consist of \u2018Arite, what\u2019s up?\u2019 \u2018Nae bad\u2019. Not that he didn\u2019t want to talk, that was just his style. And he was fundamentally unaware of the sheer admiration that family, friends and most colleagues felt for him.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of Ian\u2019s career came three severe blows to the European dream. First, there was the crisis that pitched radical Greece against a Euro-monolith, which Ian saw as a \u201cdisaster for Athens and colossal failure for the EU\u201d. Then, as his health began to fail, the arrival of what felt like the future of the planet on Europe\u2019s doorstep in the form of refugees from Syria\u2019s carnage and Africa\u2019s climate crisis. Ian was furious at nation states disguising their own failures as that of the EU. Finally there was Brexit, though Ian was by then too ill for us to feel \u2013 or read \u2013 his disdain and disgust.</p> <p>Ian had met his first wife, Jean Forsyth, while they were both students at Aberdeen. They married in 1982, and had two sons, Paul and Martin. Jean was with Ian during his final days. Their union ended in divorce and in 2003 Ian married Ivanka Anici\u0107, whom he met in Croatia. They had a son, Sean. Ivanka died in 2011, and Ian is survived by his three sons.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Traynor, journalist, born 11 November 1955; died 27 August 2016</p> <ul> <li><em>Comments for this obituary are being pre-moderated prior to publication.</em><br></li> </ul>",

Mayors from the rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains party and from the far-right Front National are keeping their bans in place, insisting that the Villeneuve-Loubet case does not apply to them.</p> <p>The burkini bans \u2013 which are now seen as illegal \u2013 pose a major problem to the French state, which is responsible for making sure the rule of law is respected. In theory, the state could now instruct local prefects to take action to force mayors to withdraw the bans. Human rights groups have also said they will pursue the towns through courts.</p> <p>The Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, who had caused divisions in his party by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/french-pm-supports-local-bans-burkinis\">supporting the mayors\u2019 bans</a>, insisted that the political debate on burkinis must continue.

He is against a nationwide law against burkinis, saying it would be illegal and anti-constitutional, and that it was pointless to push for a new law \u201camid media agitation\u201d. He told Europe 1 radio that politicians should stop using inflammatory rhetoric to \u201cthrow oil on the fire\u201d.</p> <p> Holding a rally west of Paris on Saturday, Jupp\u00e9 nonetheless proposed creating a special accord between the state and Muslim leaders to lay out clear rules for respecting French secularism.</p> <p> \u201cIt is legitimate to ask them to have a knowledge of the principles of the organisation of the republican state, especially French-style secularism,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The short-term burkini bans, which began to be issued by mayors at the end of July, have sparked a heated political row about the French principle of <em>la\u00efcit\u00e9</em> \u2013 secularism built on the strict separation of church and state \u2013 amid accusations by rights groups that politicians are twisting and distorting the principle for political gain, and using it to deliberately target Muslims following a series of terrorist attacks.<br></p> <p>Following reports of some women being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-burkini-ban-row-escalates-clothing-incident-woman-police-nice-beach\">stopped by police</a> for simply wearing a headscarf and loose clothing while standing on the beach, controversy has grown.</p> <p>Beno\u00eet Hamon, a former Socialist government minister seeking the left\u2019s presidential nomination, said on Sunday that the burkini debate was \u201ctargeting Muslims once again\u201d and criticised Valls for supporting bans. </p>",
  "<p>Any shift the public may detect in immigration proposals advanced by Donald Trump is a figment of the imagination, top Trump surrogates said in a coordinated maneuver on Sunday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-iowa-republican-red-state\">Welcome to Iowa, where Trump's purple patch could turn a blue state red</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a week in which multiple conflicting statements by the candidate drew <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/439336/trumps-amnesty-election-loser\">expressions</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/768663835377078273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">concern</a> from the anti-immigration right that Trump was softening on the issue, the Trump campaign spoke with one voice: Trump\u2019s position has not changed.</p> <p>Yet no Trump aide would say on Sunday that Trump still proposes, as he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/politics/donald-trump-deportation-force-debate-immigration/\">did last fall</a>, to follow through on perhaps his most radical suggestion, to use a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to eject the estimated 11 to 12 million undocumented migrants living in the United States.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s promise through the primary campaign season of a quick expulsion of millions of people helped him strike a contrast with competitors, who backed more inflected reform policies, and establish his bona fides as an extreme change agent.</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">polls in the presidential race mostly static</a> over the last month, however, and a quickly diminishing store of days until the election, the candidate and his advisers appear to have recognized that moderation on issues such as immigration may be necessary to compete with Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>A few recent, decent polling results in a miserable month of numbers have given Trump backers hope that there is still time to turn his campaign around. A Morning Consult survey <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2016/08/28/trump-gains-ground-clinton-black-voters-still-wary/\">released</a> on Sunday found Clinton leading by only three points, 43-40, in a head-to-head matchup. The same poll found her ahead by nine points at the start of the month.</p> <p>No such tightening was visible in polling averages, however, which have steadily <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">described</a> a Clinton lead of between six and eight points since the conclusion of the national conventions. This squares with a Quinnipiac <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us08252016_U88mxwn.pdf\">survey last week</a> finding that 90% of likely voters have already made up their minds.</p> <p>The defibrillator now attached to the Trump campaign is in some ways plain to see. In the past two weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">the campaign leadership has been remade</a>, the candidate has redoubled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">outreach to non-white voters</a> and the campaign has spent its first millions on TV ads in battleground states.</p> <p>A shift by Trump on immigration, particularly given the influence of Hispanic voters in a number of battleground states, would seem of a piece with those changes.

This sense had been missing for a very long time, so like pouring cold water on a hot glass, it was something of a shock to the old system. Some of us are delicate flowers, you know? We don\u2019t take this sort of thing well, and alarming events like this could do some real damage. </p> <p><strong>Perhaps recognising there\u2019s comfort in predictability,</strong> the big clubs of the land have started this season in historically familiar form, with the top of the table taking on a comfortingly tedious shape: two clubs have three wins from three so far, and if Manchester City can beat West Ham this afternoon they will join Manchester United and Chelsea on maximum points. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Wonderful, boring, uncompetitive comfort.</p> <p><strong>Joe Hart won\u2019t be playing today, </strong>and neither will be his replacement Claudio Bravo. But Pep Guardiola\u2019s squad management issues don\u2019t stop there. The chances are that Yaya Toure won\u2019t be in the squad today, while in the future when Leroy Sane and Ilkay Gundogan are ready to go, there will be more shuffling going on. Guardiola addressed this last week:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I cannot say every weekend why you don\u2019t play. You don\u2019t play because I decide to play another one, but I try to help them. In my career I help few players or enough players but [some] they criticise you a lot to the media. They go to the media because they did not play. That is the only reason. So when they speak it is [like when] Pep doesn\u2019t play Shaqiri.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to have only 18 players. It would be a dream because everyone is happy but unfortunately there are injuries, we have to compete every three days. In Germany, they have a winter break, here not. We have all the competitions here: four; so many games and we need a bigger squad. But always we are polite with the players.</p> <p>\u201cWe respect their careers but sometimes I take the decisions and the players who don\u2019t play, they are not happy they are not playing but they are not happy for one reason, they feel: \u2018The coach don\u2019t love me.\u2019 They don\u2019t feel loved.</p> <p>\u201cThat is the reason why. Players [don\u2019t] understand: \u2018Why the coach love this guy and don\u2019t love me? Why?\u2019 It is true, you deserve to play. I said many times you deserve to play. All of them, 30 players, you deserve to play. Nineteen players don\u2019t play, so tell me how you handle that? It is impossible. Especially if you have many relationship minutes, training sessions with them to develop, to understand what you want to do.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to communicate so that they believe: \u2018I am going to play because I created a [good impression],\u2019 and that is the goal.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Meanwhile,</strong> at West Ham...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davidgold/status/769797374222958592\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Don&#39;t go to Church. dg</p>&mdash; David Gold (@davidgold) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidgold/status/769797374222958592\">August 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 16.00 BST</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-28T13:56:15.043Z\">at 2.56pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Roberts also arranges bespoke visits by the dogs if a child will be at court on a day when the animals are not due to visit. </p> <p>Chelmsford is the only court in the country to welcome therapy dogs, but six months into the scheme, Roberts regards it as such a success that she is planning to introduce it to Ipswich county and family court.</p> <p>\u201cFor many people, coming to court is the most stressful experience in their lives,\u201d says Roberts, stroking the sleek head of Ella, a black, flat-haired retriever, who is visiting the judge in her retiring room before the official day begins. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for us who work in the system to lose touch with how stressful it is but litigants are here because the future of their children is being determined, or their marriage, or where they\u2019re going to live.</p> <p>\u201cIn the US, they bring llamas and alpacas into care homes but I\u2019m not going to attempt to bring in anything larger than a dog.\u201d She pauses and gazes at Ella, who stares back with total canine devotion: \u201cHaving said that, I would love to bring in a donkey. I love donkeys too. But no, I think I will stop at dogs.\u201d</p> <p>So-called \u201ccourthouse facility dogs\u201d are common in America, Canada and Chile, where they help children in all legal settings, as well as crime victims and witnesses, and those appearing in front of the drug and mental health courts. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/04/new-rescue-dog-save-my-life-health\">My rescue dog is saving my life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Roberts admits there is no tangible evidence as to the scheme\u2019s impact. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody could say if there\u2019s any concrete result,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a suggestion from Cafcass [the body which represents children in family court cases] that we should assess the scheme but I don\u2019t want to do that: I don\u2019t want to make it all scientific.

  "<p>Early on the morning of Tuesday 3 September 1940, two single-masted French fishing boats, La Mascotte and the Rose du Carmel, slipped across the Channel and approached the coast of Kent. When they were a few hundred yards from the headland of Dungeness, four men clambered from the vessels into a pair of rowing boats, and made their way silently to shore.</p> <p>The four were Carl Meier, 23, a&#xa0;Dutch-born Nazi party member who had spent a little time in Birmingham before the war; Charles van den Kieboom, 25, a Dutch-Japanese dual national; Sjoerd Pons, 28, a Dutchman; and a 25-year-old who described himself as German and called himself Jose Waldberg.</p> <p>They were agents of the <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/germany/abwehr.htm\" title=\"\">Abwehr</a>, the German military intelligence service, and their mission was to reconnoitre England\u2019s south coast for the invasion they had been led to believe was just weeks away. Their supplies of corned beef, baked beans and chocolate were to last for around 10 days, and the small radio transmitters they had brought with them contained valves that quickly burned out.</p> <p>Officially, they were part of Operation Lena, the codename for the&#xa0;Abwehr\u2019s contribution to Hitler\u2019s invasion plan. Unofficially, their spymasters considered their mission to be so hazardous that they called it the <em>Himmelfahrt</em>: the ascension to heaven.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just 13 days after Winston Churchill came to power, the Treachery Act became law. It carried only one sentence: death</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The tale of what happened to these men has been told before. But one sad and salient element of their story has remained hidden, buried for years in the archives of MI5 in poignant letters that have only now come to light after being transferred to the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK National Archives</a> at Kew, south-west London.</p> <p>Meier was the first to be captured, after he walked the short distance to the village of Lydd and strolled into the Rising Sun pub to ask landlady Mabel Cole for a bottle of cider. Cole was immediately wary of this young man with a foreign accent, who was unaware that he could not buy alcohol in a British pub at 9am. She was even more suspicious when Meier struck his head on the pub\u2019s traditional low ceiling as he walked out. The police were called, and within hours all four would-be spies had been rounded up.</p> <p>During six weeks at MI5\u2019s interrogation centre, Camp 020, at Ham, in the south-western suburbs of London, all four were persuaded to make lengthy statements. On 24 October, they were charged under the Treachery Act, brought before magistrates at Bow Street court under conditions of complete secrecy, and told they would&#xa0;stand trial at the Old Bailey the following month.</p> <p>To describe the Treachery Act as having been rushed on to the statute books would be an understatement.</p> <p>When Churchill entered Downing Street on 10 May that year, he could not&#xa0;accept that the Germans\u2019 rapid victories across Norway and western Europe could be attributed solely to superior weaponry, tactics and fighting spirit; there must, he concluded, be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column\" title=\"\">fifth columnists</a> at work behind the lines. He was also convinced that fifth columnists must be at work in Britain, and wanted them rooted out and destroyed. On being told that any British nationals among them could be&#xa0;prosecuted for treason, but that foreigners probably could not, the new&#xa0;prime minister demanded a new law \u2013 immediately.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28c3d3205a036d801807e7ca30bccffce3438f11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28c3d3205a036d801807e7ca30bccffce3438f11/0_83_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Winston Churchill in Downing Street, 1941\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winston Churchill in Downing Street, 1941.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet News Archive/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 23 May, the Treachery Act, which&#xa0;outlawed conduct \u201cdesigned or&#xa0;likely to give assistance to the naval,&#xa0;military or air operations of the enemy\u201d had passed through parliament and received royal assent. It carried only one sentence: death.</p> <p>When the trial of the four spies opened on 19 November, the prosecution asked the judge to make an order under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act banning \u201cdisclosure of any information with regard to any part of the proceedings\u201d. By lunchtime, reporters supping in the Bell Tavern, 200 yards from the Old Bailey, in <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/why-fleet-street-is-still-british-journalisms-spiritual-home/\" title=\"\">Fleet Street</a>, were aware that something was afoot in court one, but could not get in. They also knew that they would not get any story past the censors at the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/inf3.htm\" title=\"\">Ministry of Information</a>.</p> <p>Waldberg surprised the court by pleading guilty. Meier, Kieboom and Pons denied the offence. Pons told the court that he had assisted the Abwehr under duress: he had been threatened with incarceration in a concentration camp after being caught smuggling gems from Holland to Germany, and insisted he had no intention of doing anything to assist the Germans on arrival in England.</p> <p>After a trial that lasted four days, the&#xa0;jury took less than 90 minutes to convict Meier and Kieboom, who were&#xa0;sentenced to death, along with Waldberg. The jury accepted Pons\u2019s defence, however. He was acquitted, set free, and immediately detained once more as an enemy alien.</p> <p>In due course, Waldberg and Meier were informed that they were to be hanged at Pentonville prison in north London at 9am on 10 December. Kieboom was to hang a week later. Still, not a word about the case had appeared in the press or been uttered by the BBC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d095cf609d5a674b88c89e51c42f6864e0b48541\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d095cf609d5a674b88c89e51c42f6864e0b48541/28_12_194_297/194.jpg\" alt=\"Charles van den Kieboom, who was hanged as a German spy\" width=\"194\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles van den Kieboom, who was hanged as a German spy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A week before the first executions, Sir Alexander Maxwell, the donnish permanent under-secretary at the Home Office, began having serious misgivings about the way in which the&#xa0;three men had been prosecuted and sentenced to death in complete secrecy. He set out his concerns in a confidential letter to Viscount Swinton, the head of the Security Executive, a&#xa0;body established by Churchill to manage MI5, and to root out the supposed fifth columnists. \u201cPublic opinion and public criticism is the most important safeguard for the proper administration of justice,\u201d he&#xa0;wrote. \u201cTo carry out sentences of this kind in secrecy is contrary to all our traditions.\u201d</p> <p>Not that Maxwell was going to suggest that any future spy trials should be open to the press and public; rather, he wanted to be sure that if such secrecy were to be the cause of any future problems, it would be Swinton and MI5 that would take the blame, and not the Home Office and his boss Herbert Morrison, the home secretary. \u201cThe home secretary \u2026 may at any time be asked by his colleagues or perhaps by the Lord Chief Justice whether he is satisfied that these unusual steps are really necessary in the interests of the defence of the realm,\u201d he explained to Swinton. \u201cI think he ought to have on the Home Office records a letter from you on the subject. The home secretary should be safeguarded by a full statement from the Security Service.\u201d</p> <p>Swinton\u2019s reply two days later explained that some enemy agents had already been \u201cturned\u201d by MI5, and played back against their Abwehr masters. Those whose capture members of the public had witnessed \u2013 or who refused to play the game \u2013 would be prosecuted under the Treachery Act.</p> <p>In time, this deception operation, known as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/mi5_ww2_01.shtml\" title=\"\">Double Cross</a>, would be seen as one of MI5\u2019s greatest achievements, and it would become a vital part of the allied strategic deception that also relied heavily on the code-breaking efforts of <a href=\"https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/\" title=\"\">Bletchley Park</a>. Agents who were turned would send their Abwehr handlers a careful blend of correct and incorrect intelligence. They would also ask for reinforcements, with new code books and radios, and plenty of cash, and these men would also be captured. Before long, German intelligence was unwittingly financing the Double Cross operation that was being directed against it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/botched-nazi-spy-mission-sabotage-germany\" title=\"\">So great a failure was Operation Lena</a> that one historian has recently concluded that anti-Nazis among the upper reaches of the Abwehr must have sabotaged it.</p> <p>Swinton explained to Maxwell that Double Cross was vital to the war effort. \u201cThe combined work of all the&#xa0;services has built up, and is continually adding to, a great structure of intelligence and counter-espionage. A single disclosure, affecting one individual, might send the whole building toppling. Even in passing sentence, a judge may inadvertently err.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Maxwell had received Swinton\u2019s explanation, however, it was&#xa0;becoming clear to both the Home Office and MI5 that there was a serious problem with one of the secret convictions. At Pentonville, Waldberg was insisting his name was not Jose Waldberg at all, and that he was not German. His name, he insisted, was Henri Lassudry, and he was Belgian.</p> <p>Initially, MI5 was inclined to brush aside these claims as the desperate fabrications of a condemned man. The agency\u2019s records show, however, that when interrogating Waldberg about his claims, a French-speaking interpreter was used, as the prisoner\u2019s French was excellent \u2013 \u201clike a native speaker\u201d \u2013 while his German was weak. Furthermore, when \u201cWaldberg\u201d was given the chance to write a number of final letters to his family, he wrote to his parents, a&#xa0;Mons &amp; Mme Lassudry, at an address in Rue des Colonies, Brussels, and a&#xa0;girlfriend, Helene Ceuppens, in nearby Ixelles.</p> <p>These letters contain an explanation for the plea that had so surprised the Old Bailey. Lassudry complained that his barrister, a man called Blundell, had advised him to enter a guilty plea, without informing him that he would be sentenced to death as a consequence. Lassudry thought he would have a chance to explain himself to the judge. Had he done so, he would have entered the same defence that had saved Pons from the gallows. He was acting under duress, having been a prisoner of the Gestapo, who threatened to arrest his father if he did not agree to undertake the spying mission to England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8c2470004dbed0a389eeca72ef63060a8c80246\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8c2470004dbed0a389eeca72ef63060a8c80246/0_0_2544_2037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A letters relating to the case of Henri Lassudry, AKA Jose Waldberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A letter relating to the case of Henri Lassudry, AKA Jose Waldberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Archives in Kew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the event, he had no chance to speak to the judge, and his sentencing hearing lasted just three minutes. \u201cJ\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 tromp\u00e9 l\u00e2chement,\u201d Lassudry protested: I have been rottenly tricked.</p> <p>In his final letter, Lassudry told his mother: \u201cGod knows when you will get this letter. Maybe in a year, or even two.\u201d There was a postscript: \u201cI shall die on Tuesday December 10th at 9 o\u2019clock. Your loving Henri.\u201d</p> <p>A senior MI5 officer, Colonel William Hinchley Cooke, went to see the attorney general, Sir Donald Somervell, to inquire whether the belated discovery of the true name, nationality and motivation of one of the men who was due to die in a few days\u2019 time might, in any way, call for a stay of his execution. \u201cI gather,\u201d Hinchley Cooke recorded rather laconically in the agency\u2019s files, \u201cthat he thinks it does not.\u201d</p> <p>Meier went to the gallows first, followed minutes later by Lassudry, who was executed under the name Jose Waldberg. At 9.25am, a two-paragraph communiqu\u00e9 written by MI5 informed Fleet Street and the BBC that the two men had been \u201capprehended shortly after their surreptitious arrival in this country\u201d, with a wireless set and a large sum of money; that they had been tried and convicted, and hanged that morning. The communiqu\u00e9 added: \u201cEditors are asked not to press for any additional facts or to institute inquiries.\u201d</p> <p>Seven days later a second notice announced the execution of Kieboom. No mention was made of Pons.</p> <p>Lassudry\u2019s family never received his letters. The Home Office handed them instead to MI5, along with a covering letter that said the condemned man\u2019s criticisms of the English justice system \u201cwould prejudice the letters from our point of view, if there is any question of forwarding them to their destinations\u201d.</p> <p>MI5 filed the letters away and, in 2005, they were quietly deposited at Kew, where they lay for years, apparently unnoticed. By that time, several histories of Operation Lena, and the capture, interrogation and execution of \u201cJose Waldberg\u201d and the other invasion spies had already been written.</p> <p>Does Lassudry\u2019s fate amount to a miscarriage of justice? There is no doubt that he was working for the Abwehr: he had sent three brief radio messages from the beach at Dungeness before his capture. On the other hand, it appears likely that the members of the Old Bailey jury who had acquitted Pons \u2013 to their enormous credit, given that the nation believed an invasion to be imminent \u2013 would also have shown mercy to Lassudry, had they heard his story.</p> <p>Between 1940 and 1946, 19 spies and saboteurs were prosecuted under the Treachery Act and executed. A 20th spy \u2013 a junior Portuguese diplomat \u2013 was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment following the intervention of the Portuguese government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90cd76abdfb4099c0552ab4ad68d5988e51aafd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90cd76abdfb4099c0552ab4ad68d5988e51aafd1/0_0_2662_3180/837.jpg\" alt=\"Letter relating to the case of Carl Meier and Jose Waldeberg.\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Letter relating to the case of Carl Meier and Jose Waldeberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Archives in Kew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As each case came to court, senior MI5 officers became increasingly concerned that the <em>in camera</em> procedure being used at the Old Bailey was too insecure. They were also troubled by the requirements that notices of execution be posted on prison gates for 24 hours before a hanging, and that a coroner, sitting with a jury, must conduct an inquest into the death of the hanged man. The remedy, one MI5 officer suggested, would be to court martial spies at military establishments and then shoot them. There would be no prying journalists, no need for execution notices, and no coroner\u2019s juries.</p> <p>The Home Office was uncomfortable about the prospect of mounting courts martial for foreign nationals who were not members of any armed forces, and resisted the idea. However, one spy was dealt with in this manner after he was found to be a former soldier and a&#xa0;reservist in the German armed forces.</p> <p>Josef Jakobs, a 42-year-old dentist, had been captured in February 1941 after breaking his leg when he parachuted into Huntingdonshire. After a&#xa0;two-day hearing at Chelsea barracks in London, he was driven to an <a href=\"http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/the_tower.htm\" title=\"\">indoor shooting range at the Tower of London</a>, where he was strapped to a chair and shot by an eight-man firing squad from the Scots Guards.</p> <p>The official communiqu\u00e9 that announced the manner in which Jakobs met his death caused a sensation in Fleet Street. Reporters from the Daily Express tracked down people in Huntingdonshire who had witnessed the spy\u2019s capture, and the newspaper told the official censor that it intended to publish and be damned. Swinton, Maxwell and Somervell met, and agreed that the press should perhaps be given a little more information about the secret prosecutions and executions, to ensure there was no further breach.</p> <p>The Treachery Act was suspended in 1946, and repealed a few years later. During the war, MI5 could never be sure exactly how many of the Abwehr\u2019s agents had been captured and either prosecuted and executed, or turned and run under British control. After the war, the agency established that just one Abwehr agent had operated without detection, and he had shot himself in an air raid shelter in Cambridge after running out of money and food.</p> <p>The \u201cgreat structure of intelligence and counter-espionage\u201d that Swinton had described in his letter to Maxwell, and the wider allied campaign of strategic deception of which it had been a part, had been a remarkable success; possibly one of the finest in the agency\u2019s history.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Ian Cobain\u2019s study of official secrecy in the UK, </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/history-thieves.html\" title=\"\"><em>The History Thieves</em></a><em>, is published by Portobello Books on 1 September.</em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cCar companies are finally realising that what they sell is just a big computer you sit in,\u201d says Kevin Tighe, a senior systems engineer at the security testing firm Bugcrowd. </p> <p>It\u2019s meant to be a reassuring statement: proof that the world\u2019s major vehicle manufacturers are finally coming to terms with their responsibilities to customers, and taking the security of vehicles seriously.</p> <p>But given where Tighe and I are talking, it\u2019s hard not to be slightly uneasy about the idea that it\u2019s normal to sit inside a massive computer and trust it with your life. We\u2019re meeting at Defcon, the world\u2019s largest hacking conference, just outside the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/13/autonomous-cars-self-driving-hack-mikko-hypponen-sxsw\">car-hacking</a> village\u201d, a recent addition to the convention\u2019s lineup, where enthusiasts meet to trade tips on how to mess about with those same computers for fun and profit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"866c97dd36b42cf737dbc7013265aee61ea40bed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/866c97dd36b42cf737dbc7013265aee61ea40bed/241_928_2316_1390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An autonomous self-driving vehicle picks up people during a demonstration in Singapore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A self-driving vehicle picks up passengers during a demonstration in Singapore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The village, one of a number of breakout areas (others include biohacking, lock picking and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/21/facebook-scammers-safety-cybersecurity\">social engineering</a>\u201d \u2013 the art and science of talking people into doing stuff they shouldn\u2019t), was instituted last year. Also in 2015, two researchers, from the security consultancy IOActive and Twitter, turned car hacking from a vaguely theoretical pursuit into one with terrifying consequences.</p> <p>At that year\u2019s Defcon, Twitter\u2019s Charlie Miller and IOActive\u2019s Chris Valasek demonstrated they were able to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/21/jeep-owners-urged-update-car-software-hackers-remote-control\">wirelessly take over a Jeep</a>. They used a laptop connected to the internet miles from the vehicle to seize control of it, cutting the brakes and transmission at the flick of a switch.<br></p> <p>It sparked a worldwide recall for the affected cars \u2013 which included much of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s range. It also exposed serious problems with how the car companies planned to handle such software flaws. Even though the hack could be executed remotely, it could only be fixed with physical access to the car, forcing Fiat Chrysler to post USB keys to affected owners, or ask them to bring their cars in for maintenance. Posting USB keys brought its own problems: plugging an untrusted USB key into anything, whether car or computer, carries serious risks. It\u2019s also hard for anyone to easily verify that a drive received in the post is malware-free.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-drivers-stunt-video-joshua-brown\">Tesla drivers post viral, self-driving 'stunts' using autopilot technology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some fixes were easier to carry out, though. Speaking at this year\u2019s Black Hat conference in Las Vegas (think Defcon but in suits, taking place a few days earlier), Valasek and Miller \u2013 now both employed as researchers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> \u2013 revealed that one of the more effective changes <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/fiat-chrysler\">Fiat Chrysler</a> made was simply asking Sprint, the cellular provider that connected all the cars to the net, to block all incoming traffic.</p> <p>\u201cThis made the vulnerability kind of go away,\u201d Miller said, as Valasek pointed out that the cars never really needed the incoming connections in the first place. The service had just been kept open because no one had thought to turn it off.</p> <p>That\u2019s good, because if it was still open, the situation would be much worse today than it was last year. Although the Jeep hack was spectacular, it came with severe limitations. The pair had managed to use a bug in the car\u2019s entertainment system, which was connected to the net, to tunnel through to the supposedly secure internal network, which the various components of the car use to talk to each other, called the Can bus.</p> <p>But simply having access to the network didn\u2019t mean they were able to seize control of the car. Without the ability to stop the car sending its own messages, the hackers\u2019 own commands were usually overruled by the car\u2019s system, or simply recognised as a conflict that caused the car to err on the side of safety and turn off the feature altogether.</p> <p>In 2015, they had managed to tackle the problem by forcing the car into diagnostic mode, which allowed them far greater control. But most cars built since 2015 disable diagnostic mode when the car is in motion, meaning that the hacks can only be started when the car is travelling less than 5mph. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice parlour trick,\u201d said Miller. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it affects safety.\u201d</p> <p>So the pair\u2019s past year has been spent working out whether that safety feature can be turned off. Bad news: it can.</p> <p>The trick lies in working out how the various components talk to each other, and what they expect to hear over the Can bus. \u201cThere are times you can have conflicting messages and the car will do what you want,\u201d Miller said. For instance, the way cruise control works in the Jeep means that, rather than sending a message saying \u201ccruise control is on/off\u201d, the bus instead says \u201cthe button to turn cruise control on is/is not pressed\u201d. So when the message is inserted into the feed saying \u201cthe button to turn cruise control on is pressed\u201d, it will enable cruise control without sparking a conflict internally (a breakthrough demonstrated with video of a panicky Valasek sitting in the passenger seat of an otherwise empty car rapidly accelerating to 40mph on a deserted rural road).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5d8166a3af0ab3340200cf0192ea0a2ef9ea62d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5d8166a3af0ab3340200cf0192ea0a2ef9ea62d/0_116_3475_2085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google self-driving car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Lexus SUV equipped with Google self-driving sensors during a media preview of the firm\u2019s prototype vehicle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For other controls, such as direct control of the accelerometer or brakes, that simple approach doesn\u2019t work. But after analysing how the system determined conflicts, the pair found a simple workaround. Each message sent on the Can bus has a number, which increments by one each time. If the system receives three or more messages with the same number, it declares a fault and throws the whole thing out.</p> <p>But what the pair discovered is that if the attacker\u2019s message is sent first, with the correct counter, then the real message gets ignored. And if the next message is one further incremented, then the system never fully goes into lockdown, allowing the attacker to control the car: they can turn the steering wheel, hit the gas or slam on the brakes at any speed. Testing that one on the same rural road ended with the pair losing control and crashing into a ditch.</p> <p>There\u2019s one saving grace to all this though: ever since Fiat Chrysler fixed the hole disclosed last year, such attacks can only be done with physical access to the car. That\u2019s the company\u2019s response to the research: \u201cWhile we admire their creativity, it appears that the researchers have not identified any new remote way to compromise a 2014 Jeep Cherokee or other FCA US vehicles,\u201d it said. It\u2019s true, but the pair warn others not to dismiss their findings that quickly: if they hadn\u2019t found the earlier bug, then the cars would still be open to just this sort of attack, and it would be much more damaging.</p> <p>\u201cAll these attacks would have worked if you had a remote attack,\u201d said Valasek. \u201cIt would have worked in 2015.\u201d Valasek and Miller offered some simple fixes that would make doing what they did much harder: code-signing would make reprogramming the onboard computers much harder, while better intrusion detection would throw up alarms earlier in the process, and not be fooled by simply incrementing a counter.</p> <p>But for Tighe, the success of Valasek and Miller is proof of the opposite: not that the car\u2019s internal processes should be more suspicious, but that it\u2019s in their nature to be naive and open. Speed, he says, is of the essence in these systems. If the brake pedal says brake, it\u2019s important that the brake pads not waste time checking that the message really came from the brake pedal: instead, they need to get on with the important business of braking.</p> <p>Tighe thinks the solution lies in ensuring that unauthorised users cannot send messages on the Can bus in the first place, not wasting valuable time encrypting, signing or reverifying messages sent between the internal processes. It\u2019s an approach he says works well for military hardware, where the time penalty is even fiercer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/self-driving-taxis-roll-out-in-singapore-beating-uber-to-it\">Self-driving taxis roll out in Singapore - beating Uber to it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s also one that necessarily involves putting all your eggs in one basket, however. No one thinks the car\u2019s internal computers should be completely open to outsiders. The question is how much damage they should be able to do if they can find a way in anyway.</p> <p>Of course, that assumes that access to the car\u2019s internal computers is needed for a malicious attacker to do harm. Another group of researchers at Defcon presented their own form of car hacking which uses the very smartness of modern automobiles as the weapon.</p> <p>Three researchers, from China\u2019s Zhejiang University and the internet security company Qihoo 360, took aim at the many sensors that modern cars are equipped with \u2013 particularly those with automation features. \u201cThe reliability of the sensors directly affects the reliability of autonomous driving,\u201d said Chen Yan. The death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk\">Joshua Brown</a>, whose Tesla hit the side of a truck while the car\u2019s autopilot mode was engaged, underscores that: the car failed to see the white truck against the bright sky and ploughed into it.</p> <p>Chen and his fellow researchers showed that artificially creating a similar situation might not be as hard as it should be. The three subjected a Tesla Model S and an Audi equipped with self-parking features to a battery of attacks designed to leave them blinded in all their senses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70d0711df5ee63efc8e012dc7e085a43863fbc8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70d0711df5ee63efc8e012dc7e085a43863fbc8f/59_0_2986_1792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The wreck of the fatal Tesla crash, which killed its driver, Joshua Brown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wreck of the Tesla crash in which Joshua Brown died.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Self-driving cars use a number of sensors, for various purposes. Ultrasound is used, like a bat\u2019s echolocation, for determining the distance of close objects (useful for making sure you don\u2019t hit a wall when reversing), while millimetre-wave radio is the core part of the radar component that lets the car map out the stretch of road immediately ahead of it (so you don\u2019t end up rear-ending someone while using adaptive cruise control).</p> <p>Those sensors, though, can be jammed, spoofed or muted, and cars don\u2019t tend to react well to them. Jamming involves drowning the sensors out with your own data; spoofing tricks the sensor by blasting your own responses at it; while muting involves applying the same technique as used in noise-cancelling headphones to diminish the power of the original signal.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the car manufacturers, the more complex techniques often are not necessary. Simply playing a loud enough ultrasound burst to drown out the echolocation, for instance, is remarkably effective. Rather than going into a failsafe mode and assuming that there\u2019s an obstacle immediately in front, both the Audi and Tesla instead assume that there\u2019s nothing for the next half-kilometre. Bravely or foolishly, one of the team demonstrated that fact by standing next to the car as it was driving towards the jammer. The car hit him, albeit slowly.</p> <p>A similar, if more complex, attack worked on the radar. The team built a machine for generating radar interference, and were able to make a car simply disappear from the Tesla\u2019s autopilot view. Importantly, neither attack led to a failsafe state: the car simply assumed there was nothing to see where it couldn\u2019t see anything.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/driverless-cars-taxis-cabs-uber\">Take it from a cab driver: your most memorable ride won't be driverless | Eugene Salomon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSensors should be designed with security in mind,\u201d said Jianhao Liu, another of the three researchers, \u201cso they should always think about intentional attacks, especially when the sensor is going to play a very important role in self-driving cars.\u201d</p> <p>Following the collision in May, Tesla pointed out that its autopilot feature was not intended for fully autonomous driving. Drivers should be ready to take the wheel at any time. The company has <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hackers-fool-tesla-ss-autopilot-hide-spoof-obstacles/\">downplayed the sensor attack</a>. \u201cWe appreciate the work Wenyuan [Xu] and team put into researching potential attacks on sensors used in the autopilot system,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe have reviewed these results with Wenyuan\u2019s team and have thus far not been able to reproduce any real-world cases that pose risk to Tesla drivers.\u201d</p> <p>The response in the car-hacking village to the research was mixed. While some were happy that the research was being done, others saw it as less worthy than the genuine hacking, arguing that spoofing sensors isn\u2019t really any different from causing car crashes by shining a laser into drivers\u2019 eyes.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to find unanimity among hackers on anything. People who use \u201cherding cats\u201d as the apotheosis of a tricky organisational challenge have never had to herd information security experts. But the group of people united by the motivation to push computer security to its absolute limit seem to agree on one thing, at least: car hacking is here to stay, and sooner or later, you\u2019ll be hit too.</p>",

Nevertheless, this fixture does pitch the premier outfits from two regional powerhouses. West Brom are the only top-flight team from the West Midlands (an area with 11 league titles), while Middlesbrough can claim pre-eminence in the north-east (10 titles) after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/sunderland-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">beating Sunderland last Sunday</a>.</p> <p>Provincial pride aside, this rivalry isn\u2019t the fiercest. It\u2019s been six years since these two teams last met, with the Baggies winning the last four matches by an aggregate score of 11-0. Those games, played in the first and second tiers as both clubs slid out of the Premier League in 2009, were followed by West Brom securing an immediate return to the promised land, while their beaten opponents settled in the mire.</p> <p>As Boro battled their way back, West Brom set off on a run of six straight top-flight seasons, years of relentless boinging replaced with 11th, 10th, 8th, 17th, 13th and 14th placed finishes. Yet with doubts over Tony Pulis\u2019 style, a quiet transfer window and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/27/west-brom-fans-bigger-picture-middlesbrough-tony-pulis\">a mysterious new owner</a>, there\u2019s plenty of gloom around the Hawthorns \u2013 in sharp contrast to the Riverside, where a reliable core and a little transfer market magic have Boro on nobody\u2019s list of relegation favourites.</p> <p>Kick-off is at <strong>1.30pm BST</strong>; team news and build-up to follow.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-28T11:38:34.610Z\">at 12.38pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>There were more than 4,000 severe breaches of animal welfare regulations over the past two years at British slaughterhouses, according to data released by the government\u2019s food watchdog under freedom of information laws.</p> <p>The data, comprising reports by vets and hygiene inspectors, details instances of needless pain and distress that include chickens being boiled alive and trucks of animals suffocating or freezing to death.</p> <p>The log of reports submitted to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) reveals how regular breakdowns on production lines, equipment failures and poor procedures in abattoirs result in thousands of animals being subjected to avoidable suffering each year. Many individual acts of cruelty and neglect by slaughterhouse staff, hauliers and farmers are also documented, alongside malpractice that increases the risk of food poisoning.</p> <p>The FSA, which released the data to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), said \u201conly a tiny percentage\u201d of animals that pass through Britain\u2019s slaughterhouses are affected, adding that \u201cthe vast majority of meat processors comply with regulations\u201d.</p> <p>Meat inspectors and campaigners argue there is an under-reporting of welfare abuses, blaming insufficient staff and the often intimidating working conditions at abattoirs. </p> <p>Vets and meat hygiene inspectors working for the FSA inside abattoirs reported a total of 9,511 animal welfare breaches between July 2014 and June 2016, with records classified into three categories according to severity. Category 2 refers to a low-risk isolated incident, while category 4, the most serious, means animals were subjected to \u201cavoidable pain, distress or suffering\u201d.</p> <p>The BIJ\u2019s analysis reveals almost half the recorded incidents were category 4 breaches \u2013 a total of 4,455, or an average of six a day. A single breach can involve hundreds of animals. Between April 2011 and July 2014 there were 6,859 reported incidents in all categories.</p> <p>Neil Parish MP, chairman of the Commons select committee for environment, food and rural affairs, described the results as shocking.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no place for animal cruelty at any stage of farm production \u2013 including the slaughterhouse,\u201d said Parish. \u201cThis country prides itself as having some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world. It\u2019s vital the authorities crack down on any abuses and ensure there is zero tolerance to any mistreatment of animals when slaughtered.\u201d</p> <p>The welfare infractions included a cow being \u201cviolently slammed\u201d against a wall following an argument between two workers; an abattoir worker beating three bulls with a wooden stick and electric prod; and a haulier hitting and kicking cattle during unloading, an incident that was caught on CCTV. Many involved sheep being grabbed by the wool and ears or dragged by the horns, or pigs being lifted by their ears and tails.</p> <p>Failures in the slaughter process were also highlighted, with thousands of instances of animals not being stunned properly and in some cases not stunned at all. Inspectors recorded cases of chickens and pigs being immersed in tanks of scalding hot water \u2013 used to soften the skin and remove hair or feathers \u2013 while still alive.</p> <p>Almost 600 instances were recorded of animals arriving at slaughterhouses already dead. In one case 574 chickens, from a load of 6,072 birds, died after being left on a lorry in very hot conditions. This counts as one welfare breach despite involving hundreds of birds.</p> <p>The data also highlights practices that could facilitate the spread of the bacteria campylobacter, the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. About four in five cases of the infection, which kills about 100 people a year, come from contaminated poultry.</p> <p>Ensuring birds are as calm as possible when they are being caught and transported is an important preventative measure, because stressed birds defecate more, potentially spreading the infection and increasing the risk of meat contamination. However, the data includes regular instances of chickens being \u201coverstocked\u201d in crates and incidents of birds being left in lorries for lengthy periods of time. In one case, because of a breakdown at the plant, 14 trucks were left overnight for more than 12 hours; in another, birds were left in crates at the abattoir for 20 hours.</p> <p>The British Meat Processors Association, the industry trade body, declined to comment on the findings.</p> <p>More than 900 million farm animals are killed for food each year in Britain. There are 317 approved slaughterhouses across the UK, most run by a handful of large companies that dominate the meat processing sector. </p> <p>It is unclear from the data how many of the breaches resulted in any sanctions or improvements. Most of the category 4 breaches were referred to regional Trading Standards offices, which have responsibility for monitoring farms and transportation, but there is no requirement for the vets and inspectors who make the referral to record details of what happens next.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the FSA said it had \u201czero tolerance\u201d for welfare breaches and used a \u201cproportionate approach\u201d to enforcement. Action could include suspending or withdrawing certificates of competence from slaughterers, referring cases for prosecution, stopping operations or serving welfare enforcement notices.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a comprehensive animal verification procedure in place at every slaughterhouse for monitoring animal welfare,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201c[Category 4 breaches] can be the result of unavoidable accidents rather than deliberate abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Between June 2014 and July 2016, the spokesperson said, all category 4 breaches resulted in enforcement action. But in 2013 and 2014 the FSA referred 14 breaches of welfare regulations to the CPS, of which four resulted in prosecutions. Three of those prosecutions were later dropped.</p> <p>Of the remaining cases, four resulted in warning letters. Over the course of the two years, two slaughterers\u2019 licences were suspended and three were revoked for failure to comply with welfare legislation.</p> <p>The fact that serious welfare breaches were the exception not the norm was not the point, said Marc Cooper, head of farm animals at the RSPCA.</p> <p>\u201cSuch incidences of severe pain, distress and suffering are wholly unacceptable and completely avoidable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re avoidable, that means they shouldn\u2019t be happening at all \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t be seeing one. You would hope that strong enforcement action would be taken.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

He started studying Russian and German in school in Glasgow and then at Aberdeen University, visiting both countries as a student in the 1970s. He worked as a translator and editor of foreign broadcasts at the BBC monitoring unit at Caversham Park, near Reading, before getting a job as a subeditor at the Guardian. He stayed in London only briefly. When a stringer\u2019s position covering central Europe became vacant in 1988 he took his young family out to Vienna. It was a characteristically prescient move, as central Europe was on the brink of a revolution with the fall of the Berlin Wall. </p> <p>He filed to the Guardian as a stringer initially but was put on staff as eastern European correspondent in 1990. He covered the Balkan wars from Vienna and then went to Bonn to report on the evolution of a new Germany, moving to Berlin as the capital shifted, and then to Moscow in 1999. He moved to Zagreb in 2003, covering much of Europe from there, before establishing himself as Europe editor in Brussels in 2007. </p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve been out in the field longer than anyone,\u201d he proudly told a visitor not long before his death. </p> <p>His colleagues from the conflicts in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia remember him both for physical bravery and for vivid and crafted writing, but most of all for his sharp analytical mind. </p> <p>Allan Little, who reported the Bosnian war alongside Ian for the BBC, recalled the UN security council passing an ill-fated resolution in April 1993 establishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/jun/10/hague-bosnian-serb-srebrenica-genocide1\">Srebrenica</a> as a \u201csafe area\u201d under the protection of UN peacekeeping troops. </p> <p>\u201cIan unpicked that resolution with forensic precision and focus. He wrote about how vulnerable that left Srebrenica. He knew what would happen two years in advance,\u201d said Little. \u201cHe was a ferocious critic of the UN intervention. Working alongside him, I learned a lot from him about the place.\u201d </p> <p>Jamie Wilson, the Guardian\u2019s head of international news, said: \u201cIan was the journalist\u2019s journalist.

Recognition matches stunning photographs from the 24/7 news cycle with centuries-old artworks, and presents them online. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe team have created and trained a \u2018brain\u2019 to a point where it is simulating certain human attributes and unleashed it online \u2013 and it is creating a gallery,\u201d said Tony Guillan, the producer of the IK prize at Tate Britain.<br></p> <p>After scanning through about 30,000 digitised artworks from the gallery, the system pairs the evocative photograph of the two eunuchs with a mellow scene from the brush strokes of <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/sir-peter-lely-343\">Sir Peter Lely</a>, the principal painter to Charles II. Two women, straight-backed and smiling slightly are seated, one holding a stringed instrument, the other resting her hand on the elaborate folds of her satin dress.<br></p> <p>It is a sumptuous 17th-century work, rich in details. But presented next to the contemporary photograph, the comparison can provoke new artistic questions - for example about gender identity and the notion of glamour. </p> <p>\u201cWithout knowing it, [the system] has created subjective meaning,\u201d said Guillan. \u201cBy asking the question \u2018how do computers work and think?\u2019 you ask the exact same question of humans.\u201d</p> <p>Guillan said he hoped the project would encourage discussion about how we depict scenes and individuals. \u201cNews always presents itself as this mimetic, glass window on to the world, but of course photojournalism is an art form often; it is a mode of communication \u2013 and so is art and painting,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With \u00a315,000 in prize money and \u00a390,000 to produce their vision, the four-strong team at Fabrica have spent months developing the project, which harnesses a burgeoning form of artificial intelligence known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/28/google-says-machine-learning-is-the-future-so-i-tried-it-myself\">machine learning</a>. It will be available in full online and there will be a small exhibition at Tate Britain.<br></p> <p>\u201cComputers are very good at mathematical operations,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/\">Andrea Vedaldi</a>, an associate professor of engineering science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the project. \u201cWhen things start to be very difficult is when you don\u2019t really know how to express, in mathematical terms, what it is you want to do. For example, if you want to recognise a dog in an image ... it is not very easy to come up with the equations of a dog.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/28/google-says-machine-learning-is-the-future-so-i-tried-it-myself\">Google says machine learning is the future. So I tried it myself</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Machine learning takes a different approach: show a system enough images of different canines in different poses, the theory goes, and the system will figure out what a dog is. \u201cThis process of going from specifics to the abstract concept, this is what is really challenging,\u201d said Vedaldi. While progress in machine learning has been dramatic in recent years, he said, creating systems that truly \u201cunderstand\u201d images was still a work in progress.<br></p> <p>It is a challenge that scientists and engineers such as Vedaldi continue to grapple with, developing and exploring powerful systems, including new tools based on a branch of machine learning called deep learning. </p> <p>Recognition takes four different approaches to match images, based on technology developed by Microsoft and a team of AI specialists at the France-based company Jolibrain. \u201cIt can look for objects, like cups and saucers, it can look for faces, it can look for composition within an image \u2013 reading lines and colours \u2013 and it can look at the context that is attached to an image, so metadata, titles and things like that,\u201d said Isaac Vallentin of Fabrica.</p> <p>Now trained, the system will spend three months continuously analysing new photographs from Reuters, comparing each to thousands of digitised paintings, sculptures and other works. Where one or more matches can be found, the best \u2013 as selected by the technology \u2013 is entered into a searchable online gallery.</p> <p>Visitors to the website will also be able to explore details of how the system made each match, including the strength of the resemblance across each of the four approaches, together with particular features it has recognised, such as the age and gender of a face. \u201cWe are trying to really honestly represent how the software itself is coming to its conclusions,\u201d said Vallentin, adding that the system would also be able to create a sentence to explain, to a limited degree, each match.<br></p> <p>The small, three-section display at Tate Britain will offer further insights, with visitors able to compare the matches they would make to those generated by the machine. The results will then be scrutinised. \u201cWe just want to take these two datasets in the end and find the connections, the similarities,\u201d said Vallentin. \u201cIt is really an experiment for us.\u201d<br></p> <p>The team also hope the project will showcase the positive side of artificial intelligence \u2013 a technology that experts including the physicist Stephen Hawking have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/02/stephen-hawking-intel-communication-system-astrophysicist-software-predictive-text-type\">raised safety concerns</a> about.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology is an empowering tool,\u201d said Vallentin. \u201cYou can create really meaningful things and really helpful things, and beautiful things with technology.\u201d<br></p> <ul> <li><em>The IK prize 2016 takes place online and at Tate Britain from 2 September \u2013 27 November. </em><br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>From the top of the nine-storey building in Avdiyivka, Sergei Veremeyenko and his men can see the separatist capital of Donetsk just a few miles away. Avdiyivka has been on the frontline between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces for the past two years and fighting has intensified recently in the \u201cindustrial zone\u201d on the outskirts of town. </p> <p>The war in east Ukraine rarely makes the headlines two years on, but every day brings new casualties. The situation is at its most tense since the end of large-scale fighting in February 2015. Russian claims to have foiled a \u201cterror plot\u201d in Crimea earlier this month, followed by strong rhetoric from the president, Vladimir Putin, led many in Kiev and the west to worry that a major new Russian-backed offensive could be imminent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/aug/26/the-revolution-inspired-graffiti-changing-the-face-of-kiev-in-pictures\">The revolution-inspired graffiti changing the face of Kiev \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Avdiyivka is one of the first places where such a move would be visible.

Full-scale fighting has stopped since then, but skirmishes continue on almost a daily basis. August has been the worst month for a long time.</p> <p>The unarmed monitoring mission from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) logs hundreds of explosions a day.

The separatist side also reports frequent losses. On Thursday, when the Guardian visited the apartment block where Veremeyenko\u2019s group are based, it was shaken by what the men believed to be mortar fire from separatist positions. They claim they have strict orders not to fire and only respond to attacks. The separatist side says the same.</p> <p>\u201cWe noticed an intensification of activity in the last few days; they even drove up tanks to their forward positions, just so we could see them,\u201d said Viktor Shotropa, who leads Veremeyenko\u2019s group, which is part of the Kiev Regiment, initially a volunteer battalion that was later given official status as part of the Ukrainian interior ministry. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c90c6b4cad47dd8d7e238cc743f5a4668efe4e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c90c6b4cad47dd8d7e238cc743f5a4668efe4e6/0_347_5640_3385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Separatists at the destroyed Donetsk international airport in October last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Separatists at the destroyed Donetsk international airport in October last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleksey Filippov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut mainly I think they are just firing out of boredom. In order to actually seize more territory, they would need a full-blown invasion, with the full support of the Russian army,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Events over the past fortnight have put everyone on edge, however. Earlier this month, Russia said a soldier and a security services officer had died while detaining a Ukrainian terror cell that had planned attacks in Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in February 2014. </p> <p>Later, Russian television showed footage of a bruised Ukrainian and claimed he was working for Ukrainian military intelligence. \u201cWe obviously will not let such things slide by,\u201d Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/russia-and-ukraine-step-up-security-amid-tension-over-crimea\">said</a>. </p> <p>The Russian president accused Kiev of embracing \u201ctactics of terror\u201d and said there was little point in four-way negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France, planned for the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit in China. This led many to suspect that a new Russian offensive could be on the way, possibly with the aim of opening up a land bridge between Russia and Crimea. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/ukraine-marks-25-years-independence-riven-nation-east-war\">Ukraine marks 25 years of independence a riven nation despite the flags</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ukraine insisted the entire plot was fabricated by the Russians and the Russian reaction caused the president, Petro Poroshenko, to put his forces on high alert.

But with Ukraine\u2019s army improving over the past two years, a push for further territory would probably require a full-scale, overt Russian invasion that would irrevocably damage relations with the west.<br></p> <p>For all the improvements, there is still a certain ad-hoc nature to the Ukrainian military effort. Veremeyenko said he was not officially signed up to the army and was technically registered as a mechanic, although he fights on the frontline. </p> <p>The group operates from a number of apartments in a block that housed civilians until fighting started. Amid the weapons and other accoutrements of war, kitchen tiles featuring kiwis and watermelons are a reminder that this was once someone\u2019s home. The nine-storey building was only finished in early 2014; now the residents from all but one floor have fled as almost every apartment has some kind of damage. In the courtyard, an elderly woman pleads with the soldiers to bring her some potatoes.</p> <p>The OSCE has blamed both sides for the repeated ceasefire violations. At a briefing earlier this month, Alexander Hug, the deputy chief OSCE monitor, said a lack of trust hampered any lasting peace, because \u201cwithout trust each side fears the vacuum will be filled by the other\u201d. </p> <p>He criticised both sides for barring access to the monitors. \u201cWe need access and, to be frank, that\u2019s not happening. The sides prevent our monitors from accessing certain areas. The sides plant landmines and obstacles. The sides threaten and intimidate our unarmed civilian monitors.\u201d</p> <p>As the potential for renewed full-scale hostilities remains, it is the population of east Ukraine who suffer the most. At Mariinka, one of the few points where civilians can cross the frontline, snaking queues of people, including the elderly and young children, wait for permission to cross the makeshift border. On Thursday morning on the Ukrainian side, outgoing rounds of light artillery were audible, as well as the crackle of machine-gun fire.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3e5a5852d3af77fdb4d7dd493c867eb8e34e5d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3e5a5852d3af77fdb4d7dd493c867eb8e34e5d5/0_265_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman inspects her damaged house on Thursday after shelling in Gorlovka, eastern Ukraine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman inspects her damaged house on Thursday after shelling in Gorlovka, eastern Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The weary Ukrainian soldiers at the checkpoint and the beleaguered locals trying to cross the lines hardly paid attention; the war has become a way of life here over the past two years, and they were far more concerned about whether or not they would make it across the border. An elderly woman burst into tears as her pass to cross the line was not in the system and she was forced to turn back after many hours of waiting. </p> <p>The checkpoint at Mariinka has gradually taken on the trappings of a real border, with passport booths and customs check, and is one of many signs that a political solution to the conflict seems further away than ever. </p> <p>Moscow is keen for a settlement that would see much of the separatist infrastructure legalised, giving it de facto control over part of Ukraine without having to fund it. In Kiev, attitudes have hardened against any compromise with the \u201cterrorists\u201d in the east. Amid the deadlock, many in Kiev still worry about the possibility of Russia opting for full-scale war. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem logical but then the things they do often don\u2019t,\u201d said the Ukrainian official.<br></p>",

MSF also says the attackers boarded the boat for approximately 50 minutes.</p> <p>Qassim\u2019s claims are further complicated by the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/refugee-rescue-ship-bourbon-argos-eritreans-libya-msf\">the Bourbon Argos has been working openly in international waters off the Libyan coast for over a year</a>, rescuing tens of thousands of asylum seekers.

The fleet is nominally meant to apprehend people-smugglers, and also rescues migrants when necessary \u2013 but Qassim argued in a recent interview that the operation in fact had ulterior motives.</p> <p>\u201cDo we need military soldiers to intercept and rescue civilian boats and immigrants?\u201d he reportedly asked in <a href=\"http://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/navy-spokesman-operation-sophia-propaganda-italy-wants-have-more-time-continue-stealing-libya%E2%80%99s\">an interview with the Libyan Observer</a>, a news website. \u201cNo, those civilians need care and protection, not army personnel with guns and pistols. I think when the EU saw that the southern part of the Mediterranean, which lies opposite to Europe, especially the part that overlooks north African countries, had been reshaped by the revolutions as well as the security unrest, it wanted to form a permanent military force to be in the Mediterranean at all times.\u201d</p> <p>In response to Qassim\u2019s claims, MSF said its representatives were \u201ccurrently engaging with the Libyan authorities in order to clarify what happened exactly during the incident and to ensure that similar events, that can put people in physical danger, do not occur in the future\u201d. It added: \u201cOur main priority is to guarantee that humanitarian organisations like ours are able to continue to safely conduct search and rescue activities in the central Mediterranean with the aim of saving lives.\u201d</p> <p>MSF is one of several charities now working in the Mediterranean, independently of Operation Sophia. Collectively, they have rescued tens of thousands of asylum seekers in the past two years. Numbers of people crossing between Turkey and Greece have fallen drastically since March, but the level between Libya and Italy remains at near-record levels.</p> <p>So far in 2016, more than 100,000 people have reached Italy from north Africa. More than 3,100 have drowned in the Mediterranean since the start of the year.</p>",

Accepting the only job offer she got, from Sanford C Bernstein, in 1995, Krawcheck was its chief executive by 2001. By 2002, Sandy Weill, chief executive of Citigroup, had lured her away to take over as head of Smith Barney. </p> <p>In 2005, she was chief financial officer of Citigroup and tipped to become Wall Street\u2019s first female CEO. Even her high-profile firing following the financial crisis didn\u2019t derail her career: Krawcheck surfaced as the head of the newly merged Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s wealth management division, charged with overseeing the famed \u201cthundering herd\u201d. </p> <p>Then Bank of America\u2019s CEO, Brian Moynihan, possibly threatened by her high profile, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2015/01/02/sallie-krawcheck-wants-take-women-top-business-294332.html\">offered her a choice between departure or demotion</a>. She chose to leave. The aftermath of that high-stakes Wall Street power struggle led to her next great eureka moment.</p> <p>\u201cThere are different ways to attack the boys\u2019 club than from the inside,\u201d she tells the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b937bf624c8ba167fb85798181be3399c8296766\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b937bf624c8ba167fb85798181be3399c8296766/0_264_1000_599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Krawcheck became head of Smith Barney after quickly rising to CEO of Sanford C Bernstein.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sally Krawcheck became head of Smith Barney after quickly rising to CEO of Sanford C Bernstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For years after her 2011 \u201cresignation\u201d from Bank of America, Krawcheck debated with herself. She knew being a woman had given her a fundamentally different perspective on the way that Merrill Lynch\u2019s \u201cherd\u201d of largely male brokers and financial advisers did business, a view that had been shaped and refined by her years at Citigroup. \u201cBut I made all the arguments to myself,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were plenty of firms out there already\u201d that could opt to do business in a different way, to serve their clients \u2013 especially women \u2013 better. Except that they didn\u2019t. </p> <p>\u201cI watched and watched,\u201d Krawcheck says. The percentage of financial advisers at big Wall Street firms that were men remained unchanged, about 85%. And that matters, she says, because they didn\u2019t pay much attention to the women among their clientele, even when they thought they did. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d study this, when a male adviser met with a couple, and ask him how much time he thought he spent interacting with each member of them, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, 55/45.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>In fact, the evidence showed he had spent 90% of his time talking to the man, and not realized it. Unsurprisingly, Krawcheck found that when they were widowed, 70% of Merrill\u2019s clients took their assets and left. </p> <p>BMO Wealth Institute calculates that women <a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/personal-finance/women-control-a-majority-of-americas-wealth.html/?a=viewall\">control about 51% of all personal wealth in the US</a>, or some $14tn, and projects that figure to hit $22tn by 2020. Investment firms cannot afford to disregard women or to lose them as clients. And yet they weren\u2019t hiring women as advisers.</p> <p>\u201cOne firm used a marine corps questionnaire for hiring,\u201d Krawcheck recalls.</p> <p>Since it wasn\u2019t her job to force Wall Street into recognizing what it was doing wrong, she decided to try to start doing it the right way. The first step <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/sallie-krawcheck-buying-85-broads-2013-5\">was the purchase</a> in spring 2013 of 85 Broads, a financial membership and networking community established by alumnae of Goldman Sachs, which she promptly renamed <a href=\"https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/\">Ellevate Network</a>, to reflect its new mission: to provide more women with a way to become involved and engaged in their finances.</p> <p>Earlier this year, she rolled out the next stage of her plan, <a href=\"https://www.ellevest.com/\">Ellevest</a>: an investment platform designed around women\u2019s needs and priorities, not those of the men who run Wall Street and the firms where she cut her teeth.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole icon of a bull that stands for Wall Street \u2013 you couldn\u2019t come up with an image of a more male environment,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen feel that the brand doesn\u2019t speak to them.\u201d </p> <p>They also, she argues, speak a very different language when it comes to money, and have very different objectives, which men don\u2019t grasp at all.</p> <p>To the extent that the big Wall Street firms attempt to cater to women, they \u201cpinkify\u201d their offerings, Krawcheck says. Why, she asks, does a woman-friendly approach to investing \u201chave to mean the junior version? </p> <p>\u201cSomehow there is this feeling that women require remedial financial education and so everything must be dumbed down. The reality is that we all need a lot more education, but guys just go ahead and invest anyway.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018Just friggin\u2019 pay them more\u2019</h2> <p>Krawcheck\u2019s irritation and anger at this kind of systemic bias \u2013 and its impact on women, who end up so alienated by the Wall Street system and so daunted by the difficult of finding a firm or an independent adviser who will listen to them that they simply avoid seeking out the investment advice they need \u2013 creep through her trademark charm and humor. </p> <p>When others suggest that it doesn\u2019t make sense to focus on the <a href=\"https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/articles/7238-the-gender-gap-that-s-really-hurting-us-and-it-s-not-the-one-you-think\">investment gender gap</a> because it\u2019s more important to close the gender pay gap first, you can almost hear her grit her teeth before answering. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s like saying you broke your arm and you broke your leg, but I\u2019m not going to fix your broken arm because I can\u2019t fix your broken leg yet!\u201d </p> <p>As far as the gender pay gap itself is concerned, she has no patience at all. \u201cJust friggin\u2019 pay them more\u201d is Krawcheck\u2019s message to companies that still compensate men and women inequitably. \u201cOh, and if you haven\u2019t stopped to check whether you have a gender pay gap? You do.\u201d </p> <p>And now Krawcheck has created a place where those women, tired of testosterone-fueled investment jabber about relative price/earning ratios and the best mid-cap growth mutual fund to pick, can find an investment home.</p> <p>Krawcheck\u2019s Ellevest does not \u201cpinkify\u201d investing, she insists, but it does start the process in a very different way. Ellevest\u2019s objective isn\u2019t to design a portfolio that will beat the market or focus on the exciting investment concept of the day. Instead, the robo-adviser designs portfolios based on the user\u2019s investment time horizon and risk tolerance. </p> <p>\u201cWomen think in terms of goals-based investing,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>It\u2019s slightly pricier than rivals (the fee is 0.5% of assets a year), but cheaper than working with a traditional financial adviser would be. Moreover, as Krawcheck points out, it\u2019s a process designed to ensure that women actually feel that their portfolios and goals are in sync. </p> <p>\u201cWomen value capital preservation many times more than men, but you won\u2019t find that reflected\u201d at Merrill Lynch or anywhere else in the industry, she argues.</p> <p>It\u2019s early days still. If the company thrives, however, there\u2019s no downside: success will give women an alternative to the Merrill Lynches of the world and give the latter a much-overdue wakeup call, the kind that its leaders couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t listen to from inside the walls. </p> <p>Welcome to Wall Street\u2019s girls\u2019 club. </p>",

  "<p>In the Mongolian taiga, or snow forest, a few kilometres from the Russian border, a group of 250 reindeer herders preserve their traditions with care. They dwell, as their ancestors did, in the forest, where they live by hunting, gathering and drinking the milk of their animals. But the creation of a protected area to preserve the wild environment may threaten their survival.<br></p> <h2>Two men, one battle</h2> <p>Ganbat and Tumursukh were born in the same village in the middle of the taiga, about 50 years ago. Reaching the snow-covered forest region in the country\u2019s north-east takes two days by car from the nearest city, Murun, and then a journey by horse or reindeer \u2013 including passage across Khovsgol lake \u2013 all without encountering a soul beyond the odd elk or lynx.

When I had the opportunity to leave and study in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/03/mongolia-ulanbaatar-ger-yurt-tent-city\">Ulaanbaatar</a> [Mongolia\u2019s capital], I wanted to come back. I waited several years before realising my dream: being named manager of the regional protection of Khovsgol by the ministry of the environment. </p> <p>\u201cIn 1987, I was able to establish the first protected area in the region and save a part of it from mining exploitation. In the 80s, industrial outfits began to come into the region. The companies mined the mountain [Urandush in the Jankal range] for phosphorus. We fight to preserve our environment again these threats. The taiga is precious and fragile. It\u2019s home to rare and endangered species of flower, to snow leopards, elk, ibex \u2026 The government has understood and has begun to preserve it.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dea3b50401e9215ce3cbe367e60fde8d563642d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dea3b50401e9215ce3cbe367e60fde8d563642d6/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ganbat in his tipi \u2013 or ortz, as they are known locally\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ganbat in his tipi \u2013 or <em>ortz</em>, as they are known locally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sitting beside his wife in his <em>ortz,</em> a felt-lined tipi made of wood, Ganbat says: \u201cThe taiga is our life.

Our role is to testify to our love and respect for the taiga. We\u2019ve taken care of our reindeer since before Mongolia existed, they are our pride.\u201d<br></p> <p>The taiga is fragile. Ganbat and Tumursukh are aware of this and fight daily for its survival. Despite this common cause, the two men have different backgrounds and their approach to conserving the taiga is bringing them into conflict. <br></p> <p>Tumursukh, who is an ethnic Mongol, is responsible for the natural reserves of the region and is a fervent opponent of mining in the area.

A reindeer herder, hunter and protector of the traditions of his people, he watches over his community and their traditional lands. He is the oldest man in the Dukha camp, a respected sage to whom the group listens. </p> <p>Originally from Russia, the Dukha (who are also called Tsataan in Mongolian) are closer in traditions and way of life to the Sami people, the reindeer herders of the Arctic, than to Mongols of the steppe, who are traditionally famers and live in gers.</p> <p>These Dukha nomads move their <em>ortz</em> according to the migrations of the reindeer in these wild mountains \u2013 the only environment favourable to their animals. They don\u2019t grow crops, or raise animals other than reindeer. They don\u2019t eat the reindeer, using them only for their milk and for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumance\">transhumance</a>.</p> <p>It was only after the second world war that the Dukha established themselves definitively in Mongolia. \u201cOur fathers were accustomed to migrating where they wanted to within the taiga,\u201d says Buyantogtoh, Ganbat\u2019s sister and the group\u2019s doyenne. \u201cWe knew no frontiers, and went wherever our reindeer had sufficient pasture. Then the war broke out, and the Russian soldiers wanted to recruit our men to go and fight far away from us. We fled to the south. Then they closed the borders, and we stayed on this side, in Mongolia.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"f79dd00a85603a74181ad6fe0420591bd7e6f2fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f79dd00a85603a74181ad6fe0420591bd7e6f2fa/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oltsen leads his herd of reindeers through the thick snow in the Tengis Shishged national reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oltsen leads his herd of reindeers through the thick snow in the Tengis Shishged national reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>From state hunters to poachers</h2> <p>Initially, relations with the Mongolian state were positive, according to the Dukha, who have rarely mixed with the people living in the valleys. Known for their vast knowledge of the taiga and their capability as hunters, they were hired as \u201cstate hunters\u201d by Mongolia\u2019s communist government.</p> <p>Oltsen is one of the best hunters in the group, and is capable of confronting the bears that menace the reindeer herds. \u201cMy father was a state hunter,\u201d says Oltsen, proudly. \u201cHe hunted, would go down to the villages to bring the meat, and would return with vegetables and flour. This became more difficult after the fall of the communist government: he lost his job. But we have pursued commercial activity, selling furs and meat when we can. Tourists came as well, and we began to do crafts. They liked that.\u201d<br></p> <p>The situation has worsened: without a place in society, regarded as merely reindeer herders, the Dukha have become marginalised. In 2011, their lives changed radically. </p> <p>\u201cPeople came and told us that they had studied the taiga for 10 years,\u201d says Oltsen, bitterly. \u201cWe had never seen them. They explained to us that this territory had become a national reserve and that new laws had been put in place. They had decided that we couldn\u2019t hunt any more and that only three areas were authorised for the pasturing of our reindeer. We were no longer permitted to take them beyond the Tengis river and the Gugned Valley. But how would we live if we weren\u2019t able to hunt any more? </p> <p>\u201cTo make sure that we didn\u2019t hunt, they forbade us from bringing our dogs to guard the reindeer. But there are wolves here. Our herds were decimated. We don\u2019t have anything but our reindeer. It\u2019s our right to take care of them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Under Mongolian law, hunting is forbidden in the Tengis Shishged national reserve, as are fishing and chopping wood, and only limited migrations are allowed, in order to preserve biodiversity. Recently, rangers have been deployed to protect the area. Itn is easy to imagine how relations between these rangers \u2013 mainly young, urbanites \u2013 and the Dukha, who have dwelled in these lands for hundreds of years, rapidly became strained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/global_dev_mongolia/giv-31075hJUYzYo1DM5x/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/global_dev_mongolia/giv-31075hJUYzYo1DM5x/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t let us live any more.

If these things are outlawed, we\u2019re no longer free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they want to make us Mongols of the steppe,\u201d asks Oltsen. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do anything other than live here. But I know the taiga better than anyone. I know every corner of this mountain. I know the animals and we show them respect, just as our fathers taught us. We communicate with nature. If I go hunting and don\u2019t see many animals, it means that nature isn\u2019t ready to give them to me and I go home. We lose our culture if we can\u2019t hunt any longer or can\u2019t keep our reindeer. We\u2019re scared.\u201d<br></p> <p>A few months ago, five Dukha hunters were arrested for poaching while searching for food. Ganbat\u2019s son was among them. </p> <p>\u201cThey were taken to the police station in town. But we don\u2019t have vehicles, or the means to let them stay in town,\u201d Ganbat says. \u201cWe\u2019re all afraid. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d </p> <p>Police headquarters and the courts are in far-off Murun. The young men have returned to the Dukha camp but <strong>(</strong>risk up to five years in prison, and fines of up to \u00a37,500, for breaking the laws of the reserve. </p> <p>The manager of the Murun police investigations department said: \u201cThe reserve has brought a complaint against them for poaching.

Their website, <a href=\"http://www.rallyforrangers.org/\">Rally for Rangers</a>, says: \u201cThe Tengis Shishged park is one of the rare places in the world where this ancient pastoral religious form survives.\u201d Not for long, if the Dukha are no longer allowed to carry on their traditional activities. </p> <p>The Dukha are sceptical about the initiative: \u201cThey [rangers] spend their time riding up and down the mountain, frightening the animals. And they follow us even more aggressively now,\u201d says Ganbat. \u201cWe want our message to be heard. We want to remain in our home and live freely.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, the Mongolian government heard the pleas of the Dukha and a salary of \u00a350 a person is now provided each month.

The Dukha aren\u2019t complaining about their new source of revenue, which allows them access to resources and luxuries they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, yet they remain defiant when it comes to their tradition of preserving, in their own way, the land on which they live. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them, even with their motorbikes and their park,\u201d Buyantogtoh says. \u201cWith or without them, we will conserve our forest.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they come and talk with us?\u201d asks Ganbat. \u201cWe would tell them what to protect and where the animals are. But also which lands we need for our reindeer. Why couldn\u2019t we work together?\u201d </p> <p>Worldwide, that question echoes in many indigenous communities. <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding/rule-of-law--justice-and-security/human-rights/empowering_indigenous_peoples1.html\">The Dukha aren\u2019t alone: there are about 370 million indigenous people</a>,  spread across five continents. They live in regions threatened by exploitation, conservation of which nonetheless sometimes comes at the expense of those who reside within them.</p> <p>In 2014, Mongolia <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/mng/law-on-the-protection-of-cultural-heritage_html/Cultural_Heritage_Law_eng.pdf\">passed a law</a> to create <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/mng/law-on-the-protection-of-cultural-heritage_html/Cultural_Heritage_Law_eng.pdf\">protected cultural areas</a> (pdf), which would be managed by local communities and help to preserve their cultural heritage. Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, a former Mongolian MP and minister of culture who <a href=\"http://www.montsame.gov.mn/en/index.php/politics/item/4076-budget-for-cultural-heritage-protection-draft-law-approved\">campaigned for the new law</a>, says: \u201cMongolia must preserve its cultural heritage and help people who want to maintain their lifestyles. In a protected cultural area, hunting would be allowed, for example \u2013 even if regulated \u2013 as a cultural practice.\u201d </p> <p>On paper, this appears promising. But Oyungerel, a prominent human rights spokeswoman, is no longer in government. The law is not yet being implemented, and the Dukha aren\u2019t even aware of it.

  "<p>Everyone at this year\u2019s Edinburgh International Television Festival was expecting Vice chief executive Shane Smith to ruffle a few feathers when he gave the annual MacTaggart lecture on Wednesday evening, but few were prepared to be quite so ruffled.</p> <p>In a rambling speech interrupted by references to drinking, drug taking, becoming director general of the BBC \u2013 and, at one point, a moth landing on his head \u2013 the boss of the digital media empire lambasted broadcasters for neglecting the interests and needs of the world\u2019s youth.</p> <p>The TV industry has been aware it has something of a youth problem for years, but Smith\u2019s speech has pushed the issue centre stage. The hyperbolic, confrontational language he used has re-energised the debate, and many have taken umbrage at a North American upstart coming to Scotland to tell UK broadcasting it\u2019s out of touch. It\u2019s not hard to see why.</p> <p>\u201cNow the baby boomers have had a stranglehold on media and advertising for an entire generation,\u201d he told the assembled producers, TV bosses and journalists at the Edinburgh Playhouse. \u201cThat stranglehold is finally being broken by a highly educated, ethnically diverse, global thinking, hard-to-reach generation. And media is having a hard time adapting to this rapid change.\u201d</p> <p>Topics such as climate change or LGBT issues that young people care about are covered rarely if at all, he said, because the people making TV are making it about the things that interest them. \u201cIt\u2019s a different market and it consumes media in a different way. It can\u2019t be advertised to traditionally and it wants media to be specific only to them. This is hard for baby boomers to get their heads around. You have a lot of baby boomer executives saying \u2018I don\u2019t know, put a skateboard in it\u2019. There is no easy solution.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of that it changed everything. Everyone said young people don\u2019t care about news [and] they sure as hell don\u2019t care about international [news]. Bullshit. They care. But they don\u2019t like the way it\u2019s been portrayed up until now. This is a huge white space.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5040adc62b4269afb9982e486415b45f34f36b50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5040adc62b4269afb9982e486415b45f34f36b50/0_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sexed-up success: ITV2\u2019s Love Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sexed-up success \u2026 ITV2\u2019s Love Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AOB/LNG/Supplied by WENN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following day the TV bosses of Britain\u2019s biggest broadcasters got their chance to respond, and their central argument was that while Smith might be right about the US, the UK was a different kettle of fish. \u201cIn America, it still feels like making that content is really radical and revolutionary,\u201d said BBC director of content Charlotte Moore. \u201cNetworks there do not show stuff about climate change, about women. It\u2019s a good rallying cry ... but it shows us how precious what we have in the UK is.\u201d</p> <p>Sky\u2019s managing director of content Gary Davey said Smith had missed the point. \u201cWe all have to acknowledge that we probably need to encourage more young people to be in the creative process,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re already doing a lot of what he\u2019s advocating .... We have a fantastic diversity of channel types and programme types ... It\u2019s a fantastic breadth of choice. We are effectively servicing lots of target groups.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether Smith was \u201ca genuine disrupter or emperor\u2019s new clothes\u201d, ITV director of television Kevin Lygo was less diplomatic, saying he was \u201ctrying not to use the word \u2018odious\u2019\u201d, and was met with a round of amused applause.</p> <p>Channel 5\u2019s director of programmes Ben Frow (who had skipped Smith\u2019s speech altogether) made a telling intervention on the topic of sex on TV to justify a show that debuted at the start of the century. \u201cKids like sex and confrontation, and Big Brother has both.\u201d And while Moore said it was patronising to say the young are only interested in sex, her list of shows that get the youth vote \u2013 including The Great British Bake Off, The Apprentice, and programmes about Brexit \u2013 did not suggest a revolutionary approach to the audience.</p> <p>Jay Hunt, Channel 4\u2019s chief creative officer, later added there was a danger of creating a \u201ccult of youth\u201d and \u201cdemonising\u201d old people. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to make shows for people over 34.

Yet for all the pride in good shows dealing with important issues, the stats suggest young people are paying less and less attention to it. Ofcom\u2019s Communications Market Report published earlier this month showed the average British person watches almost two-thirds of their video diet as live TV, and with recorded TV included that rises to almost 80%. Yet live viewing drops to little more than a third for 16- to 24-year-olds and less than half when recorded is thrown in. Almost 40% of their time is spent with free or paid on-demand video and, of course, short video clips of the kind you find on YouTube.</p> <p>Research by Enders Analysis commissioned by former Channel 4 executive Liz Warner, who helped launch Big Brother, paints an even bleaker picture for the leading TV executives who gathered in Edinburgh. Enders found that the average age of viewers of BBC1 and BBC2 is 62, while on ITV it is 60 and on Channel 5 it is 58. On Channel 4, the average age is 55 and on \u201cyouth\u201d channel E4, it dips to 42, which is also the average age of the UK population.</p> <p>In her Bafta lecture last month, titled TV Is Old and Boring, Warner warned of a danger \u2013 losing a generation \u2013 remarkably similar to the one described by Smith. She said that TV was rehashing old ideas, failing to take risks and becoming a less appealing place for young people to work. \u201cWe have failed to engage with a whole generation of digital talent, the younger generation are not switching on, television is failing the young.\u201d Unlike Smith, though, she wasn\u2019t talking from a background of US television, but from a career firmly rooted in the UK. Her warning was stark. \u201cIt\u2019s got beyond being anecdotal and I think we\u2019re facing a creative chasm and a crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Smith\u2019s message, and certainly Smith himself, may not have gone down well with his audience in Edinburgh. But he\u2019s not the only one worried about whether TV is doing enough to make sure it offers a younger generation of viewers what they want.</p> <h2>Is the online-only BBC3 a success?<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5da4601b89a2e0043f0786ffb641ca1e193d5152\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5da4601b89a2e0043f0786ffb641ca1e193d5152/0_440_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reggie Yates is to front a BBC3 documentary on gun crime in Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flagged up \u2026 Reggie Yates is to front a BBC3 documentary on gun crime in Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>BBC3 remains central to the BBC\u2019s attempts to reach young people despite going online only seven months ago, but a recent survey by Thinkbox showing the corporation has seen an 18% fall in its youth audience since the linear channel\u2019s closure has raised questions about the move.</p> <p>In the post-MacTaggart interview at the Edinburgh TV Festival Vice\u2019s Shane Smith said closing the channel was a mistake.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know I would have closed [BBC3] down.

  "<p>No longer the domain of Saturday afternoon barbecues, cooking over wood and coals \u2013 intentionally charring and burning \u2013 has become quite a trend. Bearded men in waxed aprons fill every Nordic restaurant worth its salt and the technique has been celebrated at restaurants such as the wonderful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/20/kitty-fishers-london-w1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Kitty Fisher\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blackaxemangal\">Black Axe Mangal</a>. Though the grill masters of London\u2019s Turkish ocakbasi restaurants will tell you it\u2019s nothing new.</p> <p>You\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that this cavemanesque cooking is all about meat, but in fact vegetables sit centre stage at most of these kitchens. At home, we\u2019ve overlooked how much a bit of char and smoke can compliment a beloved vegetable or boost a neutral cheese, such as halloumi or feta. An aubergine is an obvious pairing with a bit of smoke \u2013 babaganoush is a friendly blend of vegetables and smoke, as is a halved aubergine grilled and basted in white miso on every turn. Onions too, work well grilled slowly and tossed through plump pearl barley grains. Even halved little gems are transformed when quickly charred and simply dressed in oil, vinegar and chopped herbs.</p> <p>This charring is, of course, possible on a griddle pan or even a good heavy\u2011based frying pan, but its natural habitat is on the barbecue. The resolution to cook outside to me seems most welcome on a weeknight, when taking the kitchen outside brings a holiday feeling to an otherwise normal Tuesday or Wednesday. These have been the char-edged suppers we\u2019ve cooked quickly this summer.</p> <h2><strong>Harissa and lime halloumi with flatbreads</strong></h2> <p>Halloumi is a real crowd-pleaser when it comes to barbecues. I have never understood the blanket fascination, but I do like its texture when its cooked just right, charred and crisped a little on the outside and perfectly melting inside, if you hit this sweet spot, gone is the offputting rubbery squeakiness. It does need some help on the flavour front; a quick marinade will boost your squeaky cheese out of its simple milky profile. It pairs well with a hit of hot chilli and a little bit of sweetness.</p> <p>Here, it has a quick dip in a harissa, lime and rose marinade, which is backed up by a grilled relish that combines smoke from charred red onions, some piquancy from a good drizzle of pomegranate molasses, sweetness from red peppers and a salty olive kick. It\u2019s also great in flatbreads, burgers and toasted sandwiches. The cooling yoghurt dampens down the chilli as well as providing a pleasing temperature contrast between the fridge-cold yoghurt and the grill-hot halloumi.</p> <p>If you like, you could stir a few crushed dried rose petals into your harissa to make it rosy. By all means, use jarred roasted red peppers to speed things up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5dccfdb4644670d31a964d44f736653b60b535dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dccfdb4644670d31a964d44f736653b60b535dd/0_0_4912_6394/768.jpg\" alt=\"Harissa and lime halloumi with flatbreads\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you can find it, use rose harissa here for the halloumi marinade.

Let the flames die down a little, then cook the onions, turning occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until soft and sweet.

Chop with the onions and green olives. Add 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses and mix well, taste and add seasoning, if needed.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Stoke the barbecue.

Wafer thin they grill in seconds and make a fine salad, but here I go for bigger pieces, cooked until the outside chars and the inside steams to a buttery softness. Sit them next to some cooling mozzarella and you\u2019ve got all the contrasts, the hot and cold, neutral and punchy, calm and bitter.</p> <p>The lovage oil is the crowning glory and simpler than you might think, though a good pesto would work too.</p> <p>I cooked this on a hot and heavy day last summer at a supper club and it\u2019s now a meal I regularly dream of: the sweetness of the charred courgettes paired with the cool, calm and creamy burrata and the verdant hit from the lovage is pure summer. It was the brainchild of the brilliant Robbin Holmgren, the head chef at Fifteen London. I am sure his version is much fancier, but this is how I do it at home. Any leftover lovage oil can be kept in a jar in the fridge for a few weeks.

Sieve the oil to get rid of any big bits of herb, then transfer to a jar and set aside.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Next, heat your barbecue (or griddle pan) until it\u2019s smoking hot. While it heats up, cut your courgettes \u2013 bigger ones into rounds and smaller ones into long slices. Once the griddle is hot, char your courgettes on both sides until nicely charred and softened a little in the middle.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Serve the charred courgettes on a platter next to the burrata torn open, finished with a good pinch of sea salt and a grinding of black pepper, and a good drizzle of the lovage oil.</p> <h2>Anna\u2019s tips for barbecuing vegetables</h2> <ul> <li>Cook on charcoal or wood if you can as it will impart that smoky flavour that gas barbecues won\u2019t.</li> <li>Use lumpwood charcoal. It\u2019s more expensive but will hold heat longer so you will use less. Avoid firelighters if you can.</li> <li>Wait for the right moment to cook. This may sound basic but wait for the flames to properly die down. You want the coals white hot, grey and glowing which give the most even heat.</li> <li>Control the heat just as you would if you were using a gas hob. If things are too hot then take your food off and let the coals cool down.</li> <li>If you are cooking more than one thing it might be useful to have two temperatures on your barbecue. To do this, once the coals are hot pile most of them to one side which will be hot for grilling, and a few on the other side for warming bread and gentler cooking.</li> <li>Don\u2019t oil your vegetables before they hit the grill. Instead, dress them carefully after grilling, while they are still warm in good olive oil, citrus or vinegar.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Anna Jones is a chef, writer and author of A Modern Way to Eat and A Modern Way to Cook (Fourth Estate); annajones.co.uk; @we_are_food</em></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Wilbert Hatcher admits he broke the law. </p> <p>In the depths of a decade-long addiction to prescription opioid painkillers, the father of two fed his craving by buying blackmarket pills on the streets of his small West Virginia town. He finally shook the addiction three years ago. But now Hatcher, 50, an assistant manager at Walmart, is at the heart of a groundbreaking legal battle with the medical industry over whether he is a criminal or a victim.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a well-rounded, educated individual who thinks that I don\u2019t have an addictive personality. But when you go to the doctor and they\u2019re pushing the drugs, and they feed and feed the addiction,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it going to take before we as a nation accept that we are the victims for the most part and the doctor, the pharmacist and pharmacies are the perpetrators feeding off the lives of others?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2016/may/25/opioid-epidemic-overdose-deaths-map\">A deadly crisis: mapping the spread of America's drug overdose epidemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hatcher is among 29 survivors of opioid addiction or relatives of those who overdosed on painkillers who accuse doctors, pharmacies and distributors in a rural corner of West Virginia of pushing the powerful and highly addictive drugs, which have properties similar to those of heroin. </p> <p>The lawsuit alleges that \u201ca veritable rogue\u2019s gallery of pill-pushing doctors and pharmacies\u201d grew rich on the back of patients who sought medical treatment only to have their lives wrecked by addiction.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a conspiracy,\u201d said Jim Cagle, the lawyer for Hatcher and other plaintiffs. \u201cDoctors and pharmacies were keeping them hooked. They were feeding the addiction.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the physicians and pharmacists involved have been jailed and stripped of their medical licences while several drug distributors agreed in June to pay West Virginia millions of dollars for flooding the state with opioid pills, contributing to an addiction epidemic and the highest death rate from drug overdoses in the US. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The doctor, the pharmacist and pharmacies are the perpetrators feeding off the lives of others</p> <footer> <cite>Wilbert Hatcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The case is expected to go to trial later this year after the West Virginia supreme court rejected a claim by lawyers for the accused doctors, pharmacists and drug stores that former addicts should not be able to sue because they admit abusing drugs. </p> <p>But lawyers for the accused parties maintain that the fault lies with the addicts. They claim that Hatcher and other plaintiffs are criminals who only became hooked because they illegally abused the drugs \u2013 a position backed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who could face a hit to their<strong> </strong>multibillion dollar market. </p> <p>That argument met with derision from one of West Virginia\u2019s US senators, Joe Manchin, who likened attempts to blame the victims for their addiction to the tactics of cigarette manufacturers. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same argument that the tobacco industry used. They can\u2019t go down that path,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an epidemic because we have a business model for it. Follow the money. Look at the amount of pills they shipped into certain parts of our state. It was a business model.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Rapidly escalating doses</h2> <p>Hatcher received his first opioid prescription after he fell down steps working at a motel in 2003. The state workers\u2019 compensation fund referred him to a busy pain clinic, the Wellness Center in Williamson, a declining coal town of about 3,000 people. </p> <p>The clinic was run day-to-day by Dr William Ryckman, who formerly worked as a physician at a federal prison. Ryckman said in a deposition that he was hired to work in Williamson in 1997 by a prisoner he befriended, Henry Vinson, who served five years for running a gay prostitution ring in Washington DC. Ryckman described the former prisoner as \u201csetting up the practice\u201d and recruiting doctors. Vinson said he did no more than manage the building.</p> <p>Hatcher\u2019s first consultation was with another early recruit to the clinic \u2013 Dr Katherine Hoover. She moved to West Virginia in the midst of a legal battle to keep her medical licence in Florida after she was accused of having asked a 17-year-old patient to have sex with her son.</p> <p>Hatcher said Hoover immediately prescribed him opioids and rapidly increased the dosage. He said he was alert to the dangers because he once counselled drug addicts but he trusted the doctor and assumed he would be safe if he diligently followed the prescription. Yet within six months he was addicted to the opioids.</p> <p>\u201cI had to have that pill every morning to get out of bed, to function. To go without it, the physical pain. Oh gosh. Your hands is jerking. You feel the cramps in your arms and your legs. The anxiety. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what am I going to do here? It\u2019s real bad. I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s the worst time of my life,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re not going to fight the doctor giving them to you when you\u2019re addicted to them</p> <footer> <cite>Wilbert Hatcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hatcher said his head told him he needed to get off the drugs and he hoped the doctor would reduce his prescription. Instead, he found that Hoover barely examined him and then stopped bothering to see him at all \u2013 instead leaving prescriptions for him to pick up for cash without a consultation. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re taking them, you\u2019re not going to fight the doctor giving them to you when you\u2019re addicted to them. You\u2019re not going say stop giving them to me,\u201d he said. Like many of those hooked on opioids, Hatcher needed ever-increasing doses to satisfy the addiction. Eventually, he looked to the black market to top up his prescriptions. \u201cYou can go out on the streets and get it. I\u2019ve done it. There are people in my life that I would never have associated with. There are people that couldn\u2019t get five minutes of my time because I knew what they were doing. These were drug dealers. But now these people are in my circle because they have the pills I need,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew who had them. This is my town. This is where I grew up. You knew who they were.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/25/opioid-epidemic-prescription-painkillers-heroin-addiction\">How cracking down on America's painkiller capital led to a heroin crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The drugs took over much of his life. They were costing him large amounts of money but also time with his children because he would spend hours waiting for dealers. His answer was to quit a well-paying but demanding position as assistant manager at Walmart and take a $10-an-hour job in an auto parts store.</p> <p>Hatcher weaned himself off the drugs with the help of counseling in 2013. He got his job back at Walmart but regards those years as a lost decade.</p> <p>\u201cI could have been the store manager by now. But when your mind is not functioning correctly, you\u2019re not thinking clearly, you lose that opportunity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lawyers for the doctors, pharmacies and pain clinics named in the legal action claim that Hatcher\u2019s addiction was his own fault. They say he and other addicts abused the drugs by buying some illegally, grinding them up to get a more powerful high or \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d in search of several prescriptions at once. </p> <p>\u201cThe very core of (their) alleged claims stem from their own criminal, illegal and immoral activity,\u201d the defendants said in court papers.</p> <p>Cagle does not deny that some, but not all, of his clients misused drugs before their opioid addiction. But he said that neither justifies prescribing them opioids for years on end nor the circumstances of other plaintiffs who never touched illegal drugs and only became hooked on painkillers after seeking treatment for work injuries or car accidents.</p> <p>Cagle contends that the doctors and pharmacists knew just how addictive the drugs were but kept on prescribing and dispensing them in large quantities because they were making big profits. Hatcher says the claim he became an addict because he abused drugs is back to front. He and others say they became addicted while following the prescriptions and only once they were hooked did they abuse drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a circle. You go to the doctor and they bill you. The pharmacy, they\u2019re a part of it because they were giving out a whole bunch of pills. It\u2019s business,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is spit town. How many pills were they selling? Enough for a major city. This is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018No medicine was practiced at her office\u2019</h2> <p>The Wellness Center, later renamed Mountain Medical Care, was shut down after a federal raid in 2010. Federal prosecutors who convicted some doctors and an administrator at the clinic described it as a moneymaking machine, raking in more $4.5m a year as word spread beyond Williamson that opioid prescriptions could be had with ease. In legal papers to seize Hoover\u2019s assets, federal officials said she prescribed more pain medication than any other doctor in West Virginia during the 2000s.</p> <p>Among her other patients was Willis Duncan, who worked as an electrician in coal mines for more than 30 years until he was referred to the clinic after he suffered a crushed sternum and broken ribs in a work accident.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d get to the clinic at five o\u2019clock in the morning. They didn\u2019t open till eight o\u2019clock, but at five o\u2019clock there would be a hundred people there waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could tell them your dick hurts and they would write you a script. The doctor\u2019s signature was already on it when you went in.\u201d</p> <p>Federal investigators said the doctors frequently did not even see the patients they were writing prescriptions for. Hatcher and Duncan both noticed that after handing over cash they picked up prescriptions signed by a Dr William Ryckman, who had never examined them. Ryckman, one of Vinson\u2019s first hires, lived nearly 300 miles from the clinic in Pennsylvania and was later convicted of sending blank prescriptions to the clinic which assistants filled in with patients\u2019 details. He was jailed for six months and lost his medical licence. The authorities also found a bank account with Ryckman\u2019s name on it and more than $1m in cash deposits but he denied knowledge of it. </p> <p>Another Williamson doctor, Diane Shafer, who Ryckman said in his deposition was married to Vinson, at one time wrote more painkiller prescriptions than some hospitals in West Virginia.</p> <p>\u201cShafer simply handed out prescriptions in exchange for cash, even pre-signing scripts for patient files,\u201d said the lawsuit against her for allegedly contributing to the death of a patient. \u201cNo medicine was practiced at her office.\u201d</p> <p>Shafer was arrested, admitted to illegally prescribing opioids and was sentenced to six months in federal prison. She has been barred from practicing medicine after surrendering her licence. </p> <p>Hatcher, Duncan and the other plaintiffs contend that the doctors were only part of the problem. They allege the pain clinics were working in league with drug stores, which also made large profits from selling the opioids. The lawsuit calls them \u201camong the most grossly negligent pharmacies in America\u201d.</p> <p>One was a small stone building on Williamson\u2019s main street, Tug Valley Pharmacy, which became notorious in the town for the long lines of out of state cars at its drive-through window. Its owner, Randy Ballengee, said in a deposition that he filled up to 200 prescriptions a day from the Wellness Clinic but did not know that it was widely spoken of locally as a \u201cpill mill\u201d. Witnesses testified that drug deals were openly made outside the pharmacy and that prescriptions were refilled early for cash. </p> <p>Hatcher used another pharmacy in the neighbouring town of South Williamson, just across the border in Kentucky. Its owner, Larry Ray Barnett, who has since died, also claimed in a deposition not to know about the pain clinic\u2019s reputation. But federal authorities said both pharmacies made large profits off of opioids. Duncan was earning $2,500 a week working in the mines but estimates he was spending close to a $1,000 on pills.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They all worked together.

Vinson today denies he did anything of the sort but said he pleaded guilty to protect his mother because a \u201cmalicious\u201d federal government threatened to indict her too. Vinson\u2019s mother, Joyce Vinson, owned the building with the clinic until she died in 2006 and Henry inherited it. Four years later he agreed to relinquish the $1m property to the government in return for a guarantee that he would not be prosecuted for whatever criminal activities may have taken place at the Wellness Center.</p> <p>Today, Vinson denies having any direct role in setting up or running the clinic. \u201cI have never been in the clinic business. I have never been in that practice. I would think it\u2019s a doctor\u2019s responsibility to see patients and if there\u2019s a patient care issue, I would think that\u2019s between the physician and a patient,\u201d he said. </p> <p> Hoover left the US for the Bahamas. Federal authorities seized her assets and she was stripped of her medical licence over the allegations she pressured a patient to have sex with her son. Hoover has defended the prescriptions as legitimate. </p> <p>A similar pattern played out across West Virginia. By the 2000s, the Sav-Rite pharmacy in Kermit, a town half an hour\u2019s drive north of Williamson with a population of little more than 300, was among the top 25 dispensers of hydrocodone opioid pain medication in the entire country. Federal investigators later accused the pharmacist, James Wooley, of working in concert with the owner of a local medical centre, Debra Justice. The pair allegedly \u201chatched a get rich(er) quick scheme to open a pain clinic that would refer all of its prescriptions for controlled substances to Sav-Rite Kermit\u201d. Investigators said the clinic and pharmacy were \u201chanding out drugs like candy\u201d.</p> <p>At its peak, Sav-Rite was selling more than 3m dosages of hydrocodone a year, earning $6.5m, in an impoverished town of a few hundred people. Investigators said there was so much cash receptionists had difficulty closing the till.</p> <p>Key to the success of the scheme was to find doctors prepared to cooperate. One of them was Dr Donald Kiser. Among the prescriptions he wrote was one for $500 worth of opioids and valium for William Preece, a former coal miner who had been injured in a work accident. </p> <p>Preece overdosed on the drugs the next day. It came just two weeks after Preece had received an earlier prescription for opioids originally prescribed for an injury as a coal miner after he was caught in a rock fall. </p> <p>Preece\u2019s sister, Debbie, said he fought hard to shake the addiction, including attending a methadone clinic. But he kept returning to the pills and the pain clinic kept giving him prescriptions. \u201cI get emotional about it because I can\u2019t get over it,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cAfter he was not able to work in the mines, he opened a little store for a living. Then he ended up losing his home, his store, everything he had due to the addiction ... Wooley\u2019s clinic, the Sav-Rite, was a like a circus. They even handed out popcorn to people waiting in line. You would see licence plates from everywhere. Virginia. Ohio. Tennessee.

The attorney general\u2019s office has sued a dozen firms which between them delivered more than 200m opioid pills to West Virginia in the five years to 2012. The lawsuits alleged that the companies knew large numbers of the drugs were sold by \u201cnotorious pill mills\u201d but were more interested in profit. </p> <p>\u201cIt is this whole chain of manufacturers, doctors, distributors, wholesalers,\u201d said Francis Hughes, the state\u2019s former chief deputy attorney general who was instrumental in the legal actions. \u201cWe were seeing drugstores that were located in a town where the population is 365 running millions of dollars a month through the drugstore selling opiates.

  "<p>Over the 11 years that Angela Merkel has been at the top of German politics, steering her country through global financial crashes, European debt crises and the aftershocks of wars in the Middle East, she has been able to rely on one constant: the loyalty of her party. If Merkel\u2019s reign has looked so solid, it has partly been because the Christian Democrat leader hasn\u2019t had to see off challenges from within her own ranks.</p> <p>But one year on from the height of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">Europe\u2019s refugee crisis</a>, that situation is changing. While Merkel\u2019s ratings are still strong enough for only a minority to expect her not to run for re-election next year, her liberal stance on the refugee question has for the first time opened up a political space for a challenger from her own party.</p> <p>Over the summer, the darkening tone of Germany\u2019s political debate has been set not by Merkel\u2019s optimistic slogan of \u201cwe will manage\u201d, but by a politician who describes himself as a \u201cburkaphobe\u201d, who calls on Muslim men to be less uptight about showering naked in public gyms, and criticises his leader\u2019s crisis management in all but name. Meet Jens Spahn, the MP for Steinfurt and Borken, deputy finance minister and, if some commentators are to be believed, Germany\u2019s chancellor-in-waiting.</p> <p>Defending the partial ban of the full-face veil that the government wants to introduce following his proposal, he says bluntly: \u201cGermany may not be the right country for those who want to keep their wife in a burka or niqab, especially now that we have become such a sought-after destination for so many. We need to send some strong signals about what is acceptable and what isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThe German people want to help refugees, but they want to help in an orderly way.\u201d</p> <p>Only 36 and openly gay, Spahn may not seem the most likely candidate to lead a conservative rebellion within Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union. \u201cA political path like mine would certainly have been rockier 10 years ago,\u201d he admitted. When he first ran as a candidate in the deeply Catholic M\u00fcnsterland region, some in his party ran a smear campaign to stop him. \u201cObviously, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7b6bc52e1008108b606d9574ada34c4bae381b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b6bc52e1008108b606d9574ada34c4bae381b4/0_271_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Syrian refugee with a picture of Merkel after reaching Munich in September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Syrian refugee with a picture of Merkel after reaching Munich in September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he rejects the idea that his lifestyle runs counter to his politics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the contradiction. Germany\u2019s dominant culture and lifestyle has become a lot more liberal in the last 10 years, whether you are looking at gays and lesbians or at immigration. But my biggest fear is that this new openness is under pressure \u2013 from a very conservative form of Islam and a rightwing backlash against immigration \u2013 and that we will have to fight very hard to preserve it.\u201d When criticising cultural norms in the Arabic world, he deliberately uses the word <em>spiessig</em>, meaning prissy or narrow-minded \u2013 a term in the past often associated with his own party.</p> <p>With a combativeness that can border on arrogance, Spahn first gained a profile as the CDU\u2019s health policy spokesman, repeatedly calling for reforms of the pension system and data protection regulation \u2013 usually two holy cows in German political debate. Having looked like a shoo-in for a ministerial post, Spahn was parked in a junior role in the finance ministry after the 2013 federal election \u2013 a move that some read as a slapdown for the uppity young politician. But in his current role, reporting to influential veteran finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Spahn has been granted a licence to roam across the political field, holding forth on anything from dual citizenship to raising the pension age.</p> <p>Coming from a party that has never openly rebelled against its leader, Spahn is still careful in phrasing criticism of the government. He insisted that he hoped Merkel would run again at the federal elections in 2017 and vehemently rejected the notion that Germany made a \u201cmistake\u201d at the height of the refugee crisis: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/angela-merkel-defends-germanys-handling-of-refugee-influx\" title=\"\">decision of 4 September</a> was correct and logical,\u201d he says. The \u201cbut\u201d is not long in the coming. \u201cBut we should have been quicker to make clear that it was an exceptional situation.</p> <p>\u201cWe all underestimated the power of how mobile phones and social media could change migration movements \u2026 It is certainly not false that no one in Germany had predicted the extent to which other countries were not prepared to help with the refugee crisis.\u201d</p> <p>But his demands on the party leader are unequivocal. \u201cIt is very important that the German government makes it clear that we have won back control since September and October last year, when we had clearly lost control of the situation due to irregular immigration on the Greek-Turkish border,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important that we make clear we are aware of the vast challenge of integration.

While he said there was \u201cnothing I regret more than Britain leaving the European Union\u201d, he criticised politicians \u201cputting the boot into Britain\u201d. Instead, he said, \u201cwe should ask what drove so many people to say: \u2018That European Union is not my own.\u2019 That\u2019s the debate we should be having in Germany, too: does Germany want to be part of a European Union that a majority of Brits don\u2019t feel belongs to them?\u201d</p> <p>In words that will be received with interest in the offices of the British \u201cBrexit ministers\u201d, David Davis and Liam Fox, Spahn appeared supportive of the idea of Britain leaving the single market and instead negotiating a bespoke, \u201cCanada-style\u201d trade deal with the EU. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the one-for-one rules of the single market without free movement. And if you want to have the single market, why leave in the first place? Because in that case you would have to subscribe to the very same rules that are being decided in Brussels without having a say. You may want that, but it wouldn\u2019t make much sense.</p> <p>\u201cBoth sides, and especially Germany, have a great interest in strong economic ties. If you can have a free trade agreement with the US, with Canada, and even with communistic Vietnam, then we\u2019ll get a sensible trade agreement with Great Britain if the will is there.\u201d</p> <p>Spahn dismissed the EU\u2019s delays in ratifying a free-trade deal with America and Canada as uniquely German reservations rooted in anti-American prejudice. Striking a deal with Britain, he said, would be easier to communicate politically. \u201cMost Germans have a positive image of Britain, and I don\u2019t think the majority of Germans are against free trade, per se.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Spahn said it should be up to the EU to negotiate such a deal. \u201cIf you say the European Union is responsible for free-trade deals, which it is, and the European parliament has got democratic legitimacy too, then it would be up to the EU to negotiate such a deal with Great Britain. But before we start talking about how we can start to couple again, we need to talk about the decoupling first.\u201d</p> <h2>RISE OF JENS SPAHN</h2> <p>16 May 1980 Born in Ahaus near M\u00fcnster, then in West Germany.</p> <p>1997 Became a member of the Christian Democratic Union.</p> <p>2002 Elected to parliament for the constituency of Steinfurt and Borken in North Rhine-Westphalia.</p> <p>2003-08 Studied political science and law at the university of Hagen, graduating with a master\u2019s degree.</p> <p>2012 His homosexuality made public in an article in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.</p> <p>2015 Appointed deputy minister in the finance ministry.</p>",

And yet, among the traditional battleground states, Iowa has become perhaps Trump\u2019s best hope of a win. While <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">national polls</a> show the Republican far behind his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_trump_vs_clinton-5597.html\">recent Iowa polls</a> have the candidates neck and neck.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s strong position is in part due to the fact that unlike in other swing states, the Iowan Republican establishment has rallied conclusively behind him. </p> <p>On Saturday at the Roast and Ride, a fundraiser featuring pork sandwiches and motorcycles held on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/03/joni-ernst-pig-castrator-iowa-win-senate-republicans\">the freshman senator Joni Ernst</a>, every major Iowa Republican was present. All three US representatives and both senators rallied behind Trump. So did Terry Branstad, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/14/meet-iowa-gov-terry-branstad-who-as-of-monday-is-americas-longest-serving-governor/\">longest-serving</a> governor in American history. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">Donald Trump politicizes death of Dwyane Wade's cousin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Trump only midway through a speech that touched on hot issues such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">immigration policy</a> and his attempt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">to appeal to African American voters</a>, things almost became awkward: Branstad, Ernst, congressman Steve King, lieutenant governor Kim Reynolds and state party chair Jeff Kaufmann all gathered behind the candidate, squeezing in for a photo opportunity.</p> <p>As Kaufmann told the Guardian, this rare embrace of a candidate who blew the establishment to pieces in primary season and has not dialled down his rhetoric or style since came about thanks to Iowa\u2019s vulnerable status as the state that kicks off each presidential election. </p> <p>\u201cAs a first-in-the-nation state,\u201d Kaufmann said, \u201cour folks are discerning and even our officeholders dig a little bit deeper.\u201d </p> <p>However, the real fuel for Iowa Republicans\u2019 love for Trump is to be found in the strong ties between the candidate and Branstad. The governor has long been an enthusiastic supporter and has stumped the state on thebusinessman\u2019s behalf. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s Iowa campaign director is Branstad\u2019s son, Eric, a veteran operative who during the caucuses led a bipartisan advocacy campaign on behalf of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/iowa-caucus-corn-ethanol-republicans-democrats-ted-cruz\">the renewable fuels industry</a>. In Iowa at least, as election day approaches, Trump can count on the party machinery going into fully into gear.</p> <p>This is not to say Iowa Republicans are unfamiliar with intra-party conflict, and a vocal \u201cNever Trump\u201d contingent is to be found among those who supported Ted Cruz, the victor of the caucuses. But it receives no establishment support. Even congressmen in swing districts are happy to appear with Trump.</p> <p>In contrast, Democrats are off the pace they set in the past two election cycles, regarding organizational goals like absentee ballot requests and thanks to lingering bad blood from the caucuses, when many supporters of Bernie Sanders felt the state party chair, Andy McGuire, tilted the scales on Clinton\u2019s behalf. There is open campaigning to replace McGuire after the presidential vote.</p> <h2>Blue collar, white voter \u2026 red state?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6f14ee228d1c8150ab7d80337f6ccf224d69658\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f14ee228d1c8150ab7d80337f6ccf224d69658/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man and child wait for Trump to speak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man and child wait for Trump to speak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent decades Iowa has seen almost no demographic change. Ninety-one per cent white, it was one of a handful of states where Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/nov/07/obama-reelection-senate-democrats-live\">won a majority of white voters four years ago</a>. But many of the blue-collar white voters who have traditionally voted Democratic in the eastern part of the state are increasingly attracted to Trump. </p> <p>In fading factory towns like Dubuque and Waterloo, long bastions of Democratic support, Trump\u2019s anti-free trade and anti-immigration message is increasingly finding an audience. </p> <p>In the suburbs of Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, meanwhile, he is not losing many moderate Republicans \u2013 mostly because such areas are home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/09/iowa-senator-ted-cruz-republican-presidential-caucus\">significant numbers of evangelical Christians</a>, to whom Clinton is simply anathema. If such voters do not vote for a third party candidate or stay home, Trump will be their man.</p> <p>New Trump supporters have, however, presented new challenges. Traditionally, Republican operatives scorn Democratic campaigns, which tend to be based on hiring hundreds of staffers to go door to door, getting marginal voters to sign up for absentee ballot requests. Republican voters have been far more consistent, meaning the party\u2019s campaigns have instead focused on tapping into networks of social conservatives, in particular home-schoolers. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-comments-death-nba-dwyane-wade-cousin-political-speech-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xt4d\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2690131\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump comments on death of Dwyane Wade's cousin \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c2a9eee4b0655f72768734\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/28/160828TrumpWade_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572764&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572764&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-comments-death-nba-dwyane-wade-cousin-political-speech-video\">Donald Trump comments on death of Dwyane Wade\u2019s cousin \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Now, with social conservatives less enthusiastic about Trump than other Republicans, the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts in Iowa must become non-traditional \u2013 in effect, Democratic-style efforts meant to turn out former Democrats. </p> <p>This shift has been buoyed by what Kauffman, the Republican Iowa state chair, sees as a \u201cresurgence of rural populism\u201d. Iowa has a long and bipartisan history of rabble-rousing, going back to the 1890s. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, farmers held dramatic strikes and even kidnapped a judge who presided over foreclosures. In parts of the state, martial law was declared. That tradition had receded, but Kaufmann has seen Trump hauling it back to the surface.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/republican-donors-trump-congress-local-races-sheldon-adelson\">Turned off by Trump: Republican mega-donors focus on congressional races</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Republican gains are borne out in registration figures. Since November 2012, Democratic voter registration in Iowa has fallen by 15,000. In the same time, Republicans have picked up almost 20,000 voters. This effort has been helped by two strong midterm results, eradicating the Democratic bench and leaving the party holding only one of the state\u2019s four congressional seats.</p> <p>In the shifting political math of 2016, all this makes Iowa far more winnable for Trump than many traditionally more competitive states. Accordingly, his campaign has committed significant resources. It is expected that Trump will campaign in the state three or four times a month until election day. Saturday\u2019s Roast and Ride was a taster.</p> <p>Even if this is not enough, and Trump loses Iowa, the coalition he has built may point to a long-term shift which will make the state less purple and more red. As Kaufmann said, win or lose: \u201cI think we have the ingredients for a realignment.\u201d</p> <p>That was a statement with which one well-connected Democrat agreed, though he did not want to attach his name to such an opinion. As he said mournfully this weekend: \u201cIncreasingly, it seems like it is a Republican state and they just let Democrats live here.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In Edinburgh, where I write this, there is concern that the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://calvertjournal.com/news/show/6554/russian-sputnik-news-agency-moves-uk-headquarters-to-edinburgh\">newly opened branch of the Kremlin-backed news agency Sputnik</a> is intended specifically to destabilise post-Brexit English-Scottish relations.

We can handle this one ourselves!!\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, let us compare the contrasting media manipulation strategies of Putin\u2019s Russia and, for example, the Labour party, both of them organisations that have, at times, abandoned their leftwing core beliefs in an attempt to adapt to a shifting geopolitical landscape. If last week\u2019s news is to be believed, Russia\u2019s control of media extends as far as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/23/fbi-new-york-times-hack-russia\">hacking staff at the <em>New York Times</em></a>. As well as the Kremlin getting to see funny cartoons of representational figures holding up signs with writing on them hours ahead of the rest of us, could this hack also mean Russia could plant false stories into American media at source?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a long tradition of essentially dishonest photo opportunities being used to cement policy in the public mind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is Donald Trump, for example, whose rise is fuelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nuclear-football-donald-trump\">fears of forthcoming global nuclear war</a>, actually a fictional creation of Russian propagandists intended to destabilise the west? Oddly, this is a more comforting proposition than the idea that he really exists.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2015, it was suggested that Putin\u2019s deliberately penis-shaped submarines, designed specifically to subconsciously exaggerate our perceptions of Russian genitalia, are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html?_r=0\">poking around the transatlantic data cables</a> to ensure the maverick anarcho-superpower\u2019s ability to cut continental Europe off from America. Two campaigns working in opposition might then mean American media were full of Russian lies that we in Europe weren\u2019t actually able to view.</p> <p>On the other hand, this kind of strategy would be typical of Putin\u2019s propaganda guru Vladislav Surkov, a surrealist artist who, despite dressing like a disgraced <em>Top Gear</em> presenter, uses creatively chaotic double-think to sculpt our perceptions of Russia as determinedly as Richard Dreyfuss <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yecJLI-GRuU\">mushes mashed potato into mountains</a> in C<em>lose Encounters of the Third Kind.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9f2388443cb9200380101cbd7ee67c6f0221888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9f2388443cb9200380101cbd7ee67c6f0221888/0_0_1884_2817/669.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the one hand, dope-fiend Russian athletes\u2019 disqualification from the Rio feelgood festival was embarrassing; on the other, it creates the impression of a country of unpredictable law-defying crazies so convincingly Surkov himself may have masterminded it. There\u2019s no way of knowing anymore. Surkov may even have written this. I may actually be him without my even knowing it.</p> <p>In March 2015, I wrote, for this paper, a silly fantasy about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/01/vladimir-putin-effigy-naked-back-yard-stewart-lee\">a giant statue of a naked Putin landing in my garden.</a> Reading the below-the-line internet comments later, I realised how thorough Russia\u2019s determination to muddy the waters of opinion was; many of them were clearly generated by almost-literate Kremlin cyber-slaves, rather than by the usual neoliberal trolls taking time off from masturbating over old videos of Toby Young on a rowing reality TV show.</p> <p>Briefly, I adopted a strategy of writing borderline meaningless gibberish about Russia to try and provoke weird responses from the full-time Kremlin-backed commenters. Indeed, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/07/fifa-eurovision-corruption-schools-academies-stewart-lee\">a column about the Eurovision Song Contest</a> three months later I discreetly included the following irrelevant paragraph: \u201cOne may as well give the kosovorotka-marinading wazzocks something incomprehensible to feed to their bewildered brainstems. To me, then, Vladimir Putin is a giant, prolapsed female worker bee that sucks hot ridicule out of langoustines\u2019 cephalothoraxes. Let\u2019s see what crunchy, expansionist lavatory honey this notion causes the parthenogenetic Russian keyboard wendigos to inflate for us this week, in the shadow of Paul McGann and his art gnome.\u201d</p> <p>The problem here was twofold. Firstly, many <em>Observer</em> readers found this nonsense indistinguishable from my usual writing.

Meanwhile, here at home, Jeremy Corbyn is filmed sitting on the floor of a train.</p> <p>There is a long tradition of essentially dishonest photo opportunities being used by politicians to cement policy in the public mind.

In 2006, David Cameron, who went on to ruin Britain for ever, was photographed in Norway <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/20/david-cameron-hug-a-husky-green-legacy-10-years\">hugging a husky</a>, as he launched the lie that he was unleashing the \u201cgreenest government ever\u201d.

(Indeed, now I find myself wondering, was Vladislav Surkov himself the unnamed source of the bought biographer Isabel Oakeshott\u2019s Cameron pig-sex-face story? Or is Isabel Oakeshott herself a Kremlin creation? What kind of name is \u201cIsabel Oakeshott\u201d?

Our left needs to raise its game.

Johnson demands in his letter to McLoughlin that the party publish the full report, not just a summary.</p> <p>Johnson said: \u201cThis is a very \u2018selective\u2019 publication, which does nothing to answer the many issues that arise from the death of our son, it reads as if its principal objective is to absolve the Conservative party\u2019s senior management and senior volunteers of any responsibility \u2013 and somewhat inconsistently, with blame being attributed to failures in process, or more sinisterly, upon more junior officials for not progressing complaints prior to August 2015, which in itself should shame your party.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe as a family had no illusions about the outcome of this \u2018whitewash\u2019, which is why we decided not to take part in it. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, many people did, with reservations, give evidence and some have made contact with us to express their dissatisfaction with its outcome, at least one saying that the \u2018summary\u2019 did not reflect their evidence. </p> <p>\u201cIn the interests of transparency and accountability, and to satisfy those witnesses who are unhappy with the report\u2019s \u2018summary\u2019, it is now incumbent upon the Conservative party to release the \u2018full\u2019 report and its evidence (respecting the anonymity of those witnesses who have requested it), to ensure that this inquiry is seen to have been conducted properly and its \u2018gaps\u2019 in evidence fully explored.\u201d</p> <p>A month before he killed himself, Elliott complained to Conservative Campaign headquarters (CCHQ) about an alleged altercation with Clarke in the Marquis of Granby pub in Westminster. </p> <p>The Clifford Chance report reveals that upon receiving the complaint, Feldman, then co-chairman of the party, said he had \u201calways had the gravest possible reservations\u201d about Clarke \u2013 but in relation to his \u201ccompetence as a campaign organiser\u201d.</p> <p>Shapps appointed Clarke, a failed parliamentary candidate, in June 2014 to run RoadTrip2015, in which young activists were bussed around the country to rally support in marginal seats, despite reviewing Clarke\u2019s candidate file, which detailed allegations of aggressive and bullying behaviour when he stood in Tooting in 2010.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Feldman and Crosby, as well as the peer and former deputy chairman Stephen Gilbert, were among senior Conservatives who raised concerns about Clarke when it emerged he was falsely using the job title of \u201cdirector in CCHQ [Conservative Campaign HQ]\u201d, the inquiry found. In one email exchange between Shapps and Crosby, Shapps admitted Clarke was a \u201cdifficult individual who delivered\u201d and keeping him as RoadTrip director was a \u201ccalculated risk to be taken to help build the campaign network up\u201d.</p> <p>Clarke, who declined to be interviewed as part of the investigation, denied the allegations included in the report. <br></p> <p>His solicitor told the law firm: \u201cClarke has cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the police, the coroner and any other statutory body charged with investigating any matters relating to the subject matter of Clifford Chance\u2019s investigation on behalf of the Conservative party board.</p> <p>\u201cThe police investigation into Elliott Johnson\u2019s death and other inquiries are ongoing, and it is not appropriate to respond to allegations until the end of those processes. However, the allegations made against Mr Clarke in the Clifford Chance report are wholly untrue and unsubstantiated. Many are based on totally fabricated media reports.

In addition, China is preparing to launch another new rocket design, a new space station, an X-ray telescope and a crewed mission before the year is out.</p> <p>China is estimated to spend around $6bn a year on its space programme. Although that is almost $1bn more than Russia, it is still <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2015/05/world/china-space/\" title=\"\">a fraction of the American space budget,</a> which is around $40bn a year. Despite its large budget, the US made only 19 successful space launches in 2013, compared with China\u2019s 14 and Russia\u2019s 31.

Key to this will be the large manned space station, Tiangong, which they plan to have in orbit by then.

They are making strides in everything from human space flight to space science and planetary exploration.</p> <p>So do the Chinese want to take over space? Brian Harvey, space analyst and author of <em>China in Space: The Great Leap Forward</em>, believes the Chinese simply want to be seen as equals. \u201cTo use a Chinese phrase, I think they are wanting to bring their own mat to the table,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are looking for equality, they want respect from the world\u2019s space community.\u201d</p> <p>To that end, China\u2019s biggest inroad has been made with the ESA through the space science programme. Soon after the turn of the century. ESA launched <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/cluster/\" title=\"\">the Cluster mission</a> to study so-called \u201cspace weather\u201d and the electrical malfunctions this could cause on satellites. The Chinese were keen to learn more about space weather too and came to the European agency with a proposal: they would build extra satellites to enhance the Cluster mission if ESA would collaborate with them.</p> <p>\u201cThey understood that space weather was a key challenge as we rely more and more on technology in orbit,\u201d says Christopher Carr, a physicist at Imperial College, London, who worked on the Cluster mission. ESA took care of the negotiations, allowing scientists, including Carr, to build the instruments unhindered. Although there were some differences in working methods that had to be ironed out, Carr says: \u201cOverall it was an enjoyable collaboration.\u201d</p> <p>The Double Star mission was launched in 2003 and became China\u2019s first scientific satellite. Cluster and Double Star have so far produced 2,300 peer-reviewed science papers. \u201cThat is an enormously successful, astonishing scientific output,\u201d says Carr.</p> <p>China has gone from strength to strength. In December 2015, it launched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/28/spacewatch-china-dark-matter-particle-explorer-dampe\" title=\"\">Dark Matter Particle Explorer</a>, a satellite to look for the mysterious non-atomic matter that astronomers believe makes up a large fraction of the universe. This December, it plans to launch the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope to look for black holes. ESA and China are working together on a new mission \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ESA_and_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences_to_study_Smile_as_joint_mission\" title=\"\">Solar Wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer</a> (Smile), which is slated for launch in 2021.</p> <p>The Chinese know that the value of these collaborations extends way beyond the science. \u201cWe are the newcomers in space science, and don\u2019t have much experience,\u201d says Wang Chi. \u201cInternational collaborations are the shortcut for China to&#xa0;catch up with the world. In addition, science, especially space science, should be the responsibility of all humans around the globe. International collaboration is the effective way to obtain the maximum science return&#xa0;from any&#xa0;space mission.\u201d</p> <p>Favata agrees: \u201cAt ESA we collaborate with all major spacefaring nations. If Smile works well it is likely to be the pathfinder for future&#xa0;missions.\u201d</p> <p>In stark contrast is America, where there is a blanket ban on working with China that dates back years. The most obvious consequence of this has been the exclusion of China from the International Space Station. But far from slowing the Chinese down, the cold shoulder has actually speeded them up.</p> <p>Circling above us at the moment is the disused shell of China\u2019s first space station. The eight-ton Tiangong 1 (Heavenly Palace) was launched on 29 September 2011 and hosted two three-person crews between 2012 and 2013. It is now abandoned and expected to <a href=\"http://www.space.com/33140-china-tiangong-1-space-lab-falling-to-earth.html\" title=\"\">re-enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere some time later this year</a>.</p> <p>The Chinese will launch Tiangong 2, a second test station, next month. It will lead to a substantial orbital facility that will be in use by 2020. Known simply as Tiangong, it will be a key base for space research, with two large science modules joined together by a connecting service module.</p> <p>\u201cThey can do a lot of science on it. It will have a research capacity that the ISS didn\u2019t reach nearly as quickly,\u201d says Harvey.</p> <p>China is not planning to keep Tiangong all to itself. In June, it signed an agreement with the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs to open the station to experiments and astronauts from UN member states, specifically developing countries that find space too expensive at the moment.</p> <p>And running the experiments is where China\u2019s astronaut programme comes in. There have been just five crewed space flights since 2003, and none at all since 2013. This is deliberate. \u201cThe idea is to take a significant step forward each time,\u201d says Harvey, \u201cand they\u2019re not going to cut corners in terms of safety.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7554cd2b48f807982a41944139ba61c80c707cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7554cd2b48f807982a41944139ba61c80c707cf/159_58_2753_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Long March II-F rocket carrying the China\u2019s first space station module Tiangong-1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2011: the Long March II-F rocket carrying the China\u2019s first space station module Tiangong 1 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in north-west China\u2019s Gansu province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the next decade, the Tiangong space station is likely to be the principal destination. Their crew capsule is called Shenzhou (divine vessel). It looks similar to the Russian Soyuz modules probably because the Chinese bought Soyuz technology in the mid-90s. This same agreement saw the training of two Chinese astronauts at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia, who then returned to China and trained more astronauts themselves.</p> <p>Twelve Chinese astronauts have now been into space, including Liu Yang who became the first Chinese woman in space on Shenzhou 9 in 2012. Assuming the Tiangong 2 gets to orbit in September, then Shenzhou 11 will follow on 16 October, carrying two people whose identities have yet to be made public who are scheduled to spend a month on board.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think the military element in the Chinese space programme is quite overstated</p> <footer> <cite>Brian Harvey, space analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Looking to the future, the Chinese have already begun testing the larger replacement of the Shenzhou capsule. A scaled-down version flew on the June flight of the Long March 7 from Hainan. This larger vehicle will be capable of taking up to six crew to the full Tiangong space station or on missions to lunar orbit.</p> <p>It was the secondary payload, Aolong 1 (Roaming Dragon), on that launch that raised eyebrows, and stoked fears in some quarters that the civilian space programme is just a front for more covert operations. Aolong 1 has a robotic arm that can grab another satellite and guide it to burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Officially, it is to remove space debris from orbit but it could also be used as a weapon, bringing down a rival\u2019s satellite.</p> <p>Although this is true of any space debris removal system, doubts remain because China does not have an unblemished record in anti-satellite weaponry. In 2007, the Chinese shot down one of their own orbiting spacecraft in what was probably a thinly veiled warning to America. Chinese concerns had been growing since 2002 when the US withdrew from 1972\u2019s Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which paved the way for President George W Bush\u2019s administration to develop space-based weapons systems.</p> <p>Since that time, concern over China\u2019s militarisation of space has persisted in America. To others, however, that is little more than paranoia. \u201cI think the military element in the Chinese space programme is overstated,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cIt\u2019s based on a misreading of the fact that their facilities are protected by the military.

But now ESA has found a way to allow collaboration without the loss of control. It is \u201can elegant solution\u201d, says astrophysicist Graziella Branduardi-Raymont at University College London, who is working on Smile. \u201cChina builds the basic spacecraft and sends it to Europe.

The mainstay of their complement is gradually being replaced by the Long March 5, 6 and 7.</p> <p>While the Long March 7 in June was capable of lifting about 13 tonnes into low Earth orbit, it is the Long March 5 that analysts are really excited about. Due to make its maiden flight this autumn, it\u2019s capable of lifting 25 tonnes&#xa0;to low Earth orbit, rivalling anything the Americans, Russians or Europeans currently have. It is not yet known what the Long March 5 will send into orbit, but the giant rocket\u2019s second flight, scheduled for next year, will be carrying a very special cargo. It will be a robotic mission designed to land on the lunar surface and send&#xa0;back&#xa0;samples of moon rock to the&#xa0;Earth for Chinese scientists to&#xa0;analyse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe0d156ea144532d75f4aa827e99c3acd0996171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe0d156ea144532d75f4aa827e99c3acd0996171/0_0_2690_1774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"China\u2019s Shenzhou-10 rocket blasts off from the Jiuquan space centre in the Gobi Desert in June 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China\u2019s Shenzhou 10 rocket blasts off from the Jiuquan space centre in the Gobi Desert in June 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Chinese call their lunar exploration mission Chang\u2019e, after the Chinese goddess of the moon. In December 2013 Chang\u2019e 3 hit the headlines after it successfully deployed a small rover on the lunar surface. Despite some technical problems, it continued to return data until just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Now, China plans to land a similar mission on the far side of the Moon in 2018. This will be a world first. \u201cThe Russians did think about such a mission in the 1970s but they never got much further than paper studies. This is real, the spacecraft is already built,\u201d says Harvey.</p> <p>Also in the advanced planning stages is a rover to go to Mars. Pencilled in for launch in 2020, the Chinese Mars mission is going to find itself racing Nasa and the ESA, which have their own Mars rover missions launching that year too.</p> <p>But what about a human landing on the moon? There could be no bigger sign of Chinese competency than that. Sure, America did it almost 50 years ago but with each passing year Apollo seems to have less relevance to the modern exploration of space. Nasa has held back from committing to a new round of lunar landings. Russia and ESA would both like to go to the moon but can\u2019t go it alone. The Chinese, however, seem to have the lunar surface in their sights. Designs for a Long March 9 rocket are currently being studied. With the first launch for the Long March 9 due in 2025, China could very well be in a position to land astronauts on the moon by 2030. This puts it roughly neck-and-neck with America, which currently plans to send astronauts to lunar orbit in 2023 but which has made no commitment to returning to the surface.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5650cf318fb7174694b8cea9d894723c1b98fcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5650cf318fb7174694b8cea9d894723c1b98fcc/0_234_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liu Yang, China\u2019s first female astronaut, waves during a departure ceremony before becoming the first Chinese woman in space in June 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liu Yang, China\u2019s first female astronaut, waves during a departure ceremony before becoming the first Chinese woman in space in June 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost certainly this will be a flashpoint, but the ignition of a new space race would be a mistake. The Apollo programme of the 1960s cost the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars for little more than technological one-upmanship. Better&#xa0;now, surely, to cooperate, spreading the cost and the benefit across the world.</p> <p>The Chinese space programme is gaining momentum year upon year. Its power lies not in unlimited funds but in carefully chosen projects, and the pursuit of clearly targeted goals \u2013 something the traditional space powers could learn from, especially when is comes to the crewed programmes.</p> <p>At present there is no agreement on what to do when the current agreements to use the International Space Station come to an end in 2024. With America continuing to talk about hugely expensive missions to Mars, but with no real plans or budget in place to do this, Russia and ESA could increasingly find that their space ambitions are more aligned with those of the Chinese.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"303cb04e52aeb9e99df8e68406decd9ce5b1a00c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/303cb04e52aeb9e99df8e68406decd9ce5b1a00c/0_170_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mission control at the Jiuquan space centre in the Gobi Desert after China\u2019s longest manned space mission in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mission control at the Jiuquan space centre in the Gobi Desert after China\u2019s longest manned space mission in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is clear is that the Chinese space programme is more willing than ever to cooperate. With the signing of the UN agreement to host foreign experiments and eventually astronauts on their space station, the Chinese are opening up. It is of course hard to imagine Russia and in particular ESA abandoning Nasa altogether, but it is not inconceivable. In the aftermath of 2008\u2019s credit crunch, Nasa pulled out of a number of high-profile joint missions with Europe, including robotic Mars exploration and space-based observatories. This left ESA floundering for new partners, or frantically rescoping its missions. Increasingly, China will play a role in the international exploration of space,&#xa0;and although it is early days they have so far they have proved to be&#xa0;highly reliable.</p> <p>A seismic shift in space power is taking place. Europe could pivot either way or balance in the middle. Although most still talk about China \u201cbecoming\u201d a space superpower, it is likely that history will record the tipping point as 25 June this year, when a giant rocket split the sky amid the cheers of more than 20,000 tourists.</p>",
  "<p>It should now be possible to separate <a href=\"http://boysdontcry.co/\" title=\"\">Frank Ocean</a>\u2019s new album from the eye-poppingly pretentious way in which it was released. There were months of false starts, then a cryptic video about the album\u2019s construction which showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/04/decoding-frank-ocean-secret-messages-boomboxes-boys-dont-cry\" title=\"\">Ocean lathing away at mysterious lumps of wood</a>.

In the album credits, Ocean thanks pretty much everyone in popular music <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/67663-frank-oceans-blonde-credits-bowie-kanye-jamie-xx-kendrick-lamar-the-beatles-more/\" title=\"\">from Bowie to the Beatles</a> \u2013 but he neglects to say who\u2019s doing what, or if they\u2019re doing anything at all. Cue more online debate and wonderment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The largely beatless tracks reveal themselves as lush and atmospheric over time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite all this, Ocean has managed to preserve the musical personality that marked him out as special on 2012\u2019s immersive, psychedelic R&amp;B game-changer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/15/frank-ocean-channel-orange-review\" title=\"\"><em>Channel Orange</em></a>. There is still the powerful sense of a veiled introvert, and of the unlikely intimacy he achieves within this pose. You find yourself caring anew about the \u201cI\u201d of these songs, who is reflected in snatches of impressionistic poetry, in sunlight, summer smoke and boxer shorts. Solo is the sweet, homoerotically charged account of the space left behind by a toking buddy who is gone (\u201cNow your baby momma ain\u2019t so vicious, all she wants is her picket fence\u201d)\u200b. Seigfried captures a feeling of cosmic detachment: \u201cI can\u2019t relate to my peers/ I\u2019d rather live outside/ I\u2019d rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here.\u201d <em>Blonde</em> is a collection of quiet moments from the man who\u2019s worked hard to make himself the most talked about thing on the internet. In his songs, Ocean is not in control. In fact, he is attractively lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Watch the video for Frank Ocean's Nikes\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.itunes.apple.com/us/embedded-player/idsa.06571398-669c-11e6-9b66-283cdffd1e01\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/post/idsa.06571398-669c-11e6-9b66-283cdffd1e01\">Watch the video for Frank Ocean\u2019s Nikes.</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The largely beatless tracks are more abstract than those on <em>Channel Orange</em>, and reveal themselves as lush and atmospheric over time. There\u2019s church music in their DNA: Nights (\u201cI wanna see Nirvana, but don\u2019t wanna die yet\u201d) ends with a polyphony of Franks, like a gospel choir warming up in an empty hall. Pretty Sweet reaches heights of holy dissonance with an off-key children\u2019s choir, a sound-clash reflected in the mad, atonal piano of Andr\u00e9 3000 (the only instantly recognisable guest) on Solo (Reprise). Other interludes are expendable, such as Facebook Story, in which the French producer SebastiAn recites a moronic modern parable about social media. Choruses by the Beatles and the Carpenters are stripped of their words and worked into new songs, but these tricks add little, when Ocean already knows how to write a tune like Stevie Wonder (Skyline To).</p> <p>We care more about the circumstances of an album\u2019s release these days than the music itself. Hopefully, Ocean\u2019s latest journey in cerebral, non-macho, boundary-free R&amp;B will be heard long after the fuss has died down.</p>",

Manny Shinwell, the famous Red Clydesider, is one of few people who was not a prime minister to have a bust in parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see that and be part of that heritage,\u201d says Berger, who has read all of her great-uncle\u2019s books. He was also, she points out, the last parliamentarian to throw a punch in the chamber. Shinwell, who was of Polish-Jewish extraction, took exception to a Tory MP telling him to \u201cget back to Poland\u201d and lashed out. \u201cAnd good for him!\u201d says Berger.</p> <p>Were he alive, Shinwell would be as proud of his great-niece\u2019s defiance as she is of his, given the scale of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/27/internet-troll-jail-violent-antisemitic-threats-labour-mp-luciana-berger\">antisemitic provocation she, too, has had to endure</a>. Three men have been convicted of abuse against her and there\u2019s even been an international social media campaign \u2013 #FilthyJewBitch \u2013 organised against her. But that is not the only reason that Berger, who resigned as Labour\u2019s shadow minister for mental health following Brexit, has been targeted. An atmosphere of contempt and violent aggression has recently begun to pervade political discourse. The most extreme illustration of it was the murder of politician Jo Cox, but others have had to endure aggressive and misogynistic intimidation. None more so than Luciana Berger. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of being young, female and Jewish,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d says Berger, who was the director of Labour Friends of Israel for three years before becoming an MP, handing over her phone. She shows me a website which contains a vitriolic catalogue of messages, urging people to tell her \u2013 and I can\u2019t even repeat what they call her \u2013 that Hitler was right \u2013 six million times.</p> <p>The campaign, organised because antisemites were angry at one of their own being jailed for abusing Berger, has been online since 2014. Could Twitter do more to control it? \u201cOf course they could!\u201d Berger says. The effects of receiving these messages go deep. \u201cIt\u2019s personal and sometimes very extreme in its nature. Sometimes it\u2019s pornographic, sometimes violent, often very misogynistic. At its peak, there were 2,500 tweets. Some people who were shown just one message couldn\u2019t believe it, so to receive thousands is difficult.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"85a6cc67876657936501ef1142cc8f25621b8d64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a6cc67876657936501ef1142cc8f25621b8d64/0_0_710_868/409.jpg\" alt=\"Garron Helm was jailed in 2014 for sending this antisemitic tweet to Berger.\" width=\"409\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garron Helm was jailed in 2014 for sending this antisemitic tweet to Berger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screen grab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Difficult, too, for her family. We\u2019re sitting in Berger\u2019s constituency office in Wavertree, Liverpool but, a few weeks before I\u2019d gone to watch her at the mayoral hustings. \u201cWhere\u2019s Luciana\u2019s husband?\u201d I asked her adviser, looking round for someone who might approximate to the male equivalent of a politician\u2019s wife. \u201cThat\u2019s Alistair,\u201d said the adviser, pointing to a laid-back figure in jeans and T-shirt. They met at a music industry event and he contacted her afterwards, claiming she\u2019d given him the eye. Had she, I asked her. \u201cWhen I got the message on Facebook, I didn\u2019t even know who he was! I kept refusing to go out with him but he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p> <p>Alistair says politics isn\u2019t the full Luciana. \u201cShe\u2019s very funny \u2013 a cool person.\u201d And the abuse she receives? \u201cShe has a lot of strength. She won\u2019t combat hate with hate.\u201d Then his tone darkens. \u201cI can\u2019t repeat what I\u2019d say behind closed doors.\u201d</p> <p>The first time I visit Liverpool to meet Berger, a massive cruise ship is sitting in the docks, a glitzy illustration of the regeneration of this area. The lights of smart hotels and restaurants bob in inky water, and the iconic bronze-cast Liver birds look down from above on the city\u2019s Liver building. Arguments rage, however, about how real this development is; whether it is slick and superficial or has reached deep into the city\u2019s deprivation. Liverpool belongs to Labour, a part of leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s heartland. Even Derek Hatton, the old ex-deputy leader of Liverpool city council who was expelled for his membership of Militant, wants to finally vacate the 80s and rejoin Labour these days.</p> <p>But Corbyn\u2019s Labour party has heralded strangely intimidating times, and resulted in new attacks on Berger who is supporting Owen Smith in the current leadership election. Almost half of Labour\u2019s 99 female MPs (including Berger) signed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/female-labour-mps-call-on-jeremy-corbyn-to-act-over-escalating-abuse\">a letter to Corbyn deploring the party\u2019s bullying culture</a> and accusing him of not doing enough to stop threats against women by his supporters. \u201cI\u2019m very worried about the future for women in politics,\u201d admits Berger, who joined parliament in 2010 as one of 64 new Labour MPs \u2013 32 men and 32 women. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely got uglier. People feel they have permission to say the most awful things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3974f359807817c2a71e843f31654d1745561104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3974f359807817c2a71e843f31654d1745561104/0_81_1852_1111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Nimmo, who messaged Berger saying she would \u2018get it like Jo Cox\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Nimmo, who messaged Berger saying she would \u2018get it like Jo Cox\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That tone has been evident in recent Labour party mayoral nomination elections across England. It was not just that there was only one female candidate \u2013 Berger \u2013 across four contests. It was the way she was treated for having the temerity to stand. Berger has kept quiet until the vote but scheduled our final meeting for the day after the result. The nomination has gone to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/corbyn-ally-steve-rotheram-named-as-candidate-for-liverpool-city-region-mayor\">Steve Rotheram</a>, Corbyn\u2019s parliamentary private secretary. Jess Phillips, Labour MP for the Birmingham Yardley, has already posted an acerbic tweet. \u201cAll the mayors can now go on an actual man date. We can make the tea.\u201d The responses include calling Phillips \u201crenta gob\u201d and a \u201cstupid woman\u201d \u2013 which make her point even more neatly than she does.</p> <p>At the mayoral hustings, Rotheram had made a virtue out of being \u201ctoo nice, too ordinary, too working class and too loyal\u201d. \u201cToo loyal\u201d seemed a less-than-subtle jibe at Berger, who joined the post-Brexit exodus from Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet when she resigned as minister for mental health. \u201cA difficult decision but the right thing to do,\u201d she says. It was undoubtedly a factor in her defeat. \u201cEspecially the fact that there was a rally in the city and one of the candidates introduced the leader very publicly\u2026 I\u2019m sure that helped! It\u2019s not customary for the leader of the party to be seen endorsing any candidate in an internal selection but we live in a different time.\u201d Our final meeting is to find out why: why being young, female, Jewish and anti-Corbyn is such a challenging cocktail in politics in 2016.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was shouted at by people who should have known better, saying: \u2018How dare you put yourself forward?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berger flashes a brightly disconcerting smile. She lost but she\u2019s fine. As a teenager, her Saturday job was in the Disney store and you can spot the pedigree: an on/off smile of blinding wattage. One of her detractors told me she found her false but, underneath the smile, Berger\u2019s politics are hallmarked by a deep sense of sincerity and a powerful sense of direction. The smile is just her shield.</p> <p>She is originally from Wembley, and her father runs a small furnishings shop where he made Tony Benn\u2019s curtains, while her mother was a counsellor in a palliative care unit. The family was more culturally Jewish than religiously so, says Berger, though she still adheres to the main Jewish festivals. Nonetheless, she manages to make family life sound a bit like a scene from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/21/friday-night-dinner-tv-review\"><em>Friday Night Dinner</em></a>, with her father\u2019s party trick being a repertoire of \u201cincredible voices\u201d, while her mother (who wrote a hit in the French charts in the 60s) and her brother (a successful singer in Nashville) fought over use of the piano.</p> <p>The family was not particularly affluent but growing up in the Thatcherite 80s, Berger knew friends who experienced real poverty and disliked the way they were treated. She developed a strong sense of social justice, basing her desire for political change on the Jewish concept of \u201ctikkun olam\u201d or \u201cheal the world\u201d. She didn\u2019t want power. She wanted to make a difference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4594c006e754e52ec6079ac53a886a18a690b92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4594c006e754e52ec6079ac53a886a18a690b92/4652_2380_6580_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opposing force: Berger sees Jeremy Corbyn as \u2018principled\u2019 but \u2018not a leader\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opposing force: Berger sees Jeremy Corbyn as \u2018principled\u2019 but \u2018not a leader\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The morning of the result, she received messages of support from women who feel she <em>has</em> made a difference, just by seeking nomination in the current climate. One says,: \u201cThe way you were treated during the selection process by some was awful so I wanted to thank you for standing.\u201d What was that treatment? \u201cAt the start,\u201d she says, \u201cI had a colleague say to me that we already had a contest with the two men, which disgusted and appalled me.\u201d</p> <p>Following the result, criticism increased. \u201cMy campaign manager and I were shouted at by people who should have known better. There was a massive sense of entitlement around the other two candidates\u2019 teams. I was absolutely right to stand \u2013 I\u2019d do it all again tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Strange that it was Berger\u2019s experience that was constantly questioned. \u201cThe left have a problem with women,\u201d one young (male) party member tells me, while another describes their horror at hearing Berger publicly referred to as \u201ca young pup\u201d by another candidate. Yet she was the only one of the three with shadow cabinet experience. She has two degrees and despite being only 35 has worked at the London stock exchange and BP, and for the Commission for Racial Equality mapping Muslim-Jewish engagement, as well as being a runner at Paramount in America and a debt collector for an American production house. (The English accent worked, apparently.) And Disney, of course.</p> <p>You have to admire Berger\u2019s courage and tenacity, particularly in the wake of fellow politician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-shot-in-west-yorkshire\">Jo Cox\u2019s murder</a>. \u201cI suppose we all think we are untouchable but it means we have to take our security more seriously.\u201d Did it frighten her? \u201cI suppose I have been contending with issues surrounding my safety and security for years.\u201d But what\u2019s going on right now \u2013 why have things escalated to such ugly proportions in British politics? \u201cEverything is just so much more polarised, particularly in the wake of Brexit. If you think about the British psyche right now, I saw doctors\u2019 reports of increased presentation of people concerned about their mental health, for instance. Brexit was a prompt, a catalyst for uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair, Berger believes that \u2013 unlike misogyny \u2013 antisemitism exists more out of the Labour party than in it. But she is still \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Shami Chakrabarti\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/jeremy-corbyn-appears-compare-israeli-government-islamic-state-labour-antisemitism-review\">official report into antisemitism</a> absolved the party completely. \u201cThere [was a bit of it] that had no place there unless someone had asked for it.\u201d Did she feel the report was manipulated? \u201cI just didn\u2019t believe that it was independent.\u201d Does she believe Corbyn is manipulative as a leader? \u201cYou can\u2019t just look at him in isolation. You have to look at the people who surround him. Incidentally, not many women!\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn, one party insider tells me, is a puppet in the middle, divided between MPs who don\u2019t think he can lead Labour to victory and party militants who are more interested in the power of opposition than the power of government. It\u2019s an unprecedented catch 22 with accusations of intimidation flying. Did Berger feel there was a murky side to what was happening at Westminster? \u201cYes, but it was more the ineptitude. I served under Ed Miliband and there was a stark contrast in terms of the professional operation and everything that happened in terms of trying to get a response.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4ae08bd6d43f5991c8180f7822102aaa1232fc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4ae08bd6d43f5991c8180f7822102aaa1232fc4/0_0_4012_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour\u2019s women MPs after the 2010 election, including Berger, centre back row.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"556\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour\u2019s women MPs after the 2010 election, including Berger, centre back row.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ireland/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Berger was present when Corbyn was elected candidate for the leadership.

I have sat in cabinet meetings every week since last September and saw some of the things that have been well documented in the health team. I saw it with transport. On the day when we should have had a campaign on the increase in train fares, we had a reshuffle going on. That\u2019s not how you take the Tory government on.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, Berger says, she gets on well with Corbyn. He\u2019s a man of principle. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make him a leader.\u201d If Corbyn wins, can Labour win an election? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. In order to win, you need a united Labour party and that isn\u2019t what we currently have.\u201d Winning is important to Berger because it\u2019s about changing lives. She remembers the 80s recession and her family not being able to afford a Chinese takeaway. She remembers Thatcher getting to the top and pulling the ladder away, so she makes sure she mentors a woman every year through the <a href=\"https://fabianwomen.org.uk/\">Fabian Women\u2019s Network</a>. Small changes can make big differences.</p> <p>You can\u2019t be the great niece of Manny Shinwell without having a sense of heritage about the Labour party and a sense of responsibility about its future. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she retorts smartly, when asked if the Labour party could split. She\u2019s committed. The party is held in trust for future generations and there\u2019s a duty to safeguard it. Not even the level of violent abuse she has experienced dents Berger\u2019s resolve. She\u2019s going nowhere. But she thinks Corbyn is not the best caretaker. \u201cUltimately,\u201d she says, \u201cthe thousands of people I represent deserve a Labour government. They deserve not just a viable opposition but a government in waiting \u2013 and currently we are not.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Hans Ulrich Obrist: \u2018I can\u2019t live without Instagram\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Swiss-born curator, writer and art historian and artistic director at the Serpentine Galleries. Since 2009, Obrist has held a top 10 spot in <em>ArtReview</em> magazine\u2019s annual list of the art world\u2019s 100 most powerful people.</strong></p> <p>I believe a lot in rituals. I get up very early every morning, around five or six o\u2019clock, and I always start the day by reading 15 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/13/edouard-glissant-obituary\">Edouard Glissant</a>, a poet, writer and philosopher. I have every book he ever wrote at home and I\u2019ll just pick one and read.</p> <p>For me, Glissant\u2019s work is like a daily toolbox. He comes from Martinique, which is one of a string of islands [making up the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea]. A cultural exchange takes place between these islands and yet they preserve their own identities. So Glissant\u2019s work explores how we can engage with globalisation without falling into the trap of homogenisation. His books are an inspiration, particularly in this current climate of a lack of tolerance. I\u2019m always considering how we could develop exhibitions that embrace mondiality, which don\u2019t lead to separation but to dialogue, which build bridges.</p> <p>After Glissant, I go running, often in the park, because I love London parks. In this city, you can discover new things every day, even after living here for many years. Then it\u2019s breakfast and the office. I read about 30-40 magazines every month: all the art publications through to <em>London Review of Books</em>, the <em>New Yorker</em>, the <em>Economist</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>. In my bag currently I have about 150 articles from the last two weeks; I cut them out and share them with friends. They often trigger something. For example, many years ago I read about a group of 60s architects who had questioned the masterplan, and about Yona Friedman, and this year he has actually built one of our <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/serpentine-summer-houses-2016-yona-friedman\">summer houses at the Serpentine.</a></p> <p>With social media, there are the ones I use for information and the ones I broadcast on. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HUObrist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a> is both. With Facebook, I never really use it actively, just to broadcast my interviews with artists on Facebook Live, or sometimes they\u2019re on <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/HUObrist/1BRKjkmnENVGw\">Periscope</a>. Over the last six months, I\u2019ve also increasingly been using Snapchat. I follow some people I find inspiring, but I also broadcast films, little performances by artists, short sparks, short poems.</p> <p>I can\u2019t live without <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hansulrichobrist/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>. I look at it a lot, about half an hour to an hour a day and then post. My handwriting project on Instagram is a protest against the disappearance of handwriting \u2013 I post a handwritten note there every day. But I also find Instagram very inspiring. The diverse ways people use it is exciting \u2013 whether it\u2019s the artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wolfgang_tillmans/\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a> using it for activism with his anti-Brexit posters, or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenniferhiggie/?hl=en\">Jennifer Higgie</a> [co-editor of <a href=\"https://frieze.com/editorial\"><em>Frieze</em></a> magazine] who posts about a different extraordinary female artist every day, with a little text of biography so it\u2019s really a protest against forgetting.</p> <p>My absolute favourite account though is from Alice Rawsthorn, the design critic of the international <em>New York Times</em>. She structures her posts by week, so each week there\u2019s a new theme \u2013 \u201cDesign and Light\u201d or \u201cDesign Families\u201d \u2013 and each day there\u2019s a new post related to the theme, so for example, there was a stunning <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BG4Jh-3vPa0/?hl=pt-br\">lighthouse from 1750</a> for \u201cDesign and Light\u201d. In a way, she came up with the rules of the game, to actually structure it by weeks, because most people have it as a daily thing. I\u2019m completely obsessed by her Instagram \u2013 it\u2019s a fascinating vision of design that makes us look at the world differently.</p> <p>I always have my best ideas in Sils Maria, a village in the Swiss mountains. I\u2019m from Switzerland and spent a lot of time there as a child. Now I go about once or twice a year. There\u2019s something very magical about the place, the light \u2013 it\u2019s almost at 2,000 metres altitude \u2013 it\u2019s glacial, it has big mountains. Most of my exhibition and book ideas I\u2019ve had there.</p> <p>My favourite cultural venue is actually an imaginary construct \u2013 it\u2019s the unrealised <a href=\"http://funpalaces.co.uk/about/idea-come/\">Fun Palace</a> by the theatre director Joan Littlewood and the architect Cedric Price, who in the 60s came up with this idea of a cultural centre bringing together all artistic disciplines, removing all silos. As a thought experiment, I\u2019m inspired by it every day. Unfortunately the Fun Palace was never built, but you can get a sense of Cedric Price\u2019s work by going to his <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/exhibits/snowdon-aviary\">amazing aviary</a> created with Lord Snowdon at London Zoo. It\u2019s my favourite building in London.</p> <p><strong>Favourite TV</strong> I mostly watch on demand, a lot of Netflix. Recently it\u2019s been <em>The People v OJ Simpson</em>. I also like this exercise of looking at all the films that a director has done \u2013 like Tarantino \u2013 going into breadth and depth at the same time.</p> <p><strong>My litmus test for new ideas</strong> I always ask myself: \u201cIs it urgent?\u201d I use that word often. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a797942ffa944583fbc04e08925ce5e67e6fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a797942ffa944583fbc04e08925ce5e67e6fe5/0_117_498_299/498.jpg\" alt=\"Fabian Riggall.\" width=\"498\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Once Upon a Time in America made me fall in love with cinema\u2019: Fabian Riggall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Funnell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Fabien Riggall: \u2018I have good ideas in the shower, so I get out and get my house wet\u2019</h2> <p><strong>As founder of Secret Cinema, Riggall has transformed how we watch films: since 2007 his live cinematic events have invited costumed fans to explore the immersive world of a movie, from </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nHZAZZqOqM\"><strong><em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest</em></strong></a><strong> to <em>Star Wars</em>. He now plans to expand into the US and produce films.</strong></p> <p>On a good morning, my routine is to get up around 7am and go for a run around Victoria Park, east London, near where I live, or a swim. I feel much more relaxed if I exercise in the morning, but if I\u2019m tired I just don\u2019t do it. I tend to have a lot of good ideas when I\u2019m in the shower, so I get out and get my whole house wet. Then I\u2019ll go and have a coffee in a place called <a href=\"http://www.climpsonandsons.com/\">Climpson &amp; Sons</a> and just have half an hour before the day starts to write to-do lists and notes.</p> <p>The biggest influence on my career has been going to the cinema when I was very young and seeing <em>Once Upon a Time in America</em>, a very violent gangster film from the 80s. I was living in Morocco at the time and I sneaked out to watch it. It\u2019s a very romantic, epic film and it had a profound effect on me. I fell in love with cinema and with the idea of what cinema was.</p> <p>One non-cultural thing that inspires my work is politics. We did a big campaign for Remain through Secret Cinema; for <em>Star Wars</em>,<em> </em>we worked with the <a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\">Refugee Council</a>; for <em>28 Days Later</em>, we supported the junior doctors; for <em>Dr Strangelove</em>, we worked with <a href=\"https://www.warchild.org.uk/\">War Child</a>. I believe that all art is political by nature and I\u2019m passionate about people getting involved in political matters.</p> <p>This summer, I went to Glastonbury, which I think is one of England\u2019s great cultural achievements: it\u2019s an extraordinary balance between types of culture and I like the madness and chaos of it. Just after the sad news about Brexit I saw Damon Albarn perform with the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/the-syrian-national-orchestra-95691\">Orchestra of Syrian Musicians</a>; it was about 60 musicians, with all these different singers. That was special.</p> <p><strong>Favourite cafe to work in </strong>I like the simplicity of Le Pain Quotidien: you sit on these long tables and work really easily.</p> <p><strong>Favourite app</strong> I spend most of my life trying to get off social media, but one app I love is <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/\">Waze</a>, a GPS-based navigation app that takes you away from traffic.

Basically, the Modern House sells post-1940s houses in the UK and they\u2019re not all super-expensive; some of them are beautifully done up ex-council places by Goldfinger or around the Barbican. And I keep saying: \u201cI love that! Look at this 1960s house \u2013 I want to live there!\u201d They recently published a fantastic coffee-table book and they write about the houses beautifully; they\u2019re like museum entries for houses I\u2019d like to live in.</p> <p>Visual pleasure and visual exploration are really important to me, but I\u2019m also a profoundly physical person. I have my best ideas in the 30 minutes following my almost daily yoga session. For me, yoga creates space within the mind as well as realigning the body so that the solutions to whatever I\u2019ve been grappling with in the previous 24 hours or 24 weeks just sort of emerge.</p> <p>One of the litmus tests I have for new ideas is in the body. If I feel a bit sick at the thought of an idea, a bit \u201coooh, God, this is scary\u201d, that actually means it\u2019s a bit exciting, doesn\u2019t it? That feeling in the gut makes me realise that, yes, this is a challenging and therefore sensible thing to do.</p> <p>I walk a lot; I really love walking in the landscape, seeing beautiful things. One of my favourite cultural venues is Jupiter Artland, an outdoor sculpture park about 12 miles outside Edinburgh. It has a really wide range of contemporary sculpture, all commissioned for the site, beautiful woodland and fantastic walks through rolling fields, as well as a lovely house. The artworks include a nine-metre-high shotgun by Cornelia Parker propped up against a very tall tree and a wonderful amethyst grotto by Anya Gallaccio. Installed just beside the cafe are Helen Chadwick\u2019s <em>Piss Flowers </em>\u2013 a kind of garden of Piss Flowers, which I love; they were a seminal piece of work for me when I was younger.</p> <p>In Manchester, in the year since it opened, I\u2019ve been going a lot to <a href=\"http://homemcr.org/\">Home</a>, the multi-artform space in the centre of town. It\u2019s rapidly become a great social space with a diverse crowd, and that\u2019s also true for my teenagers who are 19 and 16; it\u2019s become their space as well. I have lots of breakfast meetings in <a href=\"https://www.figandsparrow.co.uk/\">Fig + Sparrow</a>, a cafe in the northern quarter that also sells really nice Danish homewares. It\u2019s run by two artist-photographers who can\u2019t make a living being artist-photographers so are cafe owners too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/25/cornelia-parker-interview-i-dont-want-to-tick-anyone-elses-boxes-whitworth-retrospective\">Cornelia Parker: \u2018I don\u2019t want to tick anyone else\u2019s boxes\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I could happily live without all technology, but I\u2019m not violently opposed to it \u2013 I just don\u2019t like it to take up too much of the time that I have to be in the world myself. Instagram is my favourite social media because it\u2019s the most visual. I\u2019m quite picky about who I follow \u2013 I only follow people who have a very good eye. So one of my favourites is British-Nigerian fashion designer and occasional curator Duro Olowu, who is just fabulous. He could be commenting on something in his professional life or passing through an airport in Lagos and he sees an extraordinarily dressed woman and catches the print and the style.</p> <p>The thing I really couldn\u2019t live without, though, is my camera on my iPhone, because I want to capture the world as I\u2019m going along, the things I need to remember \u2013 and I need visual anchors for them.</p> <p>In the role that I\u2019m in now, a very small number of artists have been sounding boards, touchstones, inspirations, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/11/richard-wentworth-sculptor-portrait-artist\">Richard Wentworth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/cornelia-parker\">Cornelia Parker</a>. For me, the process of working with artists is about exploring the not yet known and that\u2019s why I love my job. But for my whole life my family have been the most incredible anchor. My husband, Nick, who is a work colleague as well, is just so optimistic about possibilities. And there\u2019s nothing better than a toddler\u2019s or a teenager\u2019s view on whatever particularly difficult work problem you\u2019re wrestling with. My daughter, Lily, forged an incredibly close bond with Marina Abramovi\u0107 when she worked with us in Manchester in 2009 and every so often, even now, she\u2019ll say: \u201cYou know if you asked Marina that question she\u2019d say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019 or she\u2019d tell them to get lost\u201d. But Lily is 16 now so she\u2019d use less polite language than that. In fact, another test for new ideas comes from Marina; she said: \u201cIf you have a lot of ideas and you write them down and think, \u2018Oh I really like that one\u2019, she said, \u2018Throw that idea away, it\u2019s too easy\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>If you only work you lose your capacity to have ideas. So, as I said, I do a lot of physical practice but also gardening. Growing vegetables and things that I have started from seed and that end up on the plate is incredibly important to me. When I was a PhD student, I worked in a remarkable south Indian restaurant in Brighton and I learned how to cook Goan and Keralan food so I particularly like to cook that sort of food, and I live in the curry mile in Manchester so I can get all the ingredients in really big bags. Most of the good projects I\u2019ve worked on have started with a dinner at my house.</p> <p><strong>Unmissable TV</strong> These past couple of months it\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/06/legacy-danish-tv-drama-bbc-borgen\"><em>The Legacy</em></a>, a Danish drama with an absolutely monstrous female gallery director.

And if the answer is yes, I don\u2019t do it \u2013 we\u2019ve done that, so let\u2019s not bother. The thing that\u2019s energising in making theatre is the unknown: trying to make things, inventing, improvising.</p> <p>I always find I get ideas when I\u2019m about to go somewhere, travelling \u2013 often it\u2019s when I\u2019m climbing up the steps into an aeroplane. But it\u2019s always going. Coming back is different and I don\u2019t have any ideas at all. The other place I have ideas is watching other people\u2019s shows, although it\u2019s usually not obviously connected to what I\u2019m watching. I\u2019ll sit for the rest of the show with my fingers crossed, going: \u201cI know there are two or three things I\u2019ve got to remember\u201d.</p> <p>I do a lot of thinking when I\u2019m swimming, especially in the summer, when I go away for a while and I swim all the time. There\u2019s a great big lake in south-west France, near Carcassonne, where I\u2019ve been swimming for 20 years. I just go round and round, up and down, and there\u2019s almost never anybody else there. I go swimming in London too, but not as much as I\u2019d like to. At the right time of year I go up to the Hampstead ponds, but really you can just splash about.</p> <p>I love watching dance at Sadler\u2019s Wells \u2013 the Israeli choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hofesh-shechter\">Hofesh Shechter</a> or avant-garde choreographers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/07/william.forsythe.dance\">William Forsythe</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/pinabausch\">Pina Bausch</a>. I think her work is a bit patchy; sometimes, it\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve ever seen and sometimes you can\u2019t wait for it to end. But at its best, it\u2019s fantastically interesting.</p> <p>Somewhere not in London that I like very much is the Amsterdam Toneelgroep. There are two theatres next to each other: one was probably built in the late 18th century, the Stadsschouwburg. It\u2019s a beautiful, big, old, rather baroque theatre with a huge stage; to the side of it is the new theatre that Ivo van Hove\u2019s company has built. It\u2019s very plain, very beautifully designed and the work they do there is great.</p> <p>My iPhone is like my sixth finger or my third hand. I use it all the time \u2013 I make notes on it, it\u2019s got my diary on it \u2013 although I can live without and do periodically live without it. If I\u2019m walking down the street I feel I\u2019m not complete if I\u2019m not sending an email or something. I used to say I could do two things at once, having a conversation and doing something with my iPhone, but I\u2019ve discovered that I don\u2019t remember the conversation or what I was doing on the phone. So the truth is that I can\u2019t.</p> <p>Quite often, I\u2019m at the theatre at 8am, 8:30am, and often I don\u2019t leave there until 10pm. So my mornings are about speed: I can get from bed to desk in about 55 minutes. I\u2019ve been doing the same journey for so many years now I can do it really fast. I can generally do it in under an hour; best ever is 50 minutes. That does not include breakfast, just getting there with a reasonable quantity of clothes on.</p> <p><strong>My favourite websites </strong>The <em>Guardian</em>, and this American political website called <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/\">Democracy Now!</a> \u2013 they cover stories that very often the other papers don\u2019t, or the papers in this country anyway.</p> <p><strong>I read...</strong> all the time, European history mostly, from the 14th century through until now.

So in terms of the sort of contemporary art I\u2019m interested in, some of my favourite artists have come from being involved in the subcultures, the music and art scene of their city. For example, in a way, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mark-leckey\">Mark Leckey</a>\u2019s whole practice is born out of a very specific working-class subculture that\u2019s strongly tied to music and the rave scene. The way he talks about it is that music distinguishes different tribes. So to get a quick overview of good music that\u2019s out I read websites like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/\">Pitchfork</a>, Triple Canopy and <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/\">Fact</a> (like a British version of Pitchfork). A lot of those sites also commission playlists of new music by DJs and musicians, which are a great way of having fresh music to listen to without doing the legwork. I used to buy a lot of new music but I\u2019m now restricted by time and I don\u2019t really go to record shops any more.</p> <p>I read a lot online. The commercial production company <a href=\"http://somesuch.co/\">Somesuch</a> commissions and publishes great writing on its website \u2013 fiction and essays \u2013 from personal pieces about something very tragic to humorous, insightful pieces on people\u2019s work. It\u2019s just published a small book of fiction too. I love it that this company, which makes really high-end adverts for huge brands, has also done that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/18/mike-kelley-nonconformist-whole-life-here\">Mike Kelley: the nonconformist's whole life is here</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also religiously follow the journalist Charlie Porter, who has a unique voice \u2013 very funny and opinionated. He comes from a fashion background but is now writing about art and there\u2019s a sense of freedom to what he writes because he\u2019s coming out of left field. Sometimes, people caught up in their own industry forget that they use a particular kind of jargon so when someone comes in from another place it\u2019s really refreshing. Visual art is like anything else \u2013 there\u2019s a whole industry behind it and sometimes you have to fight a little to get through the structures to the good stuff, the meat and potatoes.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to choose one artist who has been my biggest influence but the American artist <a href=\"http://mikekelley.com/\">Mike Kelley</a> is someone I keep coming back to. I think that\u2019s partly because he was a really prolific writer as well. He was able to look at subcultures and write them into stories. One of my interests is in transgressive practices or grotesqueries and Mike wrote a really good book called <em>Foul Perfection</em>.</p> <p>I\u2019m very fond of a group of galleries that work with emerging or under-represented artists in London, such as Studio Voltaire, the <a href=\"http://www.theshowroom.org/\">Showroom</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.chisenhale.org.uk/\">Chisenhale</a>. The recent <a href=\"http://www.studiovoltaire.org/exhibitions/archive/sharon-hayes/\">Sharon Hayes show at Studio Voltaire</a> was superb. Around the country the Hepworth, <a href=\"http://www.dca.org.uk/\">Dundee Contemporary Arts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com/\">Baltic</a> are great venues with strong international programmes. In Glasgow, GoMA is being revitalised with a brilliant new curator, though I\u2019m biased because I recently curated a <a href=\"http://glasgowinternational.org/events/cosima-von-bonin/\">Cosima von Bonin</a> exhibition there. And <a href=\"http://www.kinningparkcomplex.org/\">Kinning Park Complex</a> is an amazing multi-use community centre that houses performances, workshops and events of all types. The last thing I saw there was Glasgow-based feminist warriors Fallop\u00e9 and the Tubes.</p> <p>My favourite pub in the world is the Horse Shoe in Glasgow, where they have karaoke upstairs every night. I heard about it from a cabbie who informed me that a high percentage of the clientele had got quite far on <em>The X Factor</em>. I really love karaoke but I\u2019m quite bad at it. It\u2019s embarrassing, but I don\u2019t care. Sometimes, after a few drinks, I get into a bit of a rant about how everyone should have the right to sing. I like it when people surprise you. A friend, a brilliant artist called Stephen Sutcliffe, got up one night and did Elton John\u2019s I Guess That\u2019s Why They Call it the Blues, and it was amazing. The Horse Shoe also has a bit of a community centre feeling sometimes: you\u2019ll see tables of mum, auntie, nan and the kids who are there for two hours before they go off clubbing. It reminds me a bit of the social centre we used to go to with my family and grandparents when I was much younger, of when we used to go \u201cup the club\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Non-arts stuff I enjoy</strong> I have started horseriding again after an 18-year hiatus. When you move out of London your leisure time is freed up; you don\u2019t slip into the pressures of going to five art openings a night and all of that. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed8e130134e77447d53c6d4a2d1c926cc64ab5f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed8e130134e77447d53c6d4a2d1c926cc64ab5f4/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kully Thiarai director of National Theatre Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018TED talks allow you to connect with the world from different perspectives\u2019: Kully Thiarai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kully Thiarai: \u2018My favourite cultural venues challenge the norm\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Artistic director at National Theatre Wales, Thiarai is only the second woman, and the first Asian director to lead one of Britain\u2019s national theatre companies. Previously she transformed Doncaster\u2019s cultural scene at the helm of new theatre Cast and has led some of Britain\u2019s key theatre venues and producing companies.</strong></p> <p>When I want to be nourished I go to <a href=\"http://www.ysp.co.uk/\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a>. It\u2019s a place for contemplation and inspiration \u2013 you never quite know what you\u2019re going to see. Even the most permanent works can shed new light just because the weather looks different or your walk to it has been from somewhere else. It\u2019s calming to be in nature in that way, to see art in the context of the real world.</p> <p>My favourite cultural venues challenge the norm or at least question it, all in different ways. It\u2019s wonderful to go to a big mainstream venue, but it\u2019s a very different experience encountering the new, the rough and ready. What I find interesting is exploring how we refresh our artform, how we find collisions between things rather than specifying this is theatre, this is dance, this is music. <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/\">Theatre in the Mill</a> at Bradford University was very important to me when I was a student there. I saw some extraordinary things. Ruth Mackenzie ran it then and her programme was very inspiring \u2013 shows from the very young <a href=\"http://www.phoenixdancetheatre.co.uk/\">Phoenix Dance</a> and the early work of <a href=\"http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/history/companies/gay-sweatshop/\">Gay Sweatshop</a>. She became a real influence. And the venue continues to have work that is surprising and new and emerging. It\u2019s a bit like the <a href=\"http://www.slunglow.org/what-is-the-hub/\">Hub in Leeds</a>, a space that artists use in different ways, often to present work in its early stages. A nice creative conversation goes along with the presenting of work there and I really love that. I\u2019m also a big admirer of <a href=\"http://contactmcr.com/\">Contact in Manchester</a>. It\u2019s refreshing to hang out in a venue with so much energy and such a commitment to young people.</p> <p>I\u2019ve recently moved to Cardiff so I\u2019m still discovering lots of places there. It\u2019s got a real vibrancy. A cafe called <a href=\"http://milgicardiff.com/\">Milgi</a> does healthy food and juices and is a lovely place to hang out, with great music. Waterloo Tea in Wyndham Arcade is wonderful and there\u2019s a restaurant called the <a href=\"http://purplepoppadom.com/menu/\">Purple Poppadom</a> \u2013 I love the name, but also it does the most delicious food.</p> <p>I like watching <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks\">TED talks</a> to come across a wide variety of ideas, to connect with the world from different perspectives. They\u2019re short and snappy and you can digest them on the move. The famous <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity\">Ken Robinson talk</a> about creativity and schools is joyous to watch because he explains things brilliantly and it\u2019s a masterclass in how to present ideas.</p> <p>The four questions I always try to ask about new work or projects are: why this, why now, why here and who for? They\u2019re also the questions I ask when I\u2019m watching other people\u2019s things. It feels like how is a separate question once you\u2019ve worked out the why.</p> <p><strong>Best social media </strong>I dip into Twitter a lot. My favourite tweets are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemnsissay?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lemn Sissay\u2019s poems</a>, especially in the mornings. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a69f905b82b021e651fedc046a08921db33f8227\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a69f905b82b021e651fedc046a08921db33f8227/0_247_5284_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madani Younis, right, with a fellow patron of west London restaurant Ochi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You never know who you are going to meet\u2019: Madani Younis, right, with a fellow patron of west London restaurant Ochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Madani Younis: \u2018I\u2019m trying to reveal what this moment means in our cultural history\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Artistic director at the world-renowned new writing theatre based in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London, and former head of Freedom Studios theatre company in Bradford. When Younis accepted the Bush role in 2012 he became London\u2019s first non\u2011white artistic director.</strong></p> <p>This will probably come as a big surprise, but I\u2019m a huge fan of mixed martial arts, otherwise known as cage fighting, which is an unfortunate expression. The female fighters in mixed martial arts are the most exciting part of the sport. I watched boxing as a kid and found it a bit brutal, but reading Ernest Hemingway made me appreciate it and now mixed martial arts, in a very different way. He writes about it as a balletic art. For him, it\u2019s about the human condition: you enter the ring and you take your destiny, your dreams, with you. Last year, I directed a boxing play entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/29/the-royale-review-bush-theatre-powerful-punch\"><em>The Royale</em></a>, about Jack Johnson, the first African American heavyweight boxing champion of the world. I\u2019ve waited my whole career to direct a sports play. So, yes, I love mixed martial arts and I love the <a href=\"http://www.mmafighting.com/\">mmafighting.com</a> app.</p> <p>My mother has been a huge influence on me. She introduced me to the writers who really inspired me early on, people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin\">James Baldwin</a>, Derek Walcott, Ralph Ellison, Bell Hooks. When I read Derek Walcott\u2019s play <em>Dream on Monkey Mountain</em>, aged 16, it just blew my mind. In the same way, reading Baldwin writing about Harlem in the 60s, there was a resonance: I thought, yes, I know what that feels like.</p> <p>I always loved words. I think it was only when I was about 17 that I really fell in love with theatre: I went to the Old Red Lion in Islington, north London, and saw a play about the Troubles in Northern Ireland by Seamus Finnegan. That was the moment. I felt that that artistic communion couldn\u2019t be replicated in any other medium.</p> <p>These days, going to a monthly spoken-word night at the Forge in Camden, called <a href=\"http://www.outspokenldn.com/outspokenlive/\">Out-Spoken</a>, makes me feel like I did when I was 17. I\u2019ve seen some amazing artists there and there\u2019s no censorship, no notes, no separation between me and the artist on stage \u2013 just words from their mouth to your ears, unadulterated. It\u2019s a beautiful kind of communion. Out-Spoken is run by the artist Anthony Anaxagorou and the venue only seats about 100-120 people, but it\u2019s always a great mix of people \u2013 City types, younger men and women.</p> <p>I\u2019m also a huge fan of the <a href=\"http://bcaheritage.tumblr.com/\">Black Cultural Archives</a> in Brixton. It\u2019s a beautifully conceived building. For me, it holds up against any of our other great museums and galleries in the city; I always take visitors there. It\u2019s a reminder of a great lineage of men and women and the impact they\u2019ve had on both our city and our sense of being as a country.</p> <p>There\u2019s a West Indian restaurant/takeaway in Uxbridge Road called <a href=\"http://www.ochitakeaway.co.uk/\">Ochi</a> that I love because it\u2019s been there probably since the 60s/70s and it\u2019s an absolute staple of the community in Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Because of the music venues in the area, such as the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, now known as the O2, Ochi has this really inspiring wall of fame, with shots of people that have been there to eat, like Bob Marley, Amy Winehouse and Lauryn Hill. The food is amazing and it\u2019s a beautiful place to hang out; you never know who you are going to meet or what you\u2019re going to end up talking about. The other place I like is <a href=\"http://www.bushhalldining.co.uk/\">Bush Hall Dining Rooms</a>, an independent restaurant in Uxbridge Road. The food is really great and it has a cool vibe.</p> <p>The questions I always ask about new ideas are: what is it that this piece is trying to reveal about the world? And: from what vantage point are they trying to do that? More specifically, as a new writing theatre in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, one of London\u2019s most diverse areas, I always ask: how does this speak to London today? In a way I\u2019m trying to reveal \u2013 not in a touristy way \u2013 what this moment means in our cultural history, however uncomfortable or inspiring. If Charles Dickens were alive now, this version of London would be amazing to him.</p> <p><strong>My favourite websites</strong> <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/\">Media Diversified</a> gives me another version of the news. It\u2019s a response to the lack of black and minority ethnic journalists writing in our mainstream papers and it covers news, culture, sport and comment. It\u2019s great seeing young journalists quickly develop their voice in that space. I\u2019ve also really been taken by Vice News in the two years since it launched, particularly its global perspective and the level of investigative journalism.</p> <p><strong>Unmissable TV </strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80018294\"><em>Daredevil</em></a><em> </em>on Netflix. It\u2019s based on a Marvel comic book and the writing is really muscular. The other one is <em>House of Cards</em>; my wife and I are addicted to it. What an amazing insight into what politics really is all about. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90a98b2af9fceaed2214c67b0a9f506b6ca56be8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90a98b2af9fceaed2214c67b0a9f506b6ca56be8/609_567_2391_1435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Baker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every night I set a new tune to wake me up\u2019: Tom Baker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolina Faruolo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tom Baker: \u2018Being in a teenage band gave me a great foundation\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Founder of </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/13/field-day-festival-review-skepta-deerhunter-james-blake-pj-harvey\"><strong>Field Day</strong></a><strong> festival in east London and the live music booking agency Eat Your Own Ears, Baker is often described as London\u2019s best promoter.

It\u2019s an old working men\u2019s club with a great sound system.

I\u2019ve been really enjoying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peaky-blinders\"><em>Peaky Blinders</em></a> recently.</p> <p>I was five when I went to my first Glastonbury with my parents and then I went every year until I was 12. I started going again when I was 17 with friends. It\u2019s such a magical place I think it definitely inspired me. As a teenager, I was in a band and just embracing so much music \u2013 everything from Miles Davis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/dec/24/miles-davis-bitches-brew\"><em>Bitches Brew</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung\">Neil Young </a>to minimal classical music. It was all very physical \u2013 sharing CDs, you\u2019d work your way through a pile of 10 CDs, whole albums, not just a single track. That gave me a great foundation. I absorbed a lot.</p> <p><strong>I normally have my best ideas... </strong>When I\u2019m at an event and think, oh that\u2019s a good way to do it or I\u2019ll wake up the next day and suddenly, ahhh, how about that? <strong>IC</strong></p>",

Stef, a white, Kenyan-born British campaign co-ordinator operating from a Welsh MP\u2019s office in Westminster, is determined to initiate an annual festival to raise awareness of eastern Congo. This situation allows Brace to bring together Stef\u2019s ex-boyfriend event consultant, representatives of aid agencies and members of the Congolese community. Brace simultaneously exposes the competing interests among all these parties and conveys background information about Congo via sharp-dialogued, animated situations that only sometimes feel over-crammed. Questions about how identity is constructed are wittily addressed \u2013 as when Stef tells a Congolese poet that his poems need to be more \u201cCongolese\u201d to qualify for inclusion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stef tells a Congolese poet that his poems need to be more 'Congolese' to qualify for inclusion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Weaving among the characters and unseen by them is a man of colour wearing a pink suit and bowler hat (Sule Rimi, neatly balancing vivid presence and unobtrusiveness).

The action shifts back in time to Stef\u2019s visit to the Congo\u2019s border with Rwanda. The Rwandan genocide sparked a 10-year, multinational war in this area, exacerbated by the presence of almost all the world\u2019s coltan \u2013 crucial to digital technology. Millions died. War has ended but conflict continues. In a family home, a father (Rimi, exasperated and loving) swaps bedtime stories with a restless child (touching and funny, Joan Iyiola). Attacked by unidentified militiamen, the family is subsequently tended by a white nurse, assisted by a traumatised Stef (Fiona Button\u2019s performance is sensitively calibrated, emotionally powerful).</p> <p>Back in the present, the still-damaged stage becomes a visual representation of the sore at the heart of our glitzy digital age, of the growing spread of Stef\u2019s trauma into her London life, and of the implacable and violent conflicts that divide the Congolese characters (these particularly affect the women \u2013 especially Anna-Maria Nabirye\u2019s affecting Anne-Marie). The invisible figure\u2019s pink suit is now battered and torn, spattered with shattered circuit boards \u2013 an image of a ravaged country and people (Jon Bausor\u2019s design and costumes).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/178007458\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/178007458\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/178007458\">Watch the trailer for They Drink It in the Congo.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is only Brace\u2019s second full-length play, and some dynamics in the writing feel imbalanced: for instance, the only really multifaceted character is a white woman; violence is a significant feature of Congolese interactions.

  "<p>In the beginning, mythology told stories about events or experiences that would otherwise leave us mystified \u2013 how the world was created, what happens after we die. The first myths were mostly optimistic fictions, but our ancestors longed to believe in them: that\u2019s how religion established its hold.</p> <p>The original myth-makers expected us to take literally God\u2019s fabulations about heaven and hell and to obey his bullying commandments. Today, less credulous, we think religion itself is a myth, by which we mean a consoling lie. In common usage, \u201cmyth\u201d is at best the word we use to refer to amusingly preposterous urban legends \u2013 tales about <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/critters/lurkers/gator.asp\" title=\"\">albino alligators in the Manhattan sewers</a> or the Holy Grail\u2019s hiding place under the floor of a Paris shopping mall.</p> <p>In our society, it is publicists, spin doctors and advertisers who devise the myths. Sometimes the aim is to exalt an imperfect human being: celebrities and even politicians need to possess \u201ccharisma\u201d, a word that originally vouched for a believer\u2019s direct contact with a divine source. Myth also invests manufactured objects with a supernatural grace or glory. In the 1950s, Citro\u00ebn\u2019s DS car came to be known as the D\u00e9esse \u2013 a goddess of sleek metal and smooth leather, so curvaceously aerodynamic that it seemed, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/12/roland-barthes-happy-100th-birthday-centenary-birth\" title=\"\">Roland Barthes\u2019s</a> description in <em>Mythologies</em>, to have \u201cdescended from the sky\u201d, not driven up the highway.

More than a means of transport, Air Force One is a propaganda tool, and its effectiveness&#xa0;depends on the implied presence of a deity.</p> <p>So long as the doctrine of American isolation prevailed, the presidency was a desk job, tethered to Washington DC. But when the US acquired global power after 1945, the president took to the air, travelling in a plane that has come to represent the ubiquity and intimidating might of this ultimate empire. Equipped with surveillance systems that eavesdrop on the lowly world it overflies, allegedly able to fire missiles and to withstand a nuclear blast, Air Force One is evidence of dominance. Even if we don\u2019t accept American superiority, we bow down before American immensity: the customised 747 currently in use is as tall as a six-storey building and as long as a football field.</p> <p>On the ground, the president travels in a black Cadillac nicknamed \u201cthe Beast\u201d, ready to repel assailants with rocket-propelled grenades, pump-action shotguns and tear-gas cannon. Soaring aloft, he exchanges a beast for a bird: Air Force One is America with wings, a mechanised version of the beaked, pinioned eagle \u2013 a predator that clutches in its claws twin bundles of peacemaking olive branches and spiky, militarised arrows \u2013 that appears on the country\u2019s Great Seal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56a2c208567b263cdd19c1ae016a87644b2bfc8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56a2c208567b263cdd19c1ae016a87644b2bfc8a/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama speaks after touching down in Tel Aviv \u2013 his first visit to Israel, 20 March 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks after touching down in Tel Aviv \u2013 his first visit to Israel, 20 March 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first President Bush, who took delivery of the current double-decker Air Force One to replace the humbler 707 he inherited from Ronald Reagan, remarked that it embodies America\u2019s \u201cmajesty\u201d. A Freudian slip, surely \u2013 republics should be unmajestic and the USA was meant to be the paradise of the common man \u2013 but not inaccurate. Air Force One is a triumphal chariot, a steroid-boosted equivalent to the golden coaches and slow-motion Bentleys in which the Queen sedately trundles along. For extra effect, Lyndon Johnson installed a hydraulic \u201cking chair\u201d on board his Air Force One, which enabled him to hover in midair as he harangued the congressmen he invited into his cabin.</p> <p>Like the country whose head of state it carries, Air Force One is exceptional \u2013 and exceptions are always made for it by air-traffic controllers, who suspend other operations to give it instant clearance. The numeral in the plane\u2019s call sign is exclusive, monopolistic, not the inception of a series; it brags of being one of a kind, rather than a first among equals. In fact that solitary integer is misleading: here is the first of the myth\u2019s little fibs. Air Force One has a duplicate that, like the vice-president, is a useful safeguard against mishaps. But to preserve the myth of American primacy, the second plane is never referred to as Air Force Two and whichever of them carries the incumbent becomes Air Force One for the duration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nuclear-football-donald-trump\">The \u2018nuclear football\u2019 - the deadly briefcase that never leaves the president\u2019s side</a> </p> </aside>  <p>George W Bush may be the only president to have used both planes on a single journey. At Thanksgiving in 2003, he flew to Baghdad, where he spent a couple of hours posing for photographs as he dished out portions of festive turkey to the troops who were fighting his war. To ensure that the trip remained secret, he retreated to his ranch in Texas for the holiday, then travelled back to Washington on the first Air Force One \u2013 though it couldn\u2019t officially be called that because he was pretending not to be on board: the trip was logged as routine maintenance. The second plane was waiting in a hangar, fuelled and provisioned for the onward flight to Iraq. With a baseball cap as his camouflage, Bush entered it by the back stairs, which no president ever uses. That skulking between planes was an odd manoeuvre, very unlike his customary strutting. Bush was playing hide and seek with his twin Air Force Ones, and duplication hints at duplicity, a cultivation of double meanings that dodges, as myth always does, between truth and falsehood.</p> <p>The plane borrows America\u2019s attributes \u2013 its size, its might, its technological supremacy \u2013 but can any president dare borrow those attributes from the plane? Although Americans proverbially describe their nation\u2019s CEO as \u201cthe most powerful man in the world\u201d, it\u2019s a hollow boast, since the only way of making that power manifest is by opening the suitcase of nuclear codes chained to the arm of the military aide who accompanies the president everywhere. Power is meaningless unless it\u2019s displayed, enacted: hence Vladimir Putin\u2019s bare-chested preening or his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/putin-judo-book-russian-schoolchildren\" title=\"\">sessions of bone-crushing judo</a>. American presidents sometimes jog to demonstrate fitness, though <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2025424_2025864_2025986,00.html\" title=\"\">Jimmy Carter once embarrassingly keeled over while out for a run</a>. A president\u2019s best chance of personifying confident, aerobic America is in bounding energetically down the stairs of Air Force One. Yet the height of those stairs and their steep pitch are reminders that the presidency is a heady, hubristic office, undermined by pitfalls. In 1975 in rainy Salzburg the notoriously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlz0he9rtKw\" title=\"\">clumsy Gerald Ford slipped on the wet bottom step</a> as he deplaned and tumbled on to the tarmac, forcing his wife to shield him with an umbrella as an official tugged him upright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5040e31af859e96dd78138e9283ceb085642be6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5040e31af859e96dd78138e9283ceb085642be6f/0_0_3513_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Ford slips as he exits Air Force One, 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Ford slips as he exits Air Force One, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For once avoiding risks, when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination last year he relied on a gilded escalator in his New York headquarters to deposit him in the lobby where the photographers were gathered. Stairs require effort, which may be unavailing or self-defeating; an escalator \u2013 or so Trump hoped \u2013 allowed him to waft down smoothly from on high like a golden-maned angel of deliverance.</p> <p>In one respect, America\u2019s aeronautical myth has to wheedle its way around a flagrant contradiction: Air Force One carries the commander-in-chief, but he is not in command of the plane. When Barack Obama came on board for the first time, he shook the hand of the pilot and complimented him for looking the part, \u201clike Sam Shepard in <em>The Right Stuff</em>\u201d. In the film of Tom Wolfe\u2019s book about Nasa\u2019s astronauts, Shepard as Chuck Yeager breaks the sound barrier while remaining laconic, nonchalant, metaphorically down to earth. Actually, the pilot who flies Air Force One is nicknamed Top Gun during his tenure in the cockpit; it\u2019s lucky that Obama was greeted by a laidback Shepard lookalike rather than a clone of Tom Cruise, who played the hepped-up hotshot naval aviator known as Maverick in Tony Scott\u2019s film <em>Top Gun</em>.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s charmingly deferential remark joked about his own unfitness \u2013 physically at least \u2013 for the office. Americans want their head of state to be both a warlord and a saviour and these impossible expectations have turned the presidency into a myth \u2013 a starring role for an action hero rather than an exhaustingly intricate job for a fixer schooled in the art of compromise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYnVOIfNiU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jPYnVOIfNiU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYnVOIfNiU\">Watch Harrison Ford as President James Marshall in the 1997 film Air Force One.<br></a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump, when asked last December which president he most admires, did not pay the usual unctuous tribute to Lincoln, Kennedy or Reagan, but said that his role model was James Marshall. He was referring, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/12/12/donald-trump-harrison-ford-and-the-pre-911-politics-of-air-force-one/#3aa68d0651ff\" title=\"\">he explained, to \u201cHarrison Ford on the plane\u201d</a>: in Wolfgang Petersen\u2019s 1997 film <em>Air Force One</em>, Ford plays a president whose name suggests martial prowess as well as anticipating the air marshals who, after 9/11, began to travel on civilian flights, weapons at the ready. Marshall\u2019s backstory alludes to his time piloting combat choppers in Vietnam, when he received the Medal of Honor for valour in battle from one of his predecessors. He is therefore well prepared to beat up or gun down the terrorists from Kazakhstan who take over Air Force One after a summit meeting in Moscow; in an emergency he can even fly the plane himself.</p> <p>Harrison Ford\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s accolade was scornful, sad and a little anxious. \u201cDonald,\u201d he groaned, \u201cit was a movie! It\u2019s not like this in real life \u2013 but how would you know?\u201d Undeterred by protests about his infringement of copyright, Trump uses Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s embattled but rousingly brassy music from the film to underscore his campaign appearances, and when he arrived in Cleveland for the Republican convention in July he was greeted by the fanfares that accompany Ford\u2019s gung-ho bouts of fisticuffs with the hijackers. All he did was step out of his name-tagged helicopter, but Goldsmith\u2019s theme lent that act an air of unearned grandiosity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1ac364548256b0c4fbed012afd4ecb2446567be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ac364548256b0c4fbed012afd4ecb2446567be/0_0_1227_1877/654.jpg\" alt=\"The Clintons listen to a midair briefing in 1996.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Clintons listen to a midair briefing in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Mcneely/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s enthusiasm is easy to understand: as <em>Air Force One </em>begins, Marshall plays the kind of president any of us might fancy being, a man for whom the executive branch and its perks are a licence to daydream. Returning to the airport in wintry Moscow, he suggests a whimsical detour on the way home: \u201cLet\u2019s go to Barbados.\u201d Here, in theory, is true power, unhindered by responsibility; the plane is a magic carpet. But once he forfeits control of Air Force One, Marshall is suddenly disempowered. Hiding from the terrorists in the luggage compartment, he finds a mobile phone with which he tries to alert the cabinet to his plight. He has to go through the White House switchboard and when he identifies himself to the woman on duty she refuses to put him through because he sounds like a crackpot fantasist. That, a year ago, is how everyone viewed Trump; real life, we now know, is not quite as reasonable or as immune to delusion as Harrison Ford hoped.</p> <p>Whatever frenzy or folly it is that impels Trump, his motive can hardly be the desire to survey the world from inside Air Force One. He already has a plane, a secondhand 757 branded with his surname along its fuselage and his cross-country trips in it have made him look prematurely presidential. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, began her campaign in April 2015 with a road trip, a reprise of the mythically intrepid expeditions of the pioneers in their horsedrawn wagons: she travelled from New York to Iowa in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/hillary-clinton-iowa-road-trip-scooby-doo-van\" title=\"\">a chauffeured and prudently armoured Chevrolet camper, </a>emerging to be photographed at fast-food outlets along the way.</p> <p>Days after she set out, Obama teased Hillary\u2019s mock-modesty at a dinner for White House correspondents. Reflecting on the economy\u2019s ups and downs, he said: \u201cI have a friend who used to make millions a year. Now she\u2019s living out of a van in Iowa.\u201d But this July he invited Hillary back on to Air Force One to fly with him to an electoral rally in North Carolina. In a tweet, Trump railed against this partisan misuse of the plane and claimed that Hillary\u2019s free trip cost taxpayers half a million dollars. Obama\u2019s gesture indeed had a solemn constitutional significance. Never before had an incumbent offered a ride to a candidate for the succession who wasn\u2019t already the vice-president; it meant, as one commentator pointed out, that Obama was \u201cready to hand over the keys to Air Force One\u201d. Perhaps that transfer should be part of the ceremony at the inauguration next January.</p> <p>Guarded by snipers and sniffer dogs in a hangar that is described as a \u201csanctuary\u201d, debarred to anyone without security clearance, Air Force One is a symptom of the privileged exclusivity that Trump the populist pretends to despise. With his customary shrewdness, he has maintained an advantage by symbolically opening his private jet to all, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq3iCn2y74\" title=\"\">a video tour posted on YouTube.</a></p> <p>As hostess \u2013 a throwback to the days when flight attendants were described that way \u2013 he has appointed Amanda Miller, his gatekeeper in the reality show <em>The Apprentice</em>. (She first came to Trump\u2019s attention as a 15-year-old waitress at one of his golf clubs and after she graduated from college with a degree in fashion merchandising he hired her as a corporate marketer.) With one hand propped on her hip like a starlet posing on a red carpet, Miller purringly extols the plane\u2019s luxuries: seat belts plated in 24-carat gold, head rests on which the Trump family\u2019s spurious crest is embroidered, silk-clad walls for the boss\u2019s bedroom, Ultrasuede ceiling panels, mahogany cabinets, a shower cubicle. We are supposed to slaver enviously at this ostentation; if we don\u2019t, we condemn ourselves as losers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq3iCn2y74\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UZq3iCn2y74?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch a guided tour of Donald Trump\u2019s 757.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump\u2019s plane does without the emergency medical facilities secreted on Air Force One, which has an operating table discreetly stowed in a wall like a fold-up bed. Instead, Miller recommends a bouncy mohair divan (she pronounces it \u201cdive-in\u201d) in the guest bedroom. To conclude the tour she curls up on a sofa, tosses gobbets of popcorn into her mouth and relaxes with a film from Trump\u2019s on-board <em>cin\u00e9math\u00e8que</em> of a thousand movies. We hear only noises \u2013 a burst of gunfire and the clatter of broken glass: she could be watching Harrison Ford fight back against the hijackers in Petersen\u2019s <em>Air Force One</em>.</p> <p>That would not be my choice for in-flight entertainment, since the film\u2019s climax is a plane crash. With failing engines, ruptured fuel tanks and a damaged rudder, Air Force One finally lunges into the Caspian Sea and breaks apart; just in time, Ford is safely yanked on to a hovering Hercules turboprop, which, as its pilot beamingly announces while the theme appropriated by Trump blares out one last time, at once becomes Air Force One. This is how the succession works in the supposedly unmonarchical United States: the plane is dead, long live the plane.</p> <p>Obama, asked in 2012 what he might miss if he weren\u2019t re-elected, said: \u201cThe plane is really nice, it really is. It\u2019s a great plane.\u201d Now that he\u2019ll soon lose his right to it, he must dread having to take commercial flights again \u2013 a crash landing for the executive ego. Of course there are consolation prizes. When Bill Clinton left the White House, he swapped Air Force One for an aerial pleasure palace, a Boeing 757 owned by his fun-loving billionaire buddy Ron Burkle, a venture capitalist who, according to <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/bill-clinton-health-trump-and-hillary\" title=\"\">a recent article in <em>GQ,</em></a> paid Clinton $15m for his schmoozy aid in recruiting international clients; the in-flight services available on Burkle\u2019s jolly jet prompted the tycoon\u2019s employees to call it \u201cAir Fuck One\u201d. Absolute power, as Trump understands, can mean uninhibited self-indulgence.</p> <p>As Americans prepare to elect another president, a new presidential plane is on order. Last year, the air force secretary, Deborah Lee James, announced that the Boeing VC25-A currently in use would be replaced by a Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, which \u201cwhen fully missionised\u2026 will meet the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission, while reflecting the office of the president of the United States of America consistent with the national public interest\u201d.</p> <p>That sentence, which mixes aggression with evangelism by placing an execution between two missions, packs in all the contradictions of the myth that sustains the country and supplies its Messiah-like sense of purpose. But will a technological upgrade to the plane solve the problems of the presidency, which, thanks to props like Air Force One, has an aura of insuperable power, even though in practice it is limited or even enfeebled by partisan feuds and the rapid disillusionment of an electorate that wants its wishes instantly&#xa0;gratified?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2d96c3bbfb0b03a121bcde35f4d8cb7a1948d0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2d96c3bbfb0b03a121bcde35f4d8cb7a1948d0a/0_0_2009_2700/744.jpg\" alt=\"George W.

Reality flails and flounders, unable to match the myth. After the terrorist attacks on 9/11, President Bush spent the rest of the day flying to and fro between Florida and Nebraska in a sky that had been emptied of all other traffic. Secure in the \u201cmobile command centre\u201d of Air Force One, he issued no coherent commands, later shiftily explaining that he remained aloft because he didn\u2019t want to give \u201cthe bad guys\u201d the satisfaction of killing him. Air Force One keeps the president out of harm\u2019s way, but it also ensures that he remains out of touch. The shining seas and purple mountains celebrated in the patriotic hymn are far below and actual Americans remain invisible.</p> <p>\u201cThe presidential aircraft,\u201d James insisted, \u201cis one of the most visible symbols of the United States at home and abroad.\u201d True, but a plane is an odd or ominous symbol for a country, which surely consists of terrain, not airspace. Thunderous, scarily propulsive, bristling with weaponry, Air Force One encourages effusions of the wrong kind about American greatness; what\u2019s worse is that Petersen\u2019s film has made it an arena for crazed feats of derring-do by a superhero \u2013 or, with luck, by a superheroine in a nattily tailored trouser suit. The overlapping of politics and fiction is absurd, but that\u2019s no reason not to find it alarming. The very irrationality of myth makes it irresistible in a time of unease or trauma like the present: we are all at risk of being blown away by the rhetorical jet exhaust that Air Force One leaves behind it.</p> <p><em>Peter Conrad\u2019s Mythomania: Tales of Our Times, from Apple to Isis, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson next month. </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mythomania.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for the special price of \u00a315.94</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Alfie Allen, the 29-year-old actor, is not the boastful sort, but there have been occasional moments lately when he\u2019s realised his career is not going too badly. One of these came when he was shooting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/29/mondaymediasection.bbc\">Stephen Poliakoff</a>\u2019s new BBC drama, <em>Close to the Enemy</em> \u2013 pretty well a decade on from the writer-director giving him his television break in 2007\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/nov/05/lastnightstvjoespalace\"><em>Joe\u2019s Palace</em></a>.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the reason I got to work with Stephen again is because I\u2019m still doing OK,\u201d says Allen, with sincerity. \u201cI mean it. I\u2019m doing this TV show, which is big. And Stephen likes me as an actor, which is fantastic. He\u2019s so energetic, I love working with him; I think he\u2019s a genius.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, and \u201cthis TV show\u201d, if you didn\u2019t know, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode\"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, which Allen has appeared in \u2013 something of a rarity \u2013 since the very beginning. And he\u2019s quite right about it being \u201cbig\u201d: the sixth, most recent series had an average UK audience of more than 5 million, making it Sky\u2019s most popular TV series ever. Allen plays Theon Greyjoy, presumed heir to Pyke in the Iron Islands, though in recent times he\u2019s been caked in mud as the simpering manservant re-named Reek.</p> <p>It\u2019s a pretty bleak role \u2013 he has been kidnapped and memorably castrated \u2013 but Allen has loved being in <em>Game of Thrones</em> and the opportunities it has given him. \u201cI\u2019m forever grateful for that,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever really know how big it was or is until it finishes and then something else comes out that equals it. Then I\u2019ll be able to view that as an outsider and go, \u2018Bloody hell! Is this what <em>Game of Thrones</em> was like?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Allen, who today wears a throwback, on-trend Champion tracksuit with a tweed flat cap and Seinfeld-white Nike trainers, seems to have been famous for ever. His parents are the actor Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen, and he was immortalised in an affectionate but not wholly flattering 2006 song by his sister, Lily Allen, called \u201cAlfie\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I definitely feel like I had a different upbringing to a lot of other people, but not in a bad \u2013 or good \u2013 way,\u201d he reflects. \u201cWhen I was a kid I was roaming through Glastonbury Festival at eight years old, on my own. I say \u2018on my own\u2019, but I was probably with my oldest sister Sarah, and she would have been 13 or 14 at the time, so she\u2019d have been walking us around. But I got to go places and meet people, and was trusted a lot, without a doubt.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Equus put me on the map more as an actor rather than as a celebrity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Allen never seriously considered anything other than being an actor, although his father gave him a warning: \u201cHe told me that 95% of the acting game is about rejection and 5% is the good part. And that was definitely true for a long time.\u201d A turning point, he feels, came in 2008 when, aged 21, he took over from Daniel Radcliffe in the revival of the play <em>Equus</em>. \u201cIt put me on the map more as an actor rather than as a celebrity,\u201d says Allen, \u201cwhich was great.\u201d</p> <p>And now the parts just seem to be getting better and better: the 5% his dad alluded to. Allen has just finished the West End run of Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s hit play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/03/the-spoils-review-jesse-eisenberg-trafalgar-studios\"><em>The Spoils</em></a>, and in September he returns to Northern Ireland for a four-month stint on the penultimate series of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Before that, there\u2019s Poliakoff\u2019s six-part series, which is set in 1946 and tells the intriguing story of the postwar effort to recruit Nazi scientists for Britain\u2019s national interest. Allen plays Ringwood, part of a team ensconced in a bomb-ravaged London hotel charged with securing the intel to develop the jet engine for the RAF.</p> <p>\u201cThat period is great,\u201d says Allen. \u201cPeople were still rationing, living in wartime conditions and everybody was still having it off with each other because they thought the next day might be their last.\u201d</p> <p>All of which is decent going for an actor who will still only turn 30 next month. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m up and coming,\u201d Allen laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t have any fear of turning 30. But maybe that\u2019s because I know I\u2019m never going to be 30 mentally at any point in my life!\u201d </p> <p>Close to the Enemy<em> starts this autumn on BBC2</em></p>",
  "<p>A football field and a grove of mango trees lie between Bongwe and its neighbouring village. On one side live the family of 33-year-old Subira Mwangole, shot dead by gunmen while watching television with friends one evening in May. On the other live his alleged murderers.</p> <p>The two villages, 30km south of the port city of Mombasa on Kenya\u2019s coast, are almost identical: three-room houses with rusting tin or thatch roofs, a ramshackle primary school, a government office, a small mosque with white walls stained by rain, a crossroads where two tracks meet, a well, small plots of tall corn plants.</p> <p>Yet, despite their placid appearances, the villages lie on the invisible frontline of a brutal, low-level, three-way war pitting security agencies against the Islamic extremist network al-Shabaab, and the militants against the local community. It is a war carried out by small groups of armed men who shoot first and ask few questions.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very anxious, frightened. He knew he could die at any moment. We all know we could be next,\u201d said Ibrahim, a former al-Shabaab fighter and a close relative of Mwangole.</p> <p>There is a steady beat of violence. The extremists murder those they see as a threat. Local human rights groups say the police do the same thing. Both sets of killers know that the fear they provoke brings impunity.</p> <p>Mwangole was particularly hated by al-Shabaab for his role in convincing veterans of the movement to take advantage of an amnesty offered by the Kenyan ministry of the interior last year. The shopkeeper and father of two was himself a defector from the group, which has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2006 and has expanded across the porous border into Kenya.</p> <p>Mwangole was shot in the head by a group of men dressed as policemen but identified by family members as local members of al-Shabaab. His death was swiftly followed by the murder, in similar circumstances, <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Fear-grips-Kwale-as-three-Nyumba-Kumi-officials-are-killed-/-/1056/3224602/-/tkptij/-/index.html\" title=\"\">of three community leaders in Bongwe</a>. All were involved in government \u201canti-radicalisation\u201d schemes.</p> <p>Hundreds have died at the hands of Islamic militants in Kenya in recent decades. A first wave of violence between 1998 and 2002 was directed by al-Qaida against foreign targets, including US embassies and Israeli tourists. It had ebbed by the middle of the last decade.</p> <p>But radicalism was growing among Kenya\u2019s Muslim minority, fuelled by a sense of marginalisation, extremist clerics, the impact of the US-led \u201cwar on terror\u201d and a shift away from traditional moderate Islamic practices to more rigorous versions of the faith influenced by countries in the Gulf.</p> <p>In 2013 gunmen from al-Shabaab <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24191606\" title=\"\">stormed a shopping mall in Nairobi,</a> Kenya\u2019s capital, killing 67 people. Last year 148 people were shot dead at a university in Kenya\u2019s north-east. Both attacks were launched from Somalia, where Kenyan troops are fighting the extremists as part of an African Union force, but focused attention on support networks within Kenya itself.</p> <p>Investigators found that young men from villages such as Bongwe in Kwale county had been travelling to Somalia to fight with al-Shabaab for over a decade. Authorities launched a major crackdown and, officials say, a comprehensive \u201canti-radicalisation\u201d strategy. One element was the amnesty announced last year. By this spring, 70 al-Shabaab veterans \u2013 or returnees \u2013 had made a clean breast of their militant past to authorities, receiving an assurance that they would not be prosecuted in return.</p> <p>According to local journalists and former al-Shabaab fighter Sami, who worked closely with Mwangole and was a friend, two amnestied returnees have since been killed, as have six other al-Shabaab veterans.</p> <p>\u201cWe trusted the government. We thought we could live a better life, in peace, and put our past behind us,\u201d Sami said.</p> <p>Many amnestied veterans receive constant threats from militants, while also facing harassment from police. \u201cThe government issued an amnesty that was not anchored in law,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.hakiafrica.or.ke/index.php/en/\" title=\"\">Hussein Khaled, of Haki-Africa, a human rights monitoring group in Mombasa.</a></p> <p>The identity of the alleged killers of Mwangole and the three community leaders reveals how, despite the extremist rhetoric of \u201cglobal jihad\u201d, the conflict being fought out in Kwale is very intimate.</p> <p>In interviews with the <em>Observer</em>, Mwangole\u2019s relatives and friends blamed a band of a dozen young men from the neighbouring village for the murders in Bongwe. Most are in their 20s and only recently recruited to al-Shabaab. They include several relatives of the victims. Well before the four murders in May, the group had already made a series of threats to amnestied veterans, accusing them of treachery and spying for the government.</p> <p>Sami, who returned from a stint in Somalia with al-Shabaab six years ago, said: \u201cWe went to the police. We identified those threatening us, but they did nothing. Sometimes I think they wanted Mwangole to be killed \u2013 that\u2019s why they gave him no protection.\u201d</p> <p>In June, police detained 10 men for the killings, including three of those named by Mwangole\u2019s relatives. They say they are confident they have now broken up the network. This has inspired little confidence in Bongwe, however, where the authorities are as feared as al-Shabaab. Campaigners claim systematic human rights abuses by the police, including 70 extrajudicial \u201cexecutions\u201d or disappearances in the past year alone in and around Mombasa.</p> <p>Many such killings and disappearances involve former members of al-Shabaab, or individuals alleged to be extremists. At least three alleged members of al-Shabaab in Kwale have been shot dead by police in recent months.</p> <p>One, named as Omar Hesbon Matheka, died on 4 June when he was <a href=\"http://%20http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000204058/mother-cries-foul-as-police-insist-slain-man-was-a-terror-suspect\" title=\"\">\u201crunning while shooting at the police\u201d, according to officials,</a> who claimed a grenade had been found among the dead man\u2019s possessions. Witnesses said Matheka was killed by officers while sitting in a rickshaw. His mother told local newspapers that the 24-year-old was looking for work.</p> <p>\u201cTerrorism is the worst form of human rights violation. We want to eradicate terrorism \u2026 [but] it seems that the [government] strategy is simply using firepower. There is nothing about community resilience, addressing underlying problems or rule of law,\u201d said human rights activist Khaled.</p> <p>Maalim Mohammed, the police commissioner of Mombasa, denied any human rights abuses by Kenyan security agencies. \u201cThese allegations are baseless, malicious and unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cOur constitution and laws are very clear and we always respect the process. You cannot use coercive means to win against terrorism. You need to win hearts and minds. We get a lot of information from the community.\u201d</p> <p>The police crackdown has had a significant impact \u2013 at least in the short term. Analysts say the al-Shabaab support network on the coast and elsewhere is much weaker than it was, and has been eradicated in Mombasa.</p> <p>The British and US governments recently lifted <a href=\"http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2015/11/17/us-uk-tourists-flock-to-kenya-after-travel-warnings-lifted_c1243184\" title=\"\">travel warnings</a> applied two years ago to almost all of Kenya\u2019s Indian Ocean coastline, giving the crucial tourist industry a much-needed boost. \u201cWe can assure all visitors that they will be entirely safe here on the coast of Kenya,\u201d Mohammed said.</p> <p>But there are still frequent cross-border incidents. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-attacks-idUSKCN0Z60SE\" title=\"\">Five policemen were recently killed by suspected al-Shabaab fighters</a> near the border with Somalia. There is also continuing recruitment, according to villagers. Several Kwale county residents, who did not want to be named, added that some women are also attracted by the extremist ideology, and marry al-Shabaab veterans in the area.</p> <p>Last weekend Bongwe and its neighbouring village were calm. Both were full of women wearing flowing robes. Young children, cows and chickens wandered between the trees. A dozen youths wearing old T-shirts played on the football pitch.</p> <p>\u201cI left one war behind me in Somalia when I returned,\u201d said Ibrahim. \u201cBut now I am in the middle of another one.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The latest in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/02/purge-review\" title=\"\">horror series</a> that uses an anti-violence message as a Trojan horse to deliver exactly the kind of grimly visceral thrills it purports to condemn, <em>The Purge: Election Year</em> feels like a franchise that is running out of ideas. This year\u2019s Purge \u2013 the 12 hours during which all crime is legal \u2013 coincides with an electoral campaign. Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) is campaigning on an anti-Purge ticket, which makes her a target for the spittle-flecked reactionaries who now run the country. Her best hope for survival is to dodge the mercenaries with Nazi insignia tattooed on their faces, avoid the murder tourists in Halloween fright masks, and stick next to Sergeant Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo, reprising his role from the previous film).

This cacophonous weather is somehow created with woodwind and brass. And high on the far wall burns a black sun \u2013 or is it a dark moon? \u2013 that catches the shifting light as if it were in motion in itself.

This is apt. His clay drawing was first created for this very place. A black-and-white photograph from 1971 shows visitors in bell-bottoms making their meditative way around the maze in exactly the same spot. We walk the line just as they once did. The artwork has vanished only to reappear, apparently unchanged. Time flows both forwards and backwards.</p> <p>Modern Art Oxford is a mountain in the landscape of modern art. Founded in 1966, it was one of that great wave of new institutions that included the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, the Camden Arts Centre in London and the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham. Although it was known as the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford right up until its name changed in 2002, there was never any sign of a permanent collection. In fact, the temporary exhibitions changed with what now seems like extraordinary rapidity \u2013 six, seven or even eight in one year.</p> <p>It was here that I first saw the work of Bill Brandt, Peter Kennard, Agnes Martin and Robert Mapplethorpe. Generations of students took in the latest art upstairs before descending to the basement for the stout but inexpensive food. David Elliott, director for 20 years until 1996, mounted Indian, Japanese and Soviet seasons, with vivid shows on Pasternak and Mayakovsky. You looked and learned, and occasionally you listened. Bands played. Artists talked. Films were screened. Marina Abramovi\u0107 performed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2470004c289511e046825385a1af720692da56c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2470004c289511e046825385a1af720692da56c/0_114_3744_5180/723.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Reason weighed against the mysteries of nature\u2019: Scales, 2014 (detail) by Dorothy Cross, made from the gilded halves of a split cranium.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Reason weighed against the mysteries of nature\u2019: Scales, 2014 (detail) by Dorothy Cross, made from the gilded halves of a split cranium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and the Kerlin Gallery, Dublin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicholas Serota, one of the earliest directors, brought Joseph Beuys, Christian Boltanski and Carl Andre to Oxford. He invited Sol LeWitt to draw directly on the walls. The gallery was always concerned with ideas as much as artworks; <a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1966-Space-Place.jpg\">Space Place</a> was the title of its first major show.</p> <p>And so it is with the present event. The gallery texts go on about the digital era in which message speaks unto message and people are more likely to be immersed in their smartphones than in the great outdoors. The artists have been chosen supposedly because they \u201cinvestigate ways in which we may connect more deeply with nature\u201d. This is acceptable persiflage, of course, a ruse for gathering together some of the most illustrious names of the gallery\u2019s half century. So there are pieces by Abramovi\u0107, Agnes Martin, Helen Chadwick and Yoko Ono, who gives the viewer a set of airy instructions: \u201cImagine the clouds dripping/ Dig a hole in your garden to put them in.\u201d This was the 60s, but Ono hasn\u2019t changed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9034a6ec3a7ab1fd194f32f4c4ae7f281002c1e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9034a6ec3a7ab1fd194f32f4c4ae7f281002c1e6/0_0_2130_681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Chadwick\u2019s Viral Landscapes (detail) 1988-89.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"320\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Chadwick\u2019s Viral Landscapes (detail), 1988-89.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy National Museums Liverpool</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abramovi\u0107 painstakingly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROpzkh40Lmk\">washes the bones of a human skeleton</a> as a way of exorcising her terror of death.

For nature, at this point, read death.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/22/agnes-martin-the-artist-mystic-who-disappeared-into-the-desert\">Agnes Martin</a>\u2019s silkscreen prints turn towards the light. Serenely beautiful, these permutations on the simple intersection of straight lines seem to expand on the walls in endlessly varying grids. Each print seems to hint at infinity and is yet completely contained by geometry. <a href=\"http://collections.lacma.org/node/155378\"><em>On a Clear Day</em></a> (1973), made in New Mexico, was Martin\u2019s title for this captivating sequence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f68ede85edc4c36f1d97bd0f0062d76bc50ec051\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f68ede85edc4c36f1d97bd0f0062d76bc50ec051/0_0_3719_5579/667.jpg\" alt=\"Distil, 2014 by Dorothy Cross.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distil, 2014 by Dorothy Cross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and the Kerlin Gallery, Dublin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is almost a miniature <a href=\"http://www.frithstreetgallery.com/artists/bio/dorothy_cross\">Dorothy Cross</a> show-within-a-show here, with several large installations by the Irish artist. Inside a high glass dome, a barrister\u2019s wig rests on a pillar of grey marble, as if the truth upon which the law depends was inevitably a grey matter. In another outlandish spectacle, an antique telescope dangles like a plumb line above a beautiful shell, silver inside (in fact it is a fragment of skull). Classical pediments balance on pillars of beachwood.</p> <p>The objects of our empirical endeavour are juxtaposed with the equally elegant flotsam of nature. In some cases they are locked in poetic impasse. From a coathanger hangs a pair of golden scales containing sparkling meteorites; up close, these turn out to be the gilded halves of a split cranium, the two sides cupping what are themselves the relics of dead stars. Cross weighs reason against the mysteries of nature.</p> <p>In the last gallery, Abramovi\u0107\u2019s <em>Black Dragon</em> projects from the wall: three chunks of quartz positioned at head, heart and loin height; the artist was apparently investigating the healing power of crystals. Back in the 90s, visitors were urged to lean against them, but not any more. Now all touching is forbidden. This is one story of our experience of art in the past 50 years, permanently distorted by soaring prices and insurance costs. But it is also, in another sense, the story of Modern Art Oxford \u2013 a place where so many people had their first glimpse of international artists in solo shows before they became too big for this world.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/event/its-me-to-the-world/\">It\u2019s Me to the World is at Modern Art Oxford until 11 November</a></li> </ul>",

  "<p>I first met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/uganda-chess-prodigy-story-to-become-hollywood-film\">Phiona Mutesi</a> in September 2010 sitting on the mud stoop of her family\u2019s shack in one of the most challenging places on earth: Uganda\u2019s Katwe slum. I had been told about Phiona; how at the age of nine she could neither read nor write and had dropped out of school, when she met a Ugandan missionary, Robert Katende, who offered to teach her the game of chess \u2013 a sport so foreign in Uganda that there is no word for it in Phiona\u2019s native language \u2013 and how in just four years she had become an international chess champion. On that autumn day, Phiona\u2019s mother Harriet looked as defeated as any person I\u2019ve known. She had been forced to relocate Phiona and her two brothers five times in the previous four years, once because they\u2019d been robbed of all their meagre possessions and another time because Harriet feared their house was about to collapse.</p> <p>Phiona\u2019s latest home consisted of one 10ft x 10ft room with no windows and a tin roof so dilapidated that every rainstorm flooded the shack. The house contained little more than a wash pot, a tiny charcoal stove, a teapot, a worn toothbrush, a cracked mirror, a Bible and two musty mattresses for the entire family to sleep on.</p> <p>Katwe (pronounced kah-tway), in the south of Uganda\u2019s sprawling, smoggy capital city of Kampala, emerged in the mid-20th century as a place for poor artisans, but developed into the city\u2019s most crime-ridden slum. It has scant sanitation and during the rainy season is regularly flooded with raw sewage, with residents sleeping on their roofs to avoid drowning. If you are born in Katwe, the chances are you will die in Katwe. It\u2019s estimated that 40% of teenage women in Katwe have children. \u201cI call it a poverty chain,\u201d Katende told me. \u201cThe single mother cannot sustain the home. Her children go to the street and have more kids and they don\u2019t have the capacity to care for those kids. It is a cycle of misery that is almost impossible to break.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05598a1cb7461a10e9a5c7996f93c8cd7415f48c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05598a1cb7461a10e9a5c7996f93c8cd7415f48c/0_145_5316_3190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local hero: Phiona Mutesi\u2019s neighbourhood in Kampala, Uganda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local hero: Phiona Mutesi\u2019s neighbourhood in Kampala, Uganda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Sinclair</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During our initial meeting, Phiona didn\u2019t speak comfortably because she had never been encouraged to share her thoughts. She began by telling me she had no idea when she was born because birthdays aren\u2019t something people keep track of in Katwe. (Harriet guesses her daughter was born in 1996.) I asked her about her earliest memory. \u201cI remember I went to my dad\u2019s village when I was about three years old to see him when he was very sick, and a week later he died of Aids,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the funeral we stayed in the village for a few weeks and one morning when I woke up my older sister Julia told me she was feeling a headache. We got some local herbs and gave them to her and then she went to sleep. The following morning we found her dead in her bed. That\u2019s what I remember.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I first saw chess, I thought, \u2018What could make all these kids so silent?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harriet recalls that when Phiona was a child she nearly died twice of illnesses that were never diagnosed, but probably related to malaria. Phiona dropped out of school shortly after her father died and she began selling boiled maize from a saucepan on her head. One afternoon in 2005 she secretly followed her older brother Brian in the hope that he might lead her towards a meal. She hid and watched him enter a dusty veranda to play with some black and white pieces. The young girl had never seen anything like these figures. She thought they were beautiful. \u201cWhen I first saw chess, I thought, \u2018What could make all these kids so silent?\u2019\u201d Phiona said. \u201cThen I watched them play the game and get happy and excited, and I wanted a chance to be that happy.\u201d</p> <p>She dared to peek into the veranda again, fascinated by this new game and also curious if there might be any food inside. This time Katende spotted her. \u201cYoung girl,\u201d said the coach. \u201cCome in. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Katende also has no idea when he was born, only that he was an illegitimate child whose mother gave birth to him when she was a secondary-school student. He was transferred to his grandmother\u2019s care, and it wasn\u2019t until Katende was four years old and reunited with his mother in Kampala\u2019s Nakulabye slum that he learned his name was Robert. His mother died when he was around eight and he embarked on an odyssey of despair. Because of civil war in Uganda, he lived much of his childhood on the run, scrounging for food and sleeping hidden in the bush. He would become another slum kid sustained by sport.</p> <p>Katende had grown up playing football barefoot and by the time he reached secondary school he displayed such wondrous talent as a striker that he took requests from friends to score goals. One day he leapt for a header, crashed into the opposing goalkeeper and the resulting fall nearly killed him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143944252363d9fd63b700bee036cb211dd7ca24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/143944252363d9fd63b700bee036cb211dd7ca24/0_146_3008_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deep in thought: Phiona Mutesi at 15.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deep in thought: Phiona Mutesi at 15.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xan Rice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though doctors told him he would never play football again, he was back juggling a ball within months and eventually joined a Christian football club that ministered to youth in the slums. Katende had found his calling.</p> <p>He was assigned to Katwe and for a year he brought football and a little food to the children of the slum, until he realised some of the children had no desire to play football. He tried to figure out an alternative activity and eventually settled on chess, a game he\u2019d learned to play as a student. \u201cI had my doubts about chess in Katwe,\u201d Katende said. \u201cWith their status and their background, I wondered, \u2018Can these kids really play this game?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What gave Katende hope was that chess is a test of survival through aggression, an idea with which every slum kid could identify. Katende\u2019s Katwe chess project began with just six students, who would become known as the Pioneers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chess is a lot like my life. If you make smart moves you can stay away from danger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soon, Phiona\u2019s brother Brian joined them and a year later a barefoot girl in a muddy skirt peeked into the veranda and caught Katende\u2019s eye. Phiona\u2019s first chess tutor was Gloria, a four-year-old girl who knew little more than the names of the pieces and how they moved. Within a year of learning the game, mostly through trial and error, it became evident that Phiona had a special gift for the sport. \u201cChess is a lot like my life,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you make smart moves you can stay away from danger, but any bad decision could be your last.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b6452cc35a727cf7958f5224ca5936fdc61e8b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b6452cc35a727cf7958f5224ca5936fdc61e8b7/0_0_3816_2290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girls on film: with director Mira Nair and Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who plays Phiona\u2019s mother in the new film.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girls on film: with director Mira Nair and Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who plays Phiona\u2019s mother in the new film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isaac Kasamani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every day Phiona walked six kilometres to play chess. During her earliest games, she played recklessly, sacrificing critical pieces in an attempt to defeat her opponents as quickly as she could. Said Phiona: \u201cI must have lost my first 50 matches before Coach Robert persuaded me to play with calm and patience.\u201d</p> <p>Katende began teaching her everything he knew about the strategy of the game and by the age of 11 Phiona was Uganda\u2019s junior girls champion. Her confidence rose. \u201cHer personality with the outside world is still quite reserved because she feels inferior due to her background,\u201d Katende said. \u201cBut in chess I am always reminding her that anyone can lift a piece because it is so light. What separates you is where you choose to put it down. Chess is the one thing in Phiona\u2019s life she can control. Chess is her one chance to feel superior.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009, Phiona and two boys from Katende\u2019s Katwe chess project represented Uganda in Africa\u2019s International Children\u2019s Chess Tournament in Sudan. It was one of the first times Phiona had ever left Katwe. It was also her first flight and when her plane ascended through a cloud bank into the sun and blue sky, Phiona turned to the Ugandan chess official seated beside her and asked, \u201cIs this heaven?\u201d</p> <p>In Sudan, Phiona enjoyed her first stay in a hotel. It was the first time she had slept in her own bed and used a flush toilet and ordered a meal from a menu, an odd notion for someone who had never before been granted a choice of what to eat. \u201cI could never have imagined this world I was visiting,\u201d Phiona said. \u201cI felt like a queen.\u201d</p> <p>The Ugandan trio of slum kids, by far the youngest competitors in the tournament, defeated far more experienced teams from 16 other African nations to win the championship. When they returned to Katwe, they were greeted as conquering heroes. They discussed who might keep the trophy and concluded that none of them could because it would certainly be stolen.</p> <p>They also fielded some odd questions: did you stay indoors or in the bush? Why did you come back here? As Phiona left the celebration that evening, someone excitedly asked her, \u201cWhat is the first thing you\u2019re going to say to your mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to ask her,\u201d Phiona said, \u201c\u2018Do we have enough food for breakfast?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After a few days of getting to know her in September 2010, I flew to Russia with Phiona and Robert for the Chess Olympiad, the world\u2019s most elite team chess event, being staged that year in Khanty-Mansiysk, Siberia. Once again this proved to be a learning experience. Phiona turned on the water for her first ever shower and quickly jumped out. She asked her roommate why anybody would want to use such a thing and then she was informed that there was a handle for hot water as well. One of the youngest players at the tournament, Phiona earned a win and a draw for the Ugandan team in her seven matches.</p> <p>But Katende\u2019s enduring memory was after Phiona\u2019s third match when she was soundly defeated by an Egyptian grandmaster and she promptly marched over to her mentor and told him, \u201cCoach, I will be a grandmaster some day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat will take a lot of work and perseverance,\u201d Katende told her. Phiona savoured the meals at her hotel\u2019s all-you-can-eat buffet and left Russia stating that returning to Katwe felt like going to jail. It was a trip both triumphant and sobering.</p> <p>Two years later, Phiona performed well enough in the 2012 Chess Olympiad in Istanbul to become Uganda\u2019s first woman ever to earn a chess title, Woman Candidate Master, the first step on the ladder toward grandmaster. Then she made her first trip to the United States to help promote our book, <em>The Queen of Katwe</em>.</p> <p>It was during that visit that I first recognised Phiona\u2019s power to inspire. She came to my son\u2019s third grade classroom and a bunch of restless nine-year-olds fell silent as she shared her story. Only two of the 20 students in the class knew how to play chess, so Phiona sat down at one of the tiny school desks and began patiently teaching the game the way Gloria had once taught her. The next day the students begged to play chess again. The following year the entire third grade competed in chess and the year after that more than 200 kids in four grade levels were all part of what had become known around school as the Phiona Mutesi Chess Club.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Phiona\u2019s story is inspiring young girls like me all over Uganda</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I travelled back to Uganda in July and was greeted at the airport by Madina Nalwanga, the teenager who plays Phiona in the upcoming Disney movie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/11/lupita-nyongo-the-trailer-disney-queen-of-katwe-chess\"><em>Queen of Katwe</em></a>.

She is now 20 years old and it is remarkable how much she has matured in the six years since I first met her on the stoop of that one-room shack in Katwe. She is still unfailingly humble, unaffected by the publicity swirling around her as the film prepares to premiere in cinemas around the world this autumn. Phiona is a confident young woman, who speaks English fluently. She is in the final year of secondary school at a boarding school in Katwe. She spends holidays at her mother\u2019s newly constructed house in a lush valley several kilometres outside Kampala. Phiona and her family are finally financially secure based on earnings from the book and movie contracts. She told me she is considering going to Harvard university next autumn.</p> <p>Phiona still dreams of becoming a grandmaster in chess, though she has hit a ceiling in Uganda because there is no coach qualified to train her to a higher level, a barrier that could be erased if she decides to study in the United States.</p> <p>I asked Phiona if she\u2019d seen the movie. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t watched it yet,\u201d she told me, flashing her charming gap-toothed grin. \u201cI already know the story.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true that <em>The Queen of Katwe</em> \u2013 book and movie \u2013 may be complete, but the Queen of Katwe\u2019s story is really just beginning and it will be fascinating to watch her next move. </p> <p>The Queen of Katwe<em> by Tim Crothers is published by Abacus, \u00a38.99.

You are aware that the advisers were comfortable with \u00a320m annual synergy benefits above and beyond cost savings that would be achieved in the ordinary course of business.

  "<p>When flight schedules go wrong, they go horribly wrong. Terminals become chaotic, with long-delayed and increasingly dishevelled passengers spread all over the concourse. There are queues for \u20ac5 vouchers to join other queues for overpriced food. Tempers get frayed. This correspondent once spent 13 very unhappy hours in a sweaty Palma de Mallorca airport waiting for a flight to transport us to the relative luxury of Luton.</p> <p>Delays such as these are why the EU introduced its <a href=\"http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">flight compensation rules</a>. Brussels declared that when flights arrive at their final destination three hours or more late, the passenger is eligible for \u20ac250-\u20ac600 in compensation, depending on the distance flown. They were cited by some as a reason to vote to remain in the EU.</p> <p>Since the EU261 rules came into force, the airlines have spent much of their time trying to wriggle out of them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/may/11/airlines-ignore-court-rulings-over-compensation-for-delayed-flights\" title=\"\">as the <em>Observer</em> has highlighted</a>. Many will define routine problems as \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to avoid paying refunds. Online applications are made deliberately obtuse in the hope that frustrated applicants will give up along the way. And many do.</p> <p>But, while newspapers traditionally campaign for consumer rights, could it be that the compensation awards (we\u2019ll whisper this very quietly) are just a bit <em>too</em> generous?</p> <p>Take, for example, a colleague recently back from the Costa Dorada this summer. His Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London was delayed for more than three hours. He has since obtained \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3853) compensation for himself, wife and two children. How much did he pay for those flights? Less than \u00a3400. He feels like he has been given a free holiday.</p> <p>The same colleague flew British Airways from Heathrow to Hawaii last year for a once-in-a-lifetime treat with the family. That flight was also delayed, by just over three hours, and because it was more than 3,500km, they qualified for the big one: \u20ac600 compensation per person. The family picked up \u20ac2,400 (just under \u00a32,000 at the time) from BA. Not quite the whole cost of the tickets, but not far off.</p> <p>You may be left thinking: \u201cI wish I got delayed like that.\u201d Passengers delayed for two-and-a-half hours often find themselves praying the delay will go on for at least another 30 minutes.</p> <p>If they were in America, they wouldn\u2019t be. The US has no formal compensation rules for flight delays. Travellers can be delayed 24 hours on a flight from LA to Manchester and receive nothing, but they can pick up \u00a3500 if they are held up for three hours flying in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The EU261 rules are designed to knock the airlines into shape, and keep delays to a minimum, argue their proponents. These proponents include an increasing number of lawyers keen to snaffle a one-third cut of any \u201caward\u201d from the airline.</p> <p>Back in 2014, easyJet complained that \u201cpaying compensation far in excess of the fare price places a huge financial burden on us as an airline and will ultimately lead to higher fares for all.\u201d</p> <p>The average ticket at easyJet costs \u00a361.93, and half of all sold are below \u00a350. That means the airline has to pay around three times the ticket revenue it receives when there is a delay.</p> <p>Curiously, the airlines were reluctant when the <em>Observer</em> reached out for comment on this issue. They don\u2019t want to appear to be campaigning against consumer rights.</p> <p>But, off the record, their dissatisfaction with the rules is intense \u2013 and understandable. Limiting compensation just to the fare price may make them a little too sloppy when it comes to avoiding delays. But mightn\u2019t it be fairer to repay travellers their ticket price, plus a set fee, such as \u20ac50 or \u20ac100? Still generous, but not excessive.</p> <p>And we need to be thinking about this, because it\u2019s one of those many EU rules which we may have to renegotiate on Brexit.</p> <h2>Could there be an \u2018Opec for news\u2019?</h2> <p>Finding a way to give newspapers a slug of the advertising cash they have lost to Google is one of those old-media dreams that won\u2019t die. There have been many attempts, most recently in Germany and Spain, but they have all failed. The European commission, we learned on Thursday, is hatching the latest cunning plan.</p> <p>A draft working paper sets out options for a new law. Publishers will have an exclusive right to make their content available to the public and to reproduce it for digital purposes. The intention is to create a better regulatory tool to extract licensing payments from services like Google News.</p> <p>Legislation on its own will change nothing. Publicly funded organisations like the BBC may choose not to demand a fee. And Google could simply stop displaying articles from those who want to charge. The effects can be devastating: when the publisher of <em>Bild</em>, Germany\u2019s biggest tabloid, tried to enforce licensing fees in 2014, its traffic dropped by 80% in two weeks.</p> <p>For licensing to work, news groups will have to act collectively. The creation of Opec in the 1960s transformed the fortunes of oil nations, redressing the balance of power with western-owned oil firms. Should Europe form an Opec for news?</p> <p>Political support for a fightback is at fever pitch in France and Germany, but has been lacking so far in the UK. David Cameron\u2019s links to Google were close. Theresa May, on the other hand, spent years at the Home Office pushing for search engines and social media to take down links to extremist material. She may not be such a fan.</p> <p>But Google is really the wrong target. For many, Facebook is now their primary news source. Publishers voluntarily upload their journalism for free on the platform, where it is then shared between users. The commission\u2019s proposed licensing rights probably wouldn\u2019t apply to the Facebook model. Obtaining fair payment for Europe\u2019s journalistic black gold looks set to remain a pipe dream.</p> <h2>A new chancellor should face up to old poverty statistics</h2> <p>What does a government do when the numbers stop going its way? Stop publishing the numbers, of course.</p> <p>That\u2019s how it looked when former chancellor George Osborne ditched the Treasury\u2019s analysis of how his budgets affected the very poorest and the richest in Britain. Instead, after the Conservatives\u2019 election victory, an inferior substitute of this \u201cdistributional analysis\u201d was concocted. Rather than looking at 10 income groups, it covered just five \u2013 so the impact of austerity on the very poorest was no longer clear. Instead of showing what households actually received, the new model showed changes in the share of public spending received. The newer analysis also projected future effects, not how households were faring in the present.</p> <p>Now Andrew Tyrie MP, chair of the Treasury select committee, is asking the new chancellor Philip Hammond to revert to the old, more transparent analysis.

  "<p>When the 6th Duke of Westminster died this month, his son Hugh Richard Louis Grosvenor took on not just his father\u2019s title but also an inheritance estimated at \u00a39bn.

If you have assets which exceed the \u00a3325,000 nil-rate band (or \u00a3650,000 for a couple), you can set up a trust to pass assets down the generations without IHT being incurred.\u201d No minimum amount is required to set one up. \u201cYou could set up a trust with just \u00a31 or \u00a310,000,\u201d say Smith. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have millions to put away.\u201d</p> <p>If you put assets in a trust you need to survive seven years for them to move entirely out of your estate for IHT purposes. \u201cIf you are thinking about a trust, you need to be aware that you are effectively giving money away, as the trust can\u2019t be unravelled and the money returned to you,\u201d Smith warns.</p> <p>At the same time, while you may like the sound of the structures used by the Grosvenor family, you need to be aware that the rules on trusts have changed a lot over the years.</p> <p>\u201cThe rules in place in the 1950s are likely to be hugely different from the rules now,\u201d says Chas Roy-Chowdhury from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. \u201cYou also need to remember that the government is coming down very hard on tax avoidance, so ensure you abide by the rules.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Using a trust</strong></p> <p>Aside from using a trust to stave off death duties, there are a number of other family situations where they may be useful.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of middle-class people use trusts to protect the interests of family members,\u201d says Clive Gawthorpe from accountancy firm, UHY Hacker Young. \u201cFamilies will appoint trustees to manage assets on their behalf. This can have both practical and tax advantages. For example, if you have a disabled child who cannot manage their own money, you may want to nominate a trustee to manage assets on their behalf.\u201d</p> <p>Another increasingly common reason to set up a trust is to protect children from previous marriages.</p> <p>\u201cIf, for example, a man gets divorced and remarries a new partner, and the couple buy a home together, he might want to set up a trust to ensure the children from his first marriage get a share of the marital home once the spouse dies,\u201d says Smith. \u201cA trust is a way of ensuring that assets go to the correct beneficiaries.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, a trust can be used to stop children from cashing in on their inheritance too soon. This may be useful if the recipient is under 18.</p> <p><strong>Types of trust</strong></p> <p>\u25a0 A discretionary trust is the most common form and has been widely used in the past to minimise IHT. When setting up such a trust, you can name a list of potential beneficiaries. The trustees can then use their discretion to decide who benefits, how much each one receives, and at what age.</p> <p>You have to pay an immediate IHT charge of 20% of the value of assets going in if the value is above the nil-rate band of \u00a3325,000; below this threshold, there is no initial IHT to pay.</p> <p>The seven-year rule also applies, but in addition there is also a test every 10 years. \u201cThis takes place on the anniversary of the creation of the trust,\u201d says Gawthorpe. \u201cIt can involve a tax of up to 6% of the value of the trust going to HM Revenue &amp; Customs.\u201d</p> <p>\u25a0 An absolute \u2013 or bare \u2013 trust is set up in a child\u2019s name and cannot be altered; only one person will ultimately benefit. Bare trusts can often be popular with grandparents wanting to leave assets to younger generations but can result in problems. \u201cFor example, a grandparent may put away \u00a3100,000 for a grandchild, and that child will become absolutely entitled to that money once they turn 18,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThey could then decide to blow the lot on a flash car \u2013 and the grandparents have no control over this.\u201d</p> <p>With an absolute trust, there is no limit on the amount that can be put in, and no immediate tax is payable when the assets go in.</p> <p>\u201cIf you survive for seven years, the assets fall outside of the estate for IHT purposes,\u201d adds Smith.</p> <p><strong>The costs </strong></p> <p>In many cases, trusts can be set up simply at little or no charge. \u201cWhen you set up a trust through a life office, such as Standard Life or Clerical Medical, they will provide \u2018trust wording\u2019 for free,\u201d says Smith.</p> <p>If you are saving a large amount of money, or need to add complicated conditions, you might need a solicitor to draw up the trust. This could mean a fee of between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,500.</p> <p>\u201cRunning costs should be minimal if you use family trustees,\u201d says Gawthorpe. \u201cBut things could become more expensive if you employ professional trustees.\u201d</p> <p>Also remember that if you set up a discretionary trust, you may need to do an annual tax return and factor in accountant\u2019s fees. Equally, it is important to seek professional advice because the rules are complicated.</p> <p><strong>Covering the children</strong></p> <p>George Martin and his wife Celia (we\u2019ve changed their names), both 59, recently set up a discretionary trust as part of their inheritance tax planning.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to ensure our children benefitted from our assets,\u201d says George, who lives near Chester. \u201cWe placed two properties into the trust without paying any capital gains tax. While we currently pay tax at 40% on the income, our children will pay no tax as they have no other income.</p> <p>\u201cUnder current legislation, we hope that the properties will be able to be passed out of the trust and on to our children in a few years\u2019 time, with a substantial saving in IHT, perhaps as much as \u00a3260,000. There was only a charge of \u00a3720 to set up this trust.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Controversy</strong></p> <p>Tax campaigners want reforms to the system of trusts which has allowed Britain\u2019s wealthiest families to preserve fortunes through generations by avoiding death duties.</p> <p>Pressure groups have called on the government to publish its new central register of trusts, which names their beneficiaries and settlers. They want an obligation to publish annual accounts for those collections of assets deemed to have public interest \u2013 such as the thousands of acres of urban and rural land owned by the Grosvenor family.</p> <h2>Ways to cut an inheritance tax bill<br></h2> <p>\u25a0 In each tax year you can make a gift up to the annual exemption of \u00a33,000. On top of this, any unused exemption from the previous tax year can also be used, meaning up to \u00a312,000 per couple.</p> <p>\u25a0 Gifts of up to \u00a3250 can also be made to as many people as you like, free of inheritance tax.</p> <p>\u25a0 Money can be given to children and grandchildren when they get married. You can give up to \u00a35,000 to a child and up to \u00a32,500 to a grandchild.</p> <p>\u25a0 You can reduce the impact of IHT on your estate by using a life assurance policy written in trust. The death benefit of the policy is used to meet all or part of the IHT due, thus preserving the estate.</p> <p>\u25a0 If held for at least two years, certain assets qualify for 100% \u201cbusiness property relief\u201d from IHT. These include qualifying shares in unquoted trading companies, and some listed on Alternative Investment Market. AIM shares can now also be purchased in Isas, providing the potential for an IHT-free Isa account. Enterprise Investment Schemes enjoy similar IHT breaks to qualifying AIM shares.</p> <p><strong>Tips provided by Hargreaves Lansdown</strong></p>",

The market in sexy spatulas and unsexy Cath Kidston aprons went bull. Finally, we were all going to educate our children in the old ways, by entreating them with floury mommy smiles to beat together industrial dosages of fat, chocolate, flour and fat, cook it just short of the required time and go to bed with an educated gut-ache. Because that was, um, exactly what Britain needed. More fat kids.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone got it wrong: they either caked wrongly or drizzled wrongly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course that was just media hype, similar to the stuff about the London Olympics getting us all busy heptathling. The BBC, obviously, went along with the hype, realising that it had a desperately unlikely hit on its hands, and has played it marvellously: last year\u2019s final pulled in a record audience of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/08/the-great-british-bake-off-final-nadiya-jamir-hussain-gbbo\">more than 13 million viewers</a>. I just wonder whether, somewhere along the line, the avowed British love of, and ease with, baking has been lost.</p> <p>The seventh series, which kicked off last week, began with the making of a drizzle cake. I had thought the only cake I could ever make was a drizzle cake: a fairly simple and decent lemon drizzle cake. More fool me. Everyone got it wrong: they either caked wrongly or drizzled wrongly.

People wept. Weren\u2019t you tempted to mumble: \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, darling\u2026\u201d? They cut themselves, and burned themselves, in obeisance to a new national treasure. To be fair, it was the first episode; they\u2019d just met each other and the cameras. Much will settle.</p> <p>Early highlights: Selasi, who went through convoluted hoops to avoid admitting he worked in banking \u2013 not a popular demographic \u2013 confected wizardry. Mel and Sue for having avoided, presumably with fists stuffed in their mouths, any temptation to make jokes about swallowing. There was a contestant who loved swallows, had got married or engaged or something to a background of swallows, wore a dress festooned with swallows, baked three actual swallows (I\u2019m joking) \u2013 and was unfeasibly ripe for the swallow joke. M and S didn\u2019t make it, saving themselves for next week\u2019s biscuit-piping competition and the chance to deliver the line \u201cDo you need a pair of warm hands on your bag?\u201d I am anticipating tonight\u2019s\u2019s revamp of <em>Are You Being Served?</em> with all the glee of Custer after the fourth arrow.</p> <p>Early lowlights: Paul Hollywood\u2019s comprehension of British dietary failures. He vouchsafed to the <em>Radio Times</em>, last week, regarding the Mediterranean diet, \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that people live longer in this country than they do in Greece or Cyprus.\u201d That may be true, but I\u2019ll simply say that his claim \u201cwould have sat easily on the side of the Brexit bus\u201d. Also: Val, whose very boast that she is a fan of Ed Sheeran marks her out as lacking in taste or tasty: she\u2019ll surely be next off, after the upbeat, doomed vicar, as if there\u2019s any other kind of vicar.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07r1f0h\"><strong>One of Us</strong></a><strong> </strong>should have been terrific.

If this had been a book I would heartily recommend it as unpickupable.</p> <p>The problem was that they\u2019d thwacked in too much plot. Fine, there were a couple of vaguely feuding Scottish families \u2013 and Juliet Stevenson, John Lynch and Joanna Vanderham were fine, but should have made so much more of all of this. Yet they battered their heads against the plot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no other single hour of drama this year in which I\u2019ve been to my knees, reduced to the floor, to watch</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Druggie loser kills newlyweds for no apparent reason.

Juliet has a quiet drink problem. The other wife has a quiet anger problem. One son has a stalker problem; one a porn problem. John Lynch has a biblical problem solvable only by Hank Williams. The lead detective on the case is dealing drugs.

Wilson is a dab hand at this kind of assignment, evading stock answers and getting at fragments of honest insight. He had Jones, composer and producer for everyone from Ray Charles through Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, talking about growing up in South Side Chicago gangs. Jones traced for Wilson the scar on his hand where a switchblade nailed him to a fence, and another from an ice pick on his head. He received both wounds when he was seven years old, giving a lie to any \u201cshow me the child\u201d notions.

The TV writer Tony Garnett, whose credits included <em>Cathy Come Home</em>, revived his arguments of the 1960s and 1970s with the moralising Mary Whitehouse, no less formidable from beyond the grave.

  "<p>With a ready grin, greying stubble and the frame of a man who samples his own produce, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/15/how-to-cook-perfect-steak\">Richard Turner</a> looks like someone you\u2019d be happy to buy a steak off. This is no accident. In fact, if you have eaten serious meat in London in the past 10 years, you probably have. Between his restaurants \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-hawksmoor-air-street\">Hawksmoor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/12/jay-rayner-restaurant-pitt-cue\">Pitt Cue Co</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/08/blacklock-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Blacklock</a> \u2013 his butcher\u2019s Turner &amp; George, and cookbooks, Turner has good claim to be the capital\u2019s most influential meat man.</p> <p>In a restaurant scene increasingly dominated by young people with vans and bold business plans, Turner, 49, has had a more old-fashioned, but still unusual, route to the top. The son of an Essex banker father and housewife mother \u2013 \u201can amazing cook, one of the first people in the country to get into avocados\u201d \u2013 Turner \u201cfound his way\u201d into a military boarding school in Surrey. At 17 he enlisted, and spent seven happy years in the Paras before leaving around the time of the first Gulf War.</p> <p>\u201cThe army was brilliant until people started shooting at me,\u201d he says, sitting in the August sunshine outside Pitt Cue\u2019s spacious new premises by Liverpool Street station. \u201cBut I had fun. You have to grow up somehow. For some people it\u2019s university; for me it was the army.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He joined the army boxing team because they were given steak for breakfast</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boarding school and the army taught him to love food, mainly in large quantities. He joined the army boxing team because they were given steak for breakfast, and has fond memories of the \u201cbig chunks of meat\u201d in British army curry. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a lot of tofu,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>After leaving the army in 1991 he worked in private security, providing close protection to wealthy clients. This opened his palate to a different sort of catering.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the clients were having lunch I would eat in the same restaurant at a different table,\u201d he says. \u201cWe went to Le Gavroche maybe once a week, and it was a revelation. I started badgering the Roux brothers to let me work in the kitchen. I wanted to know how to cook like that because it was almost miraculous \u2013 dishes like Le Caneton Gavroche, where you eat the whole duck over two courses, with vegetables and a horseradish sauce. They don\u2019t cook like that any more; proper old-fashioned French cooking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaca62140649d4186b9d945c2c7629ec26eaf788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaca62140649d4186b9d945c2c7629ec26eaf788/0_787_3260_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three of a kind: at Hawksmoor restaurant, with owners  Huw Gott (left) and Will Beckett.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three of a kind: at Hawksmoor restaurant, with owners Huw Gott (left) and Will Beckett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually he was let loose in the kitchen as a commis chef. Stints at Harveys and La Tante Claire with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/20/pierre-koffmann-chef-interview\">Pierre Koffmann</a> and Marco Pierre White in Wandsworth, south London, all followed. His training served him well. \u201cThey were hard, brutal, exhausting places \u2013 some of the toughest kitchens in the world. You got shouted at and more, and you\u2019d see big, strong boys crying. But it was normal after the army. The kitchens of the 90s were fairly similar to the Paras.\u201d</p> <p>His second epiphany came at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/14/foodanddrink.restaurants\">St John</a> in the late 90s. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is amazing!\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/17/st-john-restaurant-of-my-dreams-anthony-bourdain\">Fergus Henderson</a> is a genius: the way he cooks with bags of flavour and wallop, somewhere between an old English matron and a man\u2019s man.\u201d Turner moved away from fine dining and took over a pub in Islington, The Albion, where he added business acumen to his kitchen skills.</p> <p>\u201cThe profit margin is very small in restaurants and if you get it wrong you easily slip into losses. Labour and wastage are the big costs: you have to learn not to buy too much meat or keep it too long, not to burn things or overcook them. I learned how to make kitchens work properly.\u201d</p> <p>Around this time, after travelling back and forth to America and seeing the quality of steakhouses there, Turner had the idea for a new kind of restaurant in London. \u201cIt was a no-brainer: all we had at the time was Aberdeen Angus. But Hawksmoor beat me to it, so instead I joined them as head chef and changed the menu to what my vision was.\u201d His idea was simple: to take the best meat he could buy, \u201chappy animals, slow-grown, not killed too young, seasoned with salt and cooked over charcoal. It\u2019s not rocket science. Then the clever stuff can happen around the outside.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I arrived the spinach side dish was just spinach and leeks in a b\u00e9chamel sauce. I took out the leeks, chopped the spinach more finely, and infused the cream with anchovies, rosemary and cayenne. They all create umami, so the sauce had an intense flavour, and when you ate it with the steak you understood it.\u201d</p> <p>His other innovation was commercial: he bought a computer-controlled Thermodyne oven that allowed them to double the number of covers. Profits jumped and Hawksmoor expanded to new sites. Now they are preparing to take their concept \u2013 an American steakhouse with a British twist \u2013 back to the motherland, with a huge 450-seater restaurant in the World Trade Center. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly scary,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great steak in America for years. London has caught up.\u201d</p> <p>He will move to New York for six months to oversee the launch, but these days Hawksmoor is only part of his empire. After sampling their wares when they were at the van and plan stage, he helped Pitt Cue founders Jamie Berger and Tom Adams find their first site off Carnaby Street, as well as the new one. More are planned. In Soho, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/08/blacklock-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Blacklock</a> is still full of people scoffing piles of chops. Through Turner &amp; George, he is the only UK supplier of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/raising-the-steaks-meet-the-elderly-spanish-cows-destined-for-dinner-plates\">Galician beef</a>, the unusually aged cows that have become the boeuf du jour in acclaimed restaurants like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/20/kitty-fishers-london-w1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Kitty Fisher\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/02/lurra-london-w1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Lurra</a>. He also supplies some of the meat to Hawksmoor and Pitt Cue.</p> <p>More immediately he has the fourth UK iteration of Meatopia, the meat-based festival started in the US by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/06/josh-ozersky-award-winning-food-writer-and-meat-fanatic-dies-aged-47\">Josh Ozersky</a> and brought over by Turner, initially as a PR boost for the butcher\u2019s. Chefs from around the world assemble to prepare one meaty dish each for visitors to test, all washed down with gallons of booze to the sound of live bands. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite weekend of the year,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Despite all the meaty love, and finding himself at the right end of a new concern with sourcing and ethics, Turner knows the tide could turn. \u201cVegetables are going to come around,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all eat too much meat. If we had to pay the real price, rather than supermarket prices, we\u2019d eat less and enjoy it more. We are omnivores but 70% of our diet should be vegetables and it isn\u2019t. The plant-based diet, with small amounts of meat, is going to come round soon. But I have a vegetable restaurant planned out in my head. I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d \u2022</p> <p><em>Richard Turner is co-founder of Meatopia UK, 2-4 September 2016 </em><a href=\"http://www.meatopia.co.uk/\"><em>(meatopia.co.uk)</em></a></p>",

Why should we figure out anything for ourselves, when everything is so easy to look up?<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a good question, one I confront in my book <em>Head in the Cloud</em>. I ran surveys of public knowledge in Britain and the US, on topics ranging from pop culture to quantum physics. In many regards the public is ill-informed. More than 50% of those under 30 can\u2019t name the largest ocean on Earth, the palace built by Louis XIV, or the first artificial satellite; don\u2019t know who invented the telegraph, radio or phonograph or which Roman emperor was said to have fiddled while Rome burned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The cloud is making us meta-ignorant: unaware of what we don\u2019t know</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Does knowledge matter any more? There\u2019s a decent case that it doesn\u2019t. In the 1950s economist Anthony Downs coined the concept of rational ignorance. In many situations, Downs observed, learning isn\u2019t worth the bother. Most of us don\u2019t learn car repair or medicine or accounting. Instead, we consult professionals when such expertise is needed \u2013 and that\u2019s perfectly reasonable.</p> <p>Today, we\u2019re outsourcing memory and knowledge to the internet. This is often a good thing, but it comes with a drawback. The cloud is making us meta-ignorant: unaware of what we don\u2019t know.</p> <p>Each day we make hundreds of small decisions and judgments: what to eat, buy, or do; what to think about the latest film, trend and politician. Rarely are these assessments important enough to justify looking up facts. We make snap judgments in a state of rational ignorance, based on facts already in our heads.</p> <p>I found that there are correlations between general knowledge and behaviour, political views and even socially responsible choices. One dilemma I posed was: would you throw your pet off a cliff for \u00a31 million?</p> <p>About 7% of the British public said yes. But the percentage was double that among those who scored poorly on a quiz of general knowledge. The less informed are either greedier or less kind to animals.</p> <p>In the same survey, those who didn\u2019t know which document King John signed in 1215 were far more likely to say that people should be able to smoke in pubs. Those who can\u2019t name their MP tend to say it\u2019s OK for a business to post fake online reviews under a false name. Those who believe that early humans coexisted with dinosaurs are more likely to refuse to vaccinate their children for measles, mumps, and rubella.</p> <p>These findings challenge the easy assumption that you can always look up the facts you need. Anti-vaccine parents do look up articles on the internet. It appears they are unable to distinguish valid medical advice from pseudoscientific nonsense drawing on paranoia, urban legends and conspiracy theorising.</p> <p>Hence the survey\u2019s finding: people who can\u2019t answer an easy question about dinosaurs have a poor grounding in science and are ill-prepared to form good opinions about medical controversies, even with the internet to assist them. Unfortunately a \u201cgeneral background\u201d in science or anything else isn\u2019t something you can look up on a lunch break. It\u2019s acquired through lifelong learning.</p> <p>Knowledge is not wisdom, but it is a prerequisite for wisdom \u2013 and that\u2019s one thing the digital revolution hasn\u2019t changed.</p> <p><em>William Poundstone is the author of </em>Head in the Cloud: The Power of Knowledge in the Age of Google, pu<em>blished by Oneworld (\u00a312.99, or \u00a310.65 from </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/head-in-the-cloud.html\"><em>bookshop.theguardian.com</em></a><em>)</em></p>",
  "<p>The BBC Reith Lectures in 1967 were given by Edmund Leach, a Cambridge social anthropologist. \u201cMen have become like gods,\u201d Leach began. \u201cIsn\u2019t it about time that we understood our divinity? Science offers us total mastery over our environment and over our destiny, yet instead of rejoicing we feel deeply afraid.\u201d</p> <p>That was nearly half a century ago, and yet Leach\u2019s opening lines could easily apply to today. He was speaking before the internet had been built and long before the human genome had been decoded, and so his claim about men becoming \u201clike gods\u201d seems relatively modest compared with the capabilities that molecular biology and computing have subsequently bestowed upon us. Our science-based culture is the most powerful in history, and it is ceaselessly researching, exploring, developing and growing. But in recent times it seems to have also become plagued with existential angst as the implications of human ingenuity begin to be (dimly) glimpsed.</p> <p>The title that Leach chose for his Reith Lecture \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h3xy8\" title=\"\"><em> A Runaway World</em></a> \u2013 captures our zeitgeist too. At any rate, we are also increasingly fretful about a world that seems to be running out of control, largely (but not solely) because of information technology and what the life sciences are making possible. But we seek consolation in the thought that \u201cit was always thus\u201d: people felt alarmed about steam in George Eliot\u2019s time and got worked up about electricity, the telegraph and the telephone as they arrived on the scene. The reassuring implication is that we weathered those technological storms, and so we will weather this one too. Humankind will muddle through.</p> <p>But in the last five years or so even that cautious, pragmatic optimism has begun to erode. There are several reasons for this loss of confidence. One is the sheer vertiginous pace of technological change. Another is that the new forces at loose in our society \u2013 particularly information technology and the life sciences \u2013 are potentially more far-reaching in their implications than steam or electricity ever were. And, thirdly, we have begun to see startling advances in these fields that have forced us to recalibrate our expectations.</p> <p>A classic example is the field of artificial intelligence (AI), defined as the quest to enable machines to do things that would require intelligence if performed by a human. For as long as most of us can remember, AI in that sense was always 20 years away from the date of prediction. Maybe it still is. But in the last few years we have seen that the combination of machine learning, powerful algorithms, vast processing power and so-called \u201cBig Data\u201d can enable machines to do very impressive things \u2013 real-time language translation, for example, or driving cars safely through complex urban environments \u2013 that seemed implausible even a decade ago.</p> <p>And this, in turn, has led to a renewal of excited speculation about the possibility \u2013 and the existential risks \u2013 of the \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d that would be caused by inventing a machine that was capable of recursive self-improvement. This possibility was first raised in 1965 by the British cryptographer IJ Good, who famously wrote: \u201cThe first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.\u201d Fifty years later, we find contemporary thinkers like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/12/nick-bostrom-artificial-intelligence-machine\" title=\"\">Nick Bostrom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30296999\" title=\"\">Murray Shanahan</a> taking the idea seriously.</p> <p>There\u2019s a sense, therefore, that we are approaching another \u201cend of history\u201d moment \u2013 but with a difference. In his famous 1989 article, the political scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/21/bring-back-ideology-fukuyama-end-history-25-years-on\" title=\"\">Francis Fukuyama</a> argued that the collapse of the Soviet empire meant the end of the great ideological battle between east and west and the \u201cuniversalisation of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government\u201d. This was a bold, but not implausible, claim at the time. What Fukuyama could not have known is that a new challenge to liberal democracy would eventually materialise, and that its primary roots would lie not in ideology but in bioscience and information technology.</p> <p>For that, in a nutshell, is the central argument of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yuval-noah-harari\" title=\"\">Yuval Noah Harari</a>\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/24/homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari-review\" title=\"\"><em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em></a>. In a way, it\u2019s a logical extension of his previous book, <em>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</em>, which chronicled the entire span of human history, from the evolution of Homo sapiens up to the political and technological revolutions of the 21st century, and deservedly became a world bestseller.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities. Those left behind face extinction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most writers on the implications of new technology focus too much on the technology and too little on society\u2019s role in shaping it. That\u2019s partly because those who are interested in these things are (like the engineers who create the stuff) determinists: they believe that technology drives history. And, at heart, Harari is a determinist too. \u201cIn the early 21st century,\u201d he writes in a striking passage, \u201cthe train of progress is again pulling out of the station \u2013 and this will probably be the last train ever to leave the station called <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Those who miss this train will never get a second chance. In order to get a seat on it, you need to understand 21st century technology, and in particular the powers of biotechnology and computer algorithms.\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201c These powers are far more potent than steam and the telegraph, and they will not be used mainly for the production of food, textiles, vehicles and weapons. The main products of the 21st century will be bodies, brains and minds, and the gap between those who know how to engineer bodies and brains and those who do not will be wider than the gap between Dickens\u2019s Britain and the Madhi\u2019s Sudan. Indeed, it will be bigger than the gap between Sapiens and Neanderthals. In the 21st century, those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities of creation and destruction, while those left behind will face extinction.\u201d</p> <p>This looks like determinism on steroids. What saves it from ridicule is that Harari sets the scientific and technological story within an historically informed analysis of how liberal democracy evolved. And he provides a plausible account of how the defining features of the liberal democratic order might indeed be upended by the astonishing knowledge and tools that we have produced in the last half-century. So while one might, in the end, disagree with his conclusions, one can at least see how he reached them.</p> <p>In a way, it\u2019s a story about the evolution and nature of modernity. For most of human history, Harari argues, humans believed in a cosmic order. Their world was ruled by omnipotent gods who exercised their power in capricious and incomprehensible ways. The best one could do was to try to placate these terrifying powers and obey (and pay taxes to) the priesthoods who claimed to be the anointed intermediaries between mere humans and gods. It may have been a dog\u2019s life but at least you knew where you stood, and in that sense belief in a transcendental order gave meaning to human lives.</p> <p>But then came science. Harari argues that the history of modernity is best told as a struggle between science and religion. In theory, both were interested in truth \u2013 but in different kinds of truth. Religion was primarily interested in order, whereas science, as it evolved, was primarily interested in power \u2013 the power that comes from understanding why and how things happen, and enables us to cure diseases, fight wars and produce food, among other things.</p> <p>In the end, in some parts of the world at least, science triumphed: belief in a transcendental order was relegated to the sidelines \u2013 or even to the dustbin of history. As science progressed, we did indeed start to acquire powers that in pre-modern times were supposed to be possessed only by gods (Edmund Leach\u2019s point). But if God was dead, as Nietzsche famously said, where would humans find meaning? \u201cThe modern world,\u201d writes Harari, \u201cpromised us unprecedented power \u2013 and the promise has been kept. Now what about the price? In exchange for power, the modern deal expects us to give up on meaning. How did humans handle this chilling demand? ... How did morality, beauty and even compassion survive in a world of gods, of heaven or hell?\u201d</p> <p>The answer, he argues, was in a new kind of religion: humanism \u2013 a belief system that \u201csanctifies the life, happiness and power of <em>Homo sapiens</em>\u201d. So the deal that defined modern society was a covenant between humanism and science in which the latter provided the means for achieving the ends specified by the former.</p> <p>And our looming existential crisis, as Harari sees it, comes from the fact that this covenant is destined to fall apart in this century. For one of the inescapable implications of bioscience and information technology (he argues) is that they will undermine and ultimately destroy the foundations on which humanism is built. And since liberal democracy is constructed on the worship of humanist goals (\u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d by citizens who are \u201ccreated equal\u201d, as the American founders put it), then our new powers are going to tear liberal democracy apart.</p> <p>How come? Well, modern society is organised round a combination of individualism, human rights, democracy and the free market. And each of these foundations is being eaten away by 21st-century science and technology. The life sciences are undermining the individualism so celebrated by the humanist tradition with research suggesting that \u201cthe free individual is just a fictional tale concocted by an assembly of biochemical algorithms\u201d. Similarly with the idea that we have free will. People may have freedom to choose between alternatives but the range of possibilities is determined elsewhere. And that range is increasingly determined by external algorithms as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/google-microsoft-pact-antitrust-surveillance-capitalism\" title=\"\">surveillance capitalism</a>\u201d practised by Google, Amazon and co becomes ubiquitous \u2013 to the point where internet companies will eventually know what your desires are before you do. And so on.</p> <p>Here Harari ventures into the kind of dystopian territory that Aldous Huxley would recognise. He sees three broad directions.</p> <p>1. Humans will lose their economic and military usefulness, and the economic system will stop attaching much value to them.</p> <p>2. The system will still find value in humans collectively but not in unique individuals.</p> <p>3. The system <em>will</em>, however, find value in some unique individuals, \u201cbut these will be a new race of upgraded superhumans rather than the mass of the population\u201d. By \u201csystem\u201d, he means the new kind of society that will evolve as bioscience and information technology progress at their current breakneck pace. As before, this society will be based on a deal between religion and science but this time humanism will be displaced by what Harari calls \u201cdataism\u201d \u2013 a belief that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any entity or phenomenon is determined by its contribution to data processing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We require machines that are super-intelligent: intelligence is necessary; consciousness is an optional extra</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Personally, I\u2019m not convinced by his dataism idea: the technocratic ideology underpinning our current obsession with \u201cBig Data\u201d will eventually collapse under the weight of its own absurdity. But in two other areas, Harari is exceedingly perceptive. The first is that our confident belief that we cannot be superseded by machines \u2013 because we have consciousness and they cannot have it \u2013 may be naive. Not because machine consciousness will be possible but because for Harari\u2019s dystopia to arrive, consciousness is not required. We require machines that are super-intelligent: intelligence is necessary; consciousness is an optional extra which in most cases would simply be a nuisance. And it\u2019s therefore not a showstopper for AI development.</p> <p>The second is that I\u2019m sure that his reading of the potential of bioscience is accurate. Even the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21704791-science-getting-grips-ways-slow-ageing-rejoice-long-side-effects-can-be\" title=\"\"><em>Economist</em> magazine recently ran a cover story</a> entitled: \u201cCheating death: the science that can extend your lifespan.\u201d But the exciting new possibilities offered by genetic technology will be expensive and available only to elites. So the long century in which medicine had a \u201clevelling up\u201d effect on human populations, bringing good healthcare within the reach of most people, has come to an end. Even today, rich people live longer and healthier lives. In a couple of decades, that gap will widen into a chasm.</p> <p><em>Homo Deus</em> is a remarkable book, full of insights and thoughtful reinterpretations of what we thought we knew about ourselves and our history. In some cases it seems (to me) to be naive about the potential of information technology. But what\u2019s really valuable about it is the way it grounds speculation about sci-tech in the context of how liberal democracy evolved.</p> <p>One measure of Harari\u2019s achievement is that one has to look a long way back \u2013 to 1934, in fact, the year when Lewis Mumford\u2019s <em>Technics and Civilization</em> was published \u2013 for a book with comparable ambition and scope. Not bad going for a young historian.</p>",
  "<p>The map of competitive states is expanding this year as Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers dipped to surprising lows in historically red states such as Georgia and Arizona. The last time either state voted Democratic was two decades ago.</p> <p>But even as the small club of battleground states grows this year, fewer than 10 states will likely determine the outcome of this year\u2019s race. </p> <p>Relying on the same handful of states to decide the outcome of presidential elections is a fairly recent phenomenon.

Mondale won only his home state of Minnesota.<br></p> <p>Such blowout elections may seem incredible today, but Reagan\u2019s win was less exceptional at the time. Just 12 years earlier, in 1972, Richard Nixon also swept 49 out of 50 states against George McGovern to become president. And in 1964, Lyndon B Johnson won 44 states to Barry Goldwater\u2019s six.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s in stark contrast to today\u2019s political landscape.<br></p> <p>Despite campaign troubles and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">low favorability ratings</a>, Trump will almost certainly win at least 20 states, if not 25 \u2013 half the US \u2013 on election night. In a different decade, a candidate plagued by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment\">controversial statements</a>, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/hillary-clinton-fundraising-report-donald-trump-us-election\">historically underfunded campaign</a>, and who many party elites have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/14/who-supports-donald-trump-the-new-republican-center-of-gravity\">publicly denounced</a> might have been tanking in more states.</p> <p>The term \u201cswing states\u201d is well known today, but the same few states determining several consecutive presidential elections is a recent occurrence.</p> <p>The phrase \u201cswing state\u201d wasn\u2019t mentioned in books until the 1950s, according to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">Google Ngram Viewer,</a> a service that shows how often phrases have been used in texts over time. But between 2000 and 2008, usage of the term more than tripled. During that period, Ohio, Florida, Virginia and a handful of others coalesced into the group we now think of as swing states.<br></p> <p>Since 2000, 40 states have voted for the same party\u2019s candidate in all four presidential elections. By contrast, in the four elections between 1984 and 1996, states \u201cswung\u201d more often: only 17 states voted for the same party\u2019s candidate in the four consecutive elections during that period.<br></p> <p>Increasing political polarization is a big factor in the swing state phenomenon. The roots of current polarization stretch back to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/08/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-our-polarized-politics/\">about the 1970s</a>; since then, the parties have become not only more ideologically sorted but also more ideologically divergent, and their members more hostile toward the opposing party.</p> <p>Liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats used to make up a much larger share of both the US Congress and the broader population. Even a decade ago, conservative Democratic representatives in Congress voted alongside Republicans almost as often as they voted alongside Democrats. Now, conservative Democrats in the House and Senate have been unseated by Republicans, and liberal Republicans have lost their seats to Democrats.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s also increasingly rare for members of either party to break party lines when voting, both for ideological reasons and as strategic moves in an increasingly intense competition for party control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/flipped-polarization-slider/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing US legislators becoming more polarized.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/flipped-polarization-slider/\">Graphic showing US legislators becoming more polarized.</a> </figure>  <p>Voters\u2019 ideas are also becoming more homogenous and more in sync with their chosen party\u2019s platform.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.chrismullinexmp.com\" title=\"\">Chris Mullin</a> was a fellow traveller of Jeremy Corbyn in the 1980s, back in the day when the two of them were helping Tony Benn in his ultimately unsuccessful bid to capture the commanding heights of the Labour party. He left parliament in 2010 and is about to publish a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01I9Z3IPQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" title=\"\">memoir</a> which, as readers of his excellent diaries will anticipate, is wryly thoughtful. Towards the conclusion, he reflects on the prolonged torture that his party is putting itself through and writes that elevating his old Bennite comrade to the leadership was \u201calways going to be a high risk strategy\u201d. He goes on to reveal: \u201cMuch as I respect Jeremy, I did not vote for him on the grounds that in a parliamentary democracy it is folly to elect a leader who enjoys the confidence of less than 10% of his parliamentary colleagues. And so it has proved. It has been an interesting experiment, but always destined to end badly.\u201d</p> <p>More pungent descriptions than \u201cinteresting experiment\u201d are available. There are also more lurid predictions of how it will end than \u201cbadly\u201d. What no one can say with any confidence is when that will happen. It certainly looks highly improbable that Labour will get any relief from its agonies when the result of the leadership contest is announced next month. If anything, Labour\u2019s pains are going to be compounded by an outcome which seems very likely to leave things exactly as they are, only worse.</p> <p>Leadership battles do not have to be bad news for a political party. Even bitterly divisive contests can have a benefit if they allow the ventilation and thrashing out of differences as a step towards resolving them. There has been plenty of poison flowing through Labour during its long summer of unlove, but no sense that those toxins have been drained. Quite the reverse. The divisions have become more entrenched.</p> <p>The threat that the Labour conference might have to be cancelled was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/labour-security-deal-to-rescue-party-conference-ocs-group\" title=\"\">lifted on Friday night</a> when the party finally found a security firm prepared to work with them. The main challenge for the guards will not so much be shielding the conference from the outside world as protecting the party\u2019s warring activists, officials and MPs from each other. We have got to an extraordinary situation when Labour suspends the party membership of the general secretary of an important trade union and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, then accuses his own party of conducting a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/25/john-mcdonnell-accuses-labour-committee-of-rigged-purge-of-members\" title=\"\">rigged purge</a>\u201d.</p> <p>As the ballot papers start to come in, the expectation among both his devotees and his enemies is that the incumbent will win. The bookies\u2019 odds imply that he has a better than 80% chance of still being leader when Labour meets in Liverpool at the end of September. Even the more optimistic of his internal opponents now think the best they can hope for is that his majority goes down, diminishing his mandate.</p> <p>The strategy of his challenger, Owen Smith, has not been to make it a contest about ideology. \u201cI am just as radical as Jeremy,\u201d has been his refrain.\u201d If Mr Smith were to win, it would be on a platform well to the left of Ed Miliband\u2019s losing manifesto at the last general election. Mr Smith has instead sought to make the contest about effectiveness and electability. When this strategy was conceived it seemed to have a logic to it: the way to beat Mr Corbyn was to peel away some of his support. That argued for a challenger who would align with a lot of the incumbent\u2019s positions. But the contest has revealed the flaws in that approach, as some of the Labour moderates who originally backed the strategy are now beginning to privately concede. It has meant a contest almost entirely devoid of the interplay of ideas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour MPs are not going to clap their hands to their foreheads and cry: 'We were wrong about Jeremy!'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you are a Corbynista, why would you not vote for the original rather than a copy who is being sold by MPs who clearly are not Corbynistas? As for effectiveness, many of St Jeremy\u2019s supporters simply will not accept that he is a poor leader, while others dismiss \u201ccompetence\u201d as a false construct of the mainstream media, \u201cRed Tories\u201d and other running dogs of the neoliberal establishment. Among the devotees, the cult of his personality has, if anything, been inflated over the past few weeks. \u201cThe contest is all about Corbyn,\u201d says one Smith-supporting MP with regret. \u201cIt is all about him. It doesn\u2019t matter what Owen says really. No one is listening.\u201d</p> <p>So it looks highly probable that the crimson king will keep his throne, and that could be construed as a considerable triumph. This is certainly how it is going to be interpreted by his followers, whose ardour at rallies and hustings suggests that their devotion to him is undimmed by his appalling poll ratings. Against a hostile media, the open opposition of the vast majority of his parliamentary party and diabolical corporate conspiracies to make him sit on the floor of train carriages, he will be back. Mr Corbyn and those who support him will be able to say that he has become the only person in the postwar history of his party to have been twice elected to the job.</p> <p>Yet that will simply leave Labour\u2019s fundamental structural split as vast and unmaskable as ever. The party will be back to where it was at the beginning of the summer with a leader who is openly opposed by the vast majority of his parliamentary colleagues. This contest started rolling when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/jeremy-corbyn-loses-labour-mps-confidence-vote\" title=\"\">172 of them declared that they had no confidence in him</a>. So then did every single living former leader of the party. During the contest, they have been joined by the mayor of London \u2013 the most powerful Labour politician in the land \u2013 and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/scottish-labour-leader-kezia-dugdale-backs-owen-smith-against-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">leader of the party in Scotland</a>. It is the more remarkable that Sadiq Khan and Kezia Dugdale should both urge his removal as leader even when it was apparent that this is unlikely to happen. None of that can be unsaid or undone. Labour MPs are not going to clap their hands to their foreheads and cry: \u201cWe were wrong about Jeremy!\u201d</p> <p>As soon as parliament resumes, with it will return the question of how Labour can function as the opposition when a critical mass of its MPs have resigned from or refused to serve on the frontbench. Mr Corbyn has said that he will offer a \u201chand of friendship\u201d to his parliamentary party but many think that it will be aimed at their throats. \u201cThey will threaten the PLP with unity,\u201d predicts one former member of the shadow cabinet. \u201cThey will send McDonnell out to say, \u2018The members have spoken, now fall into line or we\u2019ll come and get you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Some of the resignees may agree to return to the frontbench for fear of retribution in their constituencies or on the more noble grounds that the country needs Labour to do its constitutional duty of providing a parliamentary opposition. But whether they choose to return to the frontbench or continue to be refuseniks, all of the 172 are still going to struggle to answer the question \u201cIs Jeremy Corbyn fit to be prime minister?\u201d when they have declared him unfit to be leader of the opposition.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The likelier prospect is that the two sides settle in for more months of bitterly attritional warfare</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the part of the Corbynistas, the more zealously vengeful talk of using deselection to launch a purge of Labour MPs. The more sober people in the Corbyn camp are wary of the multiple risks of pursuing that course, at least in the near future. There would be nothing to stop a deselected MP from carrying on in parliament in the meantime. Nor could an MP be prevented from resigning his or her seat to trigger a byelection which they could then fight under the name of \u201cTrue Labour\u201d or \u201cSave Labour\u201d or something similar.</p> <p>The superficially clean answer to the party\u2019s predicament is for Corbyn Labour and anti-Corbyn Labour to concede that their differences are irreconcilable and go their separate ways. Two models of how that could happen are most commonly discussed. In the slightly less apocalyptic scenario, the parliamentary party announces that it is declaring its independence from Mr Corbyn and then elects its own chief to replace him as leader of the opposition. The fuller-blown version of divorce would see Labour MPs separating themselves into a wholly distinct party and inviting those of the membership who agree with them to follow. These ideas have some takers and promoters among commentators and there are Labour MPs who don\u2019t rule it out, but they are very much a minority at the moment. \u201cThe people urging a split just do not understand the Labour party,\u201d says one former shadow cabinet member who entirely shares the despair about the current state of the party but fears an MP-led breakaway would simply make things even darker and invite annihilation at the ballot box if Theresa May goes for a general election next spring.</p> <p>So the likelier prospect is that the two sides settle in for more months of bitterly attritional warfare. The interim goal of the Corbyn team will be to try to exploit his re-election by pushing for rule changes that will strengthen their position and aiming to wrest control of the party machinery. Iain McNicol, the party\u2019s general secretary, is quite clearly in their cross-hairs. Labour MPs will try to learn from this contest as they plan for another challenge next year. Of an end to the \u201cinteresting experiment\u201d, there is no sight.</p>",
