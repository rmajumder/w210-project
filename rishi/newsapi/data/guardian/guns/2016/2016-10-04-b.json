  "<p>The Ministry of Defence has withdrawn its attempt to strike out a whistleblowing claim brought by a doctor who raised concerns about alleged discrepancies in the dispensing of strong painkillers at an army base where he was working. </p> <p>Dr Stephen Frost, a civilian doctor who had worked with the military for 20 years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/30/whistleblower-doctor-sacked-text-mod-tribunal-stephen-frost-david-kelly\">was dismissed three years ago by text and email while on a family holiday, and since then has sought to find out why and for redress from the MoD. </a></p> <p>At a hearing in Manchester, the MoD confirmed it had withdrawn its application to have Frost\u2019s claims struck out. <a href=\"http://www.oldsquare.co.uk/our-people/profile/john-hendy-qc\">John Hendy QC</a>, for Frost, told the tribunal the parties had reached a \u201cdegree of agreement\u201d. The hearing was adjourned so that discussions about a possible settlement could take place.</p> <p>No details of why the MoD had changed its approach were given.</p> <p>Frost, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/jan/27/guardianletters4\">was involved in the campaign for a full inquest on the weapons inspector David Kelly</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/16/david-kelly-death-10-years-on\">died at the height of the Iraq dossier scandal</a>, described the last three years as a \u201cKafkaesque nightmare\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThis has been a very difficult and sometimes lonely battle. The consequences for me and my family have been catastrophic.</p> <p>\u201cI have lost over three years of my life and I have been told that it may take some time for me to recover. I have learned of the importance to us all of whistleblowers and of laws being in place to protect adequately those whistleblowers.\u201d </p> <p>Frost\u2019s solicitor, <a href=\"http://www.mwsolicitors.co.uk/by-seniority/fas-partners/35-helen-clifford\">Helen Clifford of MW Solicitors</a>, said: \u201cWhistleblowers are modern-day heroes and the law urgently needs to be changed to afford them adequate protection. Dr Frost raised genuine concerns about potential criminality following a very serious dispensing error on a military camp and he believes that he was dismissed for doing so.\u201d</p> <p>In July 2013, Frost was engaged to work as a civilian doctor at Weeton barracks near Blackpool through a private healthcare recruitment group. His contract was due to last until December that year.</p> <p>According to Frost, on 6 August 2013 he became aware of a dispensing discrepancy involving morphine sulphate tablets that occurred almost two weeks before he started working at the camp\u2019s medical centre. He said tablets six times the strength of those that should have been dispensed were involved.</p> <p>Frost expressed his concerns to members of the practice team and later to an internal investigating team, and asked for the police to be informed.</p> <p>On 6 September 2013, while he was on holiday, Frost\u2019s posting was terminated by text and email and he was told not to return to work on the following Monday. He said that no explanation was given.</p> <p>In January 2015, the MoD tried to have Frost\u2019s case struck out, arguing he could not officially be regarded as a \u201cworker\u201d for the ministry despite the fact that he had worked almost exclusively for the armed services for almost 20 years through agencies.</p> <p>The MoD also argued he could not be treated as a whistleblower because he had not originally stipulated this was a basis of his case \u2013 despite the word \u201cwhistleblower\u201d appearing on his initial claim form. At that point, a judge said a tribunal could take place. </p> <p>Frost has long questioned the official explanation for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidkelly\">the death of David Kelly</a>, who was found dead in woods near his Oxfordshire home in 2003, shortly after being exposed as the source of a BBC claim that Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government had \u201csexed up\u201d a dossier that helped make the case for war in Iraq. </p> <p>The Hutton report concluded that Kelly, a member of a UN team sent to Iraq to search for weapons of mass destruction, had committed suicide. Frost is among doctors who continue to question that conclusion.</p> <p>The MoD declined to comment. A spokesperson said: \u201cIt would not be appropriate to comment on the details of an ongoing employment tribunal.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For Wayne Rooney, this is what it has come to. After 116 caps, a record 53 goals, some exhilarating highs and excruciating lows, the England captain sat in a room of football writers at St&#xa0;George\u2019s Park and faced a question he has never been asked in all his years in the game. Had he reached the end? And, realistically, would he ever get back to his best, approaching his 31st birthday, when more and more people were suspecting he was finished?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/04/wayne-rooney-sam-allardyce-england-left-me-battered\">Wayne Rooney says Sam Allardyce left him \u2018battered\u2019 with carte blanche remark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He did not flinch. Maybe he suspected it was coming and he fronted it up, head-on, just as he did all the other questions about his alleged burnout, his removal from the Manchester United team and the awkwardness of him wanting to be a full-time midfielder when his manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, was almost scornful of the idea.</p> <p>Rooney did take great care to say he would abide by whatever Mourinho \u2013 and for that matter, England\u2019s caretaker manager Gareth Southgate \u2013 decided but nobody could have misunderstood the message from a man who is, in effect, trying to save his career.</p> <p>\u201cI have heard a lot of people talking about transition \u2013 well, let me do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that is what\u2019s going to happen, let me do that. I feel I am not being given a chance, if that is the way I want to go in my career, to expand it. I am not being given that chance to go from there to there [attack to midfield]. It is all right talking about your career, saying you can extend it by doing this and that, but you need to be given the chance to do it.\u201d</p> <p>To avoid any confusion, this was not a direct challenge to Mourinho and he did also say \u201cat the minute I\u2019m happy playing where my managers want me to play\u201d. Equally, there were other times when he sounded impatient \u2013 understandably, perhaps, when he was facing questions for the first time in his career that he might be shot.</p> <p>No, Rooney insisted, he would not accept his decline was irreversible. A player who began his career at 16 refused to subscribe to the theory the sport had worn him down \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve heard it, I don\u2019t agree with it\u201d \u2013 and there was the suspicion of a man straying dangerously close to being in denial when he was asked if he was worried about his general form. \u201cNo, to be honest,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cI felt I started the season OK. I had a bad game, certainly a very bad second half, against Watford. So I am not worried, no.</p> <p>\u201cI know I can do better but if I don\u2019t play very well there is a massive overhype and it comes from everywhere. Listen, I am hard on myself. I am honest with myself. I speak to a couple of people after every game, my dad and my agent, and they are honest with me. If I haven\u2019t played well, they tell me. But I know that anyway.</p> <p>\u201cDuring a game I can feel if I\u2019m not playing well. I knew in the Watford game I didn\u2019t play well. I didn\u2019t deserve to play the next game, I understand that, and the team have done well since then, so I have to bide my time. But I will fight to get back in. I\u2019m a fighter. I want to get back in the team. This is where I am at. But I am sure the people who know me know I will come back.\u201d</p> <p>Against this kind of backdrop, it is easy to understand why Rooney feels so aggrieved about Sam Allardyce\u2019s comments that the England captain can play \u201cwherever he wants\u201d and the subsequent fallout. Allardyce, according to Rooney, \u201cknew he made a mistake\u201d but the damage had been done. \u201cI suffered from that. I got battered.\u201d It had created the impression, one of the journalists in his company told him, that he was involved in tactics and even possibly team selection. \u201cExactly,\u201d Rooney said, \u201cwhich couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d Danny Rose, in keeping with several players, had just told a separate group of journalists he had contacted Allardyce to send him his best wishes. Had Rooney? \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/gareth-southgate-retaining-wayne-rooney-as-england-captain-was-simple-choice\">Gareth Southgate: retaining Wayne Rooney as England captain was simple choice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Allardyce did, however, play Rooney in the position he craves, whereas Mourinho made it clear, in his first press conference as United manager, that he would not get that privilege under him. Mourinho, to recap, could hardly have been more emphatic. \u201cWith me, he will never be a No6, playing 50 metres from goal. Yes, his passing is amazing but mine is also amazing without pressure. He will be a number nine, a number ten, or a number nine and a half, but never a number six or a number eight.\u201d</p> <p>Rooney evidently thinks that needs a rethink. \u201cI feel I can control and dictate games from there,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious I\u2019m not as quick as I was. You can always have a football brain, though, and I\u2019ve got that. A lot is made of where I play, and how I play, and it gets a bit frustrating at times. There will come a time, if I\u2019m not playing, when I might have to be a bit more selfish in terms of where I want to play and making that clear.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was sitting here at 25 or 26 and we were talking about playing centre midfield or a deeper midfield role I wouldn\u2019t want to play there, of course, but now I\u2019m at a stage where that might be better suited to me. Again, it is down to the manager. I am not going to go in and say: \u2018I have to play there\u2019. I play where the manager asks me. We spoke at the start of the season and, as he said to you guys, he feels my best position is further forward, so that\u2019s where I will play.\u201d</p> <p>Could he not tell Mourinho now if he thinks that is a mistake? \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time for me to be doing that. I\u2019ve always put the team as more important. The team are doing well at the minute, so I have to bide my time.\u201d</p> <p>As for Mourinho\u2019s comments that there was \u201ca Wayne before the Slovakia game and a Wayne after the Slovakia game,\u201d with the player possibly affected by criticism of his role, Rooney wrinkled his nose at that one. \u201cI have had criticism a lot of times. You\u2019ll have to ask him about that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/02/sam-allardyce-manager-england-farce\">Sam Allardyce was the manager England deserved, week of farce suggests | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rooney was sitting here as England\u2019s highest scorer, nine caps short of equalling Peter Shilton\u2019s record of 125, and four goals short of overtaking Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s goals record for United. Yet there is still the suspicion, in the unforgiving age of social media, that he is not fully appreciated. \u201cBy some people, yes; by others, no,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s football, isn\u2019t it? You divide opinions. Listen, I am not a player who wants people to say how good he is. That\u2019s not me. As long as people around me, and my manager, are happy, I\u2019m&#xa0;happy.</p> <p>\u201cI love football and, in football, you have highs and lows. I still wake up every day and love what I am doing and I cannot imagine my life without football. I dread the day it ends. Any player who has played since he was a kid will say that. You speak to other players who have done that [stopped playing] and they say it is a weird feeling. You enjoy it while you can.\u201d</p> <p>Another player might retire from international football and devote himself to extending his club career. For Rooney, that has never been a serious consideration. \u201cI love meeting up with England. Whether I am on the pitch or not, I feel I can help the players. If the manager turned around on Saturday [when England play Malta] and I was on the bench, of course I would want to play, but I am not going to say \u2019I am not playing for England again\u2019. I would still turn up and try to get back in the team. I think I can benefit the younger players around the squad.\u201d</p> <p>Rooney does not sound like a man who thinks he has reached the end. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy it [not playing] but it is part of football. Does it gee you up? Of course it does. It\u2019s like going to an audition when you get turned down \u2013 you want to prove yourself to people.</p> <p>\u201cI have no problem being left out. It\u2019s a manager\u2019s job and I understand that, but I will keep working until I get the chance to come back.\u201d</p>",

This shift has enabled restaurant chains such as McDonald\u2019s, Chick-fil-A, Subway and Wendy\u2019s to commit to sourcing chicken that was either raised without any antibiotics or without any medically-important antibiotics, a term for describing drugs developed for human use. At the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), we estimate that roughly 40% of the US chicken industry has either eliminated or pledged to eliminate the routine use of medically-important antibiotics.</p> <p>Meat producers routinely feed animals antibiotics to make them grow faster, and to help them survive the crowded, stressful, unsanitary living conditions that are typically found in factory farms. A whopping<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/UserFeeReports/FinancialReports/ADUFA/UCM447958.pdf\"> 70% of all medically-important antibiotics</a> are sold in the US for use in livestock. The excessive and often unnecessary use of these so-called miracle drugs leads to bacteria developing resistance and weakens the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating humans.</p> <p>According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2 million Americans contract<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/\"> antibiotic-resistant infections</a> every year, and 23,000 die as a result. And these are conservative estimates: as Reuters recently reported, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019re significantly undercounting the<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-uncounted-surveillance/\"> human toll of superbug infections</a>.</p> <p>Chicken raised without the routine use of antibiotics is now one of the fastest growing segments of the poultry industry. Producers in this category include some of the biggest players in the industry: Perdue Farms, Tyson Foods and Foster Farms. After about a decade of trial and error in some cases, chicken companies are showing that raising animals without reliance on antibiotics is not only possible, it\u2019s profitable.</p> <p>While the majority of the chicken industry still needs to reduce antibiotic use, chicken suppliers are ahead of other meat producers. Their headlong leap into antibiotic stewardship is a result of two main factors. First is the industry\u2019s production model \u2013 chickens have shorter lifecycles and likely fewer chances to contract infections than other types of livestock. Second, the vast majority of chickens produced in the US are raised by companies that own all or a significant part of their supply chains, making it possible for them to dictate specific farming practices across their entire operations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/05/in-n-out-antibiotic-free-meat-pledge-fda\">In-N-Out Burger beefs up its promise of antibiotic-free meat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The popularity of chicken with many Americans as a healthier protein alternative may also be a factor. The largest chicken companies and their top buyers \u2013 restaurant chains such as McDonald\u2019s, Chick-fil-A, Subway, Wendy\u2019s and Taco Bell \u2013 are responding to consumer priorities about how antibiotics are used in the chicken they grow or sell. Consumers are holding meat companies accountable for cleaning up their drug use practices. A case in point: in August, NRDC and our allies <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/lena-brook/over-350k-urge-kfc-change-chicken-antibiotics-policy\">delivered petitions signed by more than 350,000 people to KFC</a> headquarters, calling on the iconic chicken restaurant chain to establish a strong antibiotics policy for its chicken supply.</p> <p>We need companies that produce pork, beef and turkey to rise to the occasion. Though slower in coming, there are signs of progress. Perdue now also raises about half its turkeys without antibiotics. This year, Tyson announced the launch of a new line of<a href=\"http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/02/25/tyson-antibiotic-free-pork\"> pork raised without antibiotics</a>, and<a href=\"http://www.cargill.com/news/releases/2016/NA31934263.jsp\"> Cargill announced</a> it was reducing its use of medically-important antibiotics in its beef production by 20%, a move that impacts approximately 1.2 million cattle.</p> <p>The government now needs to catch up with industry leaders by swiftly enacting mandatory restrictions on the routine use of antibiotics across the livestock industry. Despite having known for decades that the misuse of antibiotics in livestock threatens our health, the<a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jonathan-kaplan/nrdc-urges-fda-curb-livestock-antibiotic-overuse-again\"> Food and Drug Administration has almost entirely failed to act to stop it</a>.

But we cannot simply lay this problem at the feet of consumers. The government and food industry must do more. If most meat producers continue to use antibiotics as a substitute for good animal husbandry, then it\u2019s our children who may end up paying most dearly.</p> <p><em>Sasha Stashwick is a senior advocate of the food and agriculture program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Yahoo\u2019s reported secret collaboration with the US government also brings up several points that warrant further investigation. (\u201cYahoo is a law abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States,\u201d the company said in a statement to Reuters.)</p> <p>Much of the discussion about Edward Snowden\u2019s 2013 revelations has focused on the NSA\u2019s mass phone spying program that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/07/politics/nsa-telephone-metadata-illegal-court/\">the courts later ruled illegal</a>. But many people forget that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/us/broader-sifting-of-data-abroad-is-seen-by-nsa.html\">New York Times also reported, in 2013</a>, based on previously published Snowden documents, that the NSA had been scanning countless emails going into and out of the US for years, looking for certain keywords.</p> <p>This Yahoo story seems to be an escalation of this type of \u201cabout\u201d or \u201cupstream\u201d surveillance, which was once done by the NSA by secretly wiretapping internet cables <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/us/politics/att-helped-nsa-spy-on-an-array-of-internet-traffic.html\">owned by AT&amp;T and others</a>. Since many email companies have started encrypting their emails in transit since that story came out, the NSA probably can\u2019t do that type of surveillance unilaterally (or <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/nsa/hepting\">with the help of AT&amp;T</a>) anymore. The US government now seems to be moving to force internet companies to do this type of mass surveillance for them, on the companies\u2019 servers, where the data remains accessible. </p> <p>Civil liberties groups <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/33044/unprecedented-unlawful-nsas-upstream-surveillance/\">have been calling this type of</a> \u201cabout\u201d mass surveillance \u2013 in which the government scans all emails for certain keywords \u2013 illegal and unconstitutional for years. But so far, no court has ruled definitively one way or another (mainly because the US has been hiding behind official secrecy to prevent it). </p> <p>Now the question reporters should be asking is: if Yahoo received this secret order, what about the other tech giants? Did Google, Facebook and Microsoft  receive similar demands to wiretap their own systems for searching all emails at the behest of the US government or others? </p> <p>The Yahoo story, if borne out, would be the quintessential example of how government-mandated backdoors are dangerous for everyone\u2019s security, and why end-to-end encryption needs to be standard on all our communications platforms. </p> <p>Incredibly, Yahoo apparently built this backdoor into its email system without even telling its then security chief, Alex Stamos. \u201cThe sources said the program was discovered by Yahoo\u2019s security team in May 2015, within weeks of its installation,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-nsa-exclusive-idUSKCN1241YT\">Menn reported</a>. \u201cThe security team initially thought hackers had broken in.\u201d</p> <p>Stamos was reportedly furious and resigned in protest. \u201cDue to a programming flaw [in the software], he told [Yahoo executives] hackers could have accessed the stored emails,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-nsa-exclusive-idUSKCN1241YT\">Menn explained</a>. Security experts have been highlighting for years how backdoors not only give access to the \u201cgood guys\u201d but also could let other criminals or foreign governments into our communications systems. </p> <p>This is exactly the type of mass surveillance that end-to-end encryption would prevent. Currently, Yahoo emails are encrypted as they travel from one server to another, but can be read by Yahoo at the company\u2019s discretion. </p> <p>Stamos is now the director of security at Facebook, which coincidentally just <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/facebook-completely-encrypted-messenger-update-now/\">rolled out end-to-end encryption</a> on its popular Facebook Messenger app, which is used by more than 900 million people around the world. Unfortunately, much like Google\u2019s just launched (<a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/09/22/why-edward-snowden-is-saying-dont-use-googles-allo.html\">and much maligned</a>) new chat program Allo, Facebook Messenger\u2019s end-to-end encryption is opt-in, and so only a tiny fraction of users are likely to turn it on. </p> <p>This type of encryption should be standard and turned on by default in all messaging apps (and ideally email as well). Users should consider switching to apps where default end-to-end encryption is already turned on, including WhatsApp, Signal and Apple\u2019s iMessage. </p> <p>Finally, Yahoo\u2019s possible betrayal of its users is another example of why whistleblowers and leaks to the press are so important. The US government considers this type of surveillance \u201clegal\u201d even though it shocks the conscience of many ordinary Americans and dozens of civil liberties groups have been attempting to have courts rule it illegal for years. The only reason we know about it is because brave people came forward at the risk of their freedom to tell us. For that, we owe them a great debt. </p>",
  "<p>Washington and Moscow are engaged in a new standoff over Syria, and this time it has gone beyond words. The US has broken off talks and recalled its negotiators from Geneva. Russia, meanwhile, has suspended an agreement on the destruction of plutonium, setting conditions \u2013 including an end to Ukraine-related sanctions \u2013 for the resumption of the accord.</p> <p>Cue doom-mongers, mostly on the western side, warning that US-Russia relations are every bit as bad as they were during the darkest days of the cold war, with corresponding dangers for everyone else. Some, indeed, would argue that the risks are greater still, because the restraint forced by the prospect of \u201cmutual assured destruction\u201d and any formal framework for contact are both missing.</p> <p>Of course, the return to hostilities in and around Aleppo is a catastrophe for those on the ground and a fresh setback for those trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad. Where US-Russian relations are concerned, however, there are reasons to take a less apocalyptic view, and the same applies to the wider consequences.</p> <p>If the fiercest measure the US has taken is to break off somewhat fitful talks on Syria, and the strongest response Russia has chosen to offer is the suspension of a single arms agreement that Moscow anyway accuses Washington of breaking, that says a lot in itself. It could reflect how little the two countries currently have to talk about, in which case a break makes little difference. Or, more likely, it shows their concern to spare other areas of cooperation, such as wider arms control or the space station. Indeed, the US said talks about avoiding bilateral clashes in Syria would continue, while the conditions Moscow has set for resuming the plutonium deal suggest it is open to bargaining even as it stamps its foot.</p> <p>To an extent both sides are playing to their domestic galleries. This is an often neglected aspect of many a diplomatic spat, but it is especially true of this one. The US is in the grip of a highly unusual presidential campaign that has barely a month to run. While Barack Obama is not running, the charges of foreign policy weakness levelled against him, not just by Donald Trump and the Republicans but by some on his own side, are a factor in the campaign. It is important for Obama and his legacy, but still more so for Hillary Clinton\u2019s prospects, that the Democratic administration does not appear spineless \u2013 especially not before its old Russian foe.</p> <p>President Putin, for his part, has to attend to national morale in the face of the first fall in living standards for many Russians since the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is judged to be such as risk that there is talk he could bring forward the presidential election to next year. Neither he nor his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, can afford to play too nice with the Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/aleppo-syria-war-humanitarian-crisis-un\">'Syria is bleeding': Aleppo facing war's worst humanitarian crisis, UN says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is another reason why the health or otherwise of US-Russia relations should not be judged exclusively by their talks about Syria: to believe that the two countries are capable of ending the conflict in Syria is to believe that the cold war continues, and that every war is a proxy superpower war.</p> <p>We are living in different times, and Syria is not a cold war-era conflict. It is wider than that, with many different proxies involved, and loyalties shifting to and fro; it is also narrower, in the sense that the only settlement that will stick must be acceptable to the people who live there. Outside powers cannot force a peace so long as the parties to the dispute believe they still have ground to gain.</p> <p>If the conflict has demonstrated anything, it is that neither erstwhile superpower has the clout to control its clients on the ground. The latest ceasefire failed not only because the US mistakenly bombed a contingent of Syrian troops, and not only because an aid convoy was destroyed, but because the sponsors of the deal \u2013 the US and Russia \u2013 were unable to control what happened next.</p> <p>The US clearly cannot marshal its so-called moderates, and may not even be quite sure who they are. Something similar applies to Putin and Assad. From the wording of the US state department\u2019s announcement on breaking off talks, it would appear that even Washington is starting to accept that Putin cannot just switch Assad on or off.</p> <p>There may well still be diehards \u2013 in the Pentagon, perhaps, and the Russian ministry of defence \u2014 who believe the world is still theirs to fight over and divide up between them. The failed ceasefire illustrated something different: that US-Russian sponsorship is no longer enough.</p> <p>For any ceasefire in Syria to endure, let alone any settlement, either many more parties will have to be involved as sponsors \u2013 including Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey \u2013 or the Syrians themselves will have to call a halt. That may not happen until there is a victor.</p> <p>This is not a palatable thought. But it may be the case that the US-Russian peace efforts in Syria have to be seen as a laudable effort, but one that was ultimately doomed to fail. Not because the US and Russia could not agree, but because an old-style superpower deal is no longer enough. This may not be good news for Syria, but it does mean it need not be the sole gauge of US-Russian relations. There are hints Moscow and Washington understand this, even as they trade recriminations.</p>",

Most likely playing as a No10, the former Premier League midfielder will attract plenty of attention, creating space for serial goal-poacher Jamie Maclaren and pacey duo Brandon Borrello and Dimi Petratos.</p> <p>The best thing about this Roar side is not necessarily what\u2019s new, but what they already have. Luke De Vere has been ravaged by injury since his return to the club, but will feel like a new signing. Tommy Oar has had a full pre-season and will surely show more than his cameo late campaign, and on top of this there\u2019s the ever-green Thomas Broich. Remember him?</p> <p><strong>Area of concern</strong></p> <p>You might remember last season\u2019s remarkable 6-3 loss to Perth, and the perhaps even more amazing 5-4 finals loss to Western Sydney. Aloisi\u2019s side is built for entertainment, no doubt, but even with the efforts of Jade North they can look incredibly exposed at the back. De Vere can\u2019t afford more injuries; Michael Theo needs to win his place back from Jamie Young (and keep it) and with scant cover at fullback, Corey Brown and Jack Hingert are crucial to Roar\u2019s chances.</p> <p><strong>Who to watch</strong></p> <p>Holman is the obvious name, but much of Roar\u2019s success might depend upon winger Tommy Oar. With a full pre-season under his belt the fringe Socceroo could torment defences with his pace and delivery \u2013 the potential combination of him and Maclaren is mouthwatering. Should he falter two-time Johnny Warren medallist Broich will be waiting in the wings. No pressure, kid. <strong>(RP)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"660d7ca6498d7d5aae09d3a815eb1769f3f81cd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/660d7ca6498d7d5aae09d3a815eb1769f3f81cd6/0_201_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Keogh celebrates his record goalscoring run last season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cKeogh.

Perth Glory</h2> <p>A massive recruitment drive has Perth poised for great things this year.</p> <p>Glory\u2019s 2015-2016 season fizzled out in the finals after finishing fifth on the table. They were eliminated in the first round and Tony Sage has gone back to his chequebook once more to make the WA club real title challengers. Perth have gone local, bringing home a gaggle of players who were born and bred near the Swan river. Rostyn Griffiths comes back from Holland, youngster Brandon Wilson from Burnley and former Socceroo Rhys Williams from Middlesbrough. If Williams can stay fit, watch out. Combine then with the likes of foreign trio Diego Castro, Andy Keogh and Nebojsa Marinkovic, along with Perth locals Adam Taggart, Josh Risdon and Shane Lowry and they\u2019ll be far from easybeats.</p> <p><strong>Ins and Outs</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> Joel Chianese (Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia), Nick Feely, Rostyn Griffiths (Roda JC, Netherlands), Joseph Mills (Oldham Athletic, UK), Liam Reddy (Wanderers), Milan Smiljanic (Maccabi Netanya, Israel), Jordan Thurtell, Rhys Williams (Charlton Athletic, UK), Brandon Wilson (Burnley FC, UK)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> Ante Covic (released), Diogo Ferreira (released), Hagi Gligor (released), Gyorgy Sandor (released), Krisztian Vadocz (released), Ruben Zadkovich (retired), Jerrad Tyson (Wanderers)</p> <p><strong>How they\u2019re better</strong></p> <p>Perth\u2019s depth has improved greatly and Kenny Lowe has two players for every position. Liam Reddy replaces the experienced Ante Covic, and he has options up front with Keogh, Chianese, Taggart, Chris Harold and young strikers Jamal Reiners and Kosta Petratos. The midfield is bursting with talent and quality, from European playmakers Marinkovic, newcomer Milan Smiljanic and Castro, to the more robust Griffiths, Wilson and Richard Garcia. In defence there are two Williams brothers to choose from, along with veteran Dino Djulbic, Socceroo Risdon, Lowry and new English fullback Mills.</p> <p><strong>Area of concern</strong><br></p> <p>Keeping all his players happy and content, with appropriate game-time could be a problem for Lowe. Unless injuries strike the coach has at least 15 players who would command starting spots at other clubs. If Lowe does get the mix right though it could be quite explosive.</p> <p><strong>Who to watch</strong></p> <p>Irishman Andy Keogh has a point to prove after his departure amid salary cap rumblings, and subsequent mid-season return to the A-League from Thailand last year. His first stint in Perth was dynamic, with goals coming from all angles, and if he can reproduce those performances than the Glory will be hard to stop. <strong>(JD)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46c8b97db7078ed3d6366f5a72c3f400f946aa9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46c8b97db7078ed3d6366f5a72c3f400f946aa9d/0_31_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adelaide United celebrate winning the championship\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Only one team (Brisbane Roar) has successfully defended an A-League championship; how will Adelaide United fare?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kalisz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5. Adelaide United</strong></h2> <p>Reigning champions Adelaide United will be hard pressed to repeat their double-winning success. Everything fell into place for the Reds last season, vaulting them from bottom after eight rounds to top after 27, culminating in a dominant finals series.</p> <p>A by-product of A-League glory is the inevitable talent drain that follows, as international scouts and wealthy rivals cherry pick from the champions. Guillermo Amor will have to refashion his attacking strategy this campaign without the pace of Craig Goodwin and Bruce Kamau, or the hold-up play of Bruce Djite. Establishing a new blend will take time, especially considering how recently key recruits Sergi Guardiola and James Holland joined the squad.</p> <p><strong>Ins and Outs</strong></p> <p><strong>Ins: </strong>Ben Garuccio (City), Sergi Guardiola (Granada, Spain - loan), James Holland (MSV Duisburg, Germany), Henrique (Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia), Ryan Kitto (Newcastle), Jesse Makarounas (Victory), Marc Marino (City), Nikola Mileusnic (Adelaide City) </p> <p><strong>Outs:</strong> Eli Babalj (AZ Alkmaar, Netherlands), Bruce Djite (Suwon, Korea), Mate Dugandzic (released), Craig Goodwin (Sparta Rotterdam, Netherlands), Bruce Kamau (City), Stefan Mauk (NEC, Netherlands), Pablo Sanchez (released), Ruon Tongyik (City)</p> <p> <strong>Areas of strength</strong></p> <p>Eugene Galekovic was arguably the league\u2019s most influential player last season. His return from injury after six rounds shored up a leaky defence and his leadership steered the Reds through squeaky-bum time. He will again marshal a solid and experienced unit that will be difficult to penetrate.</p> <p> <strong>Areas of concern</strong></p> <p>On paper at least, Adelaide\u2019s attacking options look considerably less threatening than last year. In particular, the loss of so much pace removes a significant weapon at Amor\u2019s disposal, especially away from home when looking to counterattack. United failed to score in their three preseason matches against A-League opposition, and they were outscored by Redlands United in the FFA Cup round of 32.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a worry over the depth of United\u2019s squad, especially considering the fitness of a number of key players. Jordan Elsey has already been ruled out for the season, Michael Marrone has not yet returned from a long-term injury while Marcelo Carrusca, Sergio Cirio and Iacopo La Rocca have all spent time on the treatment table in preseason.</p> <p><strong>Who to watch</strong></p> <p>The midfield triumvirate of Isaias, Holland and Carrusca should complement each other perfectly. Their mix of skills and nous provide Amor flexibility to route possession either from the base of midfield or through his roaming No10. <strong>(JH)</strong> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e582ea6562d845af924bab3215e63720f75dcfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e582ea6562d845af924bab3215e63720f75dcfed/0_87_5047_3028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star import, Bobo, in action for Sydney FC during the FFA Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star import, Bobo, in action for Sydney FC during the FFA Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Sydney FC</h2> <p>A Graham Arnold coached A-League side has never failed to make the finals but that\u2019s precisely what his spluttering Sydney FC chargers achieved last campaign. An injury-ravaged season for captain Alex Brosque didn\u2019t help, but underperforming marquees meant the Sky Blues were at times pedestrian in the front third.</p> <p>They scored a whopping 27 fewer goals than Melbourne City last season \u2013 exactly one per match \u2013 and will need Brazilian Bobo and the returning Bernie Ibini to give them far greater potency in attack.</p> <p><strong>Ins and Outs</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> Bobo (Gremio, Brazil), Josh Brilliante (Fiorentina, Italy), Bernie Ibini (Club Bruge, Belgium - loan), Danny Vukovic (Victory), Alex Wilkinson (City), Michael Zullo (City)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> Ali Abbas (Pohang Steelers, Korea), Zac Anderson (released), Jacques Faty (Mariners), Andrew Hoole (Newcastle), Chris Naumoff (retired), Ivan Necevski (Mariners), Shane Smeltz (Kedah FA, Malaysia), Robert Stambolziev (released), Mickael Tavares (Mariners), Riley Woodcock (released)</p> <p><strong>How they\u2019re better</strong></p> <p>With Matthew Jurman the only solid performer in an otherwise raggedy looking backline last season Arnold has gone for tried and tested, raiding City for Socceroos defensive duo Wilkinson and Zullo. Vukovic is another quality pick up and should put pressure on gloveman Vedran Janjetovic whose promising development plateaued last campaign.</p> <p>It\u2019s one thing scoring in the FFA Cup against state league opposition but if Bobo can maintain his impressive early form, he\u2019s not just one star signing, he\u2019s two. They were prolific together at Besiktas and if Bobo can re-inspire the occasionally forlorn Holosko, \u2018Holo-Bobo\u2019 could just become the cute double act Sydney fans have been craving.</p> <p><strong>Area of concern</strong></p> <p>Graham Arnold has responded by recruiting real quality, but with the spotlight that comes with Sydney FC it\u2019s a very different season whether Bobo goes Marc Janko, or Kruno Lovrek. Ninkovic and Holosko cannot afford underwhelming seasons (again).</p> <p>Arnold utilised the siege mentality brilliantly at the smaller Central Coast Mariners, but Sydney need to recapture the pride and swagger of being a \u201cbig club\u201d. The pizazz of a Dwight Yorke, Alessandro Del Piero, or even Terry Antonis is sewn into the fabric of this club \u2013 relying on workhorses like Matt Simon won\u2019t captivate this notoriously fickle supporter base (or the media).</p> <p><strong>Who to watch</strong></p> <p>Josh Brilliante, one of the best young players to emerge out of the A-League in recent years. A harrowing start to life in Serie A has seen the talented Socceroo\u2019s career stagnate. If he can anchor the Sydney midfield, screen the defence and control tempo, distributing well to the Brosque\u2019s and Ninkovic\u2019s of the team, the front third could click, and click dangerously. <strong>(RP)</strong></p> <p><em>Predicted placings were determined by aggregating the verdicts of a nine-strong panel of Guardian Australia football writers comprising </em><em>Richard Parkin, John Davidson, Jonathan Howcroft, Paul Connolly, Pete Smith, Mike Ticher, Richard Gadsby, Sam Perry and Kieran Pender.

  "<p>The journey of Brexit Britain towards Little England continues apace, as the government parades its intention to secure impunity from accountability for the great majority of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/03/plan-uk-military-opt-out-european-convention-human-rights\">human rights abuses committed by our forces in future conflict</a>. Universal values are universal, but they need not apply here.</p> <p>As they plot this path, the Conservatives will be pleased to know the extent to which what they seek accords with what has gone before. The Colonial Office bitterly opposed the European convention on human rights in the late 1940s, because its officials knew exactly what the British forces got up to on their civilising missions abroad. Indeed, the first case in the 1950s \u2013 involving Greece, Cyprus and the United Kingdom \u2013 was sufficiently embarrassing to allow those Colonial Office officials to lament \u201cwe told you so\u201d.</p> <p>Later, in 1978, the army\u2019s quasi-imperial frolics in Northern Ireland led to findings of a violation of the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment before the Strasbourg court itself. More recently the Strasbourg court has pushed the reach of the European convention into all of those foreign places where a European signatory state is to be found, throwing its military muscle about. Hence the successful litigation arising out of the brutal killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/03/investigate-brutal-death-baha-mousa\">Baha Mousa in Basra</a>, and much else besides, not least the inquiries into egregious human rights breaches by the British forces that have so exercised the rightwing press and its political cheerleaders. Lawyers have been excoriated by the government for taking these cases, but surely the large-scale damages paid out by the Ministry of Defence prove that their successful clients did not invent the facts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/03/plan-uk-military-opt-out-european-convention-human-rights\">Plan for UK military to opt out of European convention on human rights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government plan seems to be for the authorities to announce \u2013 as they head off to a faraway place to liberate it perhaps, or secure human rights for its people \u2013 that the emergency means most bits of the European convention will temporarily cease to apply to the forces doing this work; enabling them \u201cto take risks\u201d without fear of litigation. There is vague talk of international humanitarian law picking up the slack and catching the true rotten apples in the barrel of good guys currently being persecuted by pinko-lawyers. This is very unlikely. One of the chief virtues of this old code of laws from the authorities\u2019 point of view has been its effective unenforceability.</p> <p>So will the government\u2019s plan work? I have grave doubts, for such derogations (as they are called) cannot just be declared willy-nilly; their legitimacy is itself a proper subject of scrutiny by Strasbourg. These European judges may be very reluctant before they overrule a British judgment about what constitutes a war or a public emergency threatening the life of their nation. But the Strasbourg judges also have the job of ensuring that anything that is done under the derogation is only what is strictly needed to deal with the emergency the government says it is facing. So to give one example, detaining large numbers of suspects without trial might be thought to go beyond what is needed, to be in legal terms disproportionate to the problem at which it is aimed. That would rule it out so far as the European judges were concerned.</p> <p>There is a further problem that seems lost in all the approving hysteria. Many of the cases \u2013 never referred to by ministers \u2013 involve actions taken not by a malicious Johnny Foreigner but by British soldiers and/or their families, alleging breaches by army commanders of their own human rights: treating them so brutally on the training ground that they die; or sending troops out in inadequately defended vehicles. It is unlikely that such actions as these will ever be seen by Strasbourg to be essential. And of course quite apart from Strasbourg, there is also now our own supreme court: a compulsory defender of human rights so long as the much-maligned Human Rights Act continues to function.</p> <p>We focus on the action of courts abroad, but remember that after 11 September courts in this country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/17/terrorism.humanrights3\">disallowed the indefinite detention</a> of \u201csuspected international terrorists\u201d. Who is to say that the same might not happen again despite the derogation. The government could just ignore such rulings, or even go so far as to retaliate by pushing to repeal the Human Rights Act itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/23/british-soldiers-should-not-be-above-law\">Nobody, not even British soldiers, should be above the law | Nick Cohen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is what the Conservatives have long-wanted, and here might be a suitable opportunity finally to achieve this goal. But that too would be messy, for that would involve the whole matter being sent up to Strasbourg. We would then need to withdraw from the convention in order to make Britain\u2019s impunity work properly.</p> <p>Think also of the domestic implications. On its own, the repeal of the act may well inflame a Scotland shorn without its consent of this further bulwark against English nationalism. And what of Northern Ireland? Human rights law was once deemed an essential part of the structures that delivered peace in the province.</p> <p>Theresa May is excited about the route to Little England. So are her adherents.

  "<p>Investors\u2019 first instinct, as they woke on Friday 24 June to news that the UK had voted for Brexit, was to sell shares. This didn\u2019t feel remotely odd at the time. Sterling was plunging, the prime minister would resign by mid-morning and shares, in theory, are meant to be the asset you don\u2019t want to own when there is a whiff of panic in the air.</p> <p>Tough luck if you sold your FTSE 100 tracker fund on Monday 27 June, the day the index closed a shade below 6000 points. You\u2019ve just missed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/uk-stock-markets-soar-as-sterling-slumps-to-record-low\">a remarkable 1100-point run to 7074</a>. The vote for Brexit created the best buying opportunity for years.</p> <p>Or, rather, it was a golden chance if you are a sterling investor. As everybody knows by now, the single biggest factor fuelling the Footsie\u2019s surge has been the weakness of the pound. Most of the gain reflects currency adjustments. The profits generated overseas by big UK-listed multinationals \u2013 BP, Shell, the crew of miners, the cigarette merchants, the pharmaceutical giants, HSBC, Unilever, etcetera \u2013 are worth more when converted back into sterling, the currency in which their shares are quoted. Calculated in terms of US dollars, the FTSE 100 has gone roughly sideways since the referendum.</p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline illustrates the point. If you bought on the day of the referendum at \u00a314.29, you\u2019re up 18.7% with the share price now at \u00a316.96. But if you are a US investor and bought the dollar-denominated American Depositary Receipts (each one represents two ordinary shares), it\u2019s as if nothing has happened. The price of a Glaxo ADR has ticked up from $42.56 on referendum day to $43.30 on Tuesday \u2013 a gain of about 2%. It all depends on where you\u2019re sitting.</p> <p>Thus the sight of the Footsie above 7000 is the secondary story. Sterling\u2019s slide to a 31-year low against the dollar is the main event, and the reason why chancellor Philip Hammond should stop saying, as he did again on Monday, that \u201cthe markets have calmed since the referendum vote.\u201d Shares have calmed but sterling hasn\u2019t. The currency still tends to slip on every indication from ministers that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d is on the cards. Those pundits suggesting the pound could fall to $1.20 against the dollar, versus Tuesday\u2019s $1.27, may be proved correct.</p> <p>Yet Hammond would be right to claim that even $1.20 would not represent a crisis. In trade-weighted terms, the pound currently sits at a six-and-a-half-year low, which feels roughly the right level. First, the vote for Brexit has plainly created all the uncertainties that caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/britain-fastest-growing-g7-economy-imf-international-monetary-fund-brexit-vote\">the IMF to cut its growth forecast for the UK next year to 1.1%</a>. Second, the UK also needs to get its current account deficit under control and a weaker currency offers the best hope on that front. An overshoot on the low side would not be the worst problem for the UK economy to have.</p> <p>That is true as long as a weaker pound doesn\u2019t cause eruptions elsewhere. But, as matters stand, there are no signs of distress in bond markets, or even worries that a weaker currency will deliver a nasty dose of inflation. There\u2019s still time, of course, and the risk rises the further the pound falls. But, right now, the UK can borrow for 10 years at a rate of 0.8%. That feels a very long way from crisis levels.</p> <h2>\u00a340m payday for Jeremy and chums </h2> <p>Currency winds have also played a role in the entertaining scrap for SVG Capital, the quoted firm that invests in private equity funds. To recap: US fund HarbourVest Partners made a \u00a31bn, or 650p-a-share, offer last month in what looked to be a smash-and-grab raid. HarbourVest declared its offer final, thereby ruling out improved terms, and invited quick acceptances.<br></p> <p>Not so fast, said SVG, which had another look at its assets (most of which are euro and dollar denominated) and came up with a value of 735p a share, rather than the 666p it had offered the last time it spoke. Everyone is allowed to believe their investments are improving in value but the trick in a bid situation is to find someone prepared to agree \u2013 and then to pay up.</p> <p>SVG has only half succeeded. Late in the day, it said on Tuesday that two other private equity investors, Pomona Capital and Pantheon Ventures, are willing to buy half the investment portfolio for \u00a3379m. That is still a discount to the book value for those assets, calculated at \u00a3401m, but, crucially, is a tighter discount than the one implied by the HarbourVest offer.</p> <p>HarbourVest can protest that it is willing to buy all the investments, rather than half, and that SVG\u2019s self-liquidation plan is riddled with uncertainties. Fair comment. But at least SVG\u2019s board has given its shareholders a choice: they can have 650p for a quick sale to an opportunist bidder or they can take their chances on seeing 700p-ish via an orderly, but still brisk, liquidation.</p> <p>Either outcome would represent a triumph for Jeremy Coller, whose Coller Capital outfit rescued SVG by injecting cash at 100p for a 20% stake in 2009. Coller Capital should make a sixfold-plus return from a punt taken in the depths of the financial crisis. And remember, in the fee-heavy private equity industry, the partners usually keep a fifth of the uplift for themselves. Call it a \u00a340m payday for Jeremy and chums for riding the recovery.</p>",
  "<p>Almost nine out of 10 NHS groups are failing cancer patients, with low rates of diagnosis and treatment, new ratings show. </p> <p>Data from NHS England reveals that most clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) across England are performing poorly when it comes to diagnosing patients quickly, ensuring they get prompt treatment and boosting one-year survival rates. <br></p> <p>In some areas, just one in three patients get an early diagnosis, which is half the figure for the best performing area. </p> <p>Almost half of the patients in one area do not get their first treatment in a timely manner, while in other areas thousands die early because of poor NHS care.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that so many CCGs in England have been identified as providing inadequate care to cancer patients, or requiring improvements in this area, is very concerning,\u201d said said Dr Fran Woodard, the executive director of policy and impact at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.macmillan.org.uk/\">Macmillan Cancer Support</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt highlights just how much the NHS is struggling to meet the challenge of delivering cancer services which meet all the critical needs of people with cancer.\u201d</p> <p>CCGs commission health services and control millions of pounds of NHS money, but the stark data shows that of 209 only seven were \u201ctop performing\u201d and 22 were \u201cperforming well\u201d \u2013 together accounting to just 14% of the total. </p> <p>Twenty-four were ranked as being in \u201cgreatest need for improvement\u201d, including NHS Blackburn with Darwen CCG, NHS Blackpool, NHS Bradford City, NHS Coastal West Sussex, NHS Doncaster, NHS East Staffordshire and NHS Leicester City. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A further 156 CCGs were ranked as in \u201cneed improvement\u201d. </p> <p>An NHS England spokesman said the care cancer patients receive from the NHS is \u201cnow the best it\u2019s ever been\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve set stretching goals to save thousands more lives by 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cMeasured against this ambition, it\u2019s not surprising that most local services need to make further improvements, but we\u2019re going to track progress transparently so everyone can see how we are improving care and outcomes for patients.\u201d </p> <p>The seven areas with the top ranking were Harrogate and Rural District; Leeds North; Solihull; South Devon and Torbay; Stockport; Vale of York and NHS Wiltshire. </p> <p>The worst performers on diagnosing cancer at an early stage were NHS Lincolnshire West CCG, which diagnoses just 33.3% of cancer patients at an early stage, followed by NHS Slough CCG (36.3%) and NHS Lincolnshire East CCG (36.5%). They compared unfavourably with the top-performing NHS West Suffolk CCG, where 61% of patients are diagnosed at an early stage. </p> <p>The worst performing CCG for one-year survival from cancer was NHS Newham CCG in London (where 63.9% of patients live for a year), followed by NHS Barking and Dagenham CCG (64.9%) and NHS Medway CCG (65.3%). </p> <p>The top-performing was NHS Harrow CCG, where 74.5% of cancer patients lived for a year after diagnosis. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in NHS Thurrock CCG area, just 54.8% of patients with an urgent GP referral had their first treatment for cancer within 62 days, while at the top end of the scale, 97.5% of those living under NHS Richmond CCG are treated within 62 days of urgent referral by their GP. </p> <p>This is the first time the cancer figures have been published, although ratings for dementia, learning disabilities and diabetes were published last month.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has the admirable intention of restoring confidence in government by paying careful attention to the discontents of the 52% who voted Brexit. She recognises that many who voted leave did so from a sense that Westminster had yielded control of important policies, most notably immigration, to Brussels. That is partly the consequence of setting a target for net migration that was unachievable. Mrs May spent six years trying to make it work against internal opposition from the Lib Dems, and sometimes from George Osborne\u2019s Treasury. It was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11329609/George-Osborne-sees-off-Theresa-Mays-controversial-plan-to-deport-foreign-graduates.html\" title=\"\">Mr Osborne who vetoed a manifesto pledge</a> to prevent international students staying on after they had finished their studies. But international students stayed in Mrs May\u2019s sights, one of the few points of traction in the government\u2019s efforts to bring net migration down below 100,000.</p> <p>Now her successor at the Home Office, Amber Rudd, <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/10/full-text-amber-rudds-conference-speech/\" title=\"\">in a speech that was startlingly hardline</a>, is planning a new attack on the numbers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live\" title=\"\">students coming to Britain to study</a>. Ms Rudd wants to impose different tests for applicants to different universities and colleges. The net effect is likely to be a cut in the numbers taking shorter courses or attending the post-1992 universities that offer more accessible degree subjects, and a blow to their viability, since international students account for 30% of university revenue. This is a bad policy. It imposes new bureaucratic burdens on all universities, and might seriously undermine newer ones that serve an important local role. It will be hard to enforce. Worse, it is based <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publications/destination-education\" title=\"\">on flaky and contested evidence</a> about how many students stay after they have completed their course of study: last year, just 11,100 people who previously held study visas <a href=\"http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/non-european-student-migration-to-the-uk/\" title=\"\">were granted extensions to remain in the UK</a> in a category other than study. But the government relies on the International Passenger Survey, which suggests as many as 100,000 international students might stay on. With such a dubious evidence base, it seems unlikely that these latest moves will dent the net migration figures \u2013 while further souring an atmosphere where anti-migrant attacks already appear legitimised by the Brexit campaign. A sceptical public will have yet more evidence that migration is a problem the politicians cannot solve.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s Home Office legacy is the Immigration Act 2016, a piece of legislation expressly intended to create \u201c<a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/blog/2016/05/23/what%E2%80%99s-next-hostile-environment-immigration-act-2016-and-queen%E2%80%99s-speech\" title=\"\">a hostile environment for illegal migration</a>\u201d. Ms Rudd is on to it, announcing that the measures criminalising landlords who let property to illegal migrants and introducing compulsory immigration status checks on all taxi drivers will be in force by the end of the year. She made one positive announcement: a new \u201ccontrolling migration\u201d fund, at \u00a3140m nearly three times bigger than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal last week. But along with supporting hard-pressed public services, the fund will be used to help councils stamp down on wrongly claimed housing benefit and rough sleeping.</p> <p>Of the great humanitarian crisis engulfing millions of refugees, or the slow progress on uniting unaccompanied children with their British-based families, Ms Rudd said not a word. And every time a minister announces a crackdown on illegal migration, they add to the impression of an ill-defined, uncontrolled threat. Ms Rudd was a banker. She should know the value of robust evidence and reliable statistics. That is the only basis for policy.</p>",

Or could ever work.</p> <p>Voters, they contend, can\u2019t possibly live up to these expectations. Most are too busy with jobs and families and troubles of their own. When we do have time off, not many of us choose to spend it sifting competing claims about the fiscal implications of quantitative easing. Even when we do, we don\u2019t behave as the theory suggests.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>2.8 million voters punished Al Gore for the floods and droughts of 2000 \u2013\u00a0ironic, given his position on climate change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our folk theory of democracy is grounded in an Enlightenment notion of rational choice. This proposes that we make political decisions by seeking information, weighing the evidence and using it to choose good policies, then attempting to elect a government that will champion those policies. In doing so, we compete with other rational voters, and seek to reach the unpersuaded through reasoned debate.</p> <p>In reality, the research summarised by Achen and Bartels suggests, most people possess almost no useful information about policies and their implications, have little desire to improve their state of knowledge, and have a deep aversion to political disagreement. We base our political decisions on who we are rather than what we think. In other words, we act politically \u2013 not as individual, rational beings but as members of social groups, expressing a social identity. We seek out the political parties that seem to correspond best to our culture, with little regard to whether their policies support our interests. We remain loyal to political parties long after they have ceased to serve us.</p> <p>Of course, shifts do happen, sometimes as a result of extreme circumstances, sometimes because another party positions itself as a better guardian of a particular cultural identity. But they seldom involve a rational assessment of policy.</p> <p>The idea that parties are guided by policy decisions made by voters also seems to be a myth; in reality, the parties make the policies and we fall into line. To minimise cognitive dissonance \u2013 the gulf between what we perceive and what we believe \u2013 we either adjust our views to those of our favoured party or avoid discovering what the party really stands for. This is how people end up voting against their interests.</p> <p>We are suckers for language. When surveys asked Americans whether the federal government was spending too little on \u201cassistance to the poor\u201d, 65% agreed. But only 25% agreed that it was spending too little on \u201cwelfare\u201d. In the approach to the 1991 Gulf war, nearly two-thirds of Americans said they were willing to \u201cuse military force\u201d; less than 30% were willing to \u201cgo to war\u201d.</p> <p>Even the less ambitious notion of democracy \u2013 that it\u2019s a means by which people punish or reward governments \u2013 turns out to be divorced from reality. We remember only the past few months of a government\u2019s performance (a bias known as \u201cduration neglect\u201d) and are hopeless at correctly attributing blame. A great white shark that killed five people in July 1916 caused a 10% swing against Woodrow Wilson in the beach communities of New Jersey.In 2000, according to analysis by the authors 2.8 million voters punished the Democrats for the floods and droughts that struck that year. Al Gore, they say, lost Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada, Florida, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Missouri as a result \u2013 which is ironic given his position on climate change.</p> <p>The obvious answer is better information and civic education. But this doesn\u2019t work either. Moderately informed Republicans were more inclined than Republicans with the least information to believe that Bill Clinton oversaw an increase in the budget deficit (it declined massively). Why? Because, unlike the worst informed, they knew he was a Democrat. The tiny number of people with a very high level of political information tend to use it not to challenge their own opinions but to rationalise them. Political knowledge, Achen and Bartels argue, \u201cenhances bias\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\">Neoliberalism \u2013 the ideology at the root of all our problems</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Direct democracy \u2013 referendums and citizens\u2019 initiatives \u2013 seems to produce even worse results.

  "<p>Ian Birrell, in an otherwise illuminating article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/tory-ukip-meeting-theresa-may-brexit-vote-immigration\" title=\"\">The delirium of these Tories: it\u2019s like a Ukip convention</a>, 4 October), says that in the forthcoming article 50 negotiations, to be triggered by Theresa May before the end of March, Britain \u201cwill have just two years to sort a trade deal with a bloc of 27 nations\u201d. In fact those negotiations are to be about the terms of UK withdrawal: only after the UK has withdrawn from the EU, probably some time in 2019, can negotiations on a substantive trade deal with the EU begin, and a trade agreement of that complexity is bound to take yet more years to conclude.</p> <p>If only Mrs May had left open the timing of the article 50 trigger, she could have had some leverage with the rest of the EU in seeking a prior understanding about a \u201cframework for [Britain\u2019s] future relationship with the Union\u201d which the withdrawal negotiations are required by article 50 to \u201ctake account of\u201d \u2013 an impossibility if even an outline framework of the future relationship has not yet been worked out. This would have enabled our government to insist that the withdrawal agreement to be negotiated under article 50 must include an interim trade agreement to cover the years after Brexit while a permanent trade agreement is being negotiated. It would also have provided an opportunity, once the \u201cframework\u201d for future relations was known, for the British people to say, before the trigger is pulled, whether the terms on offer after Brexit would be better for British interests than remaining in the EU on our existing terms.</p> <p>But by committing herself to pulling the trigger within a mere five months (including the Christmas holidays), the prime minister has thrown away her sole source of leverage, and with it the opportunity to get a better idea of what Brexit will actually involve before she burns our boats.

Not a good start.<br><strong>Brian Barder</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 When free movement of people is presented as a non-negotiable feature of the European Union, it is well to remember that such movement can in some circumstances be limited. When 10 new nations joined the EU, existing members were offered transitional controls. For a period they could limit the number of migrants from those newly acceding states. The UK declined this facility, though France, Germany and Italy all chose to exercise the right, which expired in 2011. The offer of transitional control demonstrates that free movement of people is not an inviolable principle. Elections are imminent in Germany and France. Anti-immigration challengers face Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande. It seems likely that in self-defensive mode the French and German governments will decide that some temporary dilution of free movement is justified by events. How pointless Brexit will then be seen to be.<br><strong>David Butler</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 You point out that under the Good Friday agreement all citizens in the north are entitled to an Irish and therefore an EU passport (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/ireland-to-seek-special-status-to-keep-open-border-with-uk-amid-hard-brexit-fears\" title=\"\">Northern Ireland could veto Brexit, Belfast high court told</a>, theguardian.com, 4 October). Under that agreement\u2019s principle of consent, any change to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland must be \u201csubject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland\u201d. As you also point out, 56% of Northern&#xa0;Irish voters backed remain. The British government has accepted that the right to self-determination applies in any decision on whether Northern Ireland should leave the UK and join a united Ireland. Arguably withdrawal from the EU will have greater immediate consequences for the people of the north than any decision on reunification.

Secondary legislation can take one of two forms, either requiring an affirmative resolution or passing automatically if a negative resolution is not moved and carried. There are, however, major problems. Secondary legislation cannot be amended, and all too often it is authorised by bills, like the housing and planning bill, with no opportunity for either house to see the outcome of any consultation that the government undertakes or any draft of possible regulations.</p> <p>It is extremely rare for the Lords to reject secondary legislation, though over child tax credits it did ask the Commons to think again, much to the annoyance of Cameron and Osborne. The Lords, in the exercise of its function of holding government to account, does frequently debate regret motions to highlight concerns, but there is widespread concern at the growth in the use of secondary legislation to implement contentious policies with a minimum of parliamentary scrutiny.<br><strong>Jeremy Beecham</strong><br><em>Labour, House of Lords</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

The rise of new and legitimate contenders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead Mike Zimmer\u2019s Vikings are one of only two 4-0 teams in the NFL after Monday night\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/04/minnesota-vikings-shut-down-new-york-giants-nfl\">comprehensive 24-10 win over the New York Giants</a> and, improbably, have the look of a legitimate Super Bowl contender. Before a ear-splittingly loud sellout crowd of 66,690 at their new $1.1bn downtown stadium, Minnesota backed up previous statement-making wins over the Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers with another exhibition of stout defense and workmanlike offense that augurs big things as the season moves forward.</p> <p>\u201cIn the NFL it\u2019s adapt or you get eaten up,\u201d said Zimmer, the 60-year-old head coach who spent 35 years as a college and pro assistant before the Vikings offered him his first top job in 2014. \u201cI think our offensive coaches have done a nice job adapting to the personnel that we have and trying to use everybody that we have.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m here, our expectations are never going to change. It doesn\u2019t matter who is playing. We expect them to perform. [General manager Rick Spielman] has done a great job of bringing in here a lot of depth, a lot of high-character guys. Really, I say it all the time because it\u2019s true about this football team. It\u2019s so important to have the right kind of guys in here. Guys that when it gets down to it, we fight.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing Minnesota nice about this defense, which has surrendered a scant 50 points through four games. They\u2019ve recorded 15 sacks, second in the league only to the Denver Broncos. And while none of those came Monday against the Giants, they applied enough pressure on Eli Manning, who was 2-of-8 for seven yards with an interception against the blitz, to prevent the quarterback from finding his receivers downfield. Behold Odell Beckham Jr, who was limited to a career-low 23 yards and whose frustrations boiled over with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the second quarter.</p> <p>New York\u2019s star wide receiver was held in check by a ravenous secondary marshaled by Pro Bowl safety Harrison Smith and corners Captain Munnerlyn and Terence Newman, an ageless marvel at 38. But the engine room of the defense is a talent-stacked front seven led by defensive tackle Linval Joseph, defensive end Everson Griffen and linebacker Anthony Barr.</p> <p>The Giants were finally able to beat the Vikings for a big play when Paul Perkins busted a catch and run for 67 yards early in the fourth quarter that cut Minnesota\u2019s lead to 17-10, but Vikings quarterback Sam Bradford responded by marching 76 yards down the field in eight plays.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a pretty big response for us,\u201d said Bradford, who passed for 262 yards and a touchdown. \u201cObviously our defense has played fantastic all year and I think it was time for us to respond and give them a little break and allow them to catch their breath. To score and go up two possessions, that was the biggest turning point of the game.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/philadelphia-eagles-trade-sam-bradford-minnesota-vikings\">trade for the former No1 overall draft pick</a> after Bridgewater dislocated his knee and tore his ACL on a non-contact play during the preseason was not without its critics, but early returns have been encouraging. The Vikings have the NFL\u2019s best turnover differential plus-10 and have not committed an offensive turnover this year, their lone giveaway coming on defense after forcing an Aaron Rodgers interception in week 2.</p> <p>Bradford\u2019s limitations are well documented, but he\u2019s also never enjoyed the luxury of a stout defense. Never in six previous NFL seasons has the former Heisman Trophy winner played behind a defense that finished the year ranked higher than 12th in the NFL in yards or points allowed per game. This year\u2019s Vikings ranked seventh and second respectively in those categories and it\u2019s greatly helped his assimilation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to learn a little bit more of the offense each time we step on the field,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cI think it\u2019s gone pretty well. There are still some things I can do better and there\u2019s things we can do better as an offense, but obviously being 4-0 right now, I don\u2019t think you ask for a lot more.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first got here I was having a tough time just calling the plays. They were a little bit wordy. Obviously, everything was new. They\u2019ve been awesome, code-wording things. Things that I\u2019ve done in the past and trying to incorporate those into the offense. Things that I feel comfortable with. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with [quarterbacks coach] Scott Turner. He\u2019s done a great job just helping me get comfortable in this system.\u201d</p> <p>Now Minnesota will have a short week of preparation for a home meeting with the Houston Texans before their bye week. And with preseason favorites Carolina and Arizona in early disarray, it seems the sky is the limit.</p> <p>\u201cI think this team likes to win,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI just think they like to win. I think they like to compete. I think they like to go out there and prove to everybody that they can be talked about with as good of teams as there are in the league. We still got a long way to go.\u201d</p>",

Yes, Google sold some consumer electronics with a few of its own phones and Glass. Yes, Google has a delivery business for local goods. (And, it will definitely be interesting to watch if Google looks to use Amazon as a distribution channel). But Google also doesn\u2019t have near the track record for mobile instant messaging that companies like Facebook and WeChat have. Platforms like Allo become essential when they have hundreds of millions of daily active users. The year 2016 is late to be starting with 0.</p> </blockquote> <p>E-commerce specialists Salmon think the launch marks the rise of \u201cprogrammatic commerce\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like Amazon Echo and British Gas\u2019 Hive, Google is entering the increasingly competitive market of connected devices in the home.

  "<p>An unemployed man stabbed and beat an antiques dealer to death, after drawing up a list of robbery and kidnap targets that also included Kate Moss, Jeffrey Archer and other prominent business and political figures, a jury has been told.</p> <p>Michael Danaher is accused of attacking and murdering Adrian Greenwood at his home in Oxford on 6 April this year, after plotting for months to rob him of a rare first edition of The Wind in the Willows worth \u00a350,000.<br></p> <p>Oliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, told a jury at Oxford crown court that the antiques dealer died in a \u201cbrutal\u201d assault that left him with more than 30 stab wounds to the chest and neck and a deep wound in his back, almost certainly sustained while his back was turned.<br></p> <p>In addition, he had puncture wounds suggesting he may have been tortured, and numerous blunt-force injuries, including one that suggested he had been stamped on, the jury heard. Wounds to his hands suggested Greenwood tried to grab the knife used against him, the blade of which snapped off in the attack, the barrister said.<br></p> <p>Danaher denies murder, although Saxby told the jury he admits killing Greenwood but will argue that it was an act of self-defence.<br></p> <p>However, the barrister said that in contrast to Greenwood\u2019s injuries, Danaher had emerged from the violent incident \u201calmost unscathed\u201d. Afterwards he had not called emergency services, but \u201ccool as you like, he helped himself to that first edition of The Wind in the Willows, and Adrian Greenwood\u2019s phone, and his laptop and his wallet\u201d.<br></p> <p>He said that as Danaher left the house, the defendant had paused to take a selfie showing blood on his beard.<br></p> <p>The court heard that Greenwood\u2019s name appeared on a list of wealthy targets which Danaher, an unemployed father of two from Peterborough, had researched online and saved in an Excel spreadsheet he called \u201cEnterprises\u201d. Danaher tried to make ends meet by buying and selling on the internet, but was in financial difficulties, Saxby said, \u201cand had been considering unlawful means of solving them for a while\u201d.<br></p> <p>Alongside their names and addresses, Saxby said, Danaher listed \u201cmodus \u2013 in other words, how he was going to do what he was going to do\u201d, \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201cexpected take\u201d. The methods listed included \u201cstun gun\u201d and the words \u201csister\u201d and \u201cdaughter\u201d, alongside the word \u201cransom\u201d.<br></p> <p>Analysis of his laptop revealed the accused had also researched and saved the home addresses of celebrities including Simon Cowell, Katie Hopkins, Eamonn Holmes, Gary Lineker and Louise Redknapp, as well as the former Football Association chairman Greg Dyke and Adam Simmonds, a former Conservative police and crime commissioner of Northamptonshire, the court heard. A floorplan of the home of the TV presenter Anthea Turner was recovered from Danaher\u2019s laptop, Saxby said, while he had also researched how to buy samurai swords online.<br></p> <p>Greenwood, whom the defendant appeared to have targeted after the dealer listed his copy of The Wind in the Willows on eBay in August 2015, was included on the list with the note: \u201cModus: Any!! Expected take: rare books\u201d, the barrister said. He told the jury the defendant had made repeated internet searches about Greenwood, his business and home, and visited Oxford five times in the months before the killing, making a careful study of his home.<br></p> <p>Saxby told the jury of four women and eight men that the list of targets \u201cexudes a sense of resentment. It is almost as if these are people who, because of their wealth \u2026 deserve to be subjected to what he has planned.\u201d<br></p> <p>A number of those listed were Conservative party donors, and alongside the names of several, including Archer and the private equity investor Guy Hands, the words \u201cscum Tory\u201d were written, Saxby said. Police later found a stun gun, disguised as an iPhone, at the defendant\u2019s home, he added.<br></p> <p>The jury heard that on 22 March, about two weeks before Greenwood died, Danaher tried to force his way into the north London home of Adrian Beecroft, a wealthy businessman and Conservative donor who was also on the list, by pretending to have a delivery for the businessman\u2019s daughter. The man\u2019s wife became suspicious and raised the alarm, after which the accused fled, Saxby said.<br></p> <p>Late into the night before Greenwood died, the court heard, Danaher was searching the internet for topics including how to buy a handgun with a silencer, how to hide a gun in a car, and had researched a document entitled: \u201cGetting away with murder \u2013 Britain\u2019s most notorious crimes\u201d. By 10.45am, he was on the road to Oxford, where he was captured arriving at Greenwood\u2019s house at 12.55pm and leaving two hours later.<br></p> <p>Saxby told the jury that on the evening after Greenwood was killed, Danaher opened the \u201cEnterprises\u201d document on his laptop and deleted the antique dealer\u2019s name from the list, and listed the valuable book for sale on the internet. The same evening he allegedly composed a letter to Beecroft\u2019s wife in which he demanded a sum of 200 bitcoin (about \u00a396,000) in exchange for leaving the family alone. The letter was not sent.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt takes a certain person to have done what the defendant did to Adrian Greenwood,\u201d Saxby said, and \u201cto use his brutality to scare someone he had already terrified \u2026 Cool, calculated, controlled. Before, during and after. And underpinning it all? Greed. It was money he was after.\u201d<br></p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>UK stock markets soared on Tuesday, helped by a slump in the pound as it fell to a new 31-year low against the dollar amid growing fears that Britain could leave the single market after Brexit.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index of Britain\u2019s leading companies \u2013 which is dominated by companies that earn revenues in dollars \u2013 surged to 7,074.34, closing at its highest level since the record finish of 7,104 in April 2015. It came tantalisingly close to beating that landmark before a last-minute spate of profit taking.</p> <p>However, the FTSE 250 mid-cap index closed at a new peak, as investors shrugged off the gloom that surrounded markets at the start of the year and in the aftermath of the UK\u2019s EU referendum in June.</p> <p>The share gains came as the pound dropped to its worst level since June 1985, falling to $1.2721, down 0.9%.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at betting firm Spreadex, said: \u201cIt seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline ... and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market.\u201d</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: \u201cA move down to $1.25, and even $1.20 is now a possibility ... The all-time low for the pound/dollar from March 1985 is $1.05. We don\u2019t expect to return to these lows; back in 1985 the pound only briefly dipped to $1.05 before recovering sharply.\u201d </p> <p>But the weakness in the pound helped lift the international companies and exporters which dominate the FTSE 100, making their goods cheaper for foreign buyers and boosting their profits.</p> <p>Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at fund manager Aviva Investors, said the market was being driven by different factors to a year ago, when optimism over the health of the eurozone helped push shares upwards. He said: \u201cThe dynamics driving the index towards a record high are different from [2015], when we last witnessed the index go over 7,000. Then it was about falling oil prices and optimism on the eurozone recovery. This time, it materially revolves around currency ... Overseas earners benefit from the translation of these earnings back to sterling, leading to a succession of companies upgrading their earnings forecasts for currency alone.\u201d</p> <p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/ftse-100-near-record-high-pound-31-year-low\">index of Britain\u2019s 100 largest listed companies closed up 90.82 points or 1.3% to reach 7074.34</a>, a revival of 28% since it hit a 2016 low of 5537 in February.

  "<p>Google has launched a revamped artificially intelligent personal assistant that aims to be the Google people need wherever they are, be it on their smartphone or in the home through a new voice-enabled speaker.<br></p> <p>On the face of it, Assistant appears to be everything Google was already doing through its Now personal assistant on the phone, voice search on the web and information services built into its email, calendar and messenger products. But Google Assistant takes it one step further with a conversational interface that adapts to when, where and how you use it.</p> <p>In the home it can speak to you. Ask it questions and it will respond in kind \u2013 a voice conversation with a machine that learns about you and responds with your personal information, not just some generic searches pulled from the web. On the phone, it replaces Google\u2019s voice search, so you can set reminders, alarms, activate functions and pull information through voice or text.</p> <p>Gummi Hafsteinsson, product management director on the Assistant engineering team said: \u201cIt\u2019s a natural progression of what Google\u2019s been doing for years. Search has always been about finding things, first with a text box you type into, then natural language queries.</p> <p>\u201cSo now we\u2019re moving from a box you type into and get results, to more of a conversation with Google, so we can help answer questions and get things done, to help people throughout the day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3989a22f4ee95f1a08dc73848898d13eca298e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3989a22f4ee95f1a08dc73848898d13eca298e1/0_0_3564_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bottom of the Google Home speaker comes in several different colours, while multi-room audio is built right in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Google</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Google is not alone in its quest to develop AI capable of being conversational, which seen as the next big thing in tech. Apple\u2019s Siri was one of the first examples, but while simple voice control works well, the company has struggled to significantly improve its voice-activated assistant, leaving users frustrated. Amazon\u2019s Alexa, which recently launched in the UK on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/14/amazon-echo-voice-controlled-speaker-alexa-assistant-uk\">Amazon Echo</a> speaker, represents Google\u2019s biggest challenge in this space, capable of conversational responses that are almost human-like.</p> <p>But Google\u2019s advantage is that it has access to more information and voice data than anyone else though 18 years of searches and the advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence that powers it.</p> <p>\u201cConversation is a natural and fast way to get things done, getting to the point of what you need to accomplish as fast as possible. It\u2019s a universal interface of which you can apply the principles and ideas and functionalities to so many different places,\u201d said Hafsteinsson. \u201cIt means you can have a single conversation with Assistant regardless of what device you use. From the user\u2019s point of view, I shouldn\u2019t have to think about how I talk to Assistant, whether you talk to it on a phone or through Home.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, Assistant will be present on Google\u2019s new smartphones and within the Allo app for Android and iOS, but US users will also be able to buy a small voice-enabled speaker called Google Home.</p> <p>Hafsteinsson said: \u201cGoogle Home is a home helper that\u2019s connected to your home, so you can turn on the lights, play music, set timers and other home productivity apps, and answer any and all questions you might have.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fffaac015741ab5981a7e2971891fd87c082afd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fffaac015741ab5981a7e2971891fd87c082afd9/0_0_1715_1035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Assistant on the Google Pixel phone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"603\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google Assistant on the Google Pixel phone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Google</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Amazon\u2019s Echo, it will be able to control smart home devices, play music and pull information from the web. But if a user is saturated within Google\u2019s ecosystem, plugged into the company\u2019s Gmail, calendar, messaging, contacts, photos, maps and documents, it will be able to act as a true personal assistant, providing overviews of your day, information when you need it and other useful integrations.</p> <p>It also has third-party integrations \u2013 it works with most major music streaming services out of the box \u2013 and will have a developer programme launching later this year, allowing services to speak through Assistant directly to the user. For instance, if someone wants to call a cab, a taxi service such as Uber can jump into the conversation to ask specifics through Assistant before disappearing again, leaving Google to carry on the conversation once the cab is booked.</p> <p>Hafsteinsson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve added a little bit of personality, so if you say \u2018hi\u2019 to it, it asks how you are, or if you say \u2018good morning\u2019 to Assistant, it will respond with a brief overview of your day, building a relationship between user and Assistant in a natural way.\u201d</p> <p>Google Assistant represents a quick and easy way to access a wealth of features, but discovery may be difficult. Its adoption outside the home also hangs on how useful it can be without having to talk to it. There is a clear divide between the US and Europeans, particularly in the UK, over users\u2019 comfort in talking out loud to an inanimate object. But in the home there is a clearer use case.</p> <p>For Google, Assistant, Home and its new Pixel smartphones are about being with the user in every step of their day.</p> <p>Hafsteinsson said: \u201cThe long-term vision is for the Assistant to be available wherever you need it, not just on your phone. In your home, your car, wherever. For now, it\u2019s just the new phone from Google and the Home [device].\u201d</p> <p>Google Home costs $129 in the US and will come with a six-month YouTube Red free-trial. Pre-orders start on 4 October and will be available in stores from 4 November. Google said Home will launch in the UK next year.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2016/oct/04/google-pixel-phone-launch-live\"><strong>Google Pixel phone launch \u2013 as it happened</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/technology/2016/oct/04/google-launch-pixel-xl-iphone\"><strong>Google Pixel phone launched to take on iPhone</strong></a></li> </ul>",

Kardashian West had \u201cloaned\u201d him to one of her sisters who had gone out to a nearby Paris nightclub. Called by the stylist during the attack, the bodyguard reportedly rushed to the scene, arriving minutes after the gang had fled.</p> <p>The fact that the bodyguard was not present when the gang struck has raised speculation in Paris that the thieves had either been trailing and observing her extremely closely, or they had been tipped off by someone within her entourage that Duvier was not present.</p> <p>Paris prosecutors declined to comment on whether the robbers might have received help from inside her circle.</p> <p>Kardashian West reportedly begged the armed thieves not to kill her because she had children, according to the celebrity site TMZ.</p> <p>The attack happened at an exclusive, private apartment building known as a \u201cno address\u201d site, where celebrities visiting Paris often rent sumptuous suites. The main door to the street was unmarked, giving the guests privacy, but the site was thought to have far less security protection than the city\u2019s luxury hotels.

  "<p><strong></strong></p> <p>The vast patch of garbage floating in the Pacific Ocean is far worse than previously thought, with an aerial survey finding a much larger mass of fishing nets, plastic containers and other discarded items than imagined.</p> <p>A reconnaissance flight taken in a modified C-130 Hercules aircraft found a vast clump of mainly plastic waste at the northern edge of what is known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/patch.html\">great Pacific garbage patch</a>\u201d, located between Hawaii and California.</p> <p>The density of rubbish was several times higher than the <a href=\"https://www.theoceancleanup.com/\">Ocean Cleanup</a>, a foundation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/22/dutch-prototype-clean-up-boom-brings-pacific-plastics-solution-a-step-closer\">part-funded by the Dutch government</a> to rid the oceans of plastics, expected to find even at the heart of the patch, where most of the waste is concentrated.</p> <p>\u201cNormally when you do an aerial survey of dolphins or whales, you make a sighting and record it,\u201d said Boyan Slat, the founder of the Ocean Cleanup. </p> <p>\u201cThat was the plan for this survey.

The north Pacific gyre has accumulated a soup of plastic waste, including large items and smaller broken-down micro plastics that can be eaten by fish and enter the food chain.</p> <p>According to the UN environmental programme, the great Pacific garbage patch is growing so fast that it, like the Great Wall of China, is becoming visible from space. </p> <p>Last year, the Ocean Cleanup sent 30 vessels to cross the patch to scoop up micro plastics in fine nets to estimate the extent of the problem.

Scottish ministers would need to watch carefully to make sure that did not take away existing powers, Page said. </p> <p>\u201cIn my view, this represents a significant potential gap in the framework of Scottish parliamentary control over UK law making in the devolved areas, which the Scottish parliament should be alert to the need to close should UK ministers be given the power to revise EU law in the devolved areas,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The professor said Brexit would still leave Westminster and the UK government in control of the bulk of EU powers, including over trade, free movement of workers and employment law, banking and services within the UK.</p> <p>It was likely, he said, that the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/11/section/13/enacted\">Scotland Act, which sets out Holyrood\u2019s powers</a>, would need to be overhauled to clarify the extent of the Scottish parliament\u2019s autonomy and the need for UK approval after Brexit. </p> <p>Ministers will also need to invest heavily in new regulators and expertise in many of these areas, to take on policy areas currently controlled by the EU.</p> <p>Jackson Carlaw, the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said there was a risk that if Scotland was too out of step with the UK on some areas, it would damage trade deals. Even so \u201cthere are tremendous opportunities without the EU being a controlling authority, for the Scottish parliament to have much more control over many of the areas which come back to the UK\u201d, he said.</p>",

It\u2019s been18 months since the Tories ambitiously promised in their 2015 election general manifesto to halve the disability employment gap, but it is still not clear how they will achieve it. Halving the gap means getting over a million more disabled and chronically ill people into a job by 2020. Ministers no longer seem to mention that figure anymore.

The truth is that the \u201cpressures\u201d she spoke of are not caused by migration, but by the government\u2019s cuts and failure to invest in vital public services such as the NHS.</p> <p>Indeed all of the evidence suggests that the government\u2019s planned crackdown on free movement in Europe will mean less money being available to spend on public services.</p> <p>The answer in not to penalise migrants. It is deeply concerning that the fund seems to focus on withdrawing help from migrants, despite the fact that they contribute so much to our society and our economy. We should be proud of our multicultural communities, not doing them down. It is time the government stood up for migrants instead of blaming them for its own failings.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f3b8cae4b0d3973ef5f859\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T14:26:54.459Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Damian Green,</strong> the work and pensions secretary, made his key conference announcement at the weekend when he said that <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/01/dwp-scraps-retesting-for-chronically-ill-sickness-benefits-claimants\">people with the most severe health conditions who receive employment support allowance, a disability benefit, to be exempt from having to undergo regular health assessments to continue receiving payments.</a></strong></p> <p>But in his speech this afternoon he had some minor further announcements to make.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Green said he wanted to beef up the new enterprise allowance scheme.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am going to put rocket boosters under the new enterprise allowance.

And she delivered what was probably the most policy-rich speech delivered to the conference so far.</p> <p>Rudd mostly focused on immigration. She said people sent a clear message to politicians when they voted to leave the EU and she said the government was committed to getting net migration down to sustainable levels. \u201cThis means tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Specifically she announced plans to cut the number of people coming to the UK to work or to study. (Until the UK leaves the EU these proposals would only affect migrants from outside the EU.)</p> <p>She also announced a controlling migration fund, an idea that has also been proposed by Labour.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rudd announced that she was setting up a new \u00a3140m controlling migration fund. </strong>Jeremy Corbyn is committed to bringing back the migration impact fund (created by Labour but scrapped by the coalition) and at the Labour conference last week he suggested it might be worth \u00a350m over two years. Rudd said her proposal would go further.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might have heard that Jeremy Corbyn wants the government to bring back a migration fund Gordon Brown introduced after Labour let immigration spiral out of control ...</p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund was ineffective and focused funding on migrants rather than the pressures caused by migration ...</p> <p>We will deliver on our manifesto commitment and set up a new \u00a3140m controlling migration fund \u2013 designed specifically to ease the pressures on public services in areas of high migration.</p> <p>And at the same time it will implement strategies to reduce illegal immigration.</p> <p>The fund will build on work we have done to support local authorities \u2026to stop giving housing benefit to people that have no right to be in the country \u2026 to reduce rough sleeping by illegal immigrants \u2026 and to crack down on the rogue landlords who house illegal migrants in the most appalling conditions.</p> <p>And for those that are here legally, we will provide more English language support. And with it, the obvious benefits of being able to join the way of life in the country they have chosen to call home.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would consult on plans to make it harder for firms to bring in foreign workers.</strong> The Home Office would soon be consulting on measures to curb immigration, focusing on changes to the rules for the work and study routes, she said. On work she said she would be \u201cexamining whether we should tighten the test companies have to take before recruiting from abroad.\u201d</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>British businesses have driven the economic recovery in this country, with employment at record levels.</p> <p>However we still need to do more \u2026 so all British people get the opportunities they need to get on in life.</p> <p>The test should ensure people coming here are filling gaps in the labour market, not taking jobs British people could do.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted to toughen the immigration rules for foreign students studying at low quality colleges.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will also look for the first time at whether our student immigration rules should be tailored to the quality of the course and the quality of the educational institution.</p> <p>I\u2019m proud that we have world-leading centres of academic excellence. It\u2019s a testament to our country\u2019s proud history and our top universities\u2019 ability to evolve.</p> <p>But the current system allows all students, irrespective of their talents and the university\u2019s quality, favourable employment prospects when they stop studying.</p> <p>While an international student is studying here, their family members can do any form of work.</p> <p>And foreign students, even those studying English Language degrees, don\u2019t even have to be proficient in speaking English. We need to look at whether this one size fits all approach really is right for the hundreds of different universities, providing thousands of different courses across the country ...</p> <p>Our consultation will ask what more can we do to support our best universities - and those that stick to the rules - to attract the best talent \u2026 while looking at tougher rules for students on lower quality courses.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the government would make it easier to deport foreign criminals. </strong>EU migrants who repeatedly commit so-called minor crimes will be deported, she said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the first time, we will deport EU nationals that repeatedly commit so-called minor crimes in this country.</p> <p>So-called minor crime is still crime \u2013 its pain is still felt deeply by victims.</p> <p>Well, those criminals will face being banned from coming back to the country from between 5 and 10 years.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would soon be implementing legislation already passed to tighten controls on immigrants in the UK.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, I am announcing that from December, landlords that knowingly rent out property to people who have no right to be here will be committing a criminal offence. They could go to prison.</p> <p>Furthermore, from December, immigration checks will be a mandatory requirement for those wanting to get a licence to drive a taxi.</p> <p>And from next autumn, banks will have to do regular checks to ensure they are not providing essential banking services to illegal migrants.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would be publishing the next phase of the government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy later this year.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would extend the unduly lenient sentencing scheme to cover all terrorism cases heard in the crown court.</strong> This scheme allows people to ask the attorney general to look again at sentenced deemed unduly lenient.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would soon legislate to try to tackle the financing of crime and terrorism.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is an obvious point \u2013 but financial profit is the principal driver for almost all serious and organised crime.</p> <p>Our new legislation will give new powers to law enforcement agencies to track the criminals involved down \u2026 criminals who are laundering something in the region $1.6 trillion globally, every year.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae0d3c4cab96aef0d7d124850aa121e9f7d71595\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0d3c4cab96aef0d7d124850aa121e9f7d71595/0_115_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd addressing the Conservative conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd addressing the Conservative conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T13:06:27.430Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f391e2e4b05e7633c58514\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T11:27:27.672Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is Boris Johnson out running in Birmingham this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acb49618b3dc2dbdcd3d0b7a42036e9ab34a3ab7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acb49618b3dc2dbdcd3d0b7a42036e9ab34a3ab7/0_33_2517_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson (centre) takes an early morning run at the conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson (centre) takes an early morning run at the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>Johnson was running with the Sun editor, Tony Gallagher, who is in front in the picture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/murrayf00te/status/783235743518949376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonygallagher\">@tonygallagher</a> did you train for that run? <a href=\"https://t.co/u025vkdHkg\">pic.twitter.com/u025vkdHkg</a></p>&mdash; Murray Foote (@murrayf00te) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/murrayf00te/status/783235743518949376\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tonygallagher/status/783236233329868800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murrayf00te\">@murrayf00te</a> No idea who that strange blond bloke is in my wake</p>&mdash; Tony Gallagher (@tonygallagher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonygallagher/status/783236233329868800\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T12:47:28.341Z\">at 1.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f38c9de4b0a497243b6d40\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T11:20:39.794Z\">12.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Liz Truss's speech - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Liz Truss</strong>, the justice secretary, spoke after Michael Fallon.

On the Today programme Nick Robinson asked whether, in the light of her desire to help people on average incomes (who do not benefit from this cut), she would reverse it. May ignored the question. She also dodged questions from Robinson about whether she favoured building more council homes, or putting up public sector pay. (May probably does think the inheritance tax cut was a bad idea.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d16d8ae4b07ac3d446a3ad#block-57d16d8ae4b07ac3d446a3ad\"> Nick Timothy, her highly-influential co-chief of staff, has strongly criticised it in the past.)</a></p> <p><strong>3 - When May thinks net migration will be cut below 100,000. </strong>May said she was still committed to this as a target, but she refused to say when it would be met.

May did not answer directly, although she did say that she had always argued that the sky would not fall in if Britain did leave the EU. She was now focused on the future, she said.

May said that was a comment about a specific policy. She refused to say who she wanted to win the US presidential election.</p> <p><strong>6 - What she regrets.</strong> Pointing out that she has just turned 60, Morgan asked her if she had any regrets.

I\u2019m accustomed to posting about the \u2018things we\u2019ve learnt\u2019 from events like this, but this morning I will do a post about all the things we did not learn from May\u2019s media round.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t entirely unproductive. We did get something out of it. Here are six things about May that we did find out.</p> <p><strong>1 - May says injustice makes her angry.</strong> At the end of his Today interview Nick Robinson asked May what made her argument, saying that this was a question that often revealed what motivated people to go into politics. May did not have to think for long before giving a firm answer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Injustice. What makes me angry? Child sexual abuse. Modern slavery. When we see the powerful abusing their position. That\u2019s what makes me angry.</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be wrong to say that she was fired up with emotion, but she did answer the question with a sincerity and directness that was lacking from her earlier answers. And it is not an answer that David Cameron would have given, at least not with the same level of conviction. Later, on LBC, May was also quite forceful when she explained that she was committed to the child abuse inquiry because she thought some victims had been denied justice for years.

May said she did not object.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it is interesting that people focus on my shoes. I don\u2019t think they focus on Philip Hammond\u2019s or Boris Johnson\u2019s in quite the same way. But, look, do I regret that fact that people look at my shoes? Hey, it gives me an excuse to go and buy new shoes.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4 - May seems to be playing down her commitment to building new grammar schools.</strong> She was asked about the policy in various interviews and, although she did not go back on anything previously announced, it was noticeable that she was keen to stress that the policy she is proposing is about much more than building grammar schools. She described the policy in terms of lifting the ban on selection, and said it was only one aspect of a plan to create more good school places. (Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, has suggested<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/nicky-morgan-suggests-theresa-may-is-about-to-water-down-gra?utm_term=.cedj8wNreO#.soBQw615D8\"> in a BuzzFeed interview that she thinks the government is about to compromise on its plans.)</a></p> <p><strong>5 - May can make a good impression on interviewers. </strong>At the end of the Good Morning Britain interview <strong>Piers Morgan</strong>, the presenter, said: \u201cShe\u2019s a nice lady, Theresa May.\u201d His co-presenter, <strong>Susanna Reid</strong>, added: \u201cShe\u2019s very open and honest.\u201d It is not the sort of thing John Humphrys would ever say on the Today programme, but it is interesting. I don\u2019t recall Morgan and Reid making comments like that about David Cameron. And at the end of his Sky interview, <strong>Eamonn Holmes</strong> told her he was leaving the show, before adding: \u201cI would like to thank you for all your courtesy through the years, putting up with my banal, inane questioning.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6 - May may not commit to \u201chard\u201d over \u201csoft\u201d regarding Brexit, but she does for cooking. </strong>On Good Morning Britain Morgan asked about cooking scones (May is keen on cooking, and the Sunday Times published a recipe for scones from her at the weekend) and he said she had caused a stir by saying people could use either butter or margarine. Was butter better, he asked. And should it be hard or soft? May replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you have to rub it in with the flour, and it is often easier actually if it is hard, you can get a good rub in.

Everybody gets it wrong from time to time. Only the inveterate fence sitters are spared having egg on their face.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund certainly knows what it is like to make a mistake. In the run-up to the EU referendum, the IMF made a series of interventions warning voters of the dire consequences that would follow a vote to leave.</p> <p>At first, the IMF stuck to long-term forecasts, saying investment and trade would eventually be weaker if the UK divorced from the other 27 members of the EU. But as the referendum neared and the vote was on a knife-edge, the warnings became more lurid. The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\">would immediately start sliding into recession</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">House prices would crumble. Shares would crash</a>.</p> <p>So what do you do if your forecasts turn out to be a little wide of the mark? Either you put your hands up and admit you were wrong. Or you brazen it out. You say that it is too early to say. You say that eventually you will come right.</p> <p>No prizes for guessing which option the IMF has taken. Its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) report says the UK will do fine in 2016 but is going to find the going a lot tougher in 2017.</p> <p>This is a perfectly respectable view, and one held by a host of academic, business and City economists. Had the IMF stuck to this sort of assessment throughout the referendum campaign, it would have saved itself embarrassment now. As it is, it will get some stick from those who thought the Washington-based fund had overstepped the mark in its support for the remain camp.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/imf-peak-pessimism-brexit-eu-referendum-european-union-international-monetary-fund\">IMF left shamefaced after peak pessimism over Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f3ac35e4b0d3973ef5f809\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T13:21:24.999Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF singles out the UK\u2019s referendum as a key factor hurting global growth, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere is a more subdued outlook for advanced economies following the June U.K. vote in favour of leaving the European Union (Brexit) and weaker-than-expected growth in the United States.</p> <p>These developments have put further downward pressure on global interest rates, as monetary policy is now expected to remain accommodative for longer.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also cites China\u2019s economic rebalancing, and a general slowdown in trade growth since 2012.

At the hearing, the council obtained an injunction to stop the organisers setting up the project at other sites across the city centre, but agreed to give the group the use of the car park on the outskirts of the city centre for an interim period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/03/leeds-homelessness-protesters-fight-legal-bid-to-evict-tent-city\">Leeds homelessness protesters fight legal bid to evict tent city</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group had already moved to a second site in Park Square, which is home to many of the city\u2019s law firms, but the council issued a claim for possession of the square which led to Tuesday\u2019s hearing.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t support the idea of a permanent tented city as is doesn\u2019t resolve the issue or address the challenge of being able to engage with people who have a range of complicated problems that need various support and health services to help them to a better life,\u201d said Debra Coupar, Leeds city council\u2019s executive member for communities. \u201cIf, at the end of the six-week period, everyone\u2019s best endeavours haven\u2019t resulted in the group disbanding voluntarily from the site, we\u2019ll look at the legal options available to us as we have to balance the needs of the vulnerable alongside those of other residents and businesses in the city.\u201d</p> <p>The council said it would assess the needs of all those sleeping in the tents on the site by the end of that period, but maintained there was accommodation available for every person sleeping on the streets if they wanted it.</p> <p>The project\u2019s organisers said gathering rough sleepers together in the tent city served to highlight the size of the homelessness problem in Leeds and provide a safer space for them to sleep in. Continuously staffed by volunteers, who distributed donated clothing, food and hot drinks to homeless people sleeping in the tents, the project was first pitched outside the city\u2019s art gallery before it was ordered to move last week to make way for Yorkshire\u2019s Olympics celebrations.</p> <p>Haydn Jessop from Leeds Voice for the Homeless, who was once homeless himself, described the council\u2019s decision as a massive victory. \u201cWe went to the council a week ago asking for some land: they refused, but today they conceded,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Simon Rickles, another volunteer with the group, said: \u201cFinally the council are accepting the amount of people in Leeds with no option but to sleep on the streets and are starting to take positive steps to get them into homes. Meanwhile they now have a safe place to stay. I just hope the council will work with us to ensure people receive the help they need sooner in the future.\u201d </p> <p>Coupar said there was accommodation and support available to those who wanted it. \u201cWe\u2019d prefer the group to disband voluntarily, however, they clearly wish to continue their protest,\u201d she said. \u201cContinually going to court to move people on is costly and unproductive as there are few, if any, locations in a city as diverse as Leeds where the camp wouldn\u2019t cause some level of disruption to residents and businesses.</p> <p> \u201cAllowing the protesters to temporarily use the international pool site for an interim six-week period is not ideal but is the least worst option. As throughout this protest, we\u2019re committed to engaging with the group so everyone that needs assistance get it. The group have committed to working with agencies to ensure this happens.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Last month, representatives from government, major corporations, and the United Nations gathered in New York City to explore the efforts of inclusive businesses to meet the 17 <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">sustainable development goals (SDGs)</a> formally launched one year ago.

Addressing the first point, he observed that \u201cthe SDGs are not a checklist, but a holistic framework. Focusing on certain global issues can help advance multiple SDGs.\u201d In other words, because so many of the goals are interconnected, any given business shouldn\u2019t spread itself thin trying to approach 17 separate problems, but should rather leverage its core competencies to focus on just one or two areas where it can have the biggest impact.</p> <p>He cited the example of Essilor\u2019s work in India, explaining that uncorrected poor vision is \u201cthe world\u2019s largest disability\u201d and therefore a fundamental obstacle to the fulfillment of all of the SDGs. \u201cIt affects 2.5 billion people worldwide,\u201d he said, \u201cand according to the WHO costs the global economy $227bn [\u00a3176bn] each year in lost productivity.\u201d By helping adults to see, Bhuvaraghan said, millions more people will be empowered to perform the actions needed to help fulfill the 2030 agenda. </p> <h2>Idealists work better together</h2> <p>As for the charge that the SDGs may be too aspirational to be effectively addressed by the private sector in day-to-day business operations, many participants argued that SDG17 - \u201cPartnerships for the Goals\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-call-to-action-partnerzone/2016/aug/15/why-sdg17-is-an-essential-sustainable-development-goal\">helps ensure</a> that the remaining SDGs aren\u2019t approached in nebulous terms. If the goals are openly discussed and made sufficiently concrete, the thinking goes, inclusive businesses can find financially compelling reasons to work with other organisations in support of the SDGs, creating win-win scenarios that combine mutually beneficial business growth with measurable results.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this yourself,\u201d said Laura Gitman, VP of sustainability nonprofit BSR. \u201cYou need to collaborate with a variety of different partners, and it has to be true collaboration, a genuine partnership approach, which is critical to really scale.\u201d</p> <p>Toshio Takanashi, a senior executive of Japan\u2019s Asahi Kasei Corporation, agreed: \u201cI think the single most important factor to focus on is relationship.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5b847a3da72ea981d35a2d202206741e536c78b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5b847a3da72ea981d35a2d202206741e536c78b/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Spitzer and Teresa Law, CEO and CFO of Mountain Hazelnuts, Bhutan\u2019s largest private-sector employer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Spitzer and Teresa Law, CEO and CFO of Mountain Hazelnuts, Bhutan\u2019s largest private-sector employer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Business Call to Action</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet establishing trust and commitment in a business relationship, as in a marriage, takes time and patience, remarked Teresa Law, co-founder and CFO of Bhutan\u2019s largest private-sector employer, Mountain Hazelnuts. \u201cI think you need to have patience,\u201d she said, \u201cthat you\u2019re not going to get a divorce, that you\u2019re going to stick it out.\u201d</p> <p>Swedish telecom giant Ericsson\u2019s senior vice president and chief sustainability officer Elaine Weidman-Grunewald said that by continuing to establish regional partnerships her company aims to address \u201caffordability barriers\u201d to internet access, finding ways to connect \u201chalf the planet\u201d that still isn\u2019t online. Such partnerships are not only key to Erisson\u2019s core business objectives, she noted, but they also happen to align seamlessly with important SDGs.</p> <p>\u201cLife is a chain of relationships,\u201d said Roger Schmid, manager of the New York Innovation Hub for the Brazilian beauty products manufacturer Natura. \u201cSo we need to increasingly understand and appreciate how everything is interrelated, that whatever we do touches everything else.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-call-to-action-partnerzone/2016/sep/22/how-governments-are-engaging-with-the-private-sector-on-the-sdgs-new-report\">How governments are engaging with the private sector on the SDGs, new report</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Accounting for inclusive businesses\u2019 impact</h2> <p>As for the question of how inclusive businesses can adequately monitor and measure their overall progress in the effort to fulfill the SDGs, BCtA debuted a new report at the conference that aims to address such concerns head on.

It is driven by market opportunities, but it seeks to target the people that most need to be included in the economy.

  "<p>David Davis has dismissed the idea that he and other prominent leave campaigners were put in charge of Brexit so they could be held responsible if it went wrong, saying \u201cthere will be plenty of blame to go round\u201d if that were to happen.</p> <p>Speaking on the fringes of the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, the Brexit secretary said it was \u201cconspiracy stuff\u201d to believe Theresa May appointed him, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, with that in mind.</p> <p>Davis said: \u201cIf it goes wrong, the whole government will be blamed. If it goes right there will be much more than enough credit to go round, and if it goes wrong there will be plenty of blame to go round. But I don\u2019t worry about all that.\u201d</p> <p>Davis gave a predictably bullish account of how he expected the UK\u2019s EU exit to play out, saying London did not have to fear losing its prominent position in financial services.</p> <p>He said much of this was down to the anglophone culture of the finance world, and the lifestyle available in the capital.

And I said I\u2019d support her.\u201d</p> <p>Davis also said that on the day he was appointed Brexit secretary, he had almost missed the opportunity by turning off his phone.

  "<p>When you start working on a film, you make your plans. First, there\u2019s the script development, sharpening the screenplay, making sure that characters resonate and pop and are as colourful as they can be. Then there\u2019s preparation, which usually means research, meeting with the people that inhabit the culture you are making the film about, and understanding all the peripheral players in that world. After I came aboard Deepwater Horizon, I jumped into the script, went down to Louisiana \u2013 and very quickly realised this was different. We were dealing with a culture of litigation.</p> <p>Because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_explosion\">the explosion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">oil spill</a> was so huge, that\u2019s what dominated the area. You would go to these small towns in southern Louisiana, places you had never heard of, such as Port Fourchon, and you would see harbours full of boats with brand-new shiny engines, new trucks, people wearing brand-new Rolexes and new shoes. So many lawyers had moved in, there were so many lawsuits, and everyone who lived in that area had sued BP and made millions of dollars. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/spillionaires-are-the-new-rich-after-bp-oil-spill-payouts/2011/04/11/AFjaqsWD_story.html\">They called them \u201cspillionaires\u201d</a>. A lot of people got rich \u2013 some deserved it, some probably didn\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/02/deepwater-horizon-review-mark-wahlberg-john-malkovich\">Deepwater Horizon review \u2013 gripping real-life disaster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we were making a movie about the spill, we were subject to the litigious psychology. BP became a very effective disruptor and prevented us getting any access to any oil rigs. We couldn\u2019t even fly by one. At one point we were in a helicopter on a tour of a rig called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Nautilus\">Nautilus</a> and were told if we got any closer we would be perceived to be a threat and they were going to defend themselves. The companies exert so much power because they are such financial engines in that part of the country \u2013 anyone who worked with BP basically said they couldn\u2019t talk to us. We had consultants who would work with us for a day or two, but the third day they would call in sick and we would never hear from them again. We had contracts to film on the tenders that go back and forth to the rigs \u2013 then the day before, they would say we couldn\u2019t. It became obvious that BP was doing a great job of intimidating most of the people down in that community. We understood it; it wasn\u2019t a news flash. BP pays a lot of bills there, a lot of mortgages, sends a lot of kids to school, pays a lot of medical insurance. We realised our only option was to build our own rig \u2013 which we did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96997de993b8624776526d73bfc897b587d4c538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96997de993b8624776526d73bfc897b587d4c538/0_95_2936_1762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deepwater Horizon on fire in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deepwater Horizon on fire in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KPA/Zuma / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We also found that several of the people who were involved in the real-life incident clearly had gag orders as a result of their settlement with BP; they told us they could not speak with us. The ones who did not have gag orders did speak to us. BP\u2019s two main rig supervisors, Donald Vidrine and Robert Kaluza (who were played by John Malkovich and Brad Leland), did not speak to us. But because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/manslaughter-charges-dropped-bp-employees-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill\">their testimony from the congressional and coastguard hearings is on record</a>, we were able to capture so much of their documented actions and conversations that we didn\u2019t really need to speak to them.</p> <p>The legal processes were something else. Lionsgate, our studio, had a team of independent lawyers who would review every word in the script, constantly. It didn\u2019t stop there: because I do a lot of improvisation, things change during the shoot. So in the final edits the lawyers were all over me; it was the first time in my career I have ever had to take mandatory edits from the studio. For example, we had a scene that might have suggested that workers were under pressure to say the rig was safe because BP managers wanted to move on to another oil well. It was 100% true and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/12/deepwater-gulf-oil-spill-hearing\">very well documented</a>, but the lawyers were concerned it was making BP look too responsible for the blowout. So we had to back off. It was frustrating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/04/bp-oil-spill-judge-grants-final-approval-20-billion-dollar-settlement\">BP oil spill: judge grants final approval for $20bn settlement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We were also being closely monitored as to how we portrayed the actual events. If you asked 50 experts why the Deepwater oil rig blew up, you will get 50 different answers. Clearly, it was a confluence of events, not one single thing; but the one area pretty much everyone agrees on was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/29/bp-oil-spill-bp\">the issue with the cement pour at the bottom of the well</a>. They put it down in order to control the pressure of the well, and before it can be proclaimed safe they should do an inspection called a cement bond log. It\u2019s basically sending sonar signals down to make sure there are no hollow spots. BP sent the team home; they never did the test. That\u2019s fact, very well documented, and most people believe it was the beginning of the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e9d16ca44d0db0414ecac8b5c5c890b79010aaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e9d16ca44d0db0414ecac8b5c5c890b79010aaf/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If you ask 50 experts why Deepwater blew up, you will get 50 different answers.\u2019\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you ask 50 experts why Deepwater blew up, you will get 50 different answers.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s very likely BP either wanted to save the $125,000 (\u00a398,000) it would have cost \u2013 or, as my feeling is, they didn\u2019t want to know. If there was a problem they would have had to pull up all the cement and redo the job, which could take another three weeks at $1m a day. The lawyers\u2019 argument was: if you say the cement bond was cracked, the subcontractor who made the bonding solution will sue, and we can\u2019t prove the solution was faulty. If you say the test wasn\u2019t done, the company that was sent home will say that\u2019s slander. That was where we really dug in. It sounds trivial, but we argued for a week about how much we could say the cement pour was the catalyst that led to the blowout.</p> <p>The thing to remember is that BP don\u2019t own the rigs, they rent them. The way the rigs are organised, and the way the different companies work together, is fascinating. It\u2019s a complex social organisation of subcontractors, who have different jobs on the rig at a given time. For example, Transocean own the rig. Schlumberger were expecting to do the cement bond log.</p> <p>One small surprise: we were able to use actual BP logos in the film. It\u2019s one of those things where you scratch your head with the lawyers. Normally we\u2019re told we have to modify logos \u2013 but they are public domain, and to capture them on film is not illegal.</p> <p>What was behind it all was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_expenses_insurance\">litigation insurance</a>, to protect the studio from legal action. All the lawyers I was dealing with were themselves dealing with lawyers from the insurance company. As far as Lionsgate were concerned, any issue that was going to preclude the insurance bond from closing was non-negotiable. I was having to edit my film based on an insurance company, and that was crazy. BP may very well sue, but we believe we have defensible positions.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/mar/29/deepwater-horizon-mark-wahlberg-in-disaster-movie-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4tvej\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2480455\"            data-video-name=\"Deepwater Horizon: Mark Wahlberg in disaster movie trailer - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56fa83f6e4b0465523578dd3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/mar/29/deepwater-horizon-mark-wahlberg-in-disaster-movie-trailer-video\">Deepwater Horizon: Mark Wahlberg in disaster movie trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the end of the day, we might be the best thing that could happen for BP. Nobody thought the cement pour would have led to what it did. Vidrine and Kaluza were wrong, but there was no criminal intent there. We are clear on that. BP behaved as a company for profit, which it is \u2013 but we all participate in capitalist society. Every time we drive a car or fly in an airplane, we are all complicit in this relationship. BP isn\u2019t some great devil forcing us to live these lifestyles. BP had many problems drilling that well that certainly weren\u2019t all BP\u2019s fault \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/25/deepwater-trial-justice-bp-warnings\">that was why it was called \u201cthe well from hell\u201d</a>. I think we made BP look reasonable in its reactions to events. That\u2019s not to say its two guys weren\u2019t on the rig; they were in charge, and made some big mistakes. If anyone had really understood that something this bad was going to happen, they would have stopped it for sure; no one realised what the price could be for the shortcuts. I\u2019ll bet you BP are not going to be so quick to cut corners in future.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Deepwater Horizon is now in cinemas</em></p>",
  "<h2>MR NICE?</h2> <p>Following <em>that</em> penalty miss at Euro 96, Gareth Southgate and his wife went to Bali on holiday to get away from it all: the public opprobrium, the ridicule, the lucrative overtures from Pizza Hut and other constant reminders of his spot-kick shame. While there they visited an isolated Buddhist temple and were introduced to a resident monk. His first words: \u201cYou Gareth Southgate, you England penalty drama!\u201d </p> <p>It was the kind of drama Southgate will be hoping to avoid now he\u2019s been put in temporary charge of the England team, perceived by many as a safe pair of hands who is unlikely to be filmed quaffing pints of Pinot Grigio while being courted by undercover reporters, and who has already got off to a better start than his predecessor by insisting it is for him to say where Wayne Rooney is going to play. Grrr!<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/04/wayne-rooney-england-unity-malta-sam-allardyce-exit\">Wayne Rooney calls for England unity following Sam Allardyce exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to reporters for the first time since being handed the England reins for seven weeks and four matches, Southgate was quick to dismiss the notion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/gareth-southgate-england-manager\">that he is too \u201cnice\u201d for the job</a>. \u201cI guess the best thing is to talk to the people who have worked with me,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have just one style and when firmness and discipline are needed the players I have worked with, certainly over the last three or four years, would be able to tell you that\u2019s there.\u201d An iron fist in a velvet glove then, Southgate has already proved he\u2019s not afraid to make Big Calls, taking the controversial decision to select the out-of-form Rooney for England\u2019s matches against Malta and Slovenia, then promising him the captaincy in a bid to prove he\u2019s very much his own ma \u2026 oh.</p> <p>But while Southgate\u2019s selection policy may not appear to differ that much from Allardyce, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/gareth-southgate-england-manager-reluctant-redeemer\">his considerably less brash and abrasive style</a> almost certainly will. His entirely understandable but surprise admission that \u201cI am involved in a sport I love but an industry that I don\u2019t like\u201d seems almost entirely at odds with Big Sam, a man who has always seemed more at home with the bells, whistles and pound signs of the football industry than the intricacies and finer points of the actual game around which it is built. As underwhelming as some football fans seem to find his appointment, however temporary, after his predecessor\u2019s folly this is win-win for Southgate.</p> <p>Having previously declared himself not ready for this role, it\u2019s easy to see why Southgate has performed a volte-face. It seems inconceivable he will make a mess of his caretaker tenure, at which point he may well have a big decision to make. And if does all go horribly wrong for him, he still won\u2019t look as big a chump as his predecessor, nor will it be the first time he\u2019s been compelled to go out in public wearing a paper bag over his head.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cA lot of today\u2019s players cannot play 90 minutes because they get so tired easily.

USA!! USA!!! I was rather aghast at hearing a real, honest to goodness, Premier League club hired Bob Bradley as their manager (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). There are many things my country does very well or used to do very well. Like producing annoying tech billionaires or cars, respectively. But football managers? When I played youth soccer over here, all of our proper American coaches had to ask the Dutch visiting professor guy (also a coach) how to get a first down in this soccer thing. But there is one winner in all of this. Sam Allardyce. And not just for getting him off the front page. Bradley might not lead Swansea clear of relegation, but in terms of tactical sophistication and literate motivation he\u2019ll make Sam look like a combination of Marcelo Bielsa and Johan Cruyff\u201d \u2013 Thad Brown.<br></p> <p>\u201cWith regard to the rather inelegant sacking of Francesco Guidolin, I notice that Swansea reportedly interviewed Bob Bradley and Ryan Giggs last week, while he was still in the job.

  "<p>Tim Kaine and Mike Pence were born just a year apart and grew up in the kind of traditional Irish Catholic families that went to mass regularly and revered John F Kennedy.</p> <p>But when the two midwesterners entered young adulthood, both had experiences that challenged their traditional Catholic views, setting each on a radically different political course that would eventually lead them to Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate.</p> <p>For Kaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s Democratic running mate and Virginia senator, it was a nine-month mission to Honduras that became a \u201cturning point\u201d in his life. It was there that he came face to face with Jesuits who championed a controversial gospel known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/11/vatican-new-chapter-liberation-theology-founder-gustavo-gutierrez\">liberation theology, which demanded the pursuit of social justice for the poor by the faithful</a> \u2013 and has been criticised by some traditionalists as a Marxist interpretation of the gospels. He also witnessed extreme poverty, though some <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/eat-pray-starve-what-tim-kaine-didnt-learn-during-his-time-in-honduras/\">critics contend he did not do enough later in life</a> to address the issues he learned about then. </p> <p>\u201cI think of El Progreso everyday.

The argument faded, the group dispersed, no blows were exchanged. It should have been the end of the matter, but someone had been disrespected.</p> <p>Shortly after, a group of boys, including Conteh, decided to travel to Home Park in Sydenham. It was summer and the park was buzzing. A stand-off ensued between the Sydenham Boys and the SG group, and Conteh, not wishing to fight, saw a discarded bike from the rival group and made off with it, away from the confrontation. This is supported by CCTV footage.</p> <p>Nicholas Pearton, 16, a member of the Sydenham Boys, showed up late and became isolated. He ran out of the park and across the main road, pursued by SG members. He was stabbed in the back, ran into a takeaway shop, and died minutes later.</p> <p>His murder featured in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jul/07/common-guilty-by-association-legal-system-drama-documentaries\">BBC One documentary Guilty by Association,</a> highlighting Conteh\u2019s conviction and that of another who remained behind inside the park, Joseph Appiah, 16, who was convicted of murder under joint enterprise, despite being 200 yards away at the time of the stabbing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Edward came home that day it was very late,\u201d Conteh\u2019s mother, Memunatu, <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/03/31/case-study-edward-conteh-trip-to-the-park-ends-in-homicide-conviction/\">explained to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>. \u201cWhen I saw Edward\u2019s face there was panic.

Jengba is a grassroots campaign group formed in 2010 by four angry women. It is currently supporting more than 700 prisoners \u201cwrongfully imprisoned\u201d under the law of joint enterprise.</p> <p>Under the 300-year-old law, a second person who did not deliver the fatal blow can be convicted if they can be shown to have foreseen the possibility that another person may inflict serious harm. They do not need to intend the harm themselves, or even physically participate in it.</p> <p>This substantially low threshold of guilt has enabled thousands to be convicted of murder and sentenced to long prison terms, released on parole only if remorse is shown.</p> <p>However, even if \u201cforesight\u201d cannot be proven, if the defendant was associated with the crime in some way \u2013 ie presence at the scene or a friendship with the principal protagonist \u2013 they can still be convicted of manslaughter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He will be abandoned in Belgium this Thursday, leaving behind his parents and four younger siblings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is what happened to Conteh when he was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment.

The lack of any intention or foresight of the harm caused to Pearton would render his conviction unsafe.</p> <p>Conteh now has a good chance to appeal his conviction. Despite having served his sentence, he is still haunted by being labelled a killer. His appeal has been lodged at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-cases-review-commission\">Criminal Cases Review Commission</a>, but as a foreign national convicted of a crime he will now be deported back to Belgium without any family or even a place to stay.</p> <p>Jengba has supported Conteh while in prison and in the detention centre in Dover throughout his many deportation hearings. A judge at one hearing noted that joint enterprise was a \u201cvery controversial area of law\u201d and accepted the view of the original trial judge that there were mitigating circumstances, as outlined in a probation report: \u201cHe did not plan the trip to Sydenham and was more likely to be a follower than a leader in what took place in Home Park. His age, good character, borderline intelligence and abnormally compliant personality are mitigating features in his case.\u201d</p> <p>However, Conteh is still an offender, so his appeal against deportation was refused, despite his probation officer\u2019s views that he is a low risk to the public. Held securely in a deportation centre, travel documents in hand, he will be abandoned in Belgium this Thursday, leaving behind his parents and four younger siblings and the country that he calls home. If the Home Office stays his deportation, Conteh will have a chance to clear his name. Justice must prevail.</p> <p>\u2022 To ask for a stay of deportation to give Edward Conteh a chance to appeal his conviction, write to the Home Office minister for immigration, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-robert-goodwill/1562\">Robert Goodwill</a></p>",

International students come to the UK, study for a period, and then the overwhelming majority go home after their studies,\u201d she added, disputing their inclusion in the net migration target.</p> <p>Rudd said the process of bringing skilled workers to Britain from outside Europe had become a box-ticking exercise, allowing some firms to get away with not training local people. \u201cWe won\u2019t win in the world if we don\u2019t do more to upskill our own workforce. It\u2019s not fair on companies doing the right thing. So I want us to look again at whether our immigration system provides the right incentives for businesses to invest in British workers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The review is likely to look again at the resident market labour test and ensure that job vacancies are advertised locally in Britain and not just abroad among potential migrant staff.</p> <p>Rudd said the \u201ccontrolling migration fund\u201d would be designed specifically to ease the pressure on public services in areas of high migration. It replaces a Labour migration impact fund, which was scrapped in 2010 as ineffective. The fund would also be used in the government\u2019s stated drive to \u201ccreate a hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund had spent money on translation services rather than English lessons, the home secretary said, and councils were given money to promote recycling rather than the support they needed to ease housing pressures.<br></p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund was financed by a \u00a350-a-head levy on visas. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Labour\u2019sthe party\u2019s new proposal \u2013 an impact fund of \u00a350m over two years \u2013 would also be financed by a levy on citizenship applications. Rudd did not spell out where the \u00a3140m would come from.</p> <p>The Home Office said the \u00a3140m fund would be spent over the remaining three-and-a-half years of the current parliament. English local authorities would shortly be invited to bid for \u00a3100m of the fund to manage a range of issues associated with sudden and high levels of migration such as securing community cohesion, providing English language teaching or tackling overcrowded properties.</p> <p>The remaining \u00a340m would be set aside to fund immigration enforcement activity in areas of high migration, including targeting and removing illegal immigrants living in overcrowded accommodation or sleeping rough who are resistant to finding proper accommodation or returning home.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, said it sounded as if the prime minister had had a heavy hand in drafting Rudd\u2019s speech. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard these conference promises on net migration and child migrants before and they haven\u2019t come to anything \u2013 people will take them with a pinch of salt. On Theresa May\u2019s watch, net migration reached record levels. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6ab6fa93efae9832504584e714e6d380de40768\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ab6fa93efae9832504584e714e6d380de40768/0_168_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham said it sounded as if Theresa May had a hand in drafting Rudd\u2019s speech.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAmber Rudd is right to introduce a scheme to help communities address the pressures of migration, as Jeremy Corbyn called for last week. But she had depressingly little to say about the largest humanitarian crisis since the second world war and failed to repeat the commitment to taking a share of adult refugees.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Directors also expressed disappointment at Rudd\u2019s announcement. \u201cThere are different ways to control immigration and we should see Brexit as a chance to design a system which addresses local concerns, without damaging business or universities,\u201d said Seamus Nevin, the institute\u2019s head of employment and skills.</p> <p>\u201cStaying on the current course will end up satisfying no one. Net immigration will likely stay above 100,000, while firms and the public sector struggle to fill skills gaps, making it harder for them to navigate the uncertainty of the coming Brexit negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing a fringe event, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, hinted that employers might be obliged in any future work permit system to seek a British national to fill a job before they could employ someone from overseas.</p> <p>\u201cMy job is not to write immigration policy,\u201d Davis said in answer to a question on the worries among businesses about finding sufficient unskilled labour. \u201cMy job is to get the powers back here so we can decide. That is the first thing to understand. Once you do that, the government will make its decision on how it runs its immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>Davis said that any solution would not be immediate and would be up to May and Rudd. He said: \u201cIf they go down a route of having work permits for example, typically the way work permits work in other countries is you get to say, try to get a British citizen first and, if you haven\u2019t, then you have got to do that first. There will be tests like that.</p> <p>\u201cBut the other side of this is we have to make sure that our own population are ready and equipped to work, whether it is low-skilled work \u2013 and that is about motivation and about commitment to work. If it is higher skilled it is about education, which is why the other part of Theresa\u2019s concerns about society are very important in this context. But at the end of the day nobody is going to have an off switch.\u201d</p>",

This month we want your artworks that show visions of majesty \u2013 and who better for inspiration than James Thornhill, whose Painted Hall for the Old Royal Naval College in London, is one of the great unsung wonders of British art.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/community/gallery/2016/sep/02/good-thinking-your-art-on-the-theme-of-knowledge\">Good thinking:  your art on the theme of knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thornhill created the epic series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/02/greenwich-painted-hall-restoration-naval-college\">paintings for the hall</a> between 1707 and 1726. Although he was knighted by George I, and kicked off the British painting tradition of the 18th century, he tends to be remembered as the father-in-law of William Hogarth.</p> <p>A new exhibition I\u2019ve helped to curate aims to address this. A <a href=\"https://www.ornc.org/Event/thornhill\">Great and Noble Design</a> explores the story of Thornhill and the Painted Hall through numerous preparatory sketches made by the artist, including rarely seen original drawings. They provide abundant proof of his abilities as a draughtsman and skilful improviser. Thornhill\u2019s facility with pen and wash are reminiscent, in some respects, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/10/renaissance-architecture\">Inigo Jones</a>, born roughly 100 years before. Both men designed for theatres, and demonstrated confident handling of architecture. Unlike Jones, however, Thornhill\u2019s drawings show a consistent mastery of perspective, and he used innovative techniques such as the convention in architectural drawing known as the laid-out wall elevation, where each face of a building is laid flat around the floor plan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c2f1a993c5b48690640b215e130e90846119d5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c2f1a993c5b48690640b215e130e90846119d5b/0_0_742_927/400.jpg\" alt=\"James Thornhill\u2019s central oval at the Painted Hall,1707-08.

Photograph: Old Royal Naval College</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Old Royal Naval College</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The little-known Painted Hall sketches are art objects in their own right, but they are also vital evidence. We can piece together the way the artist conceived this opulent and complex work, and how he deftly adapted its iconography in response to the fast-moving politics of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustan_literature\">Augustan age</a>.</p> <p>The Painted Hall was highly praised by contemporaries. In his history of 18th-century British architecture, published in the early part of the century, Colen Campbell declared of the lower hall ceiling: \u201cHere Foreigners may view with Amaze, our Countrymen with Pleasure, and all with Admiration, the Beauty, the Force, the Majesty of a British Pencil! Rich in Invention, correct in Design, noble in Disposition, in Execution admirable.\u201d</p> <p>As early as the 1720s, however, tastes were changing, and mural painting began to be derided as vulgar. But hopefully we can revive some of the passion and emotion evoked by Campbell in 1715, and restore to Thornhill the honour and esteem his immediate contemporaries clearly felt for him.</p> <p>So with Thornhill\u2019s sheer brio and vision in mind, please submit your work on the theme of majesty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c8923f2aca38c92effcbd4a658eba9f9993cbc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c8923f2aca38c92effcbd4a658eba9f9993cbc7/0_0_3000_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A conserver clean a section of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral painted by James Thornhill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A conserver clean a section of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London, which was painted by James Thornhill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><strong>How to share your artwork</strong></strong></h2> <p>Share an image of your artwork via <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwitness.guardian.co.uk%2F&amp;ei=aCD6Ub-BOYTY0QXfo4CYCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNExLL0b8-w97kDOG255cFwccvrrJQ&amp;sig2=cqgHLUCzLdan0HyToN2Ggw&amp;bvm=bv.50165853,d.d2k\">GuardianWitness</a>, by clicking the blue \u201ccontribute\u201d button on this page, or via the <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/apps\">Android or iPhone app</a>.

  "<p>He is out-Trumping Trump.

Now he\u2019s spewing nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>But this is not a simple narrative of hero-turned-crackpot. From another perspective, Giuliani is merely reverting to his old self, albeit in more extreme form, and 9/11 was the exception that proves the rule. Under the headline, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-2016-214207\">\u201cIs Rudy Giuliani Losing His Mind?\u201d</a>, the Politico website argued: \u201cEven in New York, \u2018America\u2019s Mayor\u2019 was always a lot more like Trump than people realized.

At the convention in Cleveland he roared, waved his arms theatrically and proclaimed that Trump loves \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/19/rudy-giulianis-exceptionally-enthusiastic-denunciation-of-hillary-clinton-annotated/\">all people, from the top to the bottom</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Lambasting Clinton, against whom he holds a grudge, he has accused the media of ignoring \u201cseveral signs of illness by her\u201d. He described Trump\u2019s pitch to African Americans in Milwaukee as \u201cthe best speech that any Republican, at the least, has ever given\u201d.</p> <p>Last week he claimed that Trump beat Clinton in the first debate and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/nyregion/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump.html\">told an interviewer</a> that the Democrat is \u201ctoo stupid to be president\u201d, because of her defence of Bill Clinton\u2019s extramarital cheating.</p> <p>Then, on last Sunday\u2019s political TV shows, he reacted to the report that Trump declared a $916m loss on his 1995 income tax returns, which could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any taxes for up to 18 years. \u201cThe man\u2019s a genius,\u201d Giuliani said on Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cHe knows how to operate the tax code for the people that he\u2019s serving.\u201d</p> <p>Over on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd asked Giuliani if he was \u201cthe right person\u201d to bring up <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/bill_clinton/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Bill Clinton</a>\u2019s past infidelities. \u201cYou have your own infidelities, sir,\u201d Todd said.</p> <p>Giuliani shot back: \u201cEverybody does.

Rich Galen, a Republican strategist and former press secretary to Dan Quayle, said: \u201cI think he\u2019s gone off the rails. I hadn\u2019t paid much attention until his shrieking at the Republican convention. He\u2019s like the guitarist in This Is Spinal Tap going up to 11, except he\u2019s going up to 12.\u201d</p> <p>Galen added: \u201cHe was always pretty brash but this is a different level of disconnect. Calling Trump a \u2018genius\u2019 for losing $900m a year: I don\u2019t understand how you ever get to that point.\u201d</p> <p>The reality is that, before 9/11, Giuliani was already a troubled individual with a suspect record. In 1992, as a mayoral candidate,<a href=\"http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/rudys-racist-rants-nypd-history-lesson\"> he egged on thousands of predominantly white off-duty police officers</a> in a huge New York riot that saw innocent people attacked, property vandalised and city hall occupied. Giuliani reportedly stood on top of a car while denouncing Mayor David Dinkins, an African American, through a bullhorn.</p> <p>He succeeded Dinkins in 1994. Violent crime dropped by 56% during the eight years he served as mayor, although <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2007/sep/01/how-much-credit-giuliani-due-fighting-crime/\">it had begun falling three years before he took office</a> and reflected a wider trend in big cities across the country. There were also consequences to Giuliani\u2019s tough-on-crime approach.</p> <p>In 1999, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/05/nyregion/officers-in-bronx-fire-41-shots-and-an-unarmed-man-is-killed.html\">Amadou Diallo</a>, an unarmed immigrant from Guinea, was shot 41 times by police while reaching for his wallet. A year later, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/opinion/editorial-observer-the-mayor-can-defuse-the-dorismond-case.html\">Patrick Dorismond</a>, an unarmed 26-year-old security guard, was shot dead after a brief struggle outside a cocktail bar; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/20/nyregion/giuliani-cites-criminal-past-of-slain-man.html\">Giuliani attacked Dorismond\u2019s reputation</a> and released part of his juvenile police record, as if to imply that he got his just desserts.</p> <p>Like Trump, Giuliani has been married three times and has a chequered personal life. In 2000, following an affair, he told the media before his wife that he would seek a separation from her.</p> <p>An article on Politico last month contended: \u201cIt might seem like this summer has marked a sad break with that old Rudy, or proved him a sellout. But if you\u2019ve followed Giuliani\u2019s career, in fact it\u2019s clear he swallowed the whole Trump persona many years ago \u2013 the race-baiting, the law-and-order pose, the incessant lying used to both steal credit and avoid responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this summer isn\u2019t a crackup: It\u2019s the inevitable, supernova explosion of what long ago became one of the most toxic and overrated political careers in our history.\u201d</p> <p>If he was speaking on behalf of a conventional candidate, such behaviour could be severely damaging. With Trump, however, it is all of a piece. <a href=\"http://www.hoover.org/profiles/lanhee-j-chen\">Lanhee Chen</a>, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s hurting anything because he\u2019s not saying anything more outlandish than the nominee himself. If the nominee was Mitt Romney, it would be a problem because it would be a surrogate gone rogue.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIn 2012 he was a good surrogate, as far as I can tell, and we can continue to admire him for his work on 9/11. I\u2019m not sure who the real Rudy Giuliani is.\u201d</p>",

What were you doing on 14 July?</strong><br><strong>C:</strong> Waiting for the premiere! I was talking about it the whole day. My friend asked me: \u201cDo you wanna ride bikes today?\u201d And I was like, \u201cBud, uh, I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019ll wait until Stranger Things has been on.\u201d I was <em>so</em> excited. <br><strong>G:</strong> I had a party. They said it was going to air at midnight, but we forgot to take into account that Netflix is an LA-based company, and I live on the east coast, so really it didn\u2019t air until 3am. But everyone stayed. I was the only lasting survivor who made it through the entire eight episodes without falling asleep.</p> <p><strong>You binge-watched your own show?</strong><br><strong>G:</strong> I did! I mean, even I was starting to fall asleep \u2013 and it was my show.</p> <p><strong>Between you, your previous roles have included Jesus and Simba from The Lion King (1). Who, out of Simba and Jesus, would win in a fight?</strong><br><strong>C:</strong> Well, Simba is a lion.<br><strong>G: </strong>A lion <em>cub</em>, I might add. I\u2019m going to say Jesus. I mean, a lion? He probably hugged a lion before, didn\u2019t he?<br><strong>C:</strong> I think Simba would see Jesus and just hug him anyway, and they\u2019d go off into the sunset. Then go and lay on the beach together. <br><strong>G:</strong> They\u2019d go out for ice-cream. Jesus is not a fighter. <br><strong>C:</strong> But if he has to, he will. <br><strong>G: </strong>We\u2019re going for Jesus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb7c050fc9eea31a781c60aa568918471d05e767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb7c050fc9eea31a781c60aa568918471d05e767/561_0_3523_2115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stranger Things stillsCaleb McLaughlin (far left) and Gaten Matarazzo (far right) with Finn Wolfhard and Millie Bobby Brown in Stranger Things.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caleb McLaughlin (far left) and Gaten Matarazzo (far right) with Finn Wolfhard and Millie Bobby Brown in Stranger Things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is the whole show just an elaborate attempt to get the world interested in </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory\"><strong>string theory</strong></a><strong> (2)?</strong><br><strong>G:</strong> They were just trying to make a story, and make an original show that has a background of when the people who watch it were kids themselves. They wanted to make a good show that wasn\u2019t just [rolls eyes] \u201cbased on a true story\u201d or \u201cbased on a film\u201d. Their goal was not, I think, to get people interested in string theory. <br><strong>C:</strong> Although, when I see other movies with, like, school, and physics, and sciences and stuff, it gives me the confidence to think: \u201cI want to learn more, I want to be a scientist.\u201d I felt like we gave that to some kids. <br><strong>G:</strong> Yeah, and now kids are saying, \u201cI want to go on an adventure. I want to go and ride my bike outside.\u201d</p> <p><strong>If an entire generation had its phones taken away for a year, and could only play </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons\"><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong></a><strong>, how would that change society?</strong><br><strong>C:</strong> Oh, God. Society would be harmed.<br><strong>G:</strong> Kids are so accustomed to technology that it\u2019s upsetting to watch them without their phones. They don\u2019t know what to do. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m like that, too \u2013 if I get my phone taken away because I\u2019m grounded, I don\u2019t know what to do. So I just have to sit in my room and stare blankly at the ceiling.</p> <p><strong>Well, that\u2019s an opportunity to think about what you\u2019ve done.</strong><br><strong>G:</strong> Yep. It\u2019s just stuff like, er, my mom catching me playing video games at 2am. <br><strong>C: </strong>But when you play games such as Call of Duty, things like your thinking process and your rea\u2014<br><strong>G:</strong> Reaction time?<br><strong>C:</strong> Shut up!</p> <p><strong>To be fair, Caleb, that <em>was</em> a quick reaction to the point you were about to make, so it does prove your point.</strong><br><strong>G:</strong> Exactly.<br><strong>C: </strong>Yes.

If Dustin were to go, I\u2019d like it to be a situation where one person has to stay behind, or one person has to distract something, and I\u2019d like Dustin to volunteer to do that. A noble act.

But it\u2019s been pretty cool, and I love that people take the time out of their day to come up to me. <br><strong>G:</strong> It\u2019s very flattering. I\u2019m a kid who grew up in a small town and started acting when he was seven for no reason, and got lucky. Sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. I feel like some people, especially child stars, act out because they don\u2019t know how to handle the pressure. Unless people are in the shoes of a child actor they don\u2019t realise how difficult it can be at times.

  "<p>With his bike in its usual place against the wall and a pile of broccoli trimmings on the next table, Augusto spreads three architect\u2019s plans over one of the as-yet unset tables outside his trattoria in Testaccio. The first of the plans he shows me is of his family\u2019s land just outside the town of Santa Lucia. It is mostly situated in the region of Abruzzo, but, because of the regional lines drawn up under Mussolini in 1927, a small area is in Lazio. The second plan is of his home town itself, Santa Lucia in <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Amatrice,+Province+of+Rieti,+Italy/@42.5543299,13.2058317,12.73z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x132e3c0a934e9213:0x4094f9ab239b290!8m2!3d42.6116801!4d13.2894368\">Montereale</a>. He points to his family house, which is still standing \u2013 just. This is not the case for much of the small, ancient village, wiped out by a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/italy-earthquake-rescue-teams-dig-through-rubble-as-death-toll-rises\"> 6.2 magnitude earthquake</a> that hit central Italy in the early hours of 24 August this summer. <br></p> <p>Like many such towns, depleted as people left to find work, Santa Lucia is sparsely populated with only a few full-time inhabitants. Miraculously, none were killed. However, 6km away, in Amatrice in Lazio, 295 people lost their lives; the exquisite medieval town, dense and vulnerable, reduced to a pile of rubble. The same with nearby Pescara del Tronto, the home town of Augusto\u2019s chef Enrico. As Matteo the waiter flicks cloths before laying them on tables, Augusto taps his finger insistently on the third plan showing clusters of tiny villages, many of them no more, the heart of Italy ruptured by its seismically active Apennine spine. \u201c<em>Terribile, terribile, infernale,</em>\u201d Augusto says.</p> <p>I was in England on the day of the earthquake. Friends and family in Rome, nearly 100 miles away from the epicentre, felt a deep, sliding judder, like a fall in a dream that wakes you up with a sickening jolt. My partner, Vincenzo, was also out of Rome, but two days later the band he plays with drove back down to Abruzzo to play a concert. As in much of Italy and beyond, talk was of the earthquake and the numbers of lives lost, rising like an out-of-control counter \u2013 30, 130, and then almost 300. The show of solidarity was uniquely Italian, a country where place, food and culture is inextricably intertwined. The dish cooked for 8 musicians, and hundreds at the concert, was the dish named for the town of Amatrice: amatriciana.</p> <p>Back at the table, Augusto still has his finger firmly on the map. He is the one who suggested I write about amatriciana, and who, in the face of my doubts that I will be clumsy or inappropriate, reminds me that pasta unites. He is not bombastic about recipes \u2013 simply clear with an appreciation of history. Amatriciana is dish invented by shepherds, who would go high into the mountains during the transhumance with their flocks in the valley of Amatrice. They had pecorino cheese in abundance; they would also carry guanciale (cured pork jowl), dried pasta, wine and a curl of the red chilli you so often see hanging in great bunches above doorways in Abruzzo. <br></p> <p>Early amatriciana was <em>in</em> <em>bianco \u2013</em> white; sometimes called <em>alla gricia</em>. Over the years tomato was added, a tradition that was embraced when Abruzze chefs and trattoria owners brought their dish to Rome, where it settled in very nicely. The traditional pasta for amatriciana is <a href=\"http://www.rpspasta.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/hybrid-original/images/foodservice/FS_fresh_extruded_pasta/extrudedEggBucatiniFoodserviceproduct.png\">bucatini</a>, meaning \u201cpierced\u201d \u2013 which is exactly what they are: long pasta with a hole down the middle. When cooked al dente, bucatini retains its shape surprisingly well: you <em>can</em> wind it around your fork, but then it may well break loose, flapping like an unmanned hose and flicking sauce across your chin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/27/smothered-cabbage-and-sausage-recipe-rachel-roddy\">Smothered cabbages and sausage recipe | A kitchen in Rome</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guanciale is more delicate than pancetta: rich and almost sweet; qualities that make it sing here. You can make something delicious with pancetta or bacon though. I love the taste of fresh tomatoes and, while we still have some fat with summer, let\u2019s use them. Not too many though: the pasta shouldn\u2019t be drowned in red, but covered in a thin mantle of sauce studded with pork, enriched with sharp, tangy pecorino. <br></p> <p>Augusto suggests a little wine and uses the word <em>mantecare</em> (whisk) to describe the action of beating the cheese with the sauce, which is what brings everything together into a full-bodied dish. As he folds the architectural plans, smoothing the creases with his huge thumbs, he also suggests you think of your plate of amatriciana as tribute to those affected by the devastating earthquake and the long, inevitably complicated process of rebuilding.</p> <h2><strong>Augusto\u2019s bucatini all\u2019amatriciana</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>120g guanciale or pancetta<br>400g tomatoes, either fresh and ripe, or peeled and tinned without juice<br>100g pecorino <br>White wine (optional)<br>A pinch of dried red chilli<br>Salt<br>500g bucatini, spaghetti, rigatoni or <a href=\"http://www.alfrescopasta.com/uploads/products/9bc5fe55aa53998083001759a25ee7b3.jpg\">caserecce</a></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Bring a large pan of water to the boil for the pasta. Cut the guanciale into short batons. If you are using fresh tomatoes, peel them by plunging them first into boiling water \u2013 you can use the water for the pasta \u2013 then cold, at which point the skins should split and slip away. Then chop them into strips. If you are using tinned tomatoes, chop them roughly. Grate the pecorino.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> In a large frying pan over a medium-low heat, fry the guanciale so it renders its fat and is just starting to brown. If you like, add a splash of white wine and let it evaporate.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Add the tomatoes and chilli, then cook until the mixture has thickened into a rich sauce \u2013 which usually takes about 8 minutes. Taste: if the sauce is too acidic, add a little sugar.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, once the water is boiling, add salt, stir, then add the pasta. Once the pasta is cooked, either drain in a colander, saving some water, or use tongs to lift the pasta directly on to the sauce.

There's a proliferation of private museums across the world, where the super-wealthy invest in art, put tons of money in art, open up their own private art museums which are often tax havens, and then tell us that they're high minded philanthropists. Do we want them to write our history for us? And can the history of art be written in the work of a few artists who have won the popularity contest with these rich people? How do we row back against it? To realise it, to realise that public institutions are the product of a manipulated market.

The company has embraced a weapon that has grown increasingly popular across corporate America as organized labor has grown weaker: locking out workers to throw the union on the defensive and perhaps break the union\u2019s and the workers\u2019 will. </p> <p> \u201cI really think they\u2019re just trying to hold us out, to make us hungry, to make the membership fold,\u201d said Bryan Rodgers, the recording secretary of UAW Local 9 in South Bend. Honeywell has also locked out 42 UAW members at a second airline brake factory, in Green Island, New York, just north of Albany.</p> <p> Notwithstanding on-again, off-again negotiations, the company and union have been deadlocked since May. Tensions have festered and the workers have grown restive as the clashing sides continue to present vastly different views of the situation. The UAW says the airline brake factory here has fallen badly behind in keeping up with customer orders, while Honeywell insists that production is going well, better than with its unionized workforce.</p> <p> The union asserts that Honeywell should not be demanding concessions on health coverage, seniority and other matters when the company had record profits of $4.77bn last year and income in its aerospace division rose. But Honeywell says it needs to rein in costs because the aviation industry has hit some turbulence.</p> <p> \u201cThe union is ignoring the stark economic realities currently facing the global aviation industry, which has lost approximately 35,000 jobs since 2015,\u201d said Scott Sayres, a Honeywell spokesman.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t persuade John Suher Sr, a 60-year-old millwright, who is furious about the lockout. \u201cIt\u2019s basically corporate greed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to eliminate the middle class.\u201d</p> <p>The dispute\u2019s main sticking point is health coverage. Union members say Honeywell\u2019s proposal would make many of them pay several thousand dollars more each year for health coverage. They also complain that Honeywell is demanding the power to unilaterally change health coverage, premiums and deductibles without the union\u2019s approval.</p> <p> \u201cThe unilateral healthcare changes are unacceptable to us,\u201d said the UAW\u2019s Rodgers. \u201cThey want to be able to change healthcare any time they want.\u201d</p> <p>But Honeywell\u2019s Sayres defended the proposal. \u201cWe are offering the same healthcare benefits available to nearly all other Honeywell employees in the US, including those represented by unions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On a recent afternoon, Enright and DeLeon carried placards with bright red letters saying \u201cUAW Locked Out\u201d, as they stood alongside a makeshift shelter \u2013 a grey tarpaulin held up by wooden poles stuck into concrete-filled plastic buckets. A previous shelter had literally blown away during a ferocious summer storm. </p> <p> Wearing a bandanna on his head to shield him from the sun, DeLeon, a Honeywell employee for seven years, acknowledged the lockout was taking its toll. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a daughter in college, and my wife is ill. She\u2019s only got a part-time job. Between that and unemployment insurance, we\u2019re making it.\u201d</p> <p> Many workers are getting by only because they receive $390 or so in weekly unemployment insurance. But they worry about what will happen when those benefits expire in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/united-auto-workers-reject-fiat-chrysler-contract\">United Auto Workers reject Fiat Chrysler contract by wide margin</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The Honeywell workers average $22 an hour, or $45,760 a year for a full-time worker before overtime.

The company\u2019s contract offer includes a 8% raise over five years. </p> <p> The UAW has sought to turn up the pressure on Honeywell.

George Orwell, who predicated three supreme powers competing on the surface by shifting alliances, but in essence cooperating by the use of fear and thought control to share in world domination? Or should we place our trust in the Rand Corporation, America\u2019s university of imperialism, with its eponymous connection with Ayn Rand\u2019s naive philosophy of the beneficent capitalist?</p> <p>The conclusion of their recent study, which indicates a no-win situation between the two great powers (with a pre-emptive advantage to the US if it comes to actual hostilities), is truly frightening.</p> <p>If the view of unthinking think-tanks like Rand prevails, we could be about to be embroiled in an even greater crisis than we faced in the 1960s. <br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br><em>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</em></p> <h2><strong>More than books and testing</strong><br></h2> <p>Jonathan Freedland makes a good case against grammar schools <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-grammar-school-selection-middle-class\" title=\"\">(16&#xa0;September)</a> but is assuming that every child can benefit from an academic education.

  "<p>Duane Buck attended in 1997 the sentencing hearing in Texas that would seal his fate. The jury was being asked to decide whether to have him executed for killing his former girlfriend, Debra Gardner, and her friend Kenneth Butler.<br></p> <p>There was no disputing the conviction \u2013 Buck had carried out the brutal murders on 30 July 1995. Even so, he was still astonished by what he heard coming from the mouth of a so-called \u201cexpert\u201d witness.</p> <p>Walter Quijano, a then psychologist who was frequently called to testify in Texas capital trials, was asked to give his professional opinion with regards to a key issue concerning whether Buck should live or die. Under Texas law, in order to put him on death row the prosecution had to convince the jury that the prisoner posed such a danger of future violence that life imprisonment would be too risky \u2013 executing him was the only safe option.</p> <p>The prosecutor put a blunt question to Quijano: \u201cYou have determined that the race factor, black, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated reasons; is that correct?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d the expert witness replied.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s basically saying because you are black you need to die,\u201d Buck <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzjVcuKKqZY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">told his lawyers</a> a few years later, by now on the eve of his appointment with the death chamber. \u201cI felt that was strange because my lawyer didn\u2019t say nothing, and nobody else, you know, the prosecutor or the judge, nobody did.

Research by the University of Maryland criminologist Raymond Paternoster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/13/houston-texas-death-row-black-inmates\">found</a> that at the time of Buck\u2019s sentencing, prosecutors in Harris County, the jurisdiction that tried him, asked for the death penalty for black defendants at <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/616589-buck-paternoster-report.html\">three times</a> the rate of whites.</p> <p>One of the many remarkable features of the Buck case that the supreme court justices will be asked to consider is that Quijano was called upon to present his highly contentious evidence to the jury not by the prosecution but by his own defense lawyers. One of them, Jerry Guerinot, had a dubious reputation for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/us/18bar.html\">losing death penalty cases</a> on behalf of his defendant clients, having seen no fewer than 20 death sentences notched up against him. </p> <p>Guerinot and his co-defense attorney Danny Easterling decided to call on Quijano to give evidence at Buck\u2019s sentencing trial even though the psychologist had plainly stated in a pre-trial report seen by them that being black was a \u201cstatistical factor\u201d that \u201cincreased the probability\u201d the prisoner would commit further acts of criminal violence. \u201cRace. Black. Increased probability\u201d of future dangerousness, was how the \u201cexpert\u201d pithily put it.</p> <p>The defense counsel went on to request \u2013 against the objection of prosecutors \u2013 that the same report by Quijano be put into the record and thus made available to the jury as they deliberated their sentence. In the course of two days of deliberations, the jury asked to see files that included the psychologist\u2019s report, before duly sentencing Buck to death.</p> <p>Buck\u2019s lawyers will argue in front of the US supreme court that the decision of the defense attorneys to present Quijano to the jury amounted to an astonishingly glaring example of ineffective counsel. \u201cMr Buck\u2019s lawyers not only injected racial bias into his capital trial, they appealed to the uniquely pernicious stereotype that \u2018blacks are violence prone\u2019,\u201d the petition says.<br></p> <p>As a further twist in the case, a few years after Buck was assigned the death penalty, the then attorney general of Texas, John Cornyn (now a US senator for the state), publicly admitted that a breach of constitutional law had occurred in seven separate cases. In each of them, Quijano had been called upon to present his racially discriminatory view that being black was an indicator of potential violence. <br></p> <p>Cornyn promised that the state would allow re-sentencing hearings in each of the seven cases. The state of Texas honored that promise in all the cases bar one: that of Buck.</p> <p>\u201cThe people of Texas want and deserve a system that affords the same fairness to everyone,\u201d Cornyn said at the time he revealed that racial prejudice had infected the judicial process.

So we\u2019re working on hardware that furthers that goal,\u201d said Mikal Greaves, Facebook\u2019s mechanical and power manager, who took more than a dozen journalists on a tour of the facility, dubbed Area 404, this week.</p> <p>The name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/3333\">common website \u201cpage not found\u201d error message</a>. Facebook\u2019s engineering teams have been pushing for a space to collaborate and build prototypes more quickly, and now that space is \u201cfound\u201d.</p> <p>There are two main parts to the space: electrical engineering labs and prototyping workshops. The former allows for the construction and testing of specialized circuit boards. The latter features more heavy duty machinery such as 3D printers, waterjet cutting machines that can slice through thick slabs of metal, industrial lathes and multi-axis CNC (Computer Numeric Control) milling machines that can carve intricate objects from large aluminium blocks. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/28/google-facebook-amazon-ibm-microsoft-partnership-on-ai-tech-firms\">'Partnership on AI' formed by Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bulk of the work appears involve making prototypes of next-generation servers, storage devices, networking equipment and power systems for the company\u2019s data centers.

Previously we used to have our manufacturing partners making parts for us. They can certainly make them, but it takes longer than we would like. By bringing it in-house we\u2019ve shortened that development time,\u201d said Greaves. </p> <p>He cites the example of the company\u2019s HapiLink system (short for high-altitude platform internet link), which uses high bandwidth lasers to deliver connectivity from drones. Almost all of the components, with the exception of the carbon fiber casing, can now be built in Area 404. \u201cIt saves us weeks to months,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Once the prototypes are made and tested, they are passed on to manufacturing partners to mass-produce. At least they will be. Nothing produced in the lab\u2019s first two months has reached the manufacturing stage yet. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"059290371223e77ae5e983bb365d9a38d254a53e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/059290371223e77ae5e983bb365d9a38d254a53e/0_0_2016_1512/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook Area 404\u2019s Spencer Burns demonstrates the waterjet cutting machine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facebook Area 404\u2019s Spencer Burns demonstrates the waterjet cutting machine</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Solon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Canadian CNC model maker Spencer Burns, who previously worked at Tesla, talks about the computer-controlled prototyping equipment like a kid in a candy store.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m one of the fortunate people who get to work in this lab full time and work with these really cool machine tools,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He explained that even the floor of the space was an impressive feat of engineering.

It\u2019s merely a dress rehearsal for making a beautiful but pointless trinket. </p> <p>At that point it becomes clear that although Facebook has allowed journalists into this inner sanctum in the spirit of openness, it\u2019s been little more than an elaborate fan dance \u2013 a tantalizing performance that hinted at the company\u2019s capabilities but didn\u2019t give anything away.</p>",

  "<p>In 1930, France celebrated the 100th anniversary of the annexation of Algeria, claiming it as one of its own territories after a century of bloodshed on a huge scale, writing one of the most horrific chapters in colonial history in blood and ashes. But even if they had been wiped out on the battlefield, the Algerian people refused to fade away. They needed to rediscover a way of being visible that would remind their conquerors that they were still there. On paintings and in photographs, the Algerian was presented in rags; virtually part of a landscape as pitiful as it was picturesque. It couldn\u2019t be further from the image of the intrepid warrior, majestic on his horse, his gun held aloft and his burnous catching the wind like a banner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/22/france.world\">Mohammed Moulessehoul, the real  'Yasmina Khadra'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How to rid themselves of this cliche? With sport! Only sport could redeem their lustre of yesteryear.</p> <p>First there was football. Teams of Muslim players looked forward to a time when they could take on their invaders, and their skills, dribbles and tackles light up the stands. But it was boxing, more than anything, that thrilled the Algerians. If, in football stadiums, the stands kept the different communities apart, the ring almost sealed them in; Algerians and Europeans, finally side by side, stuck together in those overheated rooms.</p> <p>This is why I wanted to write the story of my fictional, exceptional boxer Turambo, who is an incarnation of all the Arab-Berber champions who bought pride to the region after the humiliating defeats of the invasions. Unaware of it themselves, the boxers were showing the Algerian people that they could still fight the good fight, and that even if the French government was sovereign, it was neither invincible, nor invulnerable.</p> <p>The Angels Die was, for me, an opportunity to revisit a time that I feel has been unjustly ignored by writers and historians as a decisive moment for the destiny of Algeria. From the 1930s onwards, Algerian nationalism was beginning to reap the fruit of its labours. But while 8 May 1945 is celebrated as a day of freedom in Europe, it is a day of mourning for my people, as VE Day also marked the start of a bloody repression of the Algerian people by the French army: it is estimated that as many as 45,000 people died in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9tif_and_Guelma_massacre\">S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre</a>, and the shelling of the town of Kherrata (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/05/200841013384337401.html\">European estimates sit between 15,000-20,000</a>).</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t write this book to tell the story of that tragedy. My novel is first and foremost the story of a man searching for his path, torn between his need to create a legend, and his desire to fall in love. The Angels Die is a saga, a journey through a land of many battles: a battle against himself, against life\u2019s absurdity, and especially a battle for love, the only miracle in man\u2019s purgatory. It wasn\u2019t on a whim that I chose to name the parts of my novel after the female characters. I believe in love, in what a woman has to offer to those seeking redemption. Women are the only hope that we have in this world. Those that manage to capture that hope, who try to earn it: they are the ones who will have found salvation. All my work as a writer has convinced me that this is true. I am a person who owes the foundation of their success to the love of a woman. Turambo never truly knows this, but he feels it deep down.</p> <p>I wrote this novel to pay tribute to a country that could have been a paradise for all, if everyone had known how to share. Of all of my novels, The Angels Die has probably moved me the most. It is still my favourite, perhaps because, like me, it chases after love in a hostile world.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I owe my nickname to the shopkeeper in Graba.</p> <p>The first time he saw me enter his lair, he looked me up and down, shocked by the state I was in and the way I smelt, and asked me if I came from the earth or the night. I was in bad shape, half dead from diarrhoea and exhaustion as a result of a long forced march across scrubland.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m from Turambo, sir.\u2019</p> <p>The shopkeeper smacked his lips, which were as thick as a buffalo frog\u2019s. The name of my village meant nothing to him.</p> <p>\u2018Turambo? Which side of hell is that on?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t know, sir. I need half a douro\u2019s worth of yeast and I\u2019m in a hurry.\u2019</p> <p>The shopkeeper turned to his half-empty shelves and, holding his chin between his thumb and index finger, repeated, \u2018Turambo? Turambo? Never heard of it.\u2019</p> <p>From that day on, whenever I passed his shop, he\u2019d cry out, \u2018Hey, Turambo! Which side of hell is your village on?\u2019 His voice carried such a long way that gradually everyone started calling me Turambo. </p> <p>My village had been wiped off the map by a landslide a week earlier. It was like the end of the world. Wild lightning flashes streaked the darkness, and the thunder seemed to be trying to smash the mountains to pieces. You couldn\u2019t tell men from animals anymore; they were all tearing in every direction, screaming like creatures possessed. In a few hours, the torrents of rain had swept away our hovels, our goats and donkeys, our cries and prayers, and all our landmarks. By morning, apart from the survivors shivering on the mud covered rocks, nothing remained of the village. My father had vanished into thin air.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about the book</h2> <p>The book \u2013 set in Oran in the 1920s and 1930s \u2013 unveils a harsh picture of colonial life in Algeria: cacophonous streets, squalor, violence and destitution alongside luxury, with the Arabs dismissed as little better than animals by their European overlords. You feel a pang for the boy when an official points out, with condescending amusement, that the village he\u2019s named after was not Turambo, but Arthur-Rimbaud, mispronounced by the illiterate peasants. There are ominous hints here of the hatred that would later explode into the bloody war of independence.<strong> \u2013 Lee Langley, <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/08/the-angels-die-spares-no-punches/\">the Spectator</a></strong></p> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>The Angels Die by Yasmina Khadra, translated by Howard Curtis, is out now, published by Gallic Books for \u00a38.99. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/angels-die.html\">It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a37.37</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Authorities in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut are considering new regulations on marine tourism after the first successful voyage of a mammoth luxury liner through the North-West Passage.<br></p> <p>Nearly three football fields in length, the 13-deck Crystal Serenity docked in Manhattan last month after a 32-day voyage that saw it become the largest cruise ship to sail the once impenetrable passage. Staffed by more than 600 crew members and at times accompanied by an icebreaker ship and two helicopters, the cruise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard\">capitalised on rising temperatures and steadily receding sea ice</a> to navigate the frigid Arctic waters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard\">A new Titanic? US and Canada prepare for worst as luxury Arctic cruise sets sail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sold-out voyage left authorities in Canada\u2019s north bracing for a boom in tourism. \u201cNow that marine tourism is a significant and steadily growing presence in the territory,\u201d said Bernie MacIsaac of Nunavut\u2019s department of economic development, \u201cit is important that new legislation be created that will effectively regulate the sector.\u201d</p> <p>As the Serenity made its way through largely uncharted waters, the cruise\u2019s more than 1,000 passengers \u2013 each of whom paid between $22,000 (C$29,000) and $120,000 (C$157,000) \u2013 stopped in at several Inuit villages for a glimpse of Arctic life.</p> <p>The itinerary included Cambridge Bay, population 1,500. Although the hamlet has been a regular stop on the northern cruise ship circuit for more than two decades, the Serenity eclipsed the small cruise vessels that have previously stopped there, said Vicki Aitaok, a local tour operator who coordinated the visit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know how it would impact us or how we would feel about the day.\u201d </p> <p>More than two years of planning went into the visit, during which tourists were brought in on Zodiac inflatable boats in groups of 150 so as not to overwhelm residents. The passengers \u2013 regaled with drum dancers, throat singers and the creations of local artisans \u2013 left more than C$100,000 in the community. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of employment opportunities in the community when the cruise ships come here,\u201d said Aitaok. \u201cAll the money stays in the community.\u201d </p> <p>The visit clearly demonstrated the role the burgeoning Arctic tourism industry can play in the region, said Aitaok \u2013 but within limits. The Serenity pulled into the hamlet just a day after another ship had visited, leaving many residents exhausted. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many people here,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us here, because we have such minimal resources, we need at least a day between each ship.\u201d</p> <p>Most communities in Nunavut have between 500 and 3,000 residents, said the government of Nunavut\u2019s MacIsaac, meaning visits by large cruise ships risk significantly disrupting daily life. \u201cThese types of disruptions must be mitigated and one way to do that is through regulations.\u201d</p> <p>Prospective rules being considered include limiting the number of passengers who can disembark in a community at a time or forcing ships to provide passengers with visitor guidelines.</p> <p>Authorities are mindful of the need to strike a balance between regulating tourists and ensuring communities can maximise the benefits of mass tourism. \u201cMore passengers visiting a community means more carvings, prints and other crafts are purchased, which means a substantially larger economic impact on a community from a single ship visit,\u201d said MacIsaac. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f358679396e69224af26f244101f5e149c03fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f358679396e69224af26f244101f5e149c03fd/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crystal Serenity with 1,000 passengers on board rides at anchor just outside Nome, Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crystal Serenity with 1,000 passengers on board rides at anchor just outside Nome, Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thiessen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Echoing a conundrum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2016/sep/27/dont-look-now-venice-tourists-locals-sick-of-you-cruise-liners\">facing tourist destinations around the world,</a> the government is also grappling with how best to ensure that cruise ship visits are worthwhile for the host community, he said. \u201cSeveral communities have expressed concerns that they are not receiving adequate economic return to warrant the amount of effort involved with cruise ship visits.\u201d </p> <p>Regulations being mulled include forcing cruise ship operators to report regularly to the government on what their passengers leave behind in each community they visit, he said. \u201cThis will allow the government to track the economic impact of ship visits and to shape policy accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>The tourist boom comes just as Inuit are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/10/paris-climate-change-talks-arctic-inuit-youth-cop21\">struggling to contend</a> with the effects of climate change, said Okalik Eegeesiak, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. \u201cIn 2015, about 200,000 people went to the Arctic on cruise ships,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The Serenity took care to mitigate its environmental impact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/inuit-arctic-ecosystem-extinction-tourism-crystal-serenity\">burning low-sulphur fuel and maintaining tight controls </a>on the ship\u2019s air, water and rubbish discharges. But the steadily growing industry, if not properly managed, could jeopardise the very ecosystem that is attracting the tourists. </p> <p>Many Inuit want to see more stringent controls of marine traffic in the Arctic, said Eegeesiak: \u201cWe\u2019re all worried about the potential for a disaster that will affect our livelihood, our food sources.\u201d</p> <p>The risks facing the industry were laid bare in 2010, after a small cruise ship carrying 128 passengers struck an uncharted rock shelf in the North-West Passage. It took 40 hours for a Canadian icebreaker to reach and evacuate the ship\u2019s passengers. The Canadian coast guard later filed a lawsuit seeking almost half a million dollars in damages over pollution, claiming that 13 tanks aboard the ship \u2013 holding fuel, freshwater and sludge \u2013 were breached during the grounding. </p> <p>The idea of mass tourism in the Arctic, said Eegeesiak, is woefully out of step with the region\u2019s glaring lack of infrastructure and limited capacity for search and rescue. \u201cOnce a disaster happens, it will have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd is that the only time we\u2019re going to say we should have done it better.\u201d </p>",

The librarians had so much knowledge and would direct you to the right place to find the book you wanted whether it be for a school project or for leisure,\u201d she said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/feb/06/library-visitors-austerity-job-applications-loneliness\">For many library visitors, I'm the only person they've talked to all day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Coventry <a href=\"http://coventryobserver.co.uk/news/libraries-basic-human-right-say-campaign-group-petition-handed-council/\">plans are afoot to close libraries and hand them to volunteers to run</a>, and it\u2019s even been suggested by the council that everything should be <a href=\"http:// http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/could-coventrys-libraries-go-online-11755931\">put online</a> and have users order books and then pick them up from lockers. Sarah Smith, a library user and campaigner from Coventry, told me that since August two out of the area\u2019s 17 libraries have closed, with a further five earmarked to close, and another five set to become \u2018<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/41/community_and_living/2651/connecting_communities/2\">partnership libraries</a>\u2019 - run by groups of volunteers.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be left with five libraries in the whole of Coventry. But let\u2019s be clear the provision will be massively reduced. Libraries are so much more than spaces for books, they are safe spaces for children and adults,\u201d she said. </p> <h2>The fightback continues</h2> <p>These are just a few examples; there are countless more. The bigger picture is that libraries are part of the social glue that binds us. They offer recourse to the law, they offer access to educational opportunities, they empower us and ideally they provide a safe, trusted and non-commercial public space, and they help to foster democratic involvement. All major reasons for keeping them but sadly also major reasons for cutting them. </p> <p>The situation facing public libraries in the UK is definitely a crisis and emphatically not an opportunity; unless perhaps you\u2019re a private company or a consultant. But there are protests and petitions taking place up and down the UK, and more than <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/authors-urge-call-library-action-398621\">300 authors have signed a letter</a> to the culture secretary urging her to set a new course for libraries.

  "<p>Leading shares have broken through the 7000 barrier for the first time since May 2015 as a plunge in the pound to a new 31 year low boosts the exporter-heavy FTSE 100.</p> <p>Banking shares are also receiving some support from a revival in <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>. After a market holiday in Germany on Monday, the bank\u2019s shares have reopened up 2.55% on hopes that it will not have to pay as much as the $14bn demanded by the US Department of Justice in fines related to mortgage mis-selling.</p> <p>So <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> is up 17.3p at 651.5p, <strong>Barclays</strong> is 2.1p better at 170.3p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has risen 2.3p to 181.6p.</p> <p>But the biggest riser in the leading index is <strong>Pearson</strong>, up more than 6% to 811p as analysts at Morgan Stanley dismissed suggestions the education specialist could issue a profit warning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Down 25% from its highs and with an around 10% 2018 free cashflow yield versus a PE of 10 times the market is expecting another profits warning. We don\u2019t think Pearson will warn, meaning the shares could recover sharply on the third quarter results.</p> </blockquote> <p>In more detail the bank spelled out why it thinks Pearson shares are too cheap:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>(i) Pearson cut market expectations by \u00a335m-\u00a375m pre restructuring (and \u00a3355m-\u00a3395m post restructuring) in January. This covers a multitude of sins.</p> <p>(ii) Pearson\u2019s EBITA forecasts have a lot of flex allowing, for instance, an increase of \u00a3110m in incentive compensation in 2016 \u2013 18% of expected EBITA.</p> <p>(iii) Pearson strongly reiterated its 2016-18 guidance at the first half figures and has not rescinded it in subsequent public appearances, the most recent being September 21.</p> <p>(iv) There is better trading elsewhere at Pearson with good growth in the digital businesses and better than expected contract wins in Assessment. </p> <p>v) 2017 is an inevitable upswing year in US schools with a better environment in US Higher Education (enrolments close to flat) and US and UK assessment.</p> <p>(vi) With 66% of sales in the US and sub 10% in the UK, Pearson is a play on Brexit nervousness.</p> <p>(vii) We think Pearson won\u2019t warn at the third quarter (end October), the peak trading period. Given the underperformance, low rating and big dividend yield \u2013 almost 7% \u2013 we think the shares will bounce strongly on this. </p> </blockquote> <p>Testing equipment group <strong>Intertek</strong> has also received some broker support. Its shares have jumped 166p to \u00a337.08 after Jefferies raised its recommendation from underperform to buy on the basis of strong growth and possible acquisition activity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our analysis of margin levers provides a strong case for profit growth faster than revenues, while strong free cashflow allows us to now formally model M&amp;A. We upgrade 2017 earnings per share by 10% of which 6% is underlying. Growth and margins in the main division - Products - look well supported by secular drivers. Double upgrade to buy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently up 88.30 points at 7071.82, with UK construction data also giving some support by coming in stronger than expected.</p> <p>The pound\u2019s new slide comes after UK prime minister Theresa May set the clock ticking on Brexit negotiations, and suggested the focus would be on immigration controls rather than the single market. Financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> It seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline (with March set to go down in the history books as when Article 50 was triggered), and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market. </p> </blockquote> <p>Domestic focussed stocks and defensive shares were under pressure, with <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> down 2.2p at 323.8p and<strong> National Grid</strong> 2.5p lower at 1099.5p.<br></p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Henderson Group</strong> is down 5.3p at 265.4p after Monday\u2019s surge in the wake of <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/janus-henderson-to-have-headquarters-in-london\">its proposed merger with Janus Capital,</a></strong> but specialist lender <strong>Onesavings</strong> has added 15.3p to 284p after Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight with a price target lifted from 235p to 340p.</p> <p>Continuing merger hopes among the mid-caps have helped the FTSE 250 soar to a new peak, up 1.6% to 18,474.70. Ian Williams, economist at Peel Hunt, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s quite a big chunk of globally diverse companies in that group [the FTSE 250] as well, and an agreed takeover bid for one of its constituents has helped... For foreign investors who are looking at sterling-denominated assets, they are continuing to get a bit cheaper.</p> </blockquote>",

The move, along with protections for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/11/shark-species-greater-protection-finning\">five other sharks</a> at the previous Cites summit in 2013, suggest the tide is turning for sharks. </p> <p>About <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/01/100-million-sharks-killed-each-year\">100 million sharks are killed every year</a>, driven by a $1bn annual trade, and only a fraction have had any protection. Many of the predators are now among the most threatened creatures on the planet. But the new action by Cites has doubled to 20% the proportion of sharks targeted by the fin trade that are now regulated.</p> <p>All the species protected by Cites on Monday are slow to mature and produce only a small number of pups at a time, making them particularly vulnerable to overexploitation.</p> <p>The silky shark is now one of the most common fins seen in Hong Kong, the centre of the trade. \u201cThey have shot up and they are getting this huge pounding,\u201d said Luke Warwick, from the Pew Charitable Trusts. </p> <p>Thresher sharks have long sweeping tails, which they use to corral and stun their prey, and are particularly popular with divers. The big eye thresher had been hit particularly hard, but Cites also protected the two other thresher species. Where data is available, thresher and silky shark numbers have dropped 70-90% in recent decades.</p> <p>Devil rays can grow up to five metres wide and be a tonne in weight, but are harmless plankton-feeders. They swim slowly in groups, so are very easy to catch. Their gill plates have become popular as a supposed medicine in China, and numbers are crashing.</p> <p>The proposals to protect the species were made by a group of 49 nations, thought to be the largest for any Cites proposal ever. Sri Lanka, responsible for half the catch of silky sharks in the last decade, was part of the group, saying the fishery was important to its people and it wanted it to be sustainable. </p> <p>The Philippines, Bahamas and Maldives all argued that sharks were valuable tourist attractions. \u201cThresher sharks are worth more alive than dead,\u201d the Philippines delegate told the Cites summit.<br></p> <p>Strong opposition to the proposals came from Japan, who said there was little reliable evidence that protection was needed and that implementing the measures would be hard, creating \u201cconfusion and difficulty\u201d for national authorities. Iceland made the same arguments, while China said the silky shark proposal was \u201cmisleading and discriminatory\u201d and that the demand for fins was already falling. </p> <p>But most other nations thought the measures were needed and the proposals passed with overwhelming majorities, 79% for the sharks and 85% for the devil rays. The decisions still have to be confirmed in the final plenary session of the summit, but they are not expected to be challenged. The new protections will mean catches of the sharks and rays have to be monitored and are only permitted if they do not threaten the survival of the species.</p> <p>\u201cI am just elated,\u201d said Andy Cornish, at WWF and based in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s a big win for all these sharks and rays as governments around the world will now have to act to reduce the overfishing that threatens them.\u201d He said the lack of data on catches has been a serious problem in trying to conserve the shark species, but the new protections required nations to gather the vital information. </p> <p>Elizabeth Murdock, at the National Resource Defence Council, said: \u201cThe demand for these species is completely unsustainable and it is driving them towards extinction. [Today] is a huge step forward for sharks and rays and for the health of our oceans globally.\u201d</p> <p>Guy Stevens, from the Manta Trust, was delighted by the success of the devil ray proposal: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s been years of hard work to get to this point.\u201d </p> <p>He said the argument that poor coastal communities relied on ray meat for food, made by some opponents of the proposal, did not stack up: \u201cThey would have been fished out a long time ago if they were tasty. But they taste like crap.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Britain will approach exit talks with the EU from a position of strength and not as \u201ca supplicant\u201d, Theresa May has said, seeking to raise confidence in the process as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/04/pound-dollar-low-construction-imf-brexit-business-live\">pound sunk to a 31-year low</a> amid business concerns about a \u201chard Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Making a round of broadcast interviews before her speech on Wednesday to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, May offered no new clues as to the details or overall aims of the government\u2019s Brexit strategy.</p> <p>But with sterling dropping to $1.276 in early trading, its lowest level since 1985, May insisted that business would thrive following a departure from the EU that the government seems to be hinting will result in country ending up outside the bloc\u2019s single market.</p> <p>Questioned about her pre-referendum warnings about the economic impact of Brexit, and what concessions the UK would need to make if it wanted access to the single market, the prime minister insisted she would start the process from a position of strength.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s not about the UK, in some sense, being a supplicant to the EU,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIt\u2019s about the reciprocity here. A good trade deal is going to be of benefit to us and to the EU.\u201d</p> <p>May said she was \u201cgoing to be ambitious\u201d as the negotiations began. \u201cThe way we approach this is very important,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people talk in a way that suggests that we should be approaching this as sort of, \u2018We\u2019ve been members of the EU, when we come out, what bits of membership can we keep?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cActually, I think we need to have a different approach. When we come out of the European Union we\u2019ll be an independent, sovereign country \u2013 what relationship do we want with the EU?</p> <p>\u201cI want that relationship to be the right deal for the UK and the best possible deal in terms of trade with the EU. I want British businesses to be able to trade with the EU, and operate within the EU, and EU businesses to be able to operate here in the UK. I think that makes sense for both sides of the argument.\u201d</p> <p>Asked repeatedly about her warnings about Brexit when she campaigned for the remain side, May insisted it had been a nuanced position: \u201cI did, indeed, campaign to remain inside the European Union. I also said in my speech at the beginning of that campaign that I didn\u2019t think the sky would fall in if we were to leave the European Union \u2013 it was a balanced judgment.\u201d</p> <p>While noting that life for the UK was \u201cgoing to be different in the future\u201d, May argued that businesses were confident about the road ahead.</p> <p>\u201cThey know it\u2019s not going to be plain sailing, there will be bumps in the road, and they want certainty as soon as possible about what the future holds,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut the attitude I\u2019m hearing is, yes, the people have decided, the UK will be leaving the EU \u2013 actually, let\u2019s now come together and make sure we grasp the opportunities that will be available.\u201d</p> <p>The plunge in the pound, which was also down 0.2% against the euro, comes amid a downward trend following May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">earlier statements at the Conservative conference</a>, which seemed to indicate a move to a hard Brexit of focusing on controls of immigration at the expense of single market access.</p> <p>May said she remained committed to the target of seeing annual net migration fall to the tens of thousands.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not changed, in the sense we think net migration should be at sustainable levels,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think those levels are the tens of thousands.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, once we leave the EU, there will be the opportunity to control movements coming from the European Union. I think, crucially, what people voted for on 23 June was for their government to be able to make those decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in her round of interviews, May talked about scone recipes and shoes on ITV1\u2019s Good Morning Britain.</p> <p>Perhaps her most revealing answer of the morning came on Today, when she was asked what made her angry. She replied: \u201cInjustice. What makes me angry? Child sexual abuse, modern slavery, when we see the powerful abusing their position. That\u2019s what makes me angry.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cTo me, the film is a sexy comedy.\u201d Writer-director Jim Hosking is musing on the appeal of his debut full-length feature.

There are conversations of almost transcendent, psychedelic banality: in one scene, several painful minutes are spent discussing the word \u201cpotato\u201d. Brayden falls in love with Janet (Elizabeth De Razzo) and Ronnie cruelly, uproariously, seduces his son\u2019s dream woman. And all the while, there\u2019s grease. Ronnie slathers his breakfast grapefruit in grease. Some nauseatingly greasy sausages are rejected for not being greasy enough.

  "<p>Nine months have passed since David Bowie\u2019s death, but his last collaborator, <a href=\"http://donnymccaslin.com/\">Donny McCaslin</a>, still has to pause when he talks about it. \u201cThere\u2019s so much emotion,\u201d McCaslin says, the words catching in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.\u201d <br></p> <p>McCaslin speaks about his experience with Bowie sitting in <a href=\"http://www.55bar.com/\">55 Bar</a>, the micro Greenwich Village jazz club where Bowie first heard the musician perform back in 2014. Shortly after seeing that show, Bowie chose McCaslin\u2019s band to back him on his final album, the acclaimed, jazz-fusion leaning <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/david-bowie-blackstar-review-a-spellbinding-break-with-his-past\">Blackstar</a>. </p> <p>McCaslin vividly remembers the night Bowie came to the club to check him out. \u201cI was definitely nervous,\u201d the saxophonist said. \u201cI glanced up and saw where he was sitting. I just tried to keep myself grounded and not think about it. But the pressure was on.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, McCaslin says his band \u201cwere going for it. It wasn\u2019t a watered-down version of what we do. Afterwards Bowie said: \u2018Wow, that was really loud!\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SVB0bsbHs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n0SVB0bsbHs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Clearly, he liked it that way, because a few days later, Bowie emailed the musician to ask if his band would work with him on what would be his last release, an album that turned out to be one of his most adventurous. The experience of creating music with Bowie proved so deep, and its aftermath so jarring, that McCaslin decided to turn his new album, Beyond Now, out 14 October, into a tribute. It includes several transformative covers of Bowie songs, including Warszawa from Low, and A Small Plot of Land from Outside, along with a song McCaslin wrote inspired by a piece Bowie left off Blackstar. (That track, plus two other cuts that didn\u2019t make that release, will come out on 21 October on the cast album from the musical Bowie wrote in his last year, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/08/lazarus-review-david-bowie-jukebox-musical-off-broadway-new-york\">Lazarus</a>). </p> <p>McCaslin knew his Bowie salute had to be special. \u201cI wanted the depth of my experience with him, and the impact on my life, to be reflected,\u201d he said. \u201cI was digging deep on every take to get the gravitas I felt it should have.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Beyond Now shows growth in McCaslin\u2019s own sound. The 40-year-old musician, born in northern California, has released a dozen albums, dating back to 1998. His father was a musician, a vibraphonist, whose band McCaslin performed with at the age of 12. By high school, McCaslin had a group of his own, one accomplished enough to play the Monterey jazz festival. His early albums mined acoustic jazz, but on 2010\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.allaboutjazz.com/perpetual-motion-donny-mccaslin-greenleaf-music-review-by-troy-collins.php\">Perpetual Motion</a> he sifted in elements of electronica. \u201cI had started listening to albums by Squarepusher, Skrillex, Boards of Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this vibe with electronica, this busy rhythmic activity. The framework of it speaks to me.\u201d</p> <p>The new sound brought McCaslin fresh acclaim. In the last few years, he has been nominated for three Grammys. Two of those nominations came from contributions he made to recordings by <a href=\"http://www.mariaschneider.com/\">Maria Schneider</a>, an acclaimed jazz composer and band leader who, over the years, earned Bowie\u2019s respect and friendship. It was she who suggested Bowie use McCaslin on a recording in 2014, the fierce song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09PogTIgmHw\">Sue (or In a Season of Crime)</a>, which Bowie later released as a limited-edition single, and which later turned up on Blackstar. The next month, Schneider brought Bowie down to see what McCaslin could do live at 55 Bar, sealing his interest. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09PogTIgmHw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/09PogTIgmHw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In early 2015, formal work on Blackstar began, with longtime Bowie ally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/15/david-bowies-last-days-an-18-month-burst-of-creativity\">Tony Visconti</a> acting as producer. \u201cWorking with Donny\u2019s band in the studio was a dream,\u201d said Visconti. \u201cWhat I like about Donny and his musicians is that they are very cultured jazz musicians but young enough to embrace the extremes of pop and rock. They are \u2018one-take\u2019 players. There are no mistakes, just expert playing.\u201d </p> <p>At the time, McCaslin had limited knowledge of Bowie\u2019s full catalogue of songs. While he calls Let\u2019s Dance \u201cthe soundtrack of my youth\u201d, he knew few of his other hits or deep album tracks. To prepare for Blackstar, McCaslin started to check them out, but Bowie quickly dissuaded him. \u201cHe sent me an email saying, essentially, \u2018That\u2019s old stuff. I\u2019m into different things now,\u201d McCaslin said. \u201cAt age 68, Bowie was moving forward.\u201d</p> <p>For Blackstar, that meant giving McCaslin\u2019s band nearly free rein. \u201cHe set the tone from the beginning,\u201d the saxophonist said. \u201cHe told us: \u2018Whatever you hear, I want you to go with it.\u2019 He said \u2018great\u2019 to everything.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, McCaslin couldn\u2019t tell anyone outside of his immediate family about the project. Bowie had the band sign non-disclosure agreements, the better to keep the album a secret until he was ready to release it. At the same time, Bowie was aware he had cancer, which was an even more closely guarded secret. McCaslin politely demurs when asked if he knew the star was sick during the recording process. \u201cHe was so private,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to honor his wishes that we not talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, McCaslin wasn\u2019t even sure the music he cut with Bowie would come out or, if it did, how much of his band\u2019s efforts would make the ultimate cut. It wasn\u2019t until late last fall, when a British journalist asked to interview the musician for a story about a new Bowie album, that he found out about its impending release and heard its final form.</p> <p>On 8 January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/11/was-david-bowie-saying-goodbye-on-blackstar\">Blackstar finally appeared</a>. Two days later came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-at-the-age-of-69\">news of Bowie\u2019s death</a> and, suddenly, everyone wanted to talk to McCaslin. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepped,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p> <p>He gave a few interviews, talking only about the music. Then, journalists started to get nosier about the details of Bowie\u2019s illness and demise, and McCaslin shut down. He also began to fully experience his grief. \u201cWe had this amazing connection,\u201d he said, \u201cand then he was gone.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the healing process involved channeling his feelings into the music on his new album. Besides the Bowie influence, McCaslin drew again on electronica, covering songs by <a href=\"http://www.mutemath.com/\">Mutemath</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youredm.com/2016/09/30/jauz-deadmau5-id-appears-latest-fawks-mix/\">Deadmau5</a>. The music also shows the influence of 70s fusion, a style which McCaslin calls \u201cpart of the musical DNA I grew up with\u201d.</p> <p>Two weeks after Bowie\u2019s death, McCaslin\u2019s band paid tribute to him at The Village Vanguard by performing his moody, 70s song Warszawa. \u201cThere was so much grief; we talked about the best way to pay tribute,\u201d he said. \u201cThat song has a sense of wonder to me. It\u2019s such a beautiful melody. It felt cathartic to play it.\u201d</p> <p>McCaslin says the experience of working with Bowie the year before brought a new intimacy to all the players in his group. \u201cIt got us to a deeper level of expression,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When discussing the fact that his band will forever be linked with Bowie, McCaslin chokes up again. \u201cFor me to be associated with him is really special,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that negates anything I\u2019ve done prior, or what comes in the future.</p> <p>\u201cWith this album, I feel like I\u2019ve done what I needed to do,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I can start thinking about what\u2019s next.\u201d</p>",

These are times of austerity, and you can bet the winning candidate will have to promise to deliver gold standards for tin prices. That is always a difficult vision to pitch to a workforce. The danger of terrorism in the capital is always at the forefront of decision-making and ultimately requires a huge amount of money and resources. This is not an area of policing where there can be compromise, but then, what is? Every public report or inquiry states the police must do more, invest more, place more emphasis, dedicate more resources and so on to whatever the hot topic of the report might be. This is usually accompanied by a quote from someone with a political agenda mixed with little real-life knowledge of the issue.</p> <p>Rarely does the Met reply include the issues of lack of resources. Instead, the reply will consider the message of the current governing party and City Hall. The Met message will not consider rank-and-file officers. It will not mention the budget cuts already borne against a growing anti-police rhetoric in the media \u2013 which most officers blame on the inability of the police, as an organisation, to engage with the media in a direct and open way. Everyone respects a straight-talking copper, even if they don\u2019t agree with the message being delivered.</p> <p>Your basic street cop lives between a rock and a hard place.

Detectives encourage victims of sexual offences to come forward with better care, practices and results. They then have more investigations than they can cope with. Officers volunteer to carry a firearm against a growing firearm threat, and are promptly arrested if they use it, or have their actions judged against the skewed backdrop of North Carolina \u2013 which is not a London borough.</p> <p>The new boss will need to tackle the fact that officers spend too much of their time attending incidents better suited to medical personnel, mental health professionals or social workers.

That said, we want a true leader who will berate our shortcomings <em>and</em> celebrate our efforts and successes.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton skewered opponent Donald Trump on Monday as a phony prophet of the working class amid revelations that the real estate mogul may have avoided paying federal income taxes for nearly two decades.</p> <p>\u201cTrump represents the same rigged system that he claims he\u2019s going to change,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee told voters in Toledo, during the first of two scheduled campaign stops in the battleground state of Ohio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/donald-trump-foundation-donations-new-york\">New York attorney general orders Trump Foundation to stop fundraising</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton cited a report in the New York Times published on Saturday, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-income-tax-returns-published\">leaked documents showed Trump</a> as claiming a loss of $916m in his 1995 personal tax filing. The deduction, stemming from financial mismanagement at three of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-plaza-bankruptcy\">Atlantic City casinos</a>, was substantial enough to pave the way so that Trump could have eliminated what he owed in federal income taxes for a period of up to 18 years.</p> <p>\u201cHow anyone can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is beyond me,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThe whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn\u2019t lift a finger to help and protect his employees, or the small businesses and contractors he\u2019d hired, or the people of Atlantic City,\u201d she added. </p> <p>\u201cTrump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill \u2026 When it comes to bullying small businesses, Donald Trump is the poster boy.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton and her allies have, for months, hammered Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns, breaking from a nearly 40-year tradition among major-party nominees. In her remarks, Clinton called for a law requiring presidential nominees of major parties to be forced to disclose their tax returns \u2013 mirroring a push by Senate Democrats for legislation to do precisely that.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly stood by his decision not to make his returns public, stating he was unable to do so because he is under audit. But his son Donald Trump Jr recently offered a separate excuse, saying the financial disclosures would be a distraction for his father\u2019s campaign. In last week\u2019s presidential debate, Trump sought to deflect the issue by pivoting to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s surrogates, such as the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, spun his apparent skirting of income taxes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-federal-income-tax-new-york-times\">evidence of his shrewdness</a>. </p> <p>But Clinton mocked such notions in Ohio, asking the crowd wryly: \u201cHere\u2019s my question: what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?\u201d</p> <p>Polling has shown a tight race in Ohio, with Trump holding a slim advantage in a state hard hit by the decline in manufacturing jobs. The former reality TV star has focused on Clinton\u2019s record on trade, bashing her husband\u2019s passage of Nafta in the 1990s and her previous support for the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p> <p>While taking the podium in Toledo, however, Clinton made clear she no longer favored the TPP \u2013 a trade pact negotiated by Barack Obama that has been maligned by workers as offshoring American jobs. </p> <p>\u201cI oppose TPP now, I\u2019ll oppose it after the election, and I\u2019ll oppose it as president,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Throughout her appearance, Clinton struck a more populist tone \u2013 vowing to hold accountable institutions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/01/wells-fargo-investigations-lawsuits-john-stumpf\">such as Wells Fargo</a> on the heels of a scandal in which the bank opened as many as 2m accounts without authorization from customers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/2017-us-election-trivial-debates\">Has 2016 turned into most trivial US election ever? | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cReally shocking, isn\u2019t it?

She also called for strengthening antitrust laws and enforcement.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>\u201cWe are not going to let companies like Wells Fargo use these fine-print gotchas to escape accountability,\u201d Clinton said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>At a rally in Akron later on Monday, Clinton urged supporters to \u201cstage an intervention\u201d with their friends and family planning to vote for Trump in November.</p> <p>\u201cRemember,\u201d Clinton said with a wide grin. \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton continued to hit Trump for reportedly not paying federal taxes for 18 years. She scoffed at Trump\u2019s supporters who have sought to cast him as a \u201cgenius\u201d for taking advantage of the tax law and wondered what Trump might suggest next.</p> <p> \u201cWhat else does he want us to do \u2013 pay him to lose money?\u201d she said, drawing laughs from the crowd.</p> <p>Before Clinton lit into Trump, she took time to thank her latest high-profile supporter, basketball superstar LeBron James. In an <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-why-endorsing-hillary-clinton-for-president-2016-9\">op-ed published on Business Insider</a> on Sunday, the Ohio native called Clinton a \u201cchampion for children and their futures\u201d and said she has built \u201con the legacy of my good friend, President Barack Obama\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James,\u201d Clinton said, adding: \u201cI may become president but he will be King of Ohio.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>When Eyeo, the company behind ad-blocking tool Adblock Plus, revealed it was launching an ad tech platform for publishers, it provoked a violent backlash. The press reported that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/adblock-plus-launching-platform-to-sell-acceptable-ads\">Adblock Plus would start selling ads to publishers</a>, effectively making it a poacher turned gamekeeper.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>On the face of it, what the company has actually done is extended its existing \u201cAcceptable Ads\u201d platform, which it launched in 2011, creating a more efficient way to whitelist ads. <br></p> <p>The new platform, which launched in beta last month, lets publishers and bloggers choose from a marketplace of pre-whitelisted ads, allowing them to drag and drop these on to their sites. In short, it is a slicker operation. \u201cInstead of publishers coming to us and giving us URLs of specific ad placements that they have and working with us to fit the criteria, we have been able to automate the process so they only have [whitelisted ads] to choose from,\u201d says Ben Williams, operations manager at Eyeo.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But this is not how many in the industry see it. The move effectively creates an ad network. As Johnny Ryan, head of ecosystem at PageFair, which helps publishers to overcome ad-blocking software, says, \u201cThere is a troubling conflict of interest in a business blocking ads on the one hand and offering to sell access for advertising on the other.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Indeed, in addition to paying a licensing fee to have their ads deemed acceptable \u2013 and therefore whitelisted \u2013 larger publishers and ad networks will also see 6% of the total advertising revenue from these ads go to Adblock Plus. A common view is that Eyeo has erected a gate and now it is charging people to go through it.<br></p> <p>Nick Flood, head of product at Dennis Publishing, says the organisation has seen desktop ad-blocking across its portfolio increase to double-digit percentage levels. It is one of many publishers now grappling with how to address the challenge, implementing initiatives such as serving targeted messages to users.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Flood doesn\u2019t welcome Adblock Plus\u2019 news. \u201cEyeo have built a significant user base over the last few years by allowing users to block adverts across the web. They are a commercial organisation and are looking for their next revenue stream. They already make significant amounts of revenue by charging companies such as Google, Microsoft and publishers to get on their Acceptable Ads list . This is bad enough, but creating its own ad network moves it on a step further.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Williams argues that it is only larger entities \u2013 publishers who gain more than 10m additional ad impressions per month from the Acceptable Ads initiative \u2013 who pay a licensing fee, which amounts to 30% of the revenue. \u201cI should point out that 90% of the companies on the whitelist don\u2019t pay a dime.\u201d<br></p> <p>But it still sits very uncomfortably, in part because of the self-regulating nature of the Acceptable Ads initiative and the perceived lack of transparency. \u201cAcceptable Ads [programme] has no representation from recognised advertising and publishing industry bodies such as the IPA, IAB or ISBA,\u201d says Dominic Good, global advertising sales and strategy director at the Financial Times. \u201cIt does not have any endorsement from the industry and as such there is very little transparency around what is acceptable, why, to whom, and how these decisions have been arrived at.\u201d Ryan agrees: \u201cEyeo uses Adblock Plus and its other ad-blocking software as the engine of an opaque business model: it is not known who must pay what to appear where.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Williams argues that the company\u2019s move to hand over control of what is deemed to be an \u201cacceptable\u201d ad to an independent review board is all in the name of transparency. \u201cThe criteria will soon be out of our hands.\u201d He says the committee will include representatives from advertisers and publishers as well as users and privacy specialists. \u201cOnce we have finished recruiting we will list every representative on the board.\u201d </p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t tackle the issue of the gate and the gatekeeper. Bill Fisher, senior analyst at eMarketer, says hypocrisy is too strong a word for Eyeo\u2019s latest move. Instead he is realistic. \u201cIt\u2019s a business, and it needs to make money. Having control of its own SSP (Supply Side Platform) gives it another instant revenue stream.\u201d </p> <p>Richard Reeves, managing director of the Association of Online Publishing goes one step further, stating that while Adblock Plus\u2019 move was inevitable, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make it any less hypocritical or applaudable. The driving force behind this move is not to create a fairer and more transparent value exchange between readers, advertisers and publishers, but to profit from the very companies it claims to support.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Adblock\u2019s move does allow publishers to reach a valuable, tech savvy audience who have previously put themselves out of reach, and with ads that it deems to be non-intrusive. But Reeves believes this is at great cost. \u201cBoth publishers and readers are losing out, whether through reduced revenue or an unwelcome user experience.\u201d <br></p> <p>Fisher adds that serving ads to those who have opted out doesn\u2019t sound particularly \u201cprogressive\u201d. But as Williams is keen to point out, Adblock Plus does continue to give its users the option to block even ads that meet the \u201cacceptable\u201d criteria. \u201cUsers can opt out [of all ads] at any time. However, only about 8%\u201310% of our users choose to block them all. We think, after five years, that\u2019s pretty resounding proof of the concept.\u201d</p> <p>The industry remains hugely sceptical. Adblock Plus says it has over 1,000 publishers on board, with Williams commenting that \u201cpublishers got it and signed up in droves\u201d. Flood remains unimpressed. \u201cEyeo are strategically attempting to position themselves as part of the ad ecosystem and take an increased slice of the revenues but in reality they are damaging it. As things stand we won\u2019t be signing up to this product.\u201d<br></p> <p>Good takes a similar view. \u201cWe believe that it is for the publisher to develop an advertising proposition that is appropriate to its users expectations rather than leave it to a centralised body, with little or no accountability, to devise a standard that is applicable to all.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>PageFair works closely with publishers and publishers\u2019 trade organisations on a daily basis, and Ryan says he hasn\u2019t \u201cseen any willingness among publishers to pay for the privilege of reaching their own audiences.\u201d Or as Fisher says, \u201cIt\u2019s like feeding the hand that bites you.\u201d An odd move, in anyone\u2019s book.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox,</em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cBrought to you by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding\">here</a></em><em>.</em></p>",

You get to see your character and Sera interacting in this really human way, in that they\u2019re both making dumb jokes and being a bit awkward and then they end up screwing anyway. Although it\u2019s stiffly animated, it shows the intimacy of a good friendship.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> The fact your character shaves something rude into her pubes to make Sera laugh and you both end up giggling yourselves off the bed is adorable. </p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> We\u2019ve all been there. Once I tried to shave someone\u2019s entire name into mine, but I ran out of space \u2026</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I\u2019m sure Jonathan Augustus Maximilian Rufus Anderson would have been impressed you tried though.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> OK, let\u2019s move on.</p> <h2>Sims 2</h2> <p><em>EA\u2019s life sim allows players to build a house then populate it with AI characters who can be \u201cpersuaded\u201d to fall in love and make out with each other.</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHmYcyJPcCw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CHmYcyJPcCw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Kate:</strong> In Sims 2, all it takes to bone someone is to invite them to cuddle and it just goes from there \u2013 which isn\u2019t necessarily realistic. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Sims has been the sexual frustration stress ball for many a pre-teen. It\u2019s the first game a lot of people play that explicitly has a whole load of boning in it. More importantly it\u2019s boning that <em>you</em> control. Well, you don\u2019t control the mechanics of it \u2013 that all happens under the covers. </p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Or in a hot tub. Or a changing room. But yes, the weirdest thing about Sims sex is that you\u2019re kind of the sex director. You created these people, and you have manipulated them into a sexy situation. And, nine times out of 10, in your head, those people just happen to be you and the person you\u2019re crushing on in real-life. And then you watch them roll around under a thin sheet, and blush furiously, imagining that one of the lumps of polygons is you. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> It\u2019s all very quick as well. A jump under the sheets, a few literal pyrotechnics, and wham, bam, you\u2019re done. Also, let\u2019s not forget the creepy baby noise that plays when you conceive.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Imagine if that happened in reality. You\u2019re enjoying a post-coital cuddle and then suddenly a green diamond appears above you and a little lullaby twinkle plays. As you lie in your own juices.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Yes, it\u2019s truly... wait, what?!</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> One time I deleted the bed, because deleting Sims was the way to make them happy again (also horrific) \u2013 but there was a glitch and it didn\u2019t actually delete the Sims \u2013 just the bed. All that was left on screen were two blobby conjoined naked humans writhing around in ecstasy. Or was it pain? Anyway, I never had sex again.</p> <h2>Fable 2</h2> <p><em>The critically acclaimed fantasy adventure from Lionhead is filled with salacious humour and focuses heavily on romance and relationships.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"701359f3a42a8b1ebec3026fcfb51d70544f4c92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/701359f3a42a8b1ebec3026fcfb51d70544f4c92/199_61_1081_649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fable 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cMy dog has just dug up a condom, fancy a quickie?\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Holly:</strong> The sex in Fable is in keeping with the general humour of the game. It\u2019s all fade to black and \u201cOhhh, very saucy, my love\u201d in a West Country accent.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I am prepared to believe this is an accurate representation of dating someone from the West Country. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Fable II is also a game in which there are condoms buried in the ground... That your dog digs up... And then you use them. Top marks for including prophylactics though.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> You can also have group sex <em>and</em> romance people by farting at them until they love you. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> This immediately feels like a good time to move on.</p> <h2><strong>The Garrus romance scene, Mass Effect 2</strong></h2> <p><em>In Bioware\u2019s sci-fi adventure series, lead character Commander Shepard (who can be male or female) must save humanity from the evil Reaper force, while also romancing members of his/her crew, including the avian reptilian insectoid alien, Garrus Vakarian.</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFMdhHGKRZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kFMdhHGKRZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Kate:</strong> You start off in life being all like, \u201cugh, I would never want to have sex with a beetle\u201d\u2026 and then you meet Garrus.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> If you play Mass Effect and don\u2019t fall in love with this insect/cat hybrid then I have no respect for you. I adore him.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I\u2019m just not sure what the logistics of bumping uglies with aliens are. I mean, he could have an ovipositor or something. Do you just jam whatever he\u2019s packing in whatever hole you can find and hope that it\u2019s fun for everyone? What if he\u2019s got a duck penis and it\u2019s all weird like a corkscrew?</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Bioware obviously had no idea either. Although you have a chat with the local doctor about the logistics when it comes to shagging the less directly anthropomorphic aliens, Bioware\u2019s writers just kinda go, \u201cerrr I dunno. FADE TO BLACK\u201d. But the awkwardness and the unknown are what makes this so endearing.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> Honestly, I think all video games really struggle with the, uh, physicality of sex \u2013 whether the penis is alien or not. The whole \u201cfade to black\u201d thing is a way around it, because the games that don\u2019t fade to black have all this \u2026 dry thrusting going on. And you just \u2026 part of you knows that everyone\u2019s smooth like a Ken doll down there. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Whatever the fade to black conjures up in our seedy little brains is bound to be a hundred times better than what graphics technology can realistically render on screen. Especially in Mass Effect 2. Anyway, the appeal of this scene is in the way he brings wine and puts on music in an attempt to make things nice; it\u2019s in his obvious nervousness and the way he eventually lets his guard down. Bravo Bioware, I\u2019m cool with not seeing anything explicit if the run-up is as adorable as this. Which brings us nicely to \u2026</p> <h2>The unicorn sex scene, The Witcher 3</h2> <p><em>The third title in the open-world fantasy adventure series follows monster killer Geralt of Rivia as he pulverises mega beasts and flirts with female allies Yennifer of Vengerberg and Triss Merrigold.</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHZqzoZjx5o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yHZqzoZjx5o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Holly:</strong> You can\u2019t talk about sex scenes in games and not include the infamous Witcher 3 unicorn moment.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I\u2019m a little bit in love with Yennefer. She\u2019s got that Elizabeth Taylor violet eyes thing going on, she\u2019s kind of mean but I love it. She\u2019s got a great sense of humour and I think she matches up well with Geralt. Also I love Geralt and I want the best for him. Yennefer is the best. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I agree. I\u2019m sorry Triss fans, but her voice is just too damn annoying.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> So anyway, in this scene, you and Yen are necking on a chair or something and then she coyly looks to the side \u2026 and beckons you over to her life-size stuffed unicorn. There\u2019s nothing hotter than fantastical taxidermy.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I love the implied history between the two of them. Geralt is just like, \u201coh for God\u2019s sake, not the unicorn again\u201d. In any long-term relationship, haven\u2019t we all thought that?</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> But like with the Sera scene, there\u2019s this sense of intimacy. That\u2019s the key to effective video game sex: good writing, good characters.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> This definitely isn\u2019t their first naked unicorn rodeo, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less hot. They obviously know each other, know what each other like, and can get to business despite the awkward positioning on the back of a mythological horse.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> OK, it\u2019s getting hot in here, so let\u2019s cool off with some bad video game sex.</p> <h2>The Heavy Rain quick-time sex scene</h2> <p><em>In this brooding psychological horror game from Quantic Dreams, desperate father Ethan Mars must save his kidnapped son from a deranged murderer \u2013 with help from photojournalist Madison Paige. But it\u2019s not all death, death, death... </em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBR8cd3HE2s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oBR8cd3HE2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I hate this scene so much. There is no room for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_time_event\">quick-time events</a> in sex.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> It kills the mood when there\u2019s all this moaning and nudity and suddenly the game is going \u201cPress X to take off shirt. R2 to circle nipple. Flick control stick upwards to initiate coital pleasure.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> The only way I\u2019d ever be up for quick-time sex is if it got funny when you failed one. Like, if you miss a button prompt, Ethan prematurely ejaculates in his pants or Madison does a little fanny fart. </p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> That\u2019s a totally different kind of game, I think.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> A game I\u2019d rather play than Heavy Rain. Even ignoring the silly button presses the entire setup is stilted. That whole \u2018sure, it\u2019s an inappropriate moment but we just need to shag\u2019 set-up <em>can</em> work. But here, she asks if he\u2019s OK and he\u2019s like \u201cI just killed a guy and my son\u2019s probably been kidnapped by a serial killer \u2013 let\u2019s do it\u201d. The writing is so awkward and clunky.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> It feels so gratuitous. Sure, sometimes people shag at weird times. Emotions run high, clothes come off, and before you know it, you\u2019re bonking at a funeral. It <em>happens</em>. But with games, it can feel like the developer didn\u2019t think their narrative was interesting or mature enough without a sex scene. Sex should be organic \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean in a Whole Foods kind of way.</p> <h2>Far Cry 3: the sex and death ending</h2> <p><em>Ubisoft\u2019s action blockbuster has player-character Jason Brody attempting to escape an island crawling with ruthless pirates, while also flirting with an indigenous tribe of sexy drug addicts.</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKHgyHVXScc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jKHgyHVXScc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Kate:</strong> So, when we decided to write this, we did a lot of \u2013 ahem \u2013 research. This mostly consisted of watching the relevant sex scenes in a busy-ish cafe and saying \u201cOh my\u201d a lot. But we also looked up what other people liked in a video game sex scene, and this was one popped up over and over again. And, quite frankly, we\u2019re a little baffled by that. We assume these \u2018best video game sex\u2019 lists are usually written by guys, but you have to be especially naive to think that good sex ends with bleeding out on a sacrificial altar.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> It\u2019s an odd one. I guess maybe because it\u2019s kind of like very weird point-of-view porn. It\u2019s all thrusting and grunting and the lady saying very ominous things about passing on your seed. Then she stabs you post-ejaculation. Although to be fair, she also calls you \u201cperfection\u201d so it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. </p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> We haven\u2019t had any other first-person bone-\u2019em-ups have we? I guess that\u2019s what makes this one so, uh, hot?</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> If your kink is impregnating someone then being stabbed in the chest, then this game definitely ticks all your boxes. </p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> That would make quite a marketing quote. </p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Thank you. Anyway, I can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s certainly intense. </p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> It feels like an interesting piece of trickery by the developers - like a trap. If you let yourself be seduced, it pulls the rug from under your feet and goes \u201cahahaaaaa, sex is bad, you idiot!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s a potentially interesting way of taking agency out of the player\u2019s hands, but it\u2019s not going on my personal \u201csexiest sex\u201d list.<br></p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I\u2019ve seen that list. It\u2019s filthy. I\u2019m on it.</p> <h2>Sex and the ceiling in Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood</h2> <p><em>The historical assassination adventure has hooded killer Ezio Auditore da Firenze traversing the crowded streets and rooftops of 16th century Rome, while occasionally taking a break to \u2018fare l\u2019amore\u2019, as our Italian cousins put it.</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTZMtszZpwY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xTZMtszZpwY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Kate: </strong>So Ezio takes off all his clothes, tosses his hidden blade on the floor with a surprising amount of carelessness (\u201cthat\u2019s a priceless antique you clumsy jerk\u201d) and then climbs into the tub. Saucy. Then a lady comes in, I forget who she is, and you bonk. It\u2019s \u2026 weirdly long.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Made even longer by loading screens, which is such a mood killer. Also, how is she riding him while still wearing pants? This seems to happen in quite a few games. Thrusting, grinding and moaning are all fine but heaven forbid we see actual genitalia. Although I suppose accurate wang modelling is not the best use of resources.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> I think what was weird about this one was the total lack of communication. There\u2019s no sense of intimacy or foreplay, it\u2019s just: trousers off, sex, done. And then the roof explodes. I guess we\u2019ve all been there.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> I\u2019m all for the lady taking charge, but Ezio seems to do very little. Come on, I know you\u2019re tired from running along rooftops all day but at least go on top for a bit. </p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> In The Witcher they actually mix up the positions. Ezio just starfishes his way through this one, and that\u2019s so boring. </p> <h2>X-MAN \u2013 pixel sex apocalypse</h2> <p><em>One of the erotic masterpieces from software publisher Mystique, which very much put the \u201cArrrrrgh\u201d into Atari.</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJCvxRCzk4g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OJCvxRCzk4g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Holly:</strong> This one is \u2026 how do we put it? Ah yes, repulsive. X-Man has nothing to do with the Marvel series, but is instead a wildly offensive game released in 1983 on the Atari 2600. You play as a horny guy who has to navigate to the centre of a maze without being emasculated by a pair of scissors \u2013 or a crab. If you make it, you have unconvincing doggy sex with some pixels.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> It\u2019s like Pac-Man, but with penetration. The box art has a woman squidging up her cleavage, which in typical Atari fashion has very little to do with what actually happens on screen. The woman in the game has nipples that flash on and off and she turns blue-green when she orgasms. It\u2019s pretty hot. It\u2019s not accurate, but it\u2019s hot.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> So basically, your reward for completing a rudimentary maze is to watch one set of pixels slowly penetrating another. It\u2019s like a Freudian sex nightmare set in the 1982 Disney movie Tron.</p> <p><strong>Kate:</strong> And that\u2019s why this is our favourite sex scene in video games.</p> <p><strong>Holly:</strong> Can I go home now?

  "<p>Visitors to the F54 <em>K</em><em>iezladen (</em>neighbourhood cooperative) in Berlin\u2019s Neuk\u00f6lln district are hit by the smell of chopped onions. Inside the kitchen, members are busy chopping vegetables to make a supper of <em>soljanka</em>, a Russian soup, for the stream of residents arriving for a beer and a chat \u2013 and, in some cases, to see the rental rights lawyer who is volunteering advice this evening.</p> <p>The cooperative \u2013 formally known as <a href=\"http://friedelstrasse54.blogsport.eu/\">Friedel Strasse 54</a> \u2013 was recently given notice to quit by the investor that had bought the apartment block in July, Pinehill sarl: a mailbox company registered in Luxembourg. The septuagenarian dental technician who occupied the ground-floor workshop here for decades has already been evicted.</p> <p>It is an increasingly common scenario in Neuk\u00f6lln, a sprawling neighbourhood that has become a magnet for young Europeans in recent years, and has found itself in the sights of international property developers as a result.</p> <p>Matthias Sander (his requested pseudonym for talking to the Guardian), a 32-year-old history and politics teacher, is a resident of one of the 20 flats that make up F54. \u201cThe cooperative is basically a squat now; we\u2019re just waiting to see what happens,\u201d he says. \u201cOur only hope is that our own initiative will kick in somehow, or the property market will collapse, allowing us to buy the building ourselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b849a88240701807de4a13b65d844d9fcd7a7d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b849a88240701807de4a13b65d844d9fcd7a7d2/0_0_1217_1520/801.jpg\" alt=\"Friedel Strasse 54 in Neuk\u00f6lln, Berlin.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://friedelstrasse54.blogsport.eu/\">Friedel Strasse 54</a> in Neuk\u00f6lln, Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Connolly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until a few years ago, investors discovering Berlin ignored Neuk\u00f6lln as too scruffy and working-class. It has the largest number of migrants of any district in the city, and the highest number of social welfare recipients. But in recent years, as Berlin\u2019s housing market has boomed, investors have been seizing everything they can: \u201cI\u2019d say every second building has either been bought or is in the process of being bought,\u201d Sander says.</p> <p>Recognising that the city\u2019s Social Democrat government had minimal interest in bucking this trend (the mayor said she welcomed a middle-class influx), the Neuk\u00f6lln Tenants\u2019 Alliance set about collecting signatures in support of introducing \u201c<em>milieuschutz\u201d</em> in the area. Under this law \u2013 translated as \u201csocial environment protection\u201d \u2013 real estate is shielded against owners\u2019 attempts to renovate and modernise it to the extent that existing residents could be forced out. </p> <p>\u201cThe <em>milieuschutz</em> should ensure that neighbourhoods in Berlin remain lively and socially mixed, enabling anyone to live wherever he or she wants,\u201d says Hans Panhoff, a city councillor responsible for building, planning and environment in the neighbouring district of Kreuzberg, which has borne the brunt of Berlin\u2019s gentrification drive.</p> <p>Panhoff says the law can work in conjunction with other measures, such as new rent control regulations and the right of authorities to block sales, should they be able to raise the money to buy a building themselves. (Currently, there are two prominent examples of  tenement blocks in Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain whose residents would have faced eviction by the Luxembourg investor who was on the verge of snapping them up. Instead, the district authorities have provisionally secured both blocks under this \u201ccommunal right of first refusal\u201d rule \u2013 although Panhoff says the cases are in legal limbo, while experts agree this model will not offer a long-term sustainable solution due to a simple lack of funds.)</p> <p>Panhoff\u2019s department has produced a flyer to inform local residents of the city\u2019s housing<em> </em>laws: \u201cMany people are unaware about what they have to tolerate and what they don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to increase awareness, and have seen a rise in the number of queries as a result.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a0f99aa006b287f0ed0bf7162413401d51c090f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a0f99aa006b287f0ed0bf7162413401d51c090f/0_107_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Friedel Strasse 54 cooperative protest the enforced closure of Berlin\u2019s legendary M99 corner shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Friedel Strasse 54 cooperative protest the enforced closure of Berlin\u2019s legendary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/berlin-m99-hans-georg-lindenau-corner-shop-revolutionary\">M99 corner shop</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <em>milieuschutz</em> laws are far from new \u2013 some German cities began implementing them more than 40 years ago \u2013 but their spread has never been as rapid as now: a time of unprecedented real estate price rises.</p> <p>In areas protected by the law, owners are forbidden from changing floor plans, merging two flats into one or splitting large flats up into several, adding balconies or terraces larger than four square metres, installing fitted kitchens or undertaking luxury bathroom renovations \u2013 or using the flat as a holiday let.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have bureaucrats on our side who are at least going to make their lives as difficult as possible</p> <footer> <cite>Andreas Haltermann</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have been seeing a rapid increase in such modifications being carried out,\u201d says Andreas Haltermann of the Tenants\u2019 Alliance, \u201cprimarily so landlords can increase the rent \u2013 sometimes to an extortionate level \u2013 with the intention of pushing existing residents out, so they can either sell the flat or rent it out at a much higher rate.\u201d</p> <p>Haltermann claims the <em>milieuschutz</em> \u2013 which was passed by the Neuk\u00f6lln government in its \u201cmost urgent\u201d areas in the new year, and finally came into full force this summer \u2013 has already prevented planning permission on several building projects.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware that property companies are capable of many tricks to get conversions through regardless,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we have bureaucrats on our side who are at least going to make their lives as difficult as possible, and hopefully slow down the process so much that large investors are put off buying here.\u201d</p> <p>Martin, a 49-year-old arts promoter, is reluctant to give his full name because he is still in legal dispute with a Spanish businessman who recently bought the building in which he has lived with his wife for 12 years. Martin says the <em>milieuschutz</em> has so far ensured the string of modernisation measures the new owner wanted to carry out were not allowed to happen.</p> <p>\u201cHe wanted to put in under-floor heating, to change the floor plans, to insulate the walls, to install solar panels \u2013 you name it,\u201d he says. The measures would apparently have led to a more-than-threefold increase in his rent, from \u20ac600 to \u20ac2,000. \u201cMy wife and I both work, so we might have been able to afford it \u2013 but for our neighbour it would have meant paying 85% of her wages towards rent. She would have been forced out.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright\">Gentrification is a global problem.

Rent rises are, in theory, capped \u2013 the longer someone has lived somewhere, the lower their rent is and the more rights they have. </p> <p>But if the owner upgrades the property, he is able to offset a considerable chunk of those costs on to the rent. Long-term, sociologists warn, this is likely to water down the healthy social mix in neighbourhoods that city residents often cite as one of the reasons life in Berlin is so pleasant and relaxed.</p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t want to go\u2019</h2> <p>The <em>milieuschutz</em> has done little to help the residents of Lenaustrasse 23 and Hobrechtstrasse 62, known collectively as <a href=\"http://lebrecht2362ev.de/\">Lebrecht 2362</a>, in Neuk\u00f6lln. On the day the Guardian visits, the new owner of the buildings, a Berlin developer, has sent his own inspector to compile an inventory of the 30-or-so apartments, ahead of a planned luxury upgrade.</p> <p>Henry, a social worker, nervously shows the inspector around his quirkily decorated flat, painted in shades of green, turquoise and yellow and with a sign above the toilet which reads: \u2018Free your mind and your arse will follow.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 21 years,\u201d Henry says. \u201cI\u2019m quite happy with how it is.

Look at the number of lifts that are being installed in 19th-century buildings across the district. That speaks volumes for just how effective it is.\u201d</p> <p>Theinert says the residents have tried talking to the new owners: \u201cWe\u2019ve told them we\u2019re ready to go along with the modernisation measures, that we\u2019ll take rental rises on the chin within reason \u2013 but we just don\u2019t want the luxury refit they\u2019re planning.\u201d</p> <p>Criticism of the <em>milieuschutz</em> has also come from the home owners\u2019 association Haus &amp; Grund (House and Land), which has accused the authorities of \u201ctaking away from people the chance to buy, at a time when it has never been so easy to secure provision for old age due to the low borrowing costs\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Chamber of Industry and Commerce has described the measures as \u201ca renewed attack on the ownership rights of property owners, which is having a detrimental effect on the investment climate in the city without doing anything to keep rents under control on a mid-term basis\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fedd59a3a50cfcd2c05c5494e1d0abf4009f21a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fedd59a3a50cfcd2c05c5494e1d0abf4009f21a/0_186_1470_882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti on the outside wall of Friedel Strasse 54.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti on the outside wall of <a href=\"http://friedelstrasse54.blogsport.eu/\">Friedel Strasse 54</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Connolly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at Friedel Strasse 54, Sander the teacher sits amid graffiti reading \u201cWe\u2019re here to stay\u201d and \u201cNo bling in the hood\u201d.

  "<p>Talking to computers was once for the likes of Captain Kirk, but a new product due to be announced by Google on Tuesday demonstrates that it believes devices that can speak to humans are ready for the living room.</p> <p>The search engine giant is expected to launch its Google Home \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d speaker system \u2013 a squat cylinder that will be able to process search requests and other everyday tasks when instructed to by the sound of a human voice.</p> <p>For many, conversations with computers consist of frustrating attempts to provide credit card numbers to a bank or talking to a bemused mobile phone, but Amazon has transformed the market, with the help of Alexa, its digital assistant, which lives inside its multimillion-selling Echo.</p> <p>A week ago Amazon said it would start selling the Echo in the UK at \u00a3149.99, two years after its introduction in the US, where it had become a sleeper hit. Despite a low-key launch the Echo sold 3.5m units in the time it took Amazon to adapt the device to recognise the full gamut of British English accents and voices. The Echo and other such \u201csmart speakers\u201d connect to home Wi-Fi, and owners can ask them to play music, read them the headlines, or even turn on the lights (provided they\u2019ve got the requisite smart home gear installed elsewhere).</p> <p>There is a history of voice control devices such as Siri, on Apple iPhones, and Google Now promising to revolutionise the way we interact with technology \u2013 or, more specifically, talking only to disappoint in reality, but the latest devices could change that.</p> <p>The Echo\u2019s omnidirectional microphones let it hear across a room, while its speech recognition is head and shoulders above the competition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc7cf0fad9899f5048b2bea8ef06a9cd4ccae75d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc7cf0fad9899f5048b2bea8ef06a9cd4ccae75d/0_0_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Echo voice-controlled speakers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon Echo voice-controlled speakers, seen here in one of the company\u2019s \u2018fulfilment centres\u2019 went on sale in the UK last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikael Buck/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also a difference in the role the devices are intended to take in the lives of users.

In the US, one-fifth of searches on Google Android are made by voice, according to Google chief executive Sundar Pichai.</p> <p>What Amazon and Google are banking on is that a new device will be able to overcome this barrier. By moving the voice control hub out of people\u2019s pocket and into their living room or kitchen, they hope it will become more natural.</p> <p>If Amazon can replicate its US success, then it seems likely that a new hardware category will be born, with the two companies fighting to be the one provider of intelligent speakers.</p> <p>While there are similarities between their devices, there\u2019s also a vast gulf between what Amazon and Google hope to get out of putting a smart device in every room.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon approaches this \u2026 from the point of view of the connected home as the primary locus of electronic commerce,\u201d says Werner Goertz from industry analysts Gartner. It\u2019s trivial to use the Echo to shop on Amazon rather than wander around the kitchen, verbally adding ingredients to a shopping list, then open the companion app and tell Amazon to order it all.</p> <p> Google\u2019s device hopes to go further, hooking into people\u2019s Google accounts across the web: not only does it know the events on their calendar, it also knows where people are going on holiday to next, or when the last package someone posted is due to arrive at its destination.</p> <p>Goertz points out that those advantages will only grow: not only with the company\u2019s first in-house phones, expected to be launched alongside Home on Tuesday, but also with the company\u2019s experimentation in self-driving cars.</p> <p>For some, that may be an intrusion too far. Google has always had to walk a fine line between \u201ccaring\u201d and \u201ccreepy\u201d, and at times it has crossed it (take, for example, the time it launched a social network, Buzz, that automatically added as a friend everyone you had ever emailed).</p> <p>When the Echo was launched in the US in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/nov/09/amazon-echo-smart-tv-watching-listening-surveillance\">reaction then also focused on the creepy aspects of the device</a>, especially the fact that the microphone is never turned off so that it is always listening for the device\u2019s \u201cwake word\u201d. Two years on, that technology is normal: iPhones and Android devices both use the same system to enable Google Now and Siri, for example.</p> <p>Whether or not devices like the Echo and Home can cross over from American early adopters to worldwide hits is important for the wider technology industry too. The smartphone boom in the west is almost over, and even though people are still buying new phones every two years, the industry needs another popular device for profits to stay high: current hopes according to market analysts Gartner is that the market will be worth $2bn worldwide by 2020.</p> <p>There\u2019s one huge name missing from this: Apple. While it has been steadily improving Siri, and rolling it out to ever more devices, from the iPhone to Macs and Watches, it is not making a dash for the living room at the same rate as Google and Amazon.</p> <p>\u201cApple,\u201d Goertz says, \u201cis dropping behind in this race.\u201d It risks being \u201clate to market unless it can come up with substantial product announcements by the end of this year\u201d. That might be because its voice-recognition technology simply isn\u2019t as strong as those two companies, or it might be that it has still got its hopes pegged on smart watches as the next big thing.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not dangerous,\u201d says Thomas, 10, carefully positioning a tray of bread cakes over burning coals. \u201cIt\u2019s OK if you do it right. There are people here who know the safety rules and they teach us,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Children at this state junior school have lessons in using sharp knives, saws and even air rifles. They get to cook food and smelt metal over an open fire and to skin and bone rabbits. Mike Fairclough, their headteacher, believes exposing children to risk fosters a confidence that improves their educational performance, behaviour and attitudes.</p> <p>Fairclough has no truck with the \u201celf and safety\u201d brigade and he arrives, lurching alarmingly on the rough terrain, on a quad bike. \u201cA lot of teachers agree with me. Headteachers and governors are more reticent due to their accountability should things go wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel strongly that we should not be limiting ourselves or the children through fear. The reality is that headteachers are much freer than they often believe they are.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks schools \u2013 and parents \u2013 are failing children by protecting them from anything that might cause harm instead of teaching them how to handle danger. His decision to take pupils clay-pigeon shooting brought him <a href=\"http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10690741.Headteacher_defends_clay_pigeon_shoot_at_Eastbourne_school/\" title=\"\">notoriety</a> \u2013 and plaudits from <a href=\"https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/114467\" title=\"\">Ofsted</a> and the Health and Safety Executive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/15/children-learn-play-age-eight-lego\">Children should learn mainly through play until age of eight, says Lego</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now Fairclough has written a book provocatively titled: <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/playing-with-fire-464475.html\" title=\"\">Playing with Fire: Embracing Risk and Danger in Schools</a>. In it he describes how his school, <a href=\"http://www.westrisejunior.co.uk/\" title=\"\">West Rise Junior</a> in Eastbourne, East Sussex, rents 120 acres of marshland to keep a herd of water buffalo, beehives, chickens, sheep and goats, and gets children out in all weathers to \u201cbuild grit and resilience\u201d. He invites other schools to \u201ctear off the cotton wool from around our kids and cast it into the flames\u201d.</p> <p>He wants to counter the \u201cwidespread misconception\u201d that health and safety rules prohibit any activity with a potential for danger. He says the subject is shrouded in myths, such as bans on conkers or snowballs \u201cfor safety reasons\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that every school can take risks and engage in \u2018dangerous\u2019 activities, in the same way that I have done so at my school for years. No one is stopping them. The government, Ofsted and the Health and Safety Executive would all love to see schools embracing danger in a responsible way,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Fairclough, son of the late actor Gordon Fairclough, is a fine art graduate. He taught in Wood Green, London, Slough and Aylesbury before arriving at West Rise, a 274-pupil school serving two estates where two-thirds of children are eligible for free school meals. He caused a stir when he turned up for the job interview 12 years ago in a vintage pinstripe suit and silver shoes. Today his white shirt is unbuttoned to reveal a glimpse of chest art.</p> <p>\u201cI took one look at him and thought, not a chance,\u201d says Alex Richards, then a parent governor and now the school\u2019s farm manager. \u201cSilver shoes? What a nutter. I asked where he came from and he said Aylesbury. I said if you think kids come skipping into school here like they do in posh Aylesbury, think again.\u201d Sue Poore, the school\u2019s business manager, admits that Fairclough had looked \u201cdistinctive\u201d. \u201cDespite being patently unprepared, he spoke with passion about his aspirations and it came straight from the heart, not a laptop.\u201d</p> <p>It was the right decision, says Richards: \u201cMike has transformed the school. We\u2019re in the top 5% nationally for <a href=\"http://www.westrisejunior.co.uk/?page_id=749\" title=\"\">attainment in the Sats</a> and the top school in Eastbourne for reading, writing, maths, punctuation and grammar. He\u2019s getting that hit by having the children challenging themselves and finding solutions together rather than spending all the time facing walls in the classroom.\u201d</p> <p>The school is on land once occupied by the second largest bronze age settlement in Europe and the children are preparing and cooking food in the way their prehistoric ancestors are thought to have done. Fairclough tastes the flatbread they\u2019ve made, out of flour, honey and milk, spread with butter beaten from cream, and compote from brambles they had foraged. \u201cThey are so good, they just get you totally in the groove,\u201d says Fairclough, who describes himself as a hippy and talks about being \u201cloved up\u201d, \u201ctotally cool\u201d and \u201cin the vibe\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s just one side of him. The other is an insistence on good behaviour and manners based on mutual respect, a trait he attributes to his \u201cstrict but loving\u201d upbringing. He wants West Rise pupils to leave the school as \u201cwell-rounded people who don\u2019t wimp out\u201d but who are also proficient in reading, writing and maths. He is keen on art and creative writing but also provides extra tuition sessions to make sure year 6 pupils do well in their Sats.</p> <p>Fairclough is also, surprisingly, a fan of video games after watching his teenage sons play them online with people from all over the world. \u201cLike health and safety, I believe that video gaming is misrepresented and not understood deeply enough in the teaching profession. In terms of risk and danger, video games offer a broad spectrum of subject matter which will engage most children,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only schools that are letting down children but parents too, he believes, when they foist their own anxieties on their offspring. He identifies a growing trend for parents to&#xa0;seek labels, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/04/adhd-nation-the-disorder-drugs-inside-story-alan-schwarz-review\" title=\"\">ADHD</a>, to explain poor or disturbed behaviour rather than tackling it: \u201cThey see something on television about a new disorder, fill in an&#xa0;internet questionnaire and hey presto, the child has a label. Of course there are children with special needs, but in many cases it\u2019s just a result of poor parenting.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/20/grammar-schools-play-europe-top-education-system-finland-daycare\">No grammar schools, lots of play: the secrets of Europe\u2019s top education system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers agrees children should learn to handle risk, though he says it is a matter for judgment. \u201cThere are obvious risks in allowing opportunities for reckless behaviour and there are more subtle risks in limiting opportunities for adventure and challenge. School leaders steer a difficult course between the two and, inevitably, people will find fault from one direction or another. If we trusted school leaders more and threatened them less, they would be able to exercise this judgment more confidently,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Dame Judith Hackitt, the former chairwoman of the Health and Safety Executive, visited West Rise to see for herself: \u201cOnce in a while you encounter someone who inspires you. Hearing about and then meeting Mike Fairclough was one such encounter for me. I spent most of my tenure encouraging teachers and parents to recognise their role in helping children to learn about risk to prepare them for life. Here is someone who does exactly that and much, much more,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Of course, not every state school can rent swaths of marshland, but Fairclough thinks they can all find ways to challenge children. \u201cIf you follow your heart and do what you love, while also being strategic with Ofsted and the requirements of the government, then teachers are able to do whatever they like, provided it has a measurable and positive educational impact on the children,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He admits that some parents worry at first but says they are reassured by the careful risk assessments drawn up for each activity and their children\u2019s clear enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s the best part of school. I love it more than anything,\u201d says Thomas. It\u2019s not just a boy thing: \u201cIt\u2019s good to come out into the fresh air with your friends and try new things,\u201d says Georgia, 11. Their favourite activity is making food and cooking on an open fire. \u201cAnd the really good thing is you get to eat it,\u201d says Dominic, 10.</p> <p><em>Order a copy of Playing with Fire: Embracing risk and danger in schools (John Catt Educational Ltd, \u00a314) at </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/playing-with-fire-464475.html\" title=\"\"><em>the Guardian bookshop. </em></a><em> Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a310, online orders only.

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Finally, something tangible. Last week \u2013 and, particularly, last weekend \u2013 feels like a bit of a Brexit turning point: we now have a date (or at least a deadline) for the start of exit talks, and what looks very much like a strategic direction.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">Conservative party conference on Sunday, Theresa May</a> said article 50 would be triggered before the end of March next year. The prime minister also said Britain would not emulate Norway or Switzerland but forge a relationship with the EU as a fully independent, sovereign country: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not leaving the EU today to give up control of immigration again, and we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. We are going to be a country ... that is no longer part of a political union with supranational institutions that can override national parliaments and courts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously that still leaves a lot unanswered about the detail of the trading relationship with Europe May will seek. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">Brexit: Theresa May prioritises immigration curbs over single market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her stated priorities \u2013 curbing immigration, no more interference from foreign judges, even reclaiming the right to print food labels as Britain sees fit \u2013 would seem to rule out membership of the EU\u2019s single market. </p> <p>Although she disputed the notions of \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Brexit, this looks pretty hard: May\u2019s Brexit means sovereignty taking precedence over trade arrangements and economic interests, at least short term. </p> <p>As was necessary, the prime minister also promised a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\">bill to scrap the 1972 act that took the UK into the union</a> and to transfer existing EU law into British law. Parliament will be able to remove or rewrite unwanted bits later, but at least initially, Brexit will mean up to 13,000 EU regulations being enshrined in UK law. <br></p> <p>Europe largely welcomed the clarity on the Brexit timetable, happy that Britain should now be out before the European parliament elections of spring 2019. But Donald Tusk, the European council president, once more rebuffed May\u2019s call for preparatory talks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/782577278882553856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PM May&#39;s declaration brings welcome clarity on start of Brexit talks.

invoked</a>, reiterated the bloc\u2019s stance: single market privileges and freedom of movement \u201ccannot be decoupled\u201d.</p> <p>But in some ways, things may have become simpler for the EU 27: if Britain really is not intending to seek a relaxation of the single market\u2019s rules (to allow it to control EU immigration, for example) but is just out for a reasonable trade deal, the pressure may have eased. <br></p> <p>The bloc\u2019s remaining members are also aware that as soon as article 50 is triggered, they will have the advantage: the clock will be ticking. <br></p> <aside

  "<p>Ray Webber has a boxful of books to sign, a launch to attend and a nurse to make sure he is in full working order. When I arrive at his flat in the Bristol suburbs, the nurse has hoisted his shirt over his head and is applying a stethoscope to his bare back. Webber says he has trouble breathing and has to walk with a frame. But then, as he points out, he did turn 93 in March.<br></p> <p>Physically, Webber has seen better days, but his poems are limber and fresh, full of a loose, playful energy that has earned him a small but ardent following on the city\u2019s arts scene. His debut collection, <a href=\"http://www.tangentbooks.co.uk/high-on-rust-ray-webber-selected-poems.html\">High on Rust</a>, amounts to an autobiographical flurry. It bounds from his birth in the slums (bedbugs, drunken midwife) to the death of an infant sister to his first kiss on the cobblestones outside the cigarette factory. Towards the end, Webber brings us bang up to date, describing himself as \u201ca sickening hunk of old flesh\u201d, a man with one foot already through the exit door.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Best get a move on \u2013 it could be curtains for me any time!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Check-up complete, the poet requests that the curtains be drawn because the sun hurts his eyes. He explains that he suffers repeated angina attacks and then gestures at my recorder. \u201cSo you had best get a move on. Any time could be curtains.\u201d<br></p> <p>Webber has spent his life writing largely in secret, underground, stealing moments here and there in the working day. He was raised in poverty, the son of the leader of the Bristol communist party, and went on to join the Young Communist League. He recalls gatecrashing blackshirt rallies in the 1930s, getting beaten up and kicked out. Later he worked as a postman and chaired the local painters\u2019 and decorators\u2019 union. </p> <p>Poetry, he says, was a private obsession. Entirely self-taught, he thrilled to the work of <a href=\"http://www.frankohara.org/writing.html]\">Frank O\u2019Hara</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/williamburroughs\">William Burroughs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot\">TS Eliot</a> and developed a habit of plucking opening lines from newspaper crosswords and then customising them. \u201cI always had words and rhymes running round in my head,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me absent-minded. When I was a postman, I kept missing the turnings, walking up to the wrong house.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"985f0d9d4185568f8514ceda2587f910182d2ffc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/985f0d9d4185568f8514ceda2587f910182d2ffc/0_0_501_800/313.jpg\" alt=\"High on Rust by Ray Webber\" width=\"313\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yet what\u2019s striking about Webber\u2019s work is how expansive it is. It\u2019s a great yawp to the world \u2013 it demands to be noticed. Why squirrel these poems away in the shadows? Isn\u2019t it the duty of all writers to communicate with the public? Webber\u2019s unconvinced, fearing I\u2019m being elitist. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I was doing,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cAnd I was doing it on a daily basis. You don\u2019t need poetry or any other art form to communicate with people or to have an effect on their lives.\u201d</p> <p>In the mid-70s he briefly broke cover, entering a competition arranged by the Bristol Evening Post. Even handing in the envelope, he figured his chances were good. \u201cI was cobbling together lines that made no obvious sense, because I was very influenced by Burroughs\u2019 cut-up prose. I thought, \u2018One thing\u2019s for certain: no one\u2019s writing a poem like that about Bristol.\u2019 Then my nephew opened the paper and said, \u2018You bastard, you won.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>He was invited to join the <a href=\"http://www.poetrysoc.com/content/publications/poetrynews/pn2002/bristol/\">Bristol poetry society</a>.

I read the thing from cover to cover. I\u2019m not seeing much evidence of a wife and family in there. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI was always scared by that. I didn\u2019t think I was a suitable candidate for marriage. That was because of my own general inadequacy. All sorts of neurotic feelings. I had one or two periods of anxiety and depression.

If I could start over, just to let my imagination run wild, I\u2019d get into further education by hook or by crook. I\u2019d go for English lit and philosophy.

  "<p>When six senior Italian detectives arrived in Cairo in early February, following the discovery of the brutally battered body of 28-year-old Italian PhD student Giulio Regeni, they faced long odds of solving the mystery of his disappearance and death. Egyptian officials had told reporters that Regeni had probably been hit by a car, but clear signs of torture on his body had raised an alarm in Rome.</p> <p>The Egyptian authorities guaranteed \u201cfull cooperation\u201d, but this was quickly revealed to be a hollow promise. The Italians were allowed to question witnesses \u2013 but only for a few minutes, after the Egyptian police had finished their own much longer interrogations, and with the Egyptian police still in the room. The Italians requested the video footage from the metro station where Regeni last used his mobile phone, but the Egyptians allowed several days to elapse, by which time the footage from the day of his disappearance had been taped over. They also refused to share the mobile phone records from the area around Regeni\u2019s home, where he disappeared on 25 January, and the site where his body was found nine days later.</p> <p>One of the Egyptian chief investigators in charge of the Regeni case, Major General Khaled Shalaby, who told the press that there were no signs of foul play, is a controversial figure. Convicted of kidnapping and torture over a decade ago, he escaped with a suspended sentence.<strong> </strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/21/who-murdered-giulio-regeni-podcast\">Who murdered Giulio Regeni? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Egyptians may well have hoped that the outside world, with no independent information, would have little choice but to accept their unsatisfying explanation for Regeni\u2019s death. But in the digital age, getting away with murder has become more difficult.</p> <p>About 10 days after the recovery of Regeni\u2019s body, Italian prosecutor Sergio Colaiocco and a couple of police officers travelled to Regeni\u2019s hometown of Fiumicello, in north-eastern Italy, to attend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/12/giulio-regeni-funeral-in-italy-for-student-found-dead-in-cairo\">his funeral</a>. It would be a rare opportunity to question many key witnesses in the case, gathered in one place.</p> <p>The family had asked guests not to bring cameras, or to carry signs of protest, preferring a simple, sober ceremony. But more than 3,000 mourners attended the service, most of them spilling out of a school gymnasium into the street. The funeral turned the town of less than 5,000 people into a kind of miniature United Nations \u2013 a tribute to Regeni\u2019s short but global life.</p> <p>There were friends from the US, where he had studied during high school; from Latin America, a region he knew well; from the UK, where he had done both university and graduate studies; from Germany and Austria, where he had worked; and from Egypt, where he had lived since November 2015, researching the trade union movement for his Cambridge doctorate. \u201cWe put people up in the houses of friends according to which languages they had in common,\u201d said Paola Regeni, Giulio\u2019s mother, who works as a teacher.</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not only did the police have the chance to question witnesses, they received an unexpected bonus. In a gesture of astonishing openness, Giulio Regeni\u2019s grieving friends and relatives handed over their phones and laptops to the Italian police. As members of the Facebook generation, they were used to living transparently, ceding chunks of their privacy as the price for living in a connected world. If it could shed some light on the circumstances of Giulio\u2019s death, they were prepared to share their personal data.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s parents also gave the police his computer, which they had taken from his Cairo apartment after he disappeared. This, together with the mass of emails and text messages collected from his friends, has allowed Italian prosecutors to work around the holes in the evidence provided by the Egyptian government, and to reconstruct Regeni\u2019s world.</p> <p>The prosecutors also obtained another vital piece of evidence: Regeni\u2019s battered corpse, which, after an extremely thorough autopsy in Italy, has told them volumes about the final nine days of his life, from the time of his disappearance to the time his body was dumped in a concrete channel beside the road from Cairo to Alexandria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53ee9ab2162a79285cde5fd35da0d4ef582cab7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53ee9ab2162a79285cde5fd35da0d4ef582cab7a/211_0_864_864/500.jpg\" alt=\"Giulio Regeni.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giulio Regeni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While this evidence will almost certainly not be enough to help Italian investigators identify Regeni\u2019s killers by name, it has<strong> </strong>allowed them to refute a series of lies from the Egyptian government about Regini\u2019s murder \u2013 and keep up pressure on Egypt for hard information about his killing.</p> <p>Italian prosecutors recently made an important breakthrough: the Egyptian government agreed to hand over mobile phone records from both the area where Regeni was last seen, and the place where his body was found.<strong> </strong>Perhaps even more important, during a visit to Rome in early September, Egyptian prosecutors admitted for the first time that Regeni had been under police surveillance before his disappearance.</p> <p>The Egyptian government continues to deny that it had any involvement in Regeni\u2019s death. Over the past eight months, Italian investigators have peeled away layers of false leads, attempted cover-ups, and phony evidence, to build a clearer picture of what happened to Giulio Regeni than at first seemed possible.<strong> </strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u201cI am going out,\u201d Regeni texted his girlfriend at 7.41pm on 25 January 2016.

It is, in fact, a crucial clue to understanding his disappearance and murder. It was the fifth anniversary of the Egyptian revolution of 2011, and the massive demonstrations in Tahrir Square that brought the Arab Spring to Egypt and led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-egypt-cairo\">ousting of President Hosni Mubarak</a>. The date has a totemic significance for the regime of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, for whom it represents a traumatic climbdown \u2013 a moment in which the military\u2019s apparently unassailable grip on power seemed to slip. As a result, the army had been forced to accept the trial of Mubarak and the election of Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi, posing a serious threat to its position in Egyptian life. Such a thing could never be allowed to occur again.</p> <p>When Sisi and the military took control of the government and arrested Morsi in July 2013, Morsi supporters occupied two public squares and staged sit-ins, hoping for a repeat of the peaceful revolution in Tahrir Square. But this time Sisi sent in tanks and soldiers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/egypt-braced-violence-morsi-supporters\">massacred at least 1,000 people</a>.</p> <p>Although Sisi came to power himself in the wake of mass demonstrations against Morsi, he seems to live in terror of the crowd. One of his first official acts was to ban any unauthorised assembly of more than 10 people. And each anniversary of the Tahrir Square uprising has brought bloodshed. In 2014, Sisi\u2019s government killed more than 60 protesters around the country at the time of the anniversary. A year later, 25 people were killed, including a woman poet who tried to lay a wreath of flowers in the square.</p> <p>In the days before his disappearance, computer records show that Regeni had laid low, mostly staying inside his apartment. He probably knew that the Egyptian authorities were working themselves up to a fever pitch in anticipation of the anniversary. Police had reportedly searched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/egyptian-police-raid-cairo-homes-2011-uprising\">5,000 apartments in Cairo</a>, in an effort to intimidate anyone who might be planning a demonstration. The raids were mostly concentrated in downtown Cairo, and did not include Regeni\u2019s apartment in the Dokki neighbourhood of Giza, a separate city that includes the site of the ancient pyramids.</p> <p>Although Regeni\u2019s mother had asked him to remain at home, where it was safe, he decided to attend the birthday party of a friend on the evening of 25 January. Downtown Cairo appeared to have returned to normal by nightfall and he and another<strong> </strong>friend agreed to meet at their usual place, not far from Tahrir Square. And so, Regeni walked into the force field of police activity in central Cairo, at its point of greatest alert.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"404bcab5e086e105b1fd3a399ed7d05707635795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/404bcab5e086e105b1fd3a399ed7d05707635795/0_81_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tahrir Square is almost deserted and heavily policed on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 25 January uprising.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tahrir Square is almost deserted and heavily policed on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 25 January uprising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 21 April, Reuters reported that Regeni had been picked up on the night of his disappearance by Egyptian police in downtown Cairo, near the Nasser metro stop. The news agency claimed that he was taken to a local police station for half an hour, then transferred to a Homeland Security compound in the area. The Egyptian government categorically denied the story, insisting that Regeni had never been in police custody. Reuters has stuck by its story, citing six independent but anonymous sources \u2013 three in the police and three in the security services. After publishing the report, Reuters\u2019 Cairo bureau chief was threatened with criminal prosecution and left the country. Egyptian police recently detained an Egyptian Reuters reporter for unspecified reasons.</p> <p>In May of this year, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior accidentally leaked an internal memo proposing a ban on all press coverage of the Regeni case.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is unclear whether Regeni\u2019s arrest was planned, or the result of a random sweep, but once they had him in custody, Egyptian authorities would have been quick to realise that they already had a file on him. \u201cThere is no question that he would have been monitored,\u201d said Marie Duboc, a French scholar who now teaches at the University of T\u00fcbingen, in Germany. Like Regeni, she has studied Egyptian labour unions. \u201cEven historical research that would seem harmless to any outsider, is still extremely sensitive in Egypt.\u201d</p> <p>Duboc lived under surveillance from 2008 to 2010, when she was in Cairo, working on her own PhD. \u201cI would get strange phone calls from the Ministry of Higher Education, asking about my research,\u201d she told me. Later, when she visited Egypt to do follow-up work, she was turned away at the airport and barred from entering the country. Clearly, her name had been placed on a blacklist. (She has subsequently been allowed to return, she said.)</p> <p>Independent labour unions are a particularly sensitive topic in Egypt under the Sisi government, because unions were seen as a key galvanising force in the 2011 revolution. Traditionally, labour unions were government-run \u2013 more a means of controlling workers than representing their interests. The first independent trade union was formed in 2009, but the movement truly took flight after Tahrir Square. A thousand independent labour unions sprouted up after the fall of Mubarak and<strong>,</strong> within days of the 2011 revolution, the first federation of independent unions was formed. Many democracy advocates in and outside Egypt, including Giulio Regeni and his Cambridge supervisor, the Egyptian political scientist Maha Abdelrahman, regarded the independent trade union movement as a positive development, with the potential to strengthen civil society, democratic participation and workers\u2019 rights \u2013 all things that seem threatening to a military regime determined to repress autonomous sources of power.<strong> </strong></p> <p>On 11 December, six weeks before he disappeared, Regeni attended a public meeting of the independent unions. He was impressed by their combative energy and wrote an enthusiastic article about it, together with a friend, which they published (in Italian) under a pseudonym. But something disconcerting happened at the meeting: although Regeni sat to the side and was not on the roster of speakers, a woman in a headscarf came over and photographed him. Regeni was shaken and told several friends about it. It was the first sign that he might be being watched.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s particular area of research was a nascent independent union of street vendors, a large group that was difficult to control and a cause of considerable concern to the government. Egypt has an estimated five million street vendors, who sell everything from snacks and drinks to cheap clothes and kitchen utensils. In a country of 80 to 90 million people, as many as a quarter of Egyptian families depend to some degree on the income of a street vendor.</p> <p>The Sisi government regards these workers with clear suspicion. Street vendors moved rapidly into Tahrir Square during the massive demonstrations of 2011. Most were simply looking to make a little money, selling food and drink to protesters, but their very presence was viewed by the authorities as aiding and abetting the revolution. Since then, the government has sought unsuccessfully to remove street vendors from the centre of Cairo, using fines, prison sentences and violence.</p> <p>\u201cAfter repeated failures to clear Cairo\u2019s city centre of street vendors \u2026 the Cairo governorate issued a shrewd decree,\u201d wrote Abdelrahman, in an article she published last year. The decree required store owners to report any street vendors working near their shops, or risk losing their own trading licenses. This served a dual purpose of forcing shopkeepers to keep tabs on street vendors for the government and pushing the vendors into the hands of the police.</p> <p>In order to remain on the street and avoid police harassment, street vendors were themselves expected to let police know of anything or anyone unusual or suspicious.<strong> </strong>\u201cOne of the things that has happened in Egypt in the past few years, which we didn\u2019t fully recognise, is that the street pedlars are frequently used as police informants,\u201d said one Cambridge scholar, who preferred not to be named.<strong> </strong>Scattered around the city, present on nearly every block and square, the street vendors form a natural surveillance network.</p> <p>For his doctorate, Regeni was engaged in what is known as \u201cparticipatory research\u201d \u2013 a method that involves spending substantial amounts of time in the field with one\u2019s subjects. While this is standard practice, a young Arabic-speaking foreigner, hanging out for hours in street markets, and asking about unionisation, future organising plans and attitudes toward the government, is likely to have looked extremely suspicious to most Egyptians \u2013 who have been told over and over to be on the lookout for foreign agents.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s good intentions may also have blinded him to how his actions could have been interpreted. During the autumn of 2015,<strong> </strong>he had learned of a grant of up to \u00a310,000 issued by a British foundation to fund a development project. He was interested in applying because he could use the money to support his own PhD research and help the people he was studying. He mentioned his idea to a leader of the independent street vendors\u2019 union, Mohamed Abdallah. Abdallah\u2019s level of interest \u2013 in the money, rather than the project \u2013 worried Regeni. As a result, Regeni dropped the idea. Still, news of a young well-funded foreigner, ready to finance an internal Egyptian movement, may have struck police as exactly the kind of foreign conspiracy they wanted to stamp out.</p> <p>Those most familiar with Regeni\u2019s work in Egypt dismiss the idea that he could have discovered anything valuable or threatening to the Egyptian government. \u201cGiulio had been out doing field work, talking to street pedlars, maybe six or seven times,\u201d says one of his close friends in Cairo. \u201cHe would have known only a fraction of what any of the Egyptian government\u2019s informants would have been able to tell them.\u201d Even the independent union meeting that he attended and wrote about was a well-publicised event, authorised and monitored by the authorities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"edbfbf755b25d3d9eaac61083f8a0321e4f734b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edbfbf755b25d3d9eaac61083f8a0321e4f734b6/0_0_4832_2899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street vendor near Tahrir Square, in 2013.

One of Sisi\u2019s first moves was to make the chief of the federation of independent unions his minister of labour, an appointment intended to co-opt the movement and bring it under government control. Just this summer, in a further threat to their independence, a new measure was introduced, forcing the independents to re-register or risk decertification.</p> <p>And yet, to a government on constant alert to security threats, there may have been much in the meeting that Regeni attended \u2013 and in the article he wrote about it \u2013 that the government would have found alarming. One of the proposals was for a \u201cseries of regional conferences that lead after a few months to a large national assembly and perhaps a unitary protest (\u201cTo Tahrir!\u201d said several of those present.)</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s article ends with a few sentences that look like fighting words. \u201cIn the repressive context of the Sisi government, the fact that there are popular and spontaneous initiatives that break the wall of fear is significant and represent in and of themselves an important push for change.</p> <p>\u201cTo challenge the state of emergency, the government\u2019s appeals to stability and social harmony in the name of the \u2018war on terrorism\u2019, means today, even indirectly, to challenge the very basis on which this regime bases its existence and its repression of civil society.\u201d</p> <p>On 7 January, just a month after the union meeting, Mohamed Abdallah denounced Regeni to the authorities. After Regeni\u2019s death, he told the Arabic-language newspaper Aswat Masriya that he became suspicious of Regeni because his questions \u201cwere not about street vendors \u2026 and had other intentions \u2026 I am not an informant but I believe I am protecting my country.\u201d</p> <p>The Egyptian government says that as a result of Abdallah\u2019s tip-off, it placed Regeni under investigation, but decided after a few days that his research was of \u201cno interest to national security\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During the nine days after his disappearance, Regeni\u2019s case became an international cause celebre, inspiring the Twitter hashtag #whereisgiulio? It was also a source of serious concern at the Italian Embassy in Cairo, which was preparing for the visit of a major business delegation, led by the Italian minister of economic development, Federica Guidi. On 3 February, while Guidi was meeting with Sisi and other Egyptian officials, a mini-van driver got a puncture on the road from Cairo to Alexandria. While fixing his flat tyre, he discovered Giulio Regeni\u2019s body.</p> <p>The Egyptian forensic expert who first examined the corpse initially said that the multiple signs of torture suggested Regeni had suffered a \u201cslow death\u201d. This claim, however, was quickly retracted. The deputy head of criminal investigations in Giza, the city where the body was found, told the Associated Press that initial investigations showed Regeni was killed in a road accident.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Regeni case had become a huge story in Italy. In the following days, as pressure mounted, Egyptian officials began floating various theories in the local press: that Regeni was gay and the victim of a crime of passion, that he was involved in a drug deal gone bad, or that he was a foreign spy.</p> <p>Upon further investigation, these theories fell apart. The digital record in the possession of Italian investigators showed that Regeni had a girlfriend in Ukraine, and there were Skype logs, emails and texts to prove it. His computer, email and bank records showed no trace of contact with any intelligence services. \u201cWe had his bank accounts, which showed he had almost no money,\u201d said Alessandra Ballerini, the lawyer for the Regeni family. \u201cThis is a boy who wore his father\u2019s old bathing suit and used his mother\u2019s old backpack because he didn\u2019t want to be a financial burden to his family.\u201d</p> <p>Most important was the rigorous second autopsy carried out in Italy, using Cat scans and tissue analysis. The Egyptian pathologist\u2019s report had said that Regeni was killed by a blow to the head. More detailed analysis in Italy showed that he had been hit repeatedly on the head, but that these blows were not fatal. Blood had coagulated around the points where he had been hit, and other cuts, bruises and abrasions on his body showed different stages of healing. This indicated that Regeni had been tortured more than once \u2013 and that days had passed between his initial torture, later sessions, and the moment of his death. He was covered with cuts and burns, and his hands and feet had been broken. Even his teeth were broken. His torturers appear to have carved letters into his flesh, a well-documented practice of the Egyptian police.</p> <p>The forensic doctors at the University of Rome used a highly accurate technique for determining time of death, which measures potassium levels in the vitreous fluid of the eyes. They established that Regeni died between 10pm on 1 February and 10pm on 2 February. \u201cThis is important because it means that he was alive for at least six or seven days and tortured repeatedly during that time,\u201d said one Italian investigator. The cause of death was a broken neck. Regeni\u2019s mother believes that this was the work of professional torturers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3b395fa54414c17628221af1275c57cdc032393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b395fa54414c17628221af1275c57cdc032393/1649_116_1602_2003/800.jpg\" alt=\"Giulio Regeni\u2019s mother, Paola, believes he was murdered by professional torturers.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giulio Regeni\u2019s mother, Paola, believes he was murdered by professional torturers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remo Casilli/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The strength of the autopsy evidence forced the Egyptian authorities to abandon the implausible theories of accidental death and begin a new public relations offensive. Sisi suddenly granted an interview to the editor-in-chief of the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, which was published on 16 March and dominated by the Regeni case. As the autopsy evidence implicated the Egyptian police, Sisi seemed to suggest that Regeni\u2019s death was part of an elaborate conspiracy.</p> <p>\u201cWhy was the body found right when the minister of economic development and the Italian delegation were here to strengthen our cooperation?\u201d he asked. Sisi also mentioned the shooting down of a Russian tourist airliner in October 2015. \u201cRussian tourism and Italian tourism [in Egypt] have collapsed to nothing \u2026 Fill in the dots of these different episodes and you have a clear picture of an attempt to strike the Egyptian economy and isolate Egypt.\u201d</p> <p>Just days later, in early March, a witness stepped forward with a new hypothesis. An Egyptian engineer claimed that he had seen Regeni, on the afternoon before his disappearance, having a furious argument with another foreigner near the Italian consulate. The engineer, Mohammed Fawzy, then appeared on a popular Egyptian TV programme to say that he thought that the Italian government knew who killed Regeni, but was hiding the evidence. Echoing Sisi, Fawzy speculated that whoever killed Regeni was trying to sabotage commercial relations between Egypt and Italy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Relatives of the alleged criminal gang have insisted that its members were killed in cold blood at close range</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The engineer\u2019s story collapsed when the Italian prosecutors\u2019<strong> </strong>digital archive showed that Regeni had been at home all afternoon on 24 January. He had been on Skype with his girlfriend, chatting as they streamed the same movie and watched it together, 3,500km apart. Mobile phone records also showed that the engineer was not in the neighbourhood of the Italian consulate in Cairo at the time of the alleged quarrel.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, on 24 March, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior announced a definitive resolution to the case. The ministry announced on its Facebook page that the perpetrators were a gang of four men \u201cspecialised in impersonating policemen, kidnapping foreigners and stealing their money\u201d.</p> <p>As proof, the government displayed a tray of objects that included Regeni\u2019s passport, Italian identity card, a credit card and his ID card from Cambridge University. Not only had the Egyptian police found the culprits, they had already killed them. \u201cIn an exchange of fire between police forces and the men,\u201d the ministry explained, \u201call the gang members were killed.\u201d</p> <p>However, phone records placed the leader of the gang more than 100km away from Cairo at the time of Regeni\u2019s disappearance. Relatives of the alleged criminal gang have insisted that its members were killed in cold blood at close range, rather than in a shootout. The government\u2019s scenario also made little sense: why would a band of thieves keep Regeni\u2019s identity cards, given that they would provide incriminating evidence that tied them to the crime? Why would they torture a robbery victim for a week without ever asking for ransom money or using his credit card? Egyptian officials have now accepted that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/new-twist-in-case-of-italian-student-giulio-regenis-in-egypt\">is unlikely the dead men had anything to do with Regeni\u2019s death</a>. In fact, by producing Regeni\u2019s passport and identity cards, the Egyptian police have apparently incriminated themselves.</p> <p>The string of improbable cover stories was becoming an embarrassment even in Egypt. In a rare public rebuke, Mohammed Abdel-Hadi Allam, the editor-in-chief of al-Ahram, a government-owned newspaper, wrote: \u201cThe naive stories about Regeni\u2019s death have hurt Egypt at home and abroad and offered some people grounds to judge what is going on in the country now to be no different from what went on before the 25 January revolution.\u201d He compared the Regeni case to that of Khaled Said, a young Egyptian who had been seized by police in an internet cafe in 2010, and beaten to death. Photographs of Said\u2019s body taken by his brother were posted on Facebook and became an important rallying cry for the protesters who helped bring down Hosni Mubarak.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite clear indications of involvement by the nation\u2019s security forces, the Egyptian government is left with what might be called the stupidity defence. As the Egyptian ambassador to Rome put it: \u201cWe\u2019re not so naive as to kill a young Italian and throw away his body the day of Minister Guidi\u2019s visit to Cairo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are two theories,\u201d said Karim Abdelrady, an Egyptian human rights lawyer. \u201cOne is that there is a feud between the Egyptian secret services, and one branch dumped the body in order to embarrass the other.\u201d A long, detailed anonymous letter that was sent to the Italian embassy in Bern, Switzerland and published by La Repubblica described complicated machinations within different branches of the Egyptian secret services, and reported that Regeni\u2019s body had been wrapped in an Egyptian army blanket, as if to direct suspicion towards the military police. But Italian investigators say that they have no way to confirm or deny the information in this document.</p> <p>\u201cThe other theory,\u201d explained Abdelrady, \u201cis that the Egyptian police thought they could get away with it by blaming a band of criminals, and that people would not think the Egyptian police would be so stupid as to leave the body where it could be found.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis case cannot be understood without understanding the context of generalised paranoia in the country,\u201d said one foreign scholar who has lived in Cairo for many years. \u201cFor the last three years, many high-level government officials, including members of the military, have spoken publicly about foreign conspiracies to undermine Egypt. This is bound to seep down to all levels of the police and military.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b46d91361a968c7e8420a72690d3578effa7635b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b46d91361a968c7e8420a72690d3578effa7635b/0_40_550_550/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Egyptian government put Giulio Regeni\u2019s possessions on display in an attempt to prove they had found his killers.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Egyptian government put Giulio Regeni\u2019s possessions on display in an attempt to prove they had found his killers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost immediately after taking over during the summer of 2013, the Sisi regime seemed anxious to stress that the 2011 revolution was not the result of popular dissatisfaction, but collusion between outside powers and Egyptian subversives.</p> <p>Since then, the human rights situation in Egypt \u2013 which was never good under Mubarak \u2013 has continued to deteriorate. There are now an estimated 40,000 political prisoners. Between late January and November 2015, Egypt\u2019s Al Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence documented 281 extrajudicial killings, 119 murders of prisoners in detention, 440 cases of torture in police stations,<strong> </strong>and 335 forced disappearances. After documenting these cases, the Nadeem Center was forced to shut down, allegedly for violating its charter as a medical organisation.</p> <p>While in the past, Egypt had tried to avoid trouble with foreigners, it now seemed intent on making public examples of them. \u201cGiulio died like an Egyptian,\u201d says Ballerini, the Regeni family\u2019s lawyer.</p> <p>The climate of xenophobia and police brutality in Egypt has raised questions for Italian prosecutors as to whether it was appropriate for Cambridge University to allow a young foreign student<strong> </strong>to go Cairo and undertake field research into such a delicate topic. Regeni\u2019s supervisor, Maha Abdelrahman, is very knowledgeable on this subject: she has been a vocal critic of Egypt\u2019s military governments and has written extensively about the country\u2019s unions and protest movements. In early 2015, she wrote about the tendency of turning ordinary citizens into police informants and the increasing criminalisation of previously harmless activities.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Relations between the Italian investigators and Cambridge University got off to a bad start when Abdelrahman declined to hand over her emails and text messages after the funeral. She also kept the police waiting for three hours, turning up for her interview at the police station at 10pm. Abdelrahman\u2019s reluctance to hand over her personal data is understandable, given her background \u2013 she had grown up in Egypt under a military regime, when a person would never have given anything to the police if they could help it. Abdelrahman has chosen not to speak to the press since Regeni\u2019s death, but told colleagues at Cambridge that she cooperated with the Italian police the day of the funeral.</p> <p>The Italian prosecutors have been keen to find out whose idea it was that Regeni should write his PhD dissertation on independent unions, and the street vendors\u2019 union especially. When detectives asked her whether she had pushed Regeni to pursue his research into that particular topic, or if she had been aware that he might have felt in danger, Abdelrahman felt that she was being treated like a suspect.</p> <p>The lead prosecutor, Sergio Colaiocco, travelled to England in June, having sent a request to two Cambridge professors for an interview. The university says it received no notification from the Italian government, but learned of the request informally from Cambridge police. The two professors initially agreed to meet with the prosecutor, but then declined to be interviewed. This prompted a brief firestorm, with the Italian deputy foreign minister, Mario Giro, taking to Twitter to shame Cambridge for its lack of cooperation. An Italian professor who teaches at Oxford, Federico Varese, also criticised Cambridge in an interview with La Repubblica: \u201cThe university bears some measure of moral responsibility for not protecting [Regeni] and not grasping that the kind of \u2018participatory research\u2019 he was doing increased the risk. It seems that their priority is only to protect Cambridge from possible legal responsibility and a request for damages.\u201d</p> <p>In June, Cambridge\u2019s vice-chancellor and a number of academics signed a letter stating that the university had not received any request for help from the Italian authorities, and that Regeni had no particular reason to be afraid for his safety, since \u201cno foreign student, researcher or academic\u201d had ever been murdered in Egypt. The university subsequently hired an Italian attorney to facilitate relations with the Italian government and has received, and fully complied with, a request for various documents in the Regeni case.</p> <p>\u201cI think this polemic with Cambridge has been overblown,\u201d said one close friend of Regeni\u2019s in Egypt. He pointed out that Abdelrahman had continued to do the same kind of field research that Regeni was pursuing. \u201cShe was not a professor who remained in the library and sent out her students to do field work. The truth about Giulio\u2019s murder is in Egypt, not Cambridge, in the increasing paranoia of the regime.\u201d</p> <p>In December, 2015, he said, Egyptian police detained a young French scholar who was conducting research on a workers\u2019 movement, keeping her in jail overnight. \u201cThese kinds of things had been happening more often \u2013 but they go unreported because the scholars don\u2019t say anything, so that they can return to Egypt in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The Egyptian government\u2019s softer and more cooperative approach in the last few months suggests, however, that it now accepts an urgent need for reputation management. The government and the Regeni family have agreed, in principle, to meet, which the family hopes will push the investigation another few steps closer to the truth.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s death is a mystery hiding in plain sight: his seemingly inexplicable, brutal torture and killing reflects the demise of Egyptian democracy, the stripping away of already limited liberties and protections, the brutal crackdown on dissent, the increase in torture and forced disappearances, the tendency to blame the country\u2019s problems on outside conspiracies. In this closed world, Giulio Regeni, with his ability to speak five languages, his mobile phone full of foreign and Egyptian contacts, might look like a spy, and police, in a system with little or no accountability, might make reckless mistakes.</p> <p>The Egyptian prosecutors seemed unable to understand why their Italian colleagues did not accept the evidence they were given. \u201cThe Egyptian authorities seemed shocked that our police kept asking questions after they came up with the \u2018gang\u2019 of killers and the tray with Regeni\u2019s documents,\u201d said one Italian investigator. \u201cTheir attitude seemed to be: \u2018hey, we found the criminals, we have even killed them. This should put an end to it.\u2019\u201d Surely, they thought, concerns of state \u2013 the close relations between two nations, billions of dollars of commercial ties \u2013 should count more than the life of one person, who had been killed by mistake. They seemed to find it impossible to understand that the Italian government would have to account to public opinion and could not, even if it had wanted to, accept a flimsy, implausible account of Regeni\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThis didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d Heba Morayef, an Egyptian human rights advocate, said. \u201cIt came after three years of almost constant rising xenophobic propaganda, fed by the security services, encouraging citizens\u2019 arrests of foreigners, and so on \u2026 There are so many people in the Egyptian security forces that talk about this foreign conspiracy, that more and more people start to believe it.

  "<p>A record number of people and organisations have been nominated for the 2016 Nobel peace prize, which will be announced on Friday. This year 376 candidates \u2013 228 individuals and 148 organisations \u2013 are in contention for the award. </p> <p>The selection of Nobel prizewinners is always shrouded in secrecy \u2013 the names of nominees are not released until 50 years after the decision is made, which makes predicting difficult, but here are some of those that Guardian writers think have a greater chance.</p> <h2>Syrian White Helmets</h2> <p>During the past five years of war in Syria, the White Helmets, a group of volunteer rescue workers, have run towards bombs in opposition-held areas to rescue tens of thousands \u2013 by some estimates up to 60,000 people \u2013 from the ruins and battlefields.</p> <p>There has been no more dangerous place in the world to be a first responder for most of that time. The ranks of the group, made up of pre-war Syria\u2019s middle classes, have lost 160 of their own, most killed by jets that have returned to target buildings they had already bombed.</p> <p>They are often the first on the scene of any airstrike, picking through rubble and cradling the dead and injured, wearing the distinctive white helmets that gave them their name. Their motto throughout Syria\u2019s withering conflict has been \u201cto save one life is to save all of humanity\u201d.</p> <p>The volunteers have been one of the few signs of hope in a desperate and destructive war that otherwise shows little mercy. They have been hailed across rebel areas of Syria and in Europe as a model of community cooperation and coexistence \u2013 and of success. Russian and Syrian attacks on medical centres have tried to deny care to the dying, but the White Helmets have defied that, giving comfort and life-saving care where no one else can.</p> <p>Their work has made them a prized military target for pro-regime forces, who regularly attack ambulances as soon as they arrive at the scene of a strike. The lethal threat has not been a deterrent; to many among the White Helmets it has instead been an incentive to continue serving. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Martin Chulov</em></p> <h2>Angela Merkel</h2> <p>Were Angela Merkel to win the Nobel peace prize it would hang like an albatross around her neck.

They are asking whether the influx of refugees \u2013 more than 1 million last year, and several hundreds of thousands expected by the end of this year \u2013 is making Germany a less secure place. They also worry about the impact of refugees on integration, gender equality, public services and the labour market.</p> <p>Merkel is under huge pressure to show her government is able to deal with such concerns. In his speech to the UN refugee summit in New York in September, Barack Obama thanked Merkel and the Germans for their efforts in dealing with the refugee crisis, an example of the moral pressure Merkel is under to ensure she does not do a U-turn despite growing domestic pressure.</p> <p>Merkel would be the first to agree she does not need a Nobel peace prize to add to the pressure, and the jury should do her and Germany a favour by waiting, at the very least, until she retires. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Kate Connolly</em></p> <h2>Pope Francis</h2> <p>No pope has ever won the Nobel peace prize before, but Francis is seen as a frontrunner for the accolade this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c111f4b0d777fa9981e8cd0bbdac25c5b6b9a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c111f4b0d777fa9981e8cd0bbdac25c5b6b9a29/0_0_2141_2674/801.jpg\" alt=\"Pope Francis.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pope Francis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Sekretarev/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since becoming pontiff three-and-a-half years ago, he has won the hearts of millions of people \u2013 not only Catholics \u2013 across the world for his strong stance on issues such as refugees, poverty and climate change. </p> <p>Francis has repeatedly implored politicians and citizens to offer a generous welcome to refugees.

Entitled <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/philippines0409webwcover_0.pdf\">You Can Die At Any Time</a>, it detailed evidence of complicity and at times direct involvement between government officials and the police in the squads. That same year Duterte said that criminals were a \u201clegitimate target of assassination\u201d.<br></p> <p>According to the report, police officers would give death squad members lists of targets. After being notified of the murders by members of the public, authorities were slow to respond, even when they occurred just minutes away from police stations.<br></p> <p>The report describes how the Davao police often failed to collect obvious pieces of evidence such as used bullet casings or question witnesses or suspects, instead pressuring the families of victims to identify the killers.

Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, Pence has taken the draconian position that the US should stop taking refugees from Syria because vetting processes are inadequate, in their eyes. A refugee who wants to come to the US must pass through interviews, background and medical checks by the Department of Homeland Security, US security agencies, immigration services and the UN, and the process takes 18 months to two years.</p> <p>Posner wrote that Pence\u2019s idea of exclusion by nationality is: \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating.

This year, the Trump Foundation made its most wide-ranging request for donations yet: It set up a public website, donaldtrumpforvets.com, to gather donations that Trump said would be passed on to veterans\u2019 groups.</p> <p>But the Trump Foundation never registered under article 7A of New York\u2019s Executive Law, as is required for any charity soliciting more than $25,000 a year from the public.

The president sat down with Jonathan Chait to discuss five key situations during his presidency: the Republicans, Obamacare, BP oil spill, Cuba and drones.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very in-depth chat with Obama, who delves into what sort of legacy he\u2019ll leave behind. Here he is on drone strikes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I will say, though, is that the critique of drones has been important, because it has ensured that you don\u2019t have this institutional comfort and inertia with what looks like a pretty antiseptic way of disposing of enemies. I will say that what prompted a lot of the internal reforms we put in place had less to do with what the left or <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/donate-now?ea.tracking.id=ED2016EVSCgl&amp;gclid=CJuEsvCouM8CFQEkhgodwA4PCA\">Human Rights Watch</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/\">Amnesty International</a> or other organizations were saying and had more to do with me looking at sort of the way in which the number of drone strikes was going up and the routineness with which, early in my presidency, you were seeing both DOD and CIA and our intelligence teams think about this. And it troubled me, because I think you could see, over the horizon, a situation in which, without Congress showing much interest in restraining actions with authorizations that were written really broadly, you end up with a president who can carry on perpetual wars all over the world, and a lot of them covert, without any accountability or democratic debate.</p> <p>But I will say that having these nonprofits continue to question and protest ensured that, having made that initial decision, we kept on going and that it got pushed all the way through. And it\u2019s not \u2014 as I announced when we released our best estimates of the civilian casualties \u2014 it\u2019s not a perfect solution. I think America will continue to have work to do in finding this balance between not elevating every terrorist attack into a full-blown war but not either leaving ourselves exposed to attacks or, alternatively, pretending as if we can just take shots wherever we want, whenever we want, and not be answerable to anybody. What I\u2019ve tried to do is to move the needle in the right direction, to set some trends in the right direction.

There\u2019s also Yordanos, whose story we will illuminate in a moment. </p> <p>After introducing the four key subjects \u2013 none of whom had professional acting experience \u2013 Horin\u2019s documentary poses a question she has spent a lot of time contemplating: how do women survive something like this? </p> <p>\u201cI have arrived at the conclusion that you can survive and reconstruct your life but it is absolutely dependent on breaking your silence,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cBeing able tell your story and have it acknowledged and heard and validated. </p> <p>\u201cJust imagine having this deep dark secret inside you that you feel you can\u2019t mention to anyone. It\u2019s like having a rock inside your stomach. Like this thing that\u2019s constantly pulling you down.\u201d</p> <p>Yordanos\u2019 journey to regain her life involved combining the theatre production with ongoing weekly counselling. When she was a young child, she watched her father kill her mother. When she was five years old, she was taken and trained to be a child soldier by the Eritrean army. For a decade and a half she suffered violence and sexual abuse. </p> <p>Preparing the play required extensively workshopping sessions to find ways to tell each person\u2019s stories. This meant Yordanos and the rest of the group had to revisit the trauma of their pasts, session after session, week after week. All this before getting on stage and reliving it, again and again, in front of strangers. It became too much for her. Four weeks in, Yordanos suffered an emotional collapse and quit. </p> <p>\u201cI felt tired and drained and I couldn\u2019t continue,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things that happened. I was five when I was kidnapped. From that age until my teenage life, I was in that place. While making this I had so many flashbacks and I couldn\u2019t cope with all of that. </p> <p>\u201cI felt like the best thing for me was to withdraw. Just, get away from me, I don\u2019t want to be telling this again. But my counsellor thought I was strong enough to go back and continue it. That is what I did. I was so grateful I got to finish it. </p> <p>\u201cIn my life I have been voiceless. But to stand there and speak in such a way, to say \u2018this is what happened to me and I\u2019m explaining it\u2019, I think it has huge power.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52dd7531f209d528e17af52e90e4d5009f8bb4bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52dd7531f209d528e17af52e90e4d5009f8bb4bb/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yordanos Haile-Michael\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yordanos Haile-Michael was a young child when she watched her father kill her mother.

These conversations tended to be marked by long stretches of silence, she says, eventually broken by \u201cone voice which would pipe up and say, \u2018Yes, this pain is coming out. But I can\u2019t tell you how much better I feel.\u2019\u201d <br></p> <p>The director used various techniques to protect the women from revisiting the most painful aspects of their stories. Instead of Aminata reading out a court testimony detailing her rape, for example, Horin swapped roles, so Aminata became the lawyer character and a friend played her. This sort of approach was used with each of the women in various ways, including through video footage and songs. </p> <p>\u201cIf somebody was very fragile and they were observing aspects of their story I could say to them, \u2018Tonight you don\u2019t have to come on stage and observe that or even listen to it,\u2019\u201d Horin says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t just one structure to the play. There was a kind of A version, then a B version, then a C version. This was all invented out of necessity. How to solve a practical problem and not be too hard on the women.\u201d</p> <p>The results are inspiring to say the least. The group bonded and grew like a family; they now refer to each other as sisters. There are scenes in the film that bring tears to your eyes, though the story is ultimately life-affirming. Among its messages, perhaps, is that hope comes in many forms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40541dad39e6b76462a3b9d02e01421a6ad839b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40541dad39e6b76462a3b9d02e01421a6ad839b3/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yordanos Haile-Michael, Rosemary Kariuki-Fyfe and Yarrie Bangura\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Among its messages is that hope comes in many forms\u2019: Yordanos Haile-Michael, Rosemary Kariuki-Fyfe and Yarrie Bangura.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Goodship</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The four subjects found different pathways to resilience. One has focused on poetry, another on participating in philanthropic projects. Yordanos says that because of sticking with the stage production \u2013 slogging it out when her instincts told her to quit \u2013 she is now in a better place than ever.</p> <p>\u201cI tried so hard to fit in with my own community, it didn\u2019t work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this has given me faith in humans. I made friends from different backgrounds and I get to be seen as totally the person I am. I came to accept that this is what I am meant to be and I am OK with that person. </p> <p>\u201cFor someone like me, I have no one to blame. I can\u2019t go out there saying, \u2018You have done this to me.\u2019 There is no one to say sorry, or even to acknowledge me as a human being. The play, for people to come to see it, to meet so many different people and to be able to talk about it openly \u2013 it\u2019s amazing. To me, I got my life back. I got me back.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 The Baulkham Hills African Ladies Troupe is in cinemas now</em></p>"
