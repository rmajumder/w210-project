Before taking a peak at what\u2019s to come, a look at what has gone on today \u2013 for those of a British persuasion, it has been another impressive day with three rowing golds and two more in the velodrome to take GB\u2019s tally to 20, and 46 overall. Amongst the winners was Rachel Morris, 37, who became a Paralympic champion in her second sport after adding single sculls gold to her cycling time-trial in Beijing eight years ago. Lauren Rowles and Laurence Whiteley won in the mixed double sculls before the mixed coxless fours grabbed more glory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/rachel-morris-britain-rio-rowing-golds-paralympics\">Rachel Morris leads the way as Britain win three Rio rowing golds</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>In cycling, Britain rode to the men\u2019s mixed sprint team gold</strong> with the riders Jody Cundy, Jon Allan-Butterworth and Louis Rolfe setting a world record time in beating the defending champions, China. That came on the back of a surprise win for Lora Turnham and her pilot Corrine Hall, who were all smiles as they admitted they were stunned to beat the favourites from New Zealand in the women\u2019s tandem B 3km pursuit final. </p> <p><strong>Other notable moments in Rio today include the women\u2019s triathlon,</strong> the first time the event has been staged in a Paralympic Games. The PT4 was won by Grace Norman of the USA who edged out Britain\u2019s Lauren Steadman, while Allysa Seely won the PT2 event in an American 1-2-3. Lucy Ejike won the women\u2019s 61kg powerlifting title for Nigeria earlier in the day, while in athletics Thailand\u2019s Prawat Wahoram won his country\u2019s second gold of the Games in the men\u2019s T54 5000m final. China continued their dominance with Juan Yao claiming women\u2019s F44 discus gold, but the loudest cheer of the day so far was saved for Brazil\u2019s Petrucio Ferreira Dos Santos, who stormed to gold in the men\u2019s T47 100m final. </p> <p><strong>What has all that done to the medal table?</strong> Well China are still well out in front with GB second and Ukraine third, as Brazil leap to fifth overall.

  "<p> The first new Welsh tax for almost 800 years is to be outlined in a bill expected to be introduced on Monday. </p> <p>The land transaction tax would replace stamp duty land tax from April 2018 if the bill becomes law. </p> <p> Like stamp duty land tax, land transaction tax would be payable on the purchase or lease of a building or land in Wales over a certain price.</p> <p> An announcement about the rates and bands for the proposed land transaction tax will be made closer to spring 2018, taking into account economic conditions at the time.</p> <p> The bill will also include measures to tackle tax avoidance, based on lessons learned in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.revenue.scot/land-buildings-transaction-tax\">Scotland, which has a different system to the UK. </a></p> <p>The finance secretary, Mark Drakeford, said: \u201cThis is an historic milestone in the devolution of tax powers to Wales. This bill marks another step towards the creation of taxes which are more suited to the needs of Wales and support Welsh public services.</p> <p> \u201cThis is a tax which affects so many of us. By replacing stamp duty land tax with a new made-in-Wales land transaction tax, public services in Wales will continue to benefit from the revenues raised by this important tax.</p> <p>\u201cWe have consulted widely about how this tax should work for Wales and listened to a range of views. This is why it will broadly mirror stamp duty land tax, providing the consistency and stability businesses tell us they need and providing a smooth transaction for home-buyers and the property market. We have also been able to learn from the devolution of the tax to Scotland.\u201d</p> <p> In 2014-15, \u00a3170m was raised from stamp duty land tax in Wales, with 55,000 transactions taking place. This is expected to rise to \u00a3244m by 2018-19.</p> <p> Changes to landfill tax in Wales are also due to take place and it is possible that eventually a separate rate of income tax could be set in Wales. </p> <p> Wales has not had control of its tax system since the 13th century when Edward I invaded Wales. </p> <p> </p>",
  "<p> Britain\u2019s economy will grind to a near standstill over the coming months as post-referendum uncertainty triggers a slump in business investment, a leading business group has warned as it slashed its growth forecasts.</p> <p>In its first set of forecasts since the vote to leave the EU, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) on Monday more than halved its GDP growth prediction for next year from 2.3% to 1.0%.

  "<p>Pep Guardiola tends to look a little tired at the final whistle. At Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon he looked closer to exhausted: drawn, pale, woozy, a man released from some gorgeously more-ish kind of agony.</p> <p>It had been a notably agitated afternoon even for Guardiola, who lives every detail of these matches, who famously split his trousers capering about during last year\u2019s Champions League quarter-final, and who looks set for a particularly draining season in a league where the tides are always shifting, and where at times he can resemble a chess grand master chucked into the middle of a full-contact game of It\u2019s a Knockout. Guardiola craves control, loves working the details. His greatest challenge in the Premier League may well be embracing the lack of control, the random elements, where the moment is often decided on luck, muscle, adrenal inspiration. Asked how what he had just experienced compared with the full-body intensity of <em>el cl\u00e1sico </em>he smiled and nodded and said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite similar \u2026 Quite similar.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/11/pep-guardiola-jpse-mourinho-manchester-city-manchester-united-premoer-league\">Pep Guardiola wins tactical battle with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in Manchester derby | Michael Cox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever Guardiola achieves at Manchester City, he won\u2019t die wondering if he might have given a little more. By the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-claudio-bravo-red-rooney-tackle-penalty\" title=\"\">this febrile 2-1 derby win</a> he had probably covered more ground over 90 minutes than United\u2019s centre\u2011forward. Midway through the second half he could be seen exploding off his bench, head in hands, sprinting down the touchline keeping pace with Ander Herrera as the midfielder set off on a run to take David de Gea\u2019s long throw. Welcome Pep. Welcome to our world.</p> <p>This was a wonderful and indeed very English match between the two most expensive sets of players (and managers) ever assembled, a derby that thrummed up through the gears from City\u2019s early control through to a wild last half-hour. Victory leaves City with a perfect record at the top of the table. More satisfying for Guardiola was the fact his team won here despite having to scrap and strain during an impressively direct second-half rally from United.</p> <p>City had dominated the cool clear water of the opening 35 minutes when patterns were clear, the passing crisp and their pressing devastatingly well\u2011drilled. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/11/pep-guardiola-jpse-mourinho-manchester-city-manchester-united-premoer-league\" title=\"\">Guardiola set up his team in a 4-1-2-2-1, with the most forward midfield two very wide</a>. With David Silva in wonderful ball-playing form it was a shape that flattered City\u2019s fluid movement, while magnifying United\u2019s main weakness. Deprived of the ball, United looked lumpen, with three genuinely slow players in the front six. This was a team set up to play counterattack but without the required personnel. When was the last time Zlatan Ibrahimovic played in a team that didn\u2019t have the ball most of the time most weeks? Here he looked at times like a man for whom football is a good walk spoiled.</p> <p>Afterwards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-claudio-bravo-red-rooney-tackle-penalty\" title=\"\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho pointed out Claudio Bravo might easily have conceded a penalty</a> for a hapless lunge into Wayne Rooney\u2019s shin with 20 minutes left. Details change games. But the fact remains that for the opening half here City looked like a team enjoying playing football, energised by their new rhythms, while United\u2019s players spent a lot of time shouting at each other over issues of positioning and press.</p> <p>The opening goal was preceded by just such a moment of confusion. Ibrahimovic stood off as City\u2019s defence played the ball around in their own area. This looked like a plan: United were wary of the high press. Mourinho has seen his teams taken apart against Guardiola playing these tactics. As the crowd roared, and with Rooney now urging his team-mates forward, United did press a little belatedly, but with no real pressure on Aleksandar Kolarov as he hoofed the ball upfield. There was, though, a loss of shape behind as Paul Pogba watched Kevin De Bruyne run beyond him and both centre-halves made weak challenges. De Bruyne produced a gorgeous finish, dummying De Gea one way and rolling the ball into the other corner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-claudio-bravo-red-rooney-tackle-penalty\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho criticises players and Mark Clattenburg after derby loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mourinho will see a systems failure. United slackened and lost their starting positions. But the admission that Marcus Rashford\u2019s introduction at half\u2011time offered the speed and boldness lacking in his initial selection reflects the fact the goal was deserved. City had been quicker to every ball, United playing from the start like a team defending a 1-0 aggregate lead away from home.</p> <p>In the end it was Bravo who changed the game, flapping at Rooney\u2019s pumped free-kick just before half-time and getting in a muddle with Stones. Ibrahimovic finished beautifully. Perhaps City\u2019s goalkeeper should have gone for the cross with his feet. After the game Guardiola and Nolito went into bat for their goalkeeper, describing his performance as \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d. In reality Bravo, who is a high-quality goalkeeper, just didn\u2019t look ready for this game.</p> <p>His edginess gave United a moment of leverage, gave the crowd something to bark about, and is likely to ensure an unhelpful singling out under the high ball from future opponents. At times here, lunging about in his luminous outfit, Bravo resembled a steward who had been stung by a wasp and come capering on to the pitch in a panic. He should have been sent off for that tackle on Rooney. Later he was revenge-tackled by United\u2019s captain (Rooney was lucky: he missed) and hurled himself to the floor, writhing in feigned agony.</p> <p>Until Bravo\u2019s intervention City had been toying with United at times. Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s goal, City\u2019s second, was made by the sublime De Bruyne, who provided more evidence here that he is clearly the most effective player in the Premier League right now. \u201cKevin had an amazing, amazing game,\u201d Guardiola drooled. It seems likely to be a fruitful partnership.</p> <p>Similarly Mourinho\u2019s genuine enthusiasm for Rashford\u2019s impact promises much, just as the second half had its positives for both teams. City showed they can also win ugly, that there is a spirit and defensive will in this team to match its fine ambitions. United, for all the occasional bluntness of their methods, looked like a team that really did want to win. They forced the best team in the country back for long periods. This is progress.</p> <p>At the end there was even a little mutual softening from both managers. \u201cThe substitutions of my colleague were really good,\u201d Guardiola said through his exhaustion, praising the repositioning of Pogba, Herrera\u2019s introduction and the \u201camazing foot\u201d of Daley Blind. It was that kind of occasion. Pep, Jos\u00e9 and the Premier League. This could be the start of a beautiful friendship.</p>",

  "<p>And a fiddly-dee-dee with the waves lapping against the shore. It\u2019s Bodmin Assizes Part Two! But is Francis dead? Of course not.

And what a good job the trial turned out to be a total waste of time, because a series about the sensible side of the family would be no fun at all. And we certainly can\u2019t rely on Evil George or Boring Francis to take their shirts off. Although I reckon Dr Ennis would step up if pressed. Still, not a total waste of time as this was an extremely dramatically engaging episode with many tears shed. It was all nicely layered and cleverly built up. Because, I mean, I love Bodmin Assizes as much as the next fan of the late 18th-century Cornish legal system but LA Law this wasn\u2019t. There were times when I wondered if it was all going to go on a bit.

Oh why must she always wear mustard and moss green? There is a Demelza palette. Is the wardrobe mistress on a deal with Colour Me Beautiful? (Demelza is definitely an Autumn. Elizabeth is a Winter.) For a meeting with Bergerac, though, it has to be claret, darling!</p> \n<p>It all went a bit Brexit when the vote was announced and the riot broke out. See how useful it is to have a clear majority, eh? (Topical!) But this needed to happen so Ross could witness someone who was about to die and therefore be further tempted into lowering himself by apologising for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Meeting Beardy Ginger Riot-Inciting Man was not a good omen. As Ross took to the dock, his scar shining in the sunlight, even I began to believe that he might be guilty and I haven\u2019t had a penny from Evil George.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo you go to the gallows on a point of principle?\u201d \u201cI appreciate your efforts but I cannot put my name to beggary and flattery.\u201d Oh, Ross. Paint a penitent figure and escape the worst, I tell you! Do it, otherwise the next eight episodes will be six-pack-free and the fortunes of BBC1 cannot weather this loss. \u201cThat is why you must grovel. Do so now. Or you will not live to see the sun rise tomorrow.\u201d (More weeping at this point.)</p> \n<p>But it was not to be. \u201cI make no apology for my actions. In truth, I would do the same again.\u201d This was an excellent TED talk on morality and self-belief. It wasn\u2019t ideal when trying to save yourself from the gallows. Dr Ennis summed it up: \u201cI have heard more penitent speeches.\u201d But then it turned out they were just toying with us and the jury saved the day! Let\u2019s have a party on the beach with some driftwood and a horse.

We must surmise from the lack of chest this week that either the producers have got cocky and think they can keep the viewers happy with storylines, cinematography and great acting alone. Or Aidan Turner has finally had the clause inserted into his contract that he has been gunning for all long: \u201cNo more nudey mining and scything. Mr Turner is a proper actor.

  "<p>One in six <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/reasons-why-your-car-fails-an-mot\">MOT failures</a> is due to brake or tyre problems. These wear as we drive, as does the surface of roads. Most of the wear material ends up as dust at the kerb or gets washed into drains but some wear-particles are small enough to be inhaled, and contribute to our air pollution. These particles are rich in transition metals which <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/08958378.2013.850127\">add to the toxicity</a> of our urban air.</p> <p>Increasing amounts of wear-particles have been found in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.07.026\">new research</a> from King\u2019s College London. Scientists tracked air pollution alongside 65 roads for ten years. The researchers found some roads where the air pollution benefits from improvements in diesel exhausts were outweighed by increases in particles that come from the wear of tyres, brakes and the road. This was mainly on outer London roads that had increasing numbers of heavy good vehicles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/10/calls-for-a-new-clean-air-act-in-the-uk\">Calls for a new clean air act in the UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Accessories such as electric windows and air conditioning mean that new cars can be heavier than the ones that they replace .

  "<p>Quade Cooper\u2019s rugby has a certain \u201clook\u201d to it. When he\u2019s bopping away at odd angles, ball in two hands, flicking it onto his boot or behind his back or dishing out passes for a hard charger off his hip, he moves in a singular, angular way. And you can\u2019t look away. </p> <p>And that\u2019s before he starts to run. That\u2019s when it can get really funky. For when Cooper is in flight, jagging, head back like a Christmas turkey on a last dash for freedom, you don\u2019t know what might happen. Which way will he go? Will he kick? Will he pass? Will he step the giant back-rower, throw the ball backwards over his head and be flattened like roadkill? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/quade-cooper-in-a-very-good-spot-after-starring-role-in-wallabies-win\">Quade Cooper in a 'very good spot' after starring role in Wallabies' win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When you don\u2019t know what Cooper\u2019s going to do, it\u2019s compelling viewing, you can\u2019t turn away. And rugby is a happy place. </p> <p>Yet Cooper remains as maligned a figure as Australian rugby has had since James O\u2019Connor declared himself (correctly, as it happens) a \u201cbrand\u201d. And some people \u2013 100% of whom, if you had to guess a percentage, would not have met the man \u2013 don\u2019t like him. Shane Watson, Michael Clarke and dear sweet Ricky Stuart could empathise. Some people, for whatever reason, are parodied, disliked, \u201chated\u201d. And a cross-section of our community, given free rein in our anti-social media, can\u2019t help but pile in.</p> <p>Yet with Australian rugby on a (relative, conservative, let\u2019s not crack open the \u201974 Grange Hermitage just yet) high after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/wallabies-play-with-energy-and-substance-to-defeat-springboks\">a six-point Test victory over South Africa</a> in Brisbane (but in the current climate, you take what you get and roll about in it) as my carpenter granddad would say, \u201cto buggery with these people, what have they ever done?\u201d</p> <p>And should Cooper keep up the form from Saturday night \u2013 and who knows if he can reprise that rock and roll stuff from 2011 when Queensland won the Super Rugby competition \u2013 he might even turn a few of his haters into love-you-long-timers.</p> <p>Because version 4.1 of Cooper (or whatever the latest release is) still has that point of difference that can break down well-drilled defences. He\u2019s not as funky and scatty as Carlos Spencer, not as poised as Daniel Carter (who is?), and not as high-octane as Cooper version 1 with a mullet.</p> <p>But it seems now that the man, at 28, owns a semblance of control. He\u2019s dialled back the really funky stuff and is playing as one part of the team, as the lynchpin. And like David Warner marrying a defensive tenet with his natural urge to go all-out at everything, he was one of Australia\u2019s best afield on Saturday night in Brisbane.</p> <p>Michael Cheika\u2019s confidence in the man has instilled confidence in him. For some, it\u2019s all they need. A little love.</p> <p>OK, steady on. He\u2019s not Mark Ella or Stephen Larkham redux, and the new dawn of Australian rugby isn\u2019t to bust out of his backside. But outside the World Cup romp against Uruguay, it was one of the man\u2019s best games in gold. And with a forward pack defensively staunch and strong at set piece, he was given a platform to do his thing. And his side were worthy victors 23-17 in a pretty good game of Test match rugby.</p> <p>Granted the Springboks didn\u2019t offer a lot more than kicking it to the best man under the high ball in the world. And their attack led more to the counter variety than sweeping backline plays with multiple runners and options and speed men on the fly. And while fullback Johan Goosen has one of the great boots in world rugby \u2013 the Gilbert shoots off his laces like a mortar round from one of those T-shirt guns that killed Ned Flanders\u2019 wife Maude \u2013 it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he has to use it.</p> <p>And Bryan Habana is still on the wing. He\u2019s been playing professional since US forces captured Saddam Hussein, you can learn of it on Google.</p> <p>Yet the Wallabies have the same \u2026 would you call it malaise? According to a quick poll of the dozen leather-heads on my WhatsApp chat, Australian rugby suffers from the same surfeit of sentimentality to the fine deeds by men past their use-by. Matt Giteau and Adam Ashley-Cooper have done super things. But in terms of building for a World Cup and blooding new bloods, surely you want more Reece Hodge and less Drew Mitchell.</p> <p>So, what can be gleaned from the Wallabies\u2019 six-point win on a Suncorp surface made greasy by a two-hour storm pre-match? Hard to say. Though winners are grinners, as they say. They\u2019d have been grinning pre-match by simple dint of not playing the All Blacks. To be continually measured against \u2013 and summarily flogged by \u2013 those people does little for confidence. </p> <p>But credit to the Wallabies. Despite losing the previous six Tests, they maintained their attacking intent. Cooper was on the big screen pre-match telling fans the Wallabies don\u2019t ever promise they\u2019ll win a Test. But they do promise to do their very best, and play the rugby they like to play. The Australian way \u2013 have a go, even if you\u2019re a mug, you mug.</p> <p>Elsewhere Cooper\u2019s pivot partner Bernard Foley kicked five-from-five, scored a tidy game-breaking try and threw an intercept pass to Adrian Strauss with all of Australia baying for the ball out wide. So, it was a slightly mixed night. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/wallabies-play-with-energy-and-substance-to-defeat-springboks\">Wallabies play with energy and substance to defeat Springboks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In addition to Strauss, something of an outlier, there was actually plenty to like about a few of the Springboks. Eben Etzebeth is a big hard-charger. Elton Jantjies has touches of class. And hooker Bongi Mbonambi is the size of a Kombi. And when all these people ran the ball in the Wallabies half they threatened. Another 10 minutes of running rugby and they might\u2019ve broken through. </p> <p>But there\u2019s the rub. They didn\u2019t do it often enough in the allotted period. In their own 22 it was only ever boot it out. Between 22 and half it was crash ball and bomb it high (to Israel Folau, who owns the air like Gina Rinehart owns earth. In the Wallabies half they tried a combination of all those things. So there was variety, per se. But against a committed Wallabies D-line, there was no way through. They didn\u2019t stretch Australia on the fringes nor bang at them up the guts. Their game plan was \u2026 not sure. Do your best.</p> <p>Yet the Wallabies didn\u2019t flog the Springboks because the teams are actually quite close in terms of skill level. And defences are very well drilled. And penalties are given away to test referees\u2019 resolve.</p> <p>But Australia, to coin a relatively-recent bit of pundit-speak \u201cplayed all the rugby\u201d. The Boks played some, too, but were largely content to pressure and counter and wait for things to happen. And continually testing the aerial excellence of Folau was madness and one reason they lost. Cooper was another. </p>",
  "<p><strong><br></strong>Australia\u2019s environmental laws are too weak, a new report argues, citing the Carmichael coalmine as an example.

But the results of that research did not need to be completed before mining began.</p> <p>\u201cThe damage could be done before the results of any studies are known. Once a spring goes dry, it cannot be restored,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The report also examined how the existing environmental laws manage to protect world heritage areas \u2013 specifically the Great Barrier Reef. </p> <p>It said the mine would cause 4.7bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere, mostly through the burning of the coal it produces, which would accelerate global warming, which is the greatest risk to the future of the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>But last week, a federal court ruling on a case brought by ACF against the environment minister found he did not need to consider the effects of burning the coal dug out of the mine.</p> <p>The report said this revealed a failure in the strength of the law. \u201cFor a law that sets out to protect Australia\u2019s environment, the failure to protect our most treasured ecosystem from its greatest threat is alarming,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cFar from being the strictest in Australian history, these conditions have so many gaps you could drive a mining truck through them \u2013 which is exactly what Adani intends to do,\u201d said O\u2019Shanassy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/22/what-coalmine-adani-tweet-jumps-on-earth-day-bandwagon\">What coalmine?

  "<p>Antonio Conte has claimed defenders are targeting Diego Costa and seeking to provoke the Spain forward, with the Chelsea manager praising his player\u2019s refusal to react in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/swansea-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">fractious 2-2 draw at Swansea City</a>.</p> <p>Costa took his season\u2019s tally to six goals in five appearances for club and country but his two here were not enough to prevent Conte shedding his first points as manager. Chelsea were further unnerved by the sight of the captain, John Terry, departing on crutches after sustaining an ankle injury in stoppage time. That will render him a major doubt for Friday\u2019s visit of Liverpool to Stamford Bridge and will potentially hand David Luiz his second debut for the club.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/swansea-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Diego Costa seizes Chelsea a point after Swansea\u2019s rapid turnaround</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, while Terry\u2019s fitness will be a concern, it was Costa who dominated this occasion. A trio of Swansea players were booked for fouls on the forward, with Jordi Amat having set the tone two minutes in with an elbow to the small of the back that went unpunished. \u201cThe defenders know him and, sometimes, try to provoke him,\u201d Conte said. \u201cI was a footballer and this situation is normal. They know Diego is a player with passion and they tried to provoke him. The referee must see and allow Diego Costa to play his football.</p> <p>\u201cIf you ask me if the defenders deserved a second yellow card [for fouls on the forward], I don\u2019t want to reply on this. I want to say, only, that after every game the press ask me about the passion of Diego Costa. Today I can say Diego Costa showed fantastic behaviour to control the situation. He took a lot of kicks from the first minute until the end of the game. Today I\u2019m pleased because he showed me, he showed his team-mates, he showed everyone that he has fantastic behaviour. Fantastic behaviour. It wasn\u2019t easy, it wasn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s incredible the defender didn\u2019t finish [get sent off] before the end of the match.\u201d</p> <p>That appeared to be a reference to Amat. Costa was booked for a foul on Leroy Fer, and Swansea players suggested he should have been shown a second after going to ground easily in a challenge with Lukasz Fabianski. Yet it was Chelsea who ended the more frustrated after the referee, Andre Marriner, failed to penalise Fer\u2019s foul on Gary Cahill before squeezing the home side ahead just after the hour-mark.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clear foul, so I\u2019m frustrated,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cCome on, seriously \u2026 You could be sat on the moon and see it is a clear foul. I took the touch away from him, he came through the back of me. It was clear as day and seeing it back has made me even more angry. It\u2019s all fun and games for the fans, isn\u2019t it but it\u2019s the players who suffer. That kills me and kills my team. We have dropped two points which is massive in this league. Look at my face. It\u2019s incredible. I said to the referee there\u2019s three of you that can see that. There were two fouls, and between the officials they have said that they couldn\u2019t see it. For me that is incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Conte, who backed Cahill, reiterated Cahill\u2019s assertion that the referee had made \u201ca great mistake\u201d, was just as infuriated his team did not capitalise on their dominance over the first hour, urging them to learn from their profligacy. \u201cThe players showed a fantastic reaction but we had the possibility to kill the game and, if you have that possibility, you must kill the game. We must learn from this.\u201d On Terry, the manger will await the result of a scan. \u201cHe is a warrior, so I\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The point, so unlikely while Swansea were outclassed for an hour, provided a welcome fillip for Francesco Guidolin who had been forced to abandon his team\u2019s initial formation before the interval. That change came at the expense of Neil Taylor, who made his disappointment at being substituted very clear as he retreated four minutes before the break.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the first time in my career I\u2019ve done that,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI made a mistake. I could \u2026 I can \u2026 I should have waited three minutes and made the change at half-time, but Mo Barrow had been ready to come on for five minutes and I decided to do it this way. I said sorry to him in the dressing room. There is no problem between me and Neil.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign against Donald Trump has been going well.

Still, it\u2019s clear that most voters, including some loyal Democrats, don\u2019t share my assessment. At a time when she should be pulling way ahead of Trump, she is leading, but not comfortably.</p> <p>The drag on her momentum is Clinton\u2019s insistence on holding things close in order to maintain a zone of privacy. This feeds the unfair but persistent belief among a sizable chunk of the electorate that she has something serious to hide. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">events of Sunday</a> were a case in point: the candidate appeared to stumble after leaving the 9/11 memorial in New York. The zone of privacy closed around her \u2013 press were largely kept in the dark, apart from a short statement and a shout of \u201cI\u2019m feeling great\u201d. Clinton then retreated to Chappaqua with her inner circle.</p> <p>The time has come to do something daring to try to restore trust. It goes against every fibre of her nature, but Clinton should now become radically transparent.<br></p> <p>She should release the <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/1/hillary-clintons-wall-street-speech-transcripts-an/\">transcripts of her Wall Street speeches</a>.

She resents being scrutinised more heavily than men, which she is. That unfairness was on display once again last week on the presidential forum televised by NBC, when the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-hillary-clinton-email-story-is-out-of-control/2016/09/08/692947d0-75fc-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html?utm_term=.7b9bf2cd0aeb\">host, Matt Lauer, grilled Clinton</a> over and over again about her emails while letting Trump skate by with outright lies.</p> <p>In calling for Hillary Clinton to embrace radical transparency, I am holding her accountable to her own standard. In her two campaigns for president, she has claimed she is more transparent than anyone else. During a speech in Philadelphia in 2008, she said: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7ZaL-F09E\">\u201cI think I\u2019m probably the most transparent person in public life\u201d</a> \u2013 adding that \u201cI feel you know a lot more about me than you know about anyone else. Much of it untrue, but nevertheless, it\u2019s all out there.\u201d Last March she told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood: <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/04/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-democratic-presidential-candidate-hillary-clinton-speaks-with-cnbcs-john-harwood-on-closing-bell-today.html\">\u201cI\u2019ve been the most transparent public official in modern times as far as I know.\u201d</a> If she wants to be president, she should prove this to the doubters.</p> <p>Of course, she\u2019s right that the media will never be satisfied, no matter what or how much she releases. There will be more and more questions. The tortuous, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gCAJi3yLy0\">72-minute press conference</a> that she gave as first lady in 1994, intended to answer questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/21/hillaryclinton\">Whitewater</a> and her commodities trading, only cemented her conviction that journalists are out to get her. I covered this press conference, which was dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/21/molly-ringwald-pretty-in-pink-role-model\">Pretty in Pink</a>\u201d for the sweater she wore, when I worked for the Wall Street Journal, which went overboard on Whitewater. However much Clinton hated the experience, however sexist she thought it was for reporters to dwell on her clothes, she actually did herself some good by confronting her questioners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Enduring more questions about the thorny personal issues she hates talking about will help her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I also thought she did a fine job answering the barrage of questions from Lauer last week. She is always the prepared lawyer and gave cogent and truthful answers. Trump, in a <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/09/donald-trump-jon-voight-vow-to-save-christianity.html\">speech to religious conservatives in Washington DC last Friday</a>, ripped Clinton for offering different explanations about her private email server at different times. The government\u2019s classification system is byzantine. Explaining why she didn\u2019t see or understand a tiny \u201cc\u201d (for classified) on three emails doesn\u2019t lend itself to pithy answers.</p> <p>While she knows every jot and tittle of policy, Clinton will benefit from more practice answering questions about her ethics, her speeches, the Clinton Foundation, her health and her emails. This is essential before the upcoming debates with Trump. Radical transparency will help her. Enduring more questions about the thorny personal issues she hates talking about will help her. She made a good start by meeting with reporters last week and answering their questions, but it\u2019s only a start. We can all bet that she\u2019ll be brilliantly prepared for the debates and ready for any policy question. On the personal, ethical issues, which Trump will relentlessly pound, it\u2019s harder to predict.</p> <p>Of course, this could all backfire. I\u2019m old enough to remember watching the first woman nominee for vice-president, the Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/27/geraldine-ferraro-obituary\">Geraldine Ferraro</a>, withering visibly as journalists hounded her about her husband\u2019s business dealings and their taxes. There\u2019s a long list of other politicians who thought they were attempting to \u201ccome clean\u201d but paid a political price anyway.</p> <p>But in Clinton\u2019s case, the price of not being demonstrably more transparent could be even higher \u2013 not only for her, but for the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0598cfc039a0118ca21fc9505c31e5304751ca34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0598cfc039a0118ca21fc9505c31e5304751ca34/0_2_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geraldine Ferraro, Walter Mondale's vice president nominee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first woman nominee for vice-president, the Democrat Geraldine Ferraro: \u2018I remember watching her wither visibly as journalists hounded her about her husband\u2019s business dealings and their taxes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

If ever there was a combination to test the defending champions\u2019 mettle this was it.</p> <p>And the upshot? The kind of scoreline that sends ominous smoke signals to the rest of the Premiership, a five-try bonus-point dismissal of an Exeter team who were the second-best side in the country last season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/04/wasps-exeter-premiership-rugby-union-match-report\" title=\"\">The Chiefs, now propping up the table after losing their opening two games</a>, were not at their best but this was the first time in two and a half years they have failed to collect even a losing bonus point. The gap between Saracens and the rest appears to be widening by the week.</p> <p>There were echoes of last season\u2019s final in the way Saracens took an early stranglehold and refused to panic once Exeter launched their inevitable rally. Across the field there is precision, purpose and increasing attacking intent to set alongside their customary defensive excellence and keen tactical instincts. On this evidence, it is going to take an extremely good side to beat them whether their England players are available or not.</p> <p>Already Saracens have a perfect 10 points from two games; next up will be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints\" title=\"\"> Northampton at home</a> followed by Harlequins and Bristol away. Farrell and Kruis (back spasm) are both likely to be available on Saturday. Here it was their strength around the breakdown and control at half-back that stood out, with Jackson Wray, Schalk Burger, Billy Vunipola and Richard Wigglesworth all fulfilling their respective roles perfectly.</p> <p>If the fifth try from Ben Spencer came as a result of Exeter spilling the ball as they sought to salvage some late respectability, the gap in execution and ruthlessness was almost as wide as the result suggests. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/european-champions-saracens-mark-mccall-racing-92-premiership-double\" title=\"\">Mark McCall, Saracens\u2019 director of rugby</a>, has not forgotten losing home and away to Exeter two seasons ago and was suitably delighted by a performance he described as a \u201cmassive step up\u201d from their opening weekend win over Worcester.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make any statements but the really encouraging thing was that a lot of what people consider to be our big players weren\u2019t playing. There was a brilliant focus before the game. You really felt it.\u201d</p> <p>Not since April 2014 when Sale stuck 50 points on them have Exeter been made to look quite so mortal at home in the Premiership. Rob Baxter is not the panicking type but lying bottom for the first time since their promotion in 2010 will add an extra edge to Saturday\u2019s home game against Harlequins. On the plus side, having lost to Wasps last week, they may have already met the two toughest sides out there. \u201cThe truth is you can\u2019t just be good against Saracens, you have to be outstanding,\u201d the coach said.</p> <p>As had been the case at Twickenham last May Exeter needed a good start and did not get one. Soft tackling allowed Alex Lozowski to skip his way through for a fifth-minute try and the referee, JP Doyle, initially ruled heavily in favour of the visitors at the breakdown. Aside from a crazy attempted quick throw from Billy Vunipola that almost gifted a try to Lachie Turner, Saracens looked clear-headed and dominant and deservedly increased their lead when Sean Maitland, following a nice flick-on from Marcelo Bosch, scored the first of his two tries.</p> <p>With Phil Dolman forced off prematurely and both Don Armand and Damien Welch having to leave the field temporarily, Exeter looked collectively shaken, with Burger strong over the ball and Alex Goode giving a consummate display at full-back. It was not until shortly before the half-hour mark that they enjoyed a concerted period of pressure in the visiting 22, only for a close-range TMO decision to go against them \u2013 all they had to show for their first-half efforts were two penalties from Henry Slade and, even when Wigglesworth was sent to the sin-bin for tripping the Exeter No10 in open play, they could not maximise their numerical advantage. A fine covering tackle from Lozowski in the left corner denied the lively Max Bodilly with a try looking certain.</p> <p>Turning to face the wind at 12-6 down Exeter were pretty much already doomed. Only outstanding defence from Turner and Slade in the right corner prevented Vunipola from scoring Saracens\u2019 third try but the lively Maitland \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018work rate\u2019 until I came to Sarries\u201d \u2013 Wray and, belatedly, Spencer rendered Luke Cowan-Dickie\u2019s close-range score for Exeter irrelevant.

Despite their lack of possession and territory during the opening onslaught, Broncos, too, found their groove.</p> <p>Two sets of six gave them good field position and a blind offload was claimed by Alex Walker who crashed over from 10 metres out, much to the delight of the crowd. They were just as delighted when a strong period of play resulted in a deft kick from scrum-half Jamie Soward which was touched down by James Cunningham under the posts.</p> <p>But Hull retook control in the second half. A couple of slick offloads gave them a way through the hosts\u2019 defence, with James Greenwood scoring to build on their lead, but Mantellato missed his first attempt at goal of the afternoon. Five minutes later Matty Marsh manipulated the Broncos defence, dipped through a gap and side-stepped the onrushing last man to complete an impressive solo try.</p> <p>With 25 minutes to play, Broncos hit back with William Barthau diving over from close range but any hopes of a fightback were soon extinguished when Campese burst through a lacklustre defence, drew the last man and sent James Donaldson over.</p> <p>A minute later, Shaun Lunt broke two tackles and unselfishly passed to Marsh who ran in under the sticks and Rovers\u2019 sustained pressure told once again when Marsh\u2019s kick was spilled by Barthau, gifting Will Jubb the easiest of scores.</p> <p>Broncos and Rovers then exchanged sets in the middle of the pitch, before Minns completed his treble.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May loses no opportunity to say she wants Britain to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-sets-out-one-nation-conservative-pitch-for-leadership\" title=\"\">a country that works for everyone</a>. The slogan will be the backdrop at next month\u2019s <a href=\"https://conservativepartyconference.com/index\" title=\"\">Conservative party conference</a>, too. A country that works for everyone is a very fine aim in principle. But Mrs May will struggle to make a reality of her own words without being a Tory leader who does things differently on a range of fronts. One of the things she should do differently is to re-engage with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tradeunions\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s trade unions</a>.</p> <p>It is well over 30 years since a Tory leader took a fresh approach to the unions. That is too long. Judging by the Cameron government\u2019s approach, embodied in this year\u2019s vindictive <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/trade-union-act-becomes-law\" title=\"\">Trade Union Act</a>, not much changed in Tory thinking between the 1980s and now. In some respects the same is true on the union side. But Mrs May should look beyond the militancy she condemned too quickly in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/nhs-jeremy-hunt-junior-doctors-strike\" title=\"\">junior doctors\u2019 dispute</a>. Partly that\u2019s because the gulf between her concerns and those of the unions is perhaps not as great as she assumes. But it\u2019s also because her social reform agenda will only leave a lasting mark if she takes a bold and constructive approach to organisations like unions.</p> <p>This week, the trade unions are in Brighton for <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/about-tuc/congress/congress-2016\" title=\"\">their annual congress</a>. If she can get a reliable train, Mrs May could do worse than drop in. She would not be wasting her time. The large topics that the unions are discussing include many on which the prime minister is anxious to stamp her authority \u2013 fair pay, industrial strategy, support for the steel industry, and the Brexit deal. She might even take an interest in this week\u2019s scheduled debate about wearing high heels at work.</p> <p>Fair pay is the most politically pressing question facing the British economy. Since the crisis of 2007-08, real wages in Britain have declined by more than 10%, the largest fall in any developed economy in the world except Greece. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/11/tuc-theresa-may-rein-in-directors-pay-ftse-100\" title=\"\">as the TUC itself pointed out </a>on Sunday, the average FTSE 100 boss now earns 123 times the average UK average full-time salary, and Britain\u2019s highest-paid CEO, Sir Martin Sorrell of WPP, earns the average annual salary in under 45 minutes. In July, launching her leadership campaign, <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/2016/07/11/theresa-may-2016-speech-to-launch-leadership-campaign/\" title=\"\">Mrs May called the gaps</a> \u201cirrational, unhealthy and growing\u201d. She will need allies to turn that around. The unions should be one of them.</p> <p>Mrs May has also caused waves by talking about corporate governance and putting employees on company boards. True, too many unions have been too supine about industrial co-determination for too long; too many think about this subject solely in connection with boardroom pay, though that is undoubtedly important. But the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/if-sports-direct-can-change-why-not-all-workplaces-mike-ashley\" title=\"\">one who gets the bigger picture</a>. She will call for a fair hearing from government for the union point of view on all aspects of industrial reform today. Mrs May should respond positively.</p> <p>If she went to Brighton, Mrs May would also find a union movement whose leaders are much more focused on the practical questions facing post-Brexit Britain than the Labour opponent she sees each week at prime minister\u2019s questions. On Monday the TUC <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/Post-BrexitEconomy.pdf\" title=\"\">publishes a report</a> on the impact of Brexit on jobs, which underlines that workers in all sectors and regions of Britain \u2013 not just those in the financial sector in London \u2013 could pay the price of Brexit with their jobs. Ms O\u2019Grady is expected to call for the trade unions to be at the Brexit negotiating table, alongside the nations, the regions and the CBI. Mrs May should pick up that challenge, too.</p> <p>The shaming of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\" title=\"\">Sports Direct</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/19/hermes-couriers-low-pay-national-living-wage-self-employed\" title=\"\">Hermes courier service</a> are signs of times that should be rapidly changing. The rail and doctors\u2019 disputes are also mood indicators that should not be ignored. Yet there were fewer <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacedisputesandworkingconditions/articles/labourdisputes/2015\" title=\"\">workers involved in disputes</a> in 2015 than in any year since 1893. The British economy is ripe for a fairer approach to wages, workplace protection and corporate governance than it has seen in a generation. Mrs May should be bold enough to show that a country that works for all is one that celebrates good companies and good trade unions alike.</p>",

It was unclear whether Damaris, who knew she would eventually be sent back to her family as part of the peace accords, was among the children handed over at the weekend.</p> <p>The Farc has long been accused of forced recruitment of minors, though the exact number of underage fighters is unknown. The guerrilla group said earlier this year that they had only 21 members under the age of 15; the defence ministry said in May it calculated there were some 170 members under 18.</p> <p>Since 1999, Colombia\u2019s family welfare agency has taken in at least 6,000 child soldiers who either were captured from illegal armed groups or deserted. Sixty per cent had belonged to the Farc, according to official figures.</p> <p>Forced recruitment has been one of the primary drivers of internal displacement, with families fleeing from rural areas to protect their children from being forced or lured into the rebel ranks.</p> <p>Damaris\u2019s parents instead resorted to locking her in a room of their house when she announced she was thinking of joining up with the Farc unit that frequented her village. \u201cI had a fight with my dad and he beat me and locked me in a room,\u201d she said. \u201cI escaped.\u201d</p> <p>Eight months after joining the Farc she went to visit her parents. \u201cMy parents cried and told me that it wasn\u2019t good for me, but I had already decided to stay in the guerrillas,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Damaris and other child soldiers like her are considered victims rather than criminals. But those who recruited them will have to answer for the crime before a special tribunal that will be set up as part of the peace accord. If they confess, they will be eligible for reduced sentences to be served in as yet undefined alternatives to prison. Failure to confess could land them in jail for anywhere between five and 10 years.</p> <p>The minors meanwhile will enter a special programme for reintegrating them into civil life, including receiving psychological and educational support. Some, though not all, may reunite with their families.</p> <p>Damaris said she would like to go back home and take advantage of the help she will get from the government to study to be a nurse. Her mother suffers from poor circulation in her legs. \u201cAs a nurse, I could help her,\u201d Damaris said.</p>",

Too great an indulgence of them will feed the story that Brexit is a chaotic mess or bottle up the kind of resentments on the right that undermined John Major. True, May is a more self-confident, less nervy prime minister than him. Her secret weapon is that she has a good deal of control over the coming timeline.

Outside a clique of modernisers, most Conservatives have hankered for the return of grammar schools as vital lost territory, and May is closer to their instincts \u2013 by experience and belief \u2013 than her predecessors.</p> <p>Her embrace of grammars also signals something many Tories believe but were dissuaded by Cameron-Osborne from articulating. No amount of graphs about overall outcomes, they feel, can stop a lot of parents \u2013 including those who consider themselves progressives or even on the left \u2013 wanting to send children to selective schools.

Now that narrow offering must become broader, without much road-testing beyond the commitment of a loyal but quite narrow inner team.

But a word of caution is in order if we are not to fall into a longstanding historical trap. What Kettle says in particular about BMW and the Mini plant in Cowley is absolutely true. Over the years I have taken students of business to the plant, where they have had a chance to talk to \u201cseasoned\u201d managers who are able to compare and contrast their years of experience under BMC/Rover management and their experience with BMW. They would never return to the old days for all the reasons he states.</p> <p>But like very many large and less large German businesses BMW has an independent supervisory board whose task in law it is to supervise the activities of the board of management of the enterprise. In Anglo-American jurisdictions there is no such distinction. Boards are single unitary boards dominated in power terms by executive directors with a sprinkling of so-called independent directors who are for the most part ineffective in holding executive directors to account. Hence the long-standing problems at Sports Direct and many other companies.</p> <p>We should therefore take with a pinch of salt Sports Direct\u2019s generous offer to appoint an employee director to the board. This will change little in the culture of the company. To see lasting improvement we have to embrace fully the constitutional design common in Germany and other European jurisdictions. A sticking plaster won\u2019t work. These matters and an agenda for reform are set out clearly in my book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Looming-Corporate-Calamity-Restoring-Legitimacy/dp/0993135609\">The Looming Corporate Calamity</a>.<br><strong>Richard Tudway</strong><br><em>Burgess Hill, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is timely that corporate governance has shot up the political agenda. It is to be hoped that Theresa May\u2019s threat to place workers on boards will open a long-awaited discussion on industrial democracy. Way back in the postwar period the British Control Commission in Germany fostered the idea of a tripartite board structure for industry, with a third of which being drawn from the workforce. This enlightened view did much to assist the reconstruction of Germany\u2019s industry and establish a healthy basis on which it has thrived.</p> <p>In the 21st century it is not good enough for Mike Ashley to say he will put a staff representative on the board of Sports Direct. This should not be the prerogative of the board of a public company; it should be a right that employees can elect their own representative/s.Certainly if this constituted a third of the membership of the board, much of the reported corporate abuse would be challenged.<br><strong>John Lloyd</strong><br><em>Honorary president, South Shropshire Green party</em></p> <p>\u2022 Neoliberalism can only be blamed on 1960s radicalism if you blame it for its own defeat (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/revolution-victoria-albert-museum-sixties-usher-neoliberalism\">Did we baby boomers bring about a revolution in the 1960s or just usher in neoliberalism</a>, theguardian.com, 8 September).

This found that protections for vulnerable people were inadequate and made 69 recommendations that were broadly accepted by the government.

The policy limits the definition of torture, meaning that those tortured at the hands of Isis, Boko Haram and others may no longer be included. The policy increases the burden of evidence on vulnerable people and balances vulnerability against a wider range of other factors. We fear this will lead to more vulnerable people being detained for longer.</p> <p>The guidance was laid before parliament the day before summer recess and will come into effect one week after recess, meaning there has been no opportunity for meaningful debate.

Of four couriers who complained about pay in recent weeks, three have so far received increases.</p> <p>Eleven couriers claimed to Field that they were paid the equivalent of well below the national living wage. One said that working long hours on rural rounds meant their pay worked out at less than \u00a33 an hour, while another said they earned about \u00a36 an hour because they had to drive 12 miles to start their round.</p> <p>\u201cWe have chosen to exceed the national living wage and have set our minimum standard at \u00a37.50 per hour, taking into account any expenses the couriers may accrue,\u201d Hermes said. \u201cWe are confident in the accuracy of our courier pay model and our records clearly show that our average courier rate is \u00a39.80, 36% above the minimum wage, after all legitimate expenses have been deducted.\u201d</p> <p>It also said it was putting in place an independent ombudsman to handle complaints and was this month issuing a new code of conduct to staff, demanding that managers treat couriers with \u201cdignity and respect\u201d.</p> <p>Field wants a government investigation into the use of self-employed workers at Hermes and other firms. The <a href=\"http://file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/UK%20Labour%20Market%20July%202016%20(1).pdf\">latest official data</a> shows 83% of new jobs created in the UK between March and May were self-employed positions, which means they do not benefit from sick pay, paid holiday, pensions or employment protections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/gig-economy-zero-hours-contracts-ethics\">The gig economy is here to stay. So making it fairer must be a priority | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-new-prime-minister-theresa-may\">first speech as prime minister</a> in June, May directly addressed people who \u201chave a job but you don\u2019t always have job security\u201d, saying: \u201cThe government I lead will be driven, not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is the prime minister\u2019s first serious test of her commitment,\u201d Field said. </p> <p>In a letter to Field last week, James said she was monitoring the situation at Hermes and signalled her determination to clamp down on any inappropriate use of self-employment in the British economy.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I am unable to comment on the particular examples you refer to [at Hermes], I believe everyone deserves to be treated fairly at work, free from intimidation and abuse,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cEmployers cannot opt out of their employment law obligations by defining individuals as self-employed. An individual\u2019s employment status is established based on the reality of the working relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Field claims Hermes has been enjoying \u201calmost exclusively the benefits of self-employment, namely that it is not obliged to pay employers\u2019 national insurance and pension contributions, and is not covered by employment regulations covering the national living wage, holiday pay and sick pay. Yet the couriers themselves are enjoying few, if any, of the benefits.\u201d</p> <p>The results of any HMRC inquiry into the self-employed status of the firm\u2019s 10,500 contractors are likely to be closely watched by other firms in the so-called gig economy. </p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/uber-driver-employment-tribunal-minimum-wage\">Uber and Deliveroo also rely on self-employed workers</a> who do not receive sick pay, paid holiday, pension contributions or employment protection, but enjoy flexibility about when and how they work.</p>",

Just two of them so far this season, both from horse wrangling\u2019s Leroy Fer. 42 last season, which wasn\u2019t the worst in the Premier League, but it wasn\u2019t the best either, to say the least. Especially when the scorers of 23 of those goals have departed this summer. So plenty of pressure on Borja Baston, new arrival from Spain who might well make his debut today, particularly since the early signs from Fernando Llorente haven\u2019t been peachy.</p> <p><strong>But wait!</strong> Here\u2019s a helping hand for the shot-shy Swans. Could it be that David Luiz is their big hope, a man whose job description differs rather from his actual job. Luiz is a defender who doesn\u2019t seemingly like to defend very much, but who provides entertainment in other ways, because we\u2019ve all got to stay occupied in this world. </p> <p><strong>Antonio Conte has admitted that Luiz perhaps wasn\u2019t his first choice to strengthen his backline,</strong> a man used to having only the finest and most intimidating centre-backs at his disposal. But this could be quite a compelling sub-plot of the season: how will Conte cope with Luiz, and how will he get his potentially very talented defender to, well, defend reliably?

  "<p>The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, television\u2019s first western aimed at adults, starred Hugh O\u2019Brian, a rugged, 6ft-tall former marine drill instructor, who has died aged 91. He played the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/oct/12/tombstone-us-arizona-westerns-bed-breakfast\" title=\"\">old west law enforcer</a>, quick on the draw with his trusty long-barrelled Buntline Special Colt 45.</p> <p>Through more than 220 episodes (1955-61), he was seen keeping order in Ellsworth, Kansas, then Dodge City and, finally, Tombstone, Arizona. Although folk-hero fiction was embroidered into the action, the programme aimed at authenticity, basing Earp on Stuart N Lake\u2019s definitive 1931 biography of the American marshal who dressed impeccably in a frock coat, ruffled shirt, flowered silk vest, string tie and black sombrero. All that O\u2019Brian did not copy was Earp\u2019s handlebar moustache.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m convinced that he was a thoroughly honest man, righteous and utterly fearless,\u201d said the actor. \u201cHe was&#xa0;also just. In 200 gunfights, he killed only four men.\u201d</p> <p>Taking a percentage of the programme\u2019s profits, O\u2019Brian invested wisely in a building firm, a hotel, men\u2019s toiletries and a company renting guns to TV western producers. Later, he reprised the role of Earp in two 1989 episodes of Guns of Paradise and the TV movies The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw (1991) and Wyatt Earp: Return to Tombstone&#xa0;(1994).</p> <p>O\u2019Brian was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Edith (nee Marks), who was half-German and half-English with Scottish ancestry, and Hugh Krampe, a US marine corps officer turned sales executive whose parents were German immigrants.</p> <p>He attended New Trier high school, Winnetka, Illinois, and two military academies \u2013 Roosevelt, in Aledo, Illinois, and Kemper, in Boonville, Missouri. He left the University of Cincinnati after only one semester to enlist in the US Marine Corps (1943-47) and, at 17, became one of its youngest drill instructors in the second world war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cf1201e4fff1bd3aafd02a7c2bb741dc887cf22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cf1201e4fff1bd3aafd02a7c2bb741dc887cf22/383_206_2390_1435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh O\u2019Brian with Charlton Heston at the Annual Golden Boot awards, Los Angeles, in 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh O\u2019Brian with Charlton Heston at the Annual Golden Boot awards, Los Angeles, in 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When peace came, he had plans to study law and headed to Los Angeles to earn money to help him through Yale. However, he decided on acting as a career when a girlfriend was cast in the Somerset Maugham play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/oct/30/theatre.artsfeatures3\" title=\"\">Home and Beauty</a> at the Wilshire Ebell theatre, Los Angeles, in 1947. He found himself standing in for the leading man when the star fell ill and, seeing his surname misspelled for publicity purposes as Krape, decided to switch to O\u2019Brien \u2013 from his mother\u2019s family \u2013 but another misspelling led it to become O\u2019Brian, which he kept. Stage work continued in Los Angeles, as well as Santa Barbara.</p> <p>His lean, athletic physique led him to be cast as a sailor in the 1948 film version of Kidnapped, then he played a polio victim in Never Fear (1949). A contract with Universal International meant appearances in 18 supporting roles between 1951 and 1954, when he went freelance but found himself still playing second fiddle to stars such as Robert Wagner. TV and Wyatt Earp changed all that and he was a regular on the small screen for 40 years. His most significant film role came in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/jul/31/westerns-clinteastwood\" title=\"\">The Shootist (1976)</a>, as the last character shot by John Wayne on screen.</p> <p>In 1958, O\u2019Brian spent nine days working as a volunteer at Dr Albert Schweitzer\u2019s mission hospital on the banks of the Ogooue river in Gabon, Africa. Within weeks, he was inspired to set up Hoby \u2013 Hugh O\u2019Brian Youth Leadership \u2013 which has helped almost 400,000 15 and 16-year-olds to develop their talents in leadership, service and innovation. He was also a founder of the charity Thalians, formed in 1955 to raise money for children with mental health problems, and established the Hugh O\u2019Brian Acting Awards competition at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1964.</p> <p>A 1969 paternity suit judged him to be the father of Hugh Krampe Jr, the 16-year-old son of a Los Angeles photographer, Adina Etkes. In 2006, at the age of 81, O\u2019Brian married Virginia Barber, his partner of 18 years, who survives him.</p> <p>\u2022 Hugh O\u2019Brian (Hugh Charles Krampe), actor, born 19 April 1925; died 5 September 2016</p>",
  "<p>The historian and biographer Alex Danchev, who has died aged 60 from a heart attack, believed that it was artists rather than politicians who had the power to change society.</p> <p>Danchev made his name as a military historian, with acclaimed biographies of Oliver Franks (1993) and Basil Liddell Hart (1998), and a co-edition of the unexpurgated war diaries of Lord Alanbrooke (2001). More recently, artists had become his focus, although he continued to write about contemporary politics, notably Anglo-American relations and the so-called war on terror.

In all these well-received books \u2013 and his many essays on contemporary painters, photographers and film-makers \u2013 Danchev deployed to brilliant effect his knowledge of the literary culture that helped to form his subjects\u2019 work and thinking. He also wrote beautifully about the visual qualities of the art.</p> <p>His biography of Ren\u00e9 Magritte \u2013 a painter for whom poetry and philosophy were prime sources of inspiration \u2013 was incomplete at the time of his death.</p> <p>If this mixture of military history, philosophy, poetry and avant-garde art seems eccentric, for Danchev the interrelationships were essential. As he put it in the introduction to On Art and War and Terror (2009), \u201cArmed with art \u2026 we are more alert and less deceived.\u201d Artists (in the broadest sense of the term) being exceptionally acute \u201cwitnesses\u201d of their times must, he argued, be taken seriously as thinkers and moral agents; their works have political and ethical force. Seamus Heaney\u2019s statement, \u201cThe imaginative transformation of human life is the means by which we can most truly grasp and comprehend it\u201d was, he said, his credo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df2daf28a9a22daa9da4c791ee8417705e605e4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df2daf28a9a22daa9da4c791ee8417705e605e4d/0_136_4188_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mus\u00e9e Rene Magritte, Brussels, covered with a hoarding, in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mus\u00e9e Rene Magritte, Brussels, covered with a hoarding, in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the essay on Anselm Kiefer published in On Good and Evil and the Grey Zone (2016), Danchev expressed this controlling insight in characteristically pungent style: \u201cContrary to popular belief, it is given to artists, not politicians, to create a new world order.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Danchev was born in Bolton, Lancashire. His father, Alfons Danchev, was a mining engineer of Belgian and Bulgarian parentage who moved to London to complete his training in 1939 and, having worked for the BBC World Service during the second world war, became a British citizen in 1947. His mother, Anne Gilman, worked in the fashion industry. This background no doubt contributed to Alex\u2019s dislike of conventional boundaries and eventually to the impassioned opposition to binary thinking (\u201cus and them; black and white; good and evil; civilisation and barbarism\u201d) expressed in the essays gathered in On Art and War and Terror, and On Good and Evil and the Grey Zone.</p> <p>A first-class degree in history and economics at University College, Oxford (1977), and a postgraduate teacher-training certificate at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, were Danchev\u2019s passport to Sandhurst in 1978 and the start of a decade as an officer in the Royal Army Education Corps. Meanwhile, he completed a PhD in war studies at King\u2019s College London (1984). A research fellowship at King\u2019s in 1988-89 spelled the end of his army career and led to a lectureship in international relations at Keele University, with promotion to professor and head of the department in 1992.</p> <p>From Keele, he moved in 2004 to the school of politics and international relations at Nottingham University, and from there, finally, to St Andrews University in 2014. Successive high-profile visiting fellowships at Queen Mary University of London and St Antony\u2019s College, Oxford (2008-10), reflected the esteem in which his work was held.</p> <p>Danchev\u2019s energy was phenomenal: his commitment to teaching, for which he won several awards, remained intense despite his stream of publications, arduous administrative duties and membership of august editorial boards. Somehow, he also found time to review regularly for the Times Higher Education and Literary Supplements, the London Review of Books and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-danchev\" title=\"Alex Danchev in the Guardian\">the Guardian</a>. Reviewing sometimes triggered a major new project.

Typically, he prefaced his essays with quotations from thinkers and writers that proved to be perfectly apt, but that belonged to a period or milieu seemingly different from that of the subject in hand. Thus a sharply worded assessment of Tony Blair\u2019s role in the Iraq war was introduced by Aristotle\u2019s Ethics.</p> <p>Montaigne, Proust, Nietzsche, Kafka, Rilke and Beckett were among favourite points of reference, but the chorus of voices was neither stable nor predictable: it was always expanding to admit discoveries or rediscoveries. So, following a characteristic pattern, Danchev\u2019s research on Magritte led to his delighted discovery of the underrated Belgian Surrealist poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2009/aug/10/edinburgh-art-festival-enlightenments\" title=\"\">Paul Noug\u00e9,</a> who duly joined the select company worthy of quotation in an epigraph.</p> <p>Thinking laterally was one of Danchev\u2019s fortes and the mot juste another, for the dazzling erudition never came with the heavy hand of the pedant, but with the striking turn of phrase of the enthusiast keen to share with his readers the joys and revelations afforded by the books that had marked him.</p> <p>In his life and in his work Danchev was sustained by his partnership with the psychologist Dee Cooper, whom he married in 1998 and who, he said, immeasurably deepened his understanding of the complexities of human nature.</p> <p>A devotee of jazz, he relished good company and the good things of life, while not seeking to conceal his streak of moral earnestness. He is survived by Dee, his step-daughters, Sarah and Jemma, and his step-grandchildren, Alexander and Isabella.</p> <p>\u2022 Alexander Danchev, historian, born 26 August 1955; died 7 August 2016</p>",
  "<p>As the sun blazed down on the heart of the capital, this was a late summer day with particular significance for two of the elder statesmen of British cycling. In the final stage of the national Tour the pocket-sized Australian sprinter Caleb Ewan sprinted to his first win of the week while Steve Cummings sealed the most important stage race title of his career and Sir Bradley Wiggins completed what he is adamant will be his final road race, with just the London and Gent six-day track events to come before he hangs up his wheels for good this winter.</p> <p>The 35-year-old Cummings and the 36-year-old knight of the realm have much in common beyond a shared background in track cycling through the British pursuit squad, from which they transferred successfully to road racing, plus the fact that they share overall victories in the relaunched national tour \u2013 the only other Briton to win the event, the Devonian Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, was disqualified after a positive test for blood doping.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/steve-cummings-tour-of-britain-cycling\">Steve Cummings holds off rivals to close in on Tour of Britain title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pair share musical tastes \u2013 for years Wiggins\u2019s compilation of tracks for warming up was one made by Cummings \u2013 but, critically, both struggled to find the right environment within road cycling; Cummings truly blossomed only in the last two years after being given his head at MTN-Qubeka, now Dimension Data, while it took Wiggins seven years to find his feet. Cummings, like Wiggins, is at his best when choosing his own targets, to attain in his own way, but he is a tactician who thrives on broken racing whereas Wiggins needs a structured race to thrive.</p> <p>Cummings and his runner-up, Rohan Dennis, acknowledged that the key to the Briton\u2019s victory this week was the second stage through the Lake District, where Cummings paced his effort over the key climb of the Struggle to ensure that he had enough left in the tank at the end to open the decisive gap on the Australian and the eventual third-placed Tom Dumoulin of Holland. \u201cI won the race on stage two and I\u2019ve been hanging on to that ever since,\u201d said Cummings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/09/tour-of-britain-steve-cummings-yellow-jersey\">Tour of Britain: Steve Cummings battles his way into yellow jersey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cummings had twice finished second in his home Tour, in 2008 and 2011, but he is adamant that racing for an overall title does not suit him. \u201cI find it really stressful. You have to be up there all the time. You have to be a complete rider.\u201d On Wednesday\u2019s stage through Wales he struggled, to the extent that the Etixx team of the then race leader, Julien Vermote, contemplated trying to dislodge him. \u201cIt was harder than I thought. I\u2019m used to targeting just one day in a stage race. I know how to do that but perhaps I took my eye off the ball.\u201d</p> <p>Now, while Wiggins kicks back before his final track outings, Cummings will continue \u2013 subject to selection \u2013 to the world road race championships in Qatar, where he hopes to ride in support of his Dimension Data team-mate Mark Cavendish, who was prominent on team duty on Saturday but critically also on Monday, when he put in a massive effort to position Cummings at the front for the Struggle.</p> <p>He then hopes to continue to the final Classic of the season, the Tour of Lombardy. \u201cWhatever happens on Sunday, this week\u2019s been a success,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cIf I\u2019m not 100% and I can perform as I have here, that\u2019s a good sign for those goals.\u201d With stage victories in three major stage races this year, plus a second stage win at the Tour de France, this has been by far the most successful year of his career, and it has a little way still to go.</p>",

By contrast, Liberty\u2019s headquarters are in the sleepy town of Englewood, Colorado. The cable TV and media giant is listed on Nasdaq and majority owned by the billionaire John Malone, nicknamed Darth Vader for his ruthless deal-making style.</p> <p>In the year to 31 December 2015 Liberty made a $248m net profit from revenues of $4.8bn. Its big-name sports credentials have to date been limited to the Eurosport TV channel and the Atlanta Braves baseball team. The firm is not well-known in Europe but it is a power player in the entertainment world.</p> <p>Liberty holds a 34% stake in the event promoter Live Nation, which in turn owns Ticketmaster. The sister company Liberty Global, which is also majority owned by Malone, owns Virgin Media plus the TV production company behind Midsomer Murders and The Only Way is Essex, and 10% of ITV. It also has a stake in the Formula E electric racing series alongside Discovery Communications. Malone owns 29% of the voting rights in Discovery, which is the parent group of Eurosport.</p> <p>F1 is one of Liberty\u2019s biggest single investments and, provided that the deal gets regulatory clearance it will end up with a 35.3% stake, with Malone personally holding 3.1%. Another 1% will be in the hands of Liberty\u2019s chief executive, Greg Maffei, and 24.7% retained by the previous controlling owner, the private equity firm CVC.</p> <p>The purchase is being fuelled with more than $1bn of cash together with payment in Liberty shares and $351m of debt. Liberty is also taking on F1\u2019s existing $4.1bn in bank debt \u2013 meaning Delta Topco has an overall enterprise value of $8bn. It is high-octane and there is good reason for that.</p> <p>F1 has three core revenue streams. Starting at the bottom, in the year to the end of December 2015 $250m came from selling trackside advertising at each of the 19 races and sponsorship of the series. F1\u2019s partners include the parcel delivery service DHL and Heineken, which signed up in June, and will be handing over an estimated $40m&#xa0;annually.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/f1-zip/giv-22601oq1l6TqGTr0D\" data-alt=\"How F1's finances work\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/f1-zip/giv-22601oq1l6TqGTr0D\">How F1's finances work</a> </figure>  <p>There are two other major sources of F1\u2019s revenue \u2013 fees from circuits that host races and broadcasting rights. They each bring in roughly the same amount and last year it came to a combined $1.2bn.</p> <p>Along with $339.4m from other sources this gave Delta Topco total revenue of $1.7bn in 2015 \u2013 with underlying profits of $464m. In the decade that CVC has held the keys F1 has made total net profits of $3.5bn and it has a well-oiled formula.</p> <p>F1 doesn\u2019t own any tracks or teams so costs are kept under tight control. The company only has 356 staff and its biggest single cost is a payment of 63% of its gross profits to the teams as prize money. Over the five years to 2015 the prize money payment shot up nearly 30% to just over $900m due to the boom in interest in F1. It is a staggering sum but it isn\u2019t the only trick under F1\u2019s bonnet.</p> <p>Ecclestone has promoted F1 to emerging markets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/sep/20/f1-singapore-grand-prix-live\" title=\"\">such as Singapore</a> and Bahrain, which view the races as away to boost their global status or drive tourism through the sport\u2019s 400m TV viewers. The limited number of slots on the F1 calendar has fuelled an arms race in the amount countries are prepared to spend to get a race with the highest hosting fees rising to nearly $80m annually.</p> <p>To insulate against inflation, the key contracts contain an escalator clause which increases the amount paid by 10% annually. Only 10% to 20% of them need to be renewed annually as they have an average length of around five years. It gives F1 contracted revenue of $9.3bn up to 2026 which makes it very different to other sports because its financial performance is not related to the events on track.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/04/f1-italian-grand-prix-live\">F1: Nico Rosberg wins Italian Grand Prix \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And CVC has been the biggest winner. Since it invested in F1 in 2006 CVC has extracted $4.4bn from dividends and the sale of stakes in Delta Topco.</p> <p>Pro rata, CVC\u2019s 38.1% stake will give it $1.7bn in cash and shares in Liberty bringing its total haul to $6.1bn \u2013 that is a 532% return on the $965.6m that CVC invested in 2006 putting F1 in pole position to be its most profitable investment.</p> <p>In contrast, CVC made a 314% return from its investment in gaming firm William Hill and 292% from stockbroker Collins Stewart. Although its biggest return is believed to be the 831% it got from the 2005 sale of a Spanish hospital business \u2013 but that only returned \u20ac222m in cash.</p> <p>CVC can\u2019t afford to take its hands off the wheel just yet though as the sale to Liberty is still far from the finish line. Perhaps the biggest hurdle is that the FIA has a 1% stake in Delta Topco which CVC granted it in 2013. The FIA paid just over $458,000 for the stake which is now worth $44m and, according to the share transfer agreement, it can only be cashed in when CVC sells its shares.</p> <p>In order for the sale to proceed consent is needed from the FIA and the European Commission. The FIA has to decide whether Liberty is a \u2018fit and proper\u2019 owner of F1 but the EC may consider it to be conflicted due to its financial interest in the sale.

  "<p>Lawyers representing a Libyan husband and wife who were kidnapped and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s prisons are seeking to overturn a decision that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute a former MI6 officer for his alleged role.</p> <p>Mark Allen, the head of counter-terrorism at the agency at the time of the so-called rendition operations, had set out his role in a letter to the Gaddafi government that came to light during the 2011 Libyan revolution. </p> <p>However the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/mi6-officers-not-charges-rendition-of-libyan-families-abdel-hakim-belhaj\">Crown Prosecution Service decided earlier this year that Allen \u2013 now Sir Mark \u2013 should face no criminal charges</a>, a ruling that the victims said reflected poorly on British justice.</p> <p>Lawyers for the couple are now seeking a judicial review of the CPS decision, which they have denounced as a \u201csee no evil, hear no evil\u201d ruling that has put the government and its intelligence agencies above the rule of law.</p> <p>Cori Crider of the legal charity Reprieve said: \u201cIt\u2019s sad that the CPS will aggressively prosecute journalists for \u2018misconduct in public office\u2019, but a top MI6 officer who helped render kids and a pregnant woman to Gaddafi walks free. It\u2019s sadder still that prosecutors felt victim families should have no role in the \u2018victims\u2019 review.\u2019 The family\u2019s view is clear. Justice was denied. The decision leaves the UK\u2019s security services basically exempt from British law. That\u2019s why they are fighting it.\u201d</p> <p>Abdel Hakim Belhaj, an opponent of Gaddafi, and his wife Fatima Bouchar, were abducted in Thailand in March 2004 while en route from Malaysia to the UK, where they had planned to apply for political asylum. </p> <p>They were held briefly at an American detention facility in Bangkok, and allegedly tortured, before being bound and gagged and flown to Tripoli. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/08/special-report-britain-rendition-libya\">Bouchar, who was pregnant, says she was taped head to foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight</a>.</p> <p>Evidence of MI6 involvement emerged in correspondence between Allen and Gaddafi\u2019s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, that was discovered during the Libyan revolution.</p> <p>Other documents included a fax from the CIA to Tripoli, which gave details of a second UK-Libyan rendition operation, in which another opponent of Gaddafi, Sami al-Saadi, was kidnapped in Hong Kong and flown to Tripoli along with his wife and four children.</p> <p> Scotland Yard spent four years investigating the kidnappings and sent a 28,000-page file to the CPS. Police are understood to believe that they had built a particularly formidable case against MI6 in the Saadi case.</p> <p>Detectives are said to have been dismayed that the CPS concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against Allen or anyone else. In making public their decision, the CPS disclosed that Allen had \u201csought political authority for some of his actions\u201d. </p> <p>In a letter to the CPS, Belhaj\u2019s lawyers at the London firm Leigh Day claim that the decision is unreasonable. They say: \u201cIt appears the CPS has erroneously proceeded on the basis that political approval would be a reasonable excuse for the conduct under investigation.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the legal charity Reprieve has complained to the information commissioner over the government\u2019s refusal to disclose whether ministers or Downing Street officials were in any way involved in the decision to not bring charges. </p> <p>There was no comment from the CPS or Allen, who was not directly named in the CPS statement.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cAn ordinary day ended as the biggest manmade ecological disaster in history,\u201d says one of the taglines. </p> <p>Trailers for the new disaster movie Deepwater Horizon, based on the April 2010 disaster, which will be released later this month, quickly shift from sickly sweet family scenes of Mark Wahlberg bidding farewell to his wife and daughter as he goes off to work on a huge oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to a desperate fight for survival, as panicked workers scramble to escape the burning oil rig.</p> <p>The Hollywood marketeers are right with their tagline. It was a global disaster with far-reaching human and environmental consequences. Eleven people were killed and about 4.9m barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">worst spill in US history</a>.</p> <p>The story of Deepwater Horizon is also \u201ctragedy on an epic scale\u201d for BP, which operated the rig, according to the US corporate governance expert Lynn Stout. The oil company was later found to have been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/04/bp-reckless-conduct-oil-spill-judge-rules\">grossly negligent in its handling </a>of the well and has faced <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/bp-fined-further-25bn-over-deeepwater-horizon-spill\">billions of dollars in penalties</a>.</p> <p>Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School, chose the story of how profit-driven decisions at BP led to disaster to open her 2012 book The Shareholder Value Myth.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In her view, there are wider lessons to learn from BP\u2019s tale about how costcutting and skimping on safety procedures to secure short-term shareholder gains ended up costing investors in the long run. </p> <p>The Deepwater Horizon disaster is one example of a problem that afflicts many companies, she says. That problem is the idea that the company belongs to its shareholders and exists for one purpose only: to maximise wealth for those shareholders.</p> <p>Six years on from the deadly blowout, you do not have to look far for more examples of companies misbehaving and cutting corners, which subsequently hurts shareholders. </p> <p>Last week, Sports Direct <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sports-directs-biggest-investors-want-independent-review-mike-ashley-keith-hellawell\">faced anger from shareholders</a> after the company accepted that it had not treated employees properly. The admission followed months of pressure on the retailer\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley, and Sports Direct after the Guardian highlighted <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">a climate of fear </a>at the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire. As the revelations about the company began to batter its reputation, the share price fell and previously quiet stockholders emerged to voice their disquiet.</p> <p>Everyone loses here. The workers, the shareholders and business at large.<br></p> <p>Many companies, particularly smaller ones, will tell you they exist for their employees and customers, as much as for shareholder gains. Yet those who want to serve a wider base of stakeholders may find themselves hamstrung by a legal system that appears to put shareholder interests centre stage. For all their willingness to do good, is it not the primary duty of company directors to create value for shareholders?</p> <p>There does not appear to be a straightforward answer. Lawyers will disagree over how company directors should interpret the 2006 Companies Act, which <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/pdfs/ukpga_20060046_en.pdf\">states in section 172</a> (pdf) that \u201ca director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members\u201d. But for Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, there is no question that this statement makes shareholder primacy explicit. As he put it in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/833.aspx\">speech exploring company ownership</a> last year: \u201cFor the first time in history, shareholder primacy had been hardwired into companies\u2019 statutory purposes.\u201d</p> <p>This idea of shareholder primacy is seen in the way that a company\u2019s share price performance has increasingly become the key measure of success.</p> <p>As in Stout\u2019s Deepwater Horizon example, the pitfalls of this are obvious. When chief executives manage the share price rather than the company itself, short-termism can quickly take over. Investment suffers as shareholders hungry for dividends demand ever increasing payouts, while risk taking rises, as demonstrated to disastrous global effect by the financial crisis.</p> <p>When the shareholder is king, a company\u2019s long-term success and impact on those around it take a back seat.</p> <p>But campaigners for a different kind of capitalism say it does not have to be this way. A growing movement is putting forward a new model, where directors answer to a range of stakeholders, such as employees and the environment, not just investors. Those pushing for change may dare to hope their calls will be answered now that Theresa May is vowing tackle corporate irresponsibility and \u201creform capitalism so that it works for everyone not just the privileged few\u201d.</p> <p>The good news for the prime minister is that a simple amendment to company law could make a big difference. </p> <p>The charity <a href=\"http://bcorporation.uk/meet-b-lab-uk\">B Lab UK</a> is urging the government to pass \u201cbenefit company\u201d legislation. The reform would give companies the option to reject shareholder primacy and be managed for the benefit of all stakeholders, according to the charity, which represents a growing number of so-called B Corps, or benefit corporations. This model has three mandatory elements: a broadened purpose, director accountability and stakeholder transparency.</p> <p>The movement behind benefit corporations <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps/our-history\">started a decade ago</a> in the US to pioneer the idea that companies are \u201cbest for the world\u201d, rather than best in the world. The movement has spread to include 1,800 B Corps in 50 countries.</p> <p>In some places, laws have been changed for companies to turn themselves into B Corps, but in others, no such change has been deemed necessary. Some corporate governance experts argue that the UK is one such case and the law already allows for a wide range of stakeholders to be considered by company chiefs. At the moment, when a UK company becomes a B Corp, it changes its constitution.</p> <p>However, B Lab UK says a small amendment to the law would clear things up. As the charity\u2019s co-founder James Perry says, for directors worried about where their legal duties lie, a law \u201cgives you a fighting chance, or a platform\u201d to act in the interests of society and the environment.</p> <p>Perry, who helped set up the frozen ready meals retailer Cook, insists that the change would still leave companies with the option to continue putting shareholders first. But ultimately, the market will decide, he says. Those who choose the broader stakeholder model may find that it makes more business sense. The hope is that a sense of purpose raises longer-run success, helps recruit and retain skilled staff, and appeals to customers. The B Corps movement in the UK likes to say it is to business what Fairtrade certification is to coffee.</p> <p>If the new government is serious about shaking up capitalism, this is an easy win. Companies\u2019 corporate and social responsibility programmes can do good, but they do not address the root causes of corporate misbehaviour, misjudgments or recklessness. For that, we must move beyond a world where shareholders reign supreme.</p>",

He was arrested at Heathrow airport in February and has been on police bail since.</p> <p>His mother Angela Wood told the Newark Advertiser earlier this year: \u201cWe still believe Aiden should never have been arrested in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cAiden should be being treated as a hero for doing what the UK government should be doing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) announced last week that it intended to impose its strictest regulations on a drug that many claim can help treat opioid addiction, the public outcry was immediate.</p> <p>\u201cThis hit us out of the blue,\u201d said Susan Ash, the founder of the American Kratom Association. At the end of August, the DEA announced its intention to define kratom, a south-east Asian plant, and its active chemical components as a schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, along with cannabis, heroin, and other drugs that are deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no recognized medical use. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hearing people that are terrified, literally scared to death of going back to old ways of life, whether that means living in chronic pain when nothing else has worked for them, dealing with PTSD, listening to all the people fearful that they\u2019re going to go back on either prescribed or illicit opiates and possibly could die,\u201d said Ash. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional.\u201d</p> <p>Russ Bayer of the DEA said the agency \u201cmade the determination after a review of some of the scientific and medical literature out in the world that kratom poses such an imminent threat\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/prescription-drugs-what-if-you-depend-on-opioids-chronic-pain\">War on prescription drugs: what if you depend on opioids to live a decent life?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kratom, which is botanically related to coffee, is currently not regulated at all and can be obtained through any number of companies on the internet or at health food or smoke shops. Some users say they would like it to be more strictly regulated \u2013 so they could be sure they are actually getting the plant and not other chemicals \u2013 but they think it is ridiculous to say it has no currently accepted medical usage.</p> <p>Advocates say that the drug has prevented countless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/congress-passes-opioids-bill-anti-addiction-legislation\">opioid-related</a> deaths, but the fact that it activates opioid receptors has caused the DEA to miscategorize the active compounds \u2013 mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine \u2013 as <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-20803.pdf\">opioids</a>. \u201cThey know it\u2019s not an opioid and yet they call it an opioid because they knew they would get congressional support from all the congresspeople who are dealing with opioid epidemics in their own states.\u201d</p> <p>People also use it recreationally or to treat pain. Users say it helps everything from PTSD to menstrual cramps. In small doses, many people say kratom has a stimulant effect and even as the opiate effect increases with the dosage, many users manage it in such a way that it helps them get through the workday, instead of sending them out on the nod. Marion Winik, a Baltimore-based writer and professor, says she uses one spoonful early in the day, like tea, for work and doesn\u2019t need to use it again. Other users say they take it throughout the day.</p> <p>The DEA cites 660 emergency room calls over the last five years and 15 deaths related to kratom over the last two, but advocates insist that in all of those deaths there were other chemicals involved.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been no direct deaths tied to kratom,\u201d Ash said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had an expert toxicologist review reports and conclude that you cannot attribute kratom solely as the cause of death for anyone, anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>One 2008 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670991/\">study</a> found that subjects who took kratom suffered seizure-like symptoms only after mixing it with another drug, modafinil, and found that it could mitigate opioid withdrawal.</p> <p>Ash, a lobbyist, founded the American Kratom Association after the substance helped her beat an opioid addiction that started with a narcotics prescription. </p> <p>After she went through a rehabilitation program, Ash says, a doctor said she would have to take subutex or suboxone, pharmaceuticals often used to treat opioid addiction, for the rest of her life. But those drugs are also narcotics and Ash realized \u201cI was repeating the same old addict patterns with the subutex\u201d.</p> <p>She had used kratom to combat withdrawals when she feared running out of her monthly prescriptions, so she tried it again two years ago. \u201cAnd literally within a two-week period of time, I was up and around and productive and so passionate about this that I started this organization. Whereas the last few years of my life had been largely bedridden and before that I was leaving the house only to see doctors; now I\u2019m flying across the country advocating for this plant.\u201d</p> <p>The DEA acknowledges the public outcry, which resulted in a \u201cWe the People\u201d <a href=\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance\">petition</a> to the White House that quickly gained 100,000 signatures.</p> <p>Bayer, of the DEA, said he had received many calls from people who say they have used kratom to treat their opioid addiction. </p> <p>\u201cOr: \u2018I\u2019ve had chronic pain with the exception of the last year while I\u2019ve been taking kratom.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve had anxiety or posttraumatic stress disorder, I\u2019m a U.S. military veteran, except for when I\u2019ve taken kratom over the last several months.\u2019 So we get that,\u201d Bayer said.</p> <p>Jag Davies of the Drug Policy Alliance called the DEA\u2019s decision a reversion back to drug war policymaking. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really shocking that despite all the progress that\u2019s been made toward treating drugs as a health issue instead of a criminal justice issue that still the politicians and policymakers go with knee-jerk prohibition,\u201d said Davies. \u201cKratom is suffering the same fate as other medicinal plants that have been used for millennia in that there is no incentive for pharmaceutical companies to spend millions of dollars on research to get FDA approval ... There\u2019s no good reason for people who are using kratom to be treated as criminals.\u201d</p> <p>The scheduling is temporary, but many people think it is unlikely to be reversed. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fairly unlikely that the DEA is going to change its mind, because it never does. They\u2019re robots when it comes to prohibition,\u201d Davies said. </p> <p>Albert Garcia-Romeu, who was beginning research to conduct a kratom study at Johns Hopkins University says that the temporary scheduling is structured to create the conditions for keeping it illegal. \u201cThere will likely be a surge in adulterated kratom-like products being sold on the black market\u201d and a corresponding \u201cincrease in poisonings and ER visits attributed to kratom, which will then solidify their stance keep it Schedule I\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Jos\u00e9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-claudio-bravo-red-rooney-tackle-penalty\" title=\"\">Mourinho was quick to criticise his players</a> after Saturday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/10/manchester-united-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">2-1 defeat by Manchester City</a>. \u201cA few players were below the level,\u201d he complained. \u201cSometimes players disappoint managers.\u201d But Mourinho\u2019s tactical blunder was equally to blame for Manchester United\u2019s poor first-half performance and their improvement after the break owed much to his change of formation.</p> <p>City\u2019s most dangerous players in Pep Guardiola\u2019s 4-3-3 system are the two advanced central midfielders, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne. Although both are more accustomed to higher positions, they have adjusted excellently to their new roles, driving forward and combining swiftly between the lines. Without the threat of Sergio Ag\u00fcero, usually City\u2019s obvious dangerman, Mourinho\u2019s primary task was protecting the zone where Silva and De Bruyne operate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City\u2019s derby delight as De Bruyne inspires win over United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, Mourinho made no obvious plans. He continued with a midfield duo of Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba, a combination that was repeatedly exposed throughout the first half. Pogba, in particular, gave an incredibly indisciplined midfield display, positioning himself as if he were playing in a midfield trio, the system he is accustomed to. He was often caught ahead of the ball at turnovers, which left Fellaini isolated in front of the defence. The Belgian has generally been impressive this season but was inevitably incapable of shutting down both Silva and De Bruyne.</p> <p>United\u2019s problem was exacerbated by their full-backs, Antonio Valencia and Luke Shaw, being dragged out towards the touchlines as City stretched the play determinedly through the left-sided Nolito and right-sided Raheem Sterling. Therefore, huge gaps opened up in the channels, most obviously in City\u2019s inside-left position. De Bruyne put himself between Eric Bailly, Valencia and Fellaini. No one knew who was supposed to be stopping him.</p> <p>De Bruyne ran the show, repeatedly collecting long passes into that inside\u2011left channel. City generally built play down the left, then switched balls to Sterling, as if Shaw had been identified as United\u2019s weak link. But none of the home defence looked comfortable, with the usually reliable Daley Blind caught out badly for the opener, scored by De Bruyne. That goal, from a long ball, and the second, by Kelechi Iheanacho from a rebound, did not do justice to City\u2019s slick passing football, but this was a hugely impressive all-round performance.</p> <p>After Zlatan Ibrahimovic had offered United a lifeline shortly before half-time, Mourinho\u2019s tactical switch changed the game dramatically. The two wide players, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Jesse Lingard, were sacrificed, with Ander Herrera introduced as a third central midfielder, Marcus Rashford brought on down the left, and Wayne Rooney moving to the right. It was now 4-3-3, with three outright forwards.</p> <p>The difference was immediate. Herrera won a tackle within the first minute of the second half, and provided more discipline in front of the back four. Pogba and Fellaini pushed forward, the latter acting as a target for long balls, and United started to dominate. In particular, their pressing improved significantly: the goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who made a nervous start to his City career, suddenly found himself without passing options. United\u2019s attackers pushed forward on to City\u2019s defenders and everyone else backed up, tracking individuals closely when they dropped into deep positions. City were under pressure.</p> <p>Therefore, Guardiola changed things decisively just eight minutes into the second half, with the holding midfielder Fernando replacing the centre-forward Iheanacho, and Fernandinho and De Bruyne, City\u2019s two outstanding players on the day, pushed forward to maintain the 4-3-3 system. The extra defensive qualities, and the added midfield discipline, worked excellently, as City stabilised the game and regained control. They should have capitalised more on their counterattacking chances, particularly after Leroy San\u00e9 replaced Sterling down the right, but United\u2019s best spell had arrived before Guardiola\u2019s change.</p> <p>Mourinho waited until 10 minutes from time before using his final change, Anthony Martial for Shaw. United now in effect played four up front in the closing stages, and Guardiola \u2013 always keen to maintain a spare man in defence \u2013 switched to a 5-4-1, with the ultra-versatile Fernandinho playing his third position of the day as City were forced to defend long balls.</p> <p>Guardiola won this tactical battle: his starting system outfoxed Mourinho, and when the United manager changed things intelligently to chase the game, City\u2019s head coach responded to every move quickly and effectively. Tactical battles are not simply about defensive, cagey football \u2013 this was fascinating strategically, and also a brilliantly entertaining game.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has endorsed a new cross-party campaign created by prominent pro-Brexit politicians aimed at pressuring Theresa May into fully delivering on the promise that Britain will leave the EU.<br></p> <p>Johnson, a prominent leave campaigner who is now foreign secretary in May\u2019s government, said the Change Britain campaign, led by the pro-Brexit Labour MP Gisela Stuart, would ensure the UK gained control over \u201claws, borders, money and trade\u201d as it exited the EU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">Business leaders and MPs attack Liam Fox over 'fat and lazy' accusations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His decision to record a message supporting Change Britain indicated the continued tensions over the issue within May\u2019s government, where Johnson, along with other prominent pro-Brexiters Liam Fox and David Davis, is seen as pressing the case for a rapid and comprehensive exit.</p> <p>Adding to the pressure on May this weekend, the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/10/theresa-may-should-invoke-article-50-within-weeks-says-john-whit/\">said in an interview on Sunday</a> that she should invoke article 50, which triggers the formal process for EU departure, within weeks, rather than waiting for next year. </p> <p>It also emerged that the new manifesto for Change Britain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge\">makes no mention of the leave campaign\u2019s pledge</a> of a \u00a3350m-a-week bonanza for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> if Britain left the EU.</p> <p>Many senior figures from Vote Leave are involved in Change Britain. As well as Johnson and Stuart, these include Michael Gove, the Tory former justice secretary, the former chancellor Nigel Lawson, Digby Jones, former head of the CBI, and David Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary.</p> <p>The NHS pledge was at the heart of the Vote Leave message in the run-up to the 23 June vote, and was displayed on its official battlebus, but the <a href=\"http://www.changebritain.org/\">website for Change Britain</a>, which, the group says, aims to \u201cdeliver the UK\u2019s referendum result in the most effective way\u201d, makes no mention of the NHS.</p> <p>Instead, Change Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit Means Brexit\u201d page said any savings made as a result of no longer having to pay into the EU budget should be spent on guaranteeing \u201ccontinued funding for farming, science, universities and poorer regions of the UK\u201d. </p> <p>Anna Soubry, the pro-remain Tory MP and former minister for small business, said it was outrageous that the leave campaigners had \u201cpeddled that lie\u201d during the campaign and were now quietly abandoning it.</p> <p>The remain camp argued all along that it was wrong to claim that the UK sent \u00a3350m a week to Brussels, as this was the gross figure and did not take account of the large sums of money that came back in EU farm and other subsidies, including structural funds and education and research grants. The idea that so much extra money could be guaranteed for the NHS post-Brexit was also challenged as totally unrealistic.</p> <p>Soubry, a leading light in Open Britain, the successor to the remain campaign, added: \u201cThey should all hang their heads in shame. There were many people, particularly in less wealthy areas, who were convinced by Leave\u2019s claim that if we left the EU we would be able to pour millions more into the NHS. The danger now is these people will become even more disillusioned with all politicians because this lot misled them.\u201d</p> <p>A group of more than 20 Labour MPs, meanwhile, have written an open letter to the leading Brexiters in Change Britain asking that they apologise over the \u00a3350m promise if it is not kept.</p> <p>There should be \u201cno escaping this pledge for the leave campaign\u201d, wrote the MPs, among them Liz Kendall, Chuka Umunna and Mary Creagh. The letter says: \u201cThey cannot walk away from it now, disown it or pretend it never happened. They must either admit it was a lie and apologise to their voters, or justify it and explain when it is coming.\u201d</p> <p>But speaking on Sunday, Stuart denied that anyone had been misled or that the pledge had been dropped.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, the priority was the NHS, but you need to be in government to actually implement that,\u201d she told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr show of the pledge. \u201cFirst of all we\u2019ve got to leave, and then we can make the decisions. To me and to many of us the priority is the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>In his message for Change Britain, Johnson said: \u201cOn 23 June the people of this country voted to leave the European Union and they voted for change. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey did so by a clear majority. But there were many people who also voted for remain. So it\u2019s absolutely vital that we work together, leavers and remainers, as we seize the opportunities that this country now has to forge a positive and exciting new relationship, not just with the European Union, but also with the rest of the world; changing Britain and making it global again. </p> <p> \u201cNow, more than ever, we need to show the British people that as politicians we are listening to what they have to say. </p> <p>\u201cBrexit means Brexit and that means delivering on their instructions and restoring UK control over our laws, borders, money and trade.\u201d </p>",

Several women have been arrested in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a> in recent days as police believed a cell was about to attack Paris\u2019s Gare de Lyon station, days after trying to blow up a car near Notre Dame. </p> <p>The commando \u2013 including a 23-year-old woman who had been engaged at different times to two French extremists who carried out attacks this summer \u2013 illustrated how extensive new terror cells have been able to form in France since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks\">November attacks that killed 130 in Paris</a> last year. A 15-year-old boy was also arrested and questioned at the weekend over links to the failed plot.</p> <p>The boy had been under house arrest since France declared a state of emergency after the Paris attacks, two judicial sources said on condition of anonymity. They did not say why he was under house arrest. His arrest on Saturday came as he was planning an attack in a public place in the French capital, one of the sources said.</p> <p>The prime minister, Manuel Valls, <a href=\"http://www.europe1.fr/politique/ce-quil-faut-retenir-de-lintervention-de-manuel-valls-sur-europe-1-2843608\">said on Sunday</a> that the current terror threat in France was at \u201cmaximum\u201d and that at least two terror attacks had been thwarted in the past week. </p> <p>In a country that has seen more than 230 people die in terrorist attacks since January 2015, Valls said: \u201cThere will be more attacks. There will be innocent victims. Each time I say those words, because it\u2019s my role, I realise the importance and gravity of it.\u201d </p> <p>He said 700 French jihadis were currently fighting with Isis in Syria, including more than 200 women. French security services were also watching 15,000 people for radicalisation. He rejected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/sarkozy-terrorism-france-special-courts-detention-facilities\">repeated calls</a> by the rightwing former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/le-comeback-kid-sarkozy-shapes-up-for-presidential-run-on-hardline-platform\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> for a type of internment in which people suspected of showing signs of radicalisation would be put in special detention centres. </p> <p>Valls said Sarkozy was wrong to try to \u201cstrangle the state of law\u201d. Despite a serious overcrowding problem already facing French prisons, Valls said that 10,000 new prison places had to be created in the next 10 years for isolation cells and dedicated units for radicalised prisoners. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54dd6e21a3017b4c790d0f0ac359f37db4365369\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54dd6e21a3017b4c790d0f0ac359f37db4365369/0_22_1708_1026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The discovery of a car near Notre Dame Cathedral last Sunday containing six gas canisters sparked a security alert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The discovery of a car near Notre Dame cathedral last Sunday containing six gas canisters sparked a security alert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ornella G\u2019s fingerprints were found in a Peugeot 607 car that was abandoned last Sunday a few hundred metres from Notre Dame in an area thronging with tourists. The car contained five gas cylinders, three bottles of diesel and a lit cigarette. Two women are suspected of attempting to blow up the car before fleeing when they saw a man they believed to be a plainclothes police officer.</p> <p>Ornella G, who has three children, had been previously known to authorities for wanting to go to Syria to join jihadis. Her lawyer told French media that she had confessed to investigators. The French paper <a href=\"http://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Ines-Ornella-Sarah-Amel-qui-sont-les-femmes-qui-voulaient-attaquer-Paris-808318\">Le Journal du Dimanche</a> reported that she had told investigators that she and another woman had driven around Paris in the early hours of last Sunday morning, initially considering blowing up the car near the Eiffel Tower. </p> <p>She has been charged with association with a terrorist group and attempted murder by an organised group. She was arrested at a service station in southern France as she attempted to flee south with her children and former partner. </p> <p>Ines Madani, 19, who is also suspected of taking part in the failed Notre Dame attack, continued to be questioned on Sunday. She was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/paris-women-arrested-had-planned-imminent-attack-gare-de-lyon-say-officials\">arrested</a> on Thursday in a town south-east of Paris with two other women as they prepared to carry out what officials called another \u201cimminent attack\u201d on a railway station, probably Paris\u2019s Gare de Lyon. In her handbag, she had a written statement of allegiance to Isis. </p> <p>Another of the women arrested, referred to as Sarah H, aged 23, had been engaged at different times to two French extremists who carried out deadly attacks earlier this year. One of them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/14/french-police-officer-wife-murdered-larossi-abballa-isis\">Larossi Abballa</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/14/french-police-officer-wife-murdered-larossi-abballa-isis\">murdered a police commander</a> and his police officer partner in June at their home in Magnanville outside Paris in the presence of their three-year-old son. He filmed the aftermath on Facebook Live before dying in a police raid. The other was Adel Kermiche, who slit the throat of an elderly French priest during morning mass in Normandy in July. </p>",
  "<p>Marc Forster is a wildly unreliable film-maker: the devastatingly effective drama Monster\u2019s Ball remains his all-time high; Machine Gun Preacher his indisputable low. Still, there\u2019s no denying he\u2019s an incredibly talented visual stylist. For the opening sequence of All I See Is You, Forster stuns with a total banger of a scene that boldly attempts to pit you inside the head of a blind person. It\u2019s a sensorial overload. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/30/blake-lively-cafe-society-woody-allen-interview\">Blake Lively on sharks, starlets and filming with Woody Allen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He doesn\u2019t let up for the first third of his film, which sees Blake Lovely as Gina \u2013 a remarkably beautiful and sweet-natured young woman, living in Bangkok with her doting husband James (Jason Clarke) \u2013 go about her life without the ability to see. Forster, with the help of cinematographer Matthias Koenigswieser and a killer sound design team, conjures up hallucinatory passages to imagine how Gina experiences the world. </p> <p>These early scenes are so intoxicating than when Gina gradually begins to gain her eyesight back following a new procedure, it\u2019s a bit of letdown (as warped as that sounds).</p> <p>To celebrate, James whisks her away to Barcelona to visit her sister, and make peace with the site of the accident that caused her to go blind as a child. Gina returns to Bangkok changed. She does away with her old drab wardrobe to embrace the fact she looks like Blake Lively. When she dyes her hair a lighter shade of blonde, it noticeably irks her husband, who\u2019s taken aback by how men now perceive her. The freshly empowered Gina seems to pose a threat to man used to caring for her.</p> <p>It takes All I See Is You most of its two-hour running time to reach this point. The jarring lack of conflict is likely what prompted a steady stream of walkouts at the Toronto film festival\u2019s first press screening. For much of his film, Forster just lets the narrative idly glide along, as Gina becomes acquainted with her regained sense and James grows more removed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/a-monster-calls-review-liam-neesons-tree-offers-pre-teen-bereavement-therapy\">A Monster Calls review: Liam Neeson's tree offers pre-teen bereavement therapy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lively acquits herself skillfully with the transition Gina experiences, grounding her journey every step of the way. Clarke is suitably loving until he\u2019s not; the actor\u2019s sinister grin offers a glimpse of where the story is heading. </p> <p>When the inevitable twist comes during the film\u2019s final stretch it doesn\u2019t come as a shock (Toronto did after all bill All I See Is You as a thriller), but it does feel extremely rushed given the languid pacing of all that came before. The last minute developments are ludicrous (James\u2019s motivations are woefully undeveloped), so the Hitchcock-like tone Forster strains to set rings false. </p> <p>Even as All I See Is You descends into soapy nonsense, it remains visually engaging. The eerie overhead shots coupled with the stunning locations keep the film entrancing as the plot goes off the rails.</p>",

They laid into the Senate committee with a vigor that Brennan, who still had to answer to it, could not. The Formers, who would in September 2015 attack the report in a book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rebuttal-Intelligence-Committees-Detention-Interrogation/dp/1591145872/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471570496&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rebuttal\">Rebuttal</a>, called the committee\u2019s work a partisan hit job. They disdained it for not interviewing CIA officials involved in the program \u2013 all the while ignoring the fact that committee Republicans and Obama\u2019s justice department prevented Jones from conducting those interviews. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/10/former-cia-leadership-fight-back-torture-report\">reiterated the insistence</a> that torture yielded a wealth of intelligence and derided the Senate report for what they called its leaps in logic. One of them was former acting director Michael Morell, a frequent television guest, who would publish a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Great-War-Our-Time-Terrorism/dp/1455585661\">memoir</a> in May 2015 recapitulating much of the standard CIA line.</p> <p>\u201cMorell, he presents himself as this thoughtful guy, who\u2019s really in the weeds and knows things, but he went out and talked about how the report was inaccurate, he wrote a book with inaccuracies. He stated publicly that he had only read 300 pages of the executive summary and told Feinstein he hadn\u2019t read the full report,\u201d Jones said.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was the same problem with the agency, over and over again. Either you are knowingly spreading inaccurate information, which is pretty terrible, or you just don\u2019t want to know, and you take a briefing with inaccurate information and you just repeat it.\u201d</p> <p>CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said that the agency did not coordinate its response with the Formers. The Senate committee \u201cwithdrew its approval to let former officers read the executive summary prior to its release to the public, so some were not able to read or prepare responses to the accusations until [the committee] released its executive summary to the public,\u201d Trapani said. </p> <p>Glenn Carle was a CIA officer from 1985 to 2007. He knew Brennan while at the agency and respects the director\u2019s \u201csubtle and fair mind\u201d. After 9/11, Carle was called upon to interrogate a terrorism suspect <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/07/am-i-a-torturer/\">he now believes is innocent</a>. Although he did not use the brutal techniques called out in the Senate report, the experience deeply affected Carle, who has become a vocal critic of the agency\u2019s post-9/11 torture. </p> <p>While Carle said the CIA often holds a legitimate feeling of besiegement against outside criticism \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re always the ones left holding the bag after we\u2019re asked to mine the harbors or overthrow the government,\u201d he noted \u2013 the fury of the CIA reactions to the Senate troubled him. </p> <p>\u201cI was dismayed by the response, which I thought was in parts intellectually shoddy, simple-minded, unnecessarily defensive, circle-the-wagons reactive and wrong and harmful,\u201d Carle said. </p> <p>He continued: \u201cWe were well outside of the bounds, and it was obvious. And part of the defense the agency used, the Bush administration used, defenders, proponents, Republicans use, is that \u2018You have to understand the context of the times, we were all afraid there was going to be another attack, we had to act.\u2019 That\u2019s all bullshit. No, you cannot do that. Our job is not to react emotionally, and in fear, and reflexively, which is what that is a justification for doing. Our job is to get it right. Our job is to see through that and have the courage to act correctly.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Support Embed\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; &lt;body style=&quot;padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt; @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianEgyptianWeb/GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold.svg#GuardianEgyptianWeb-Semibold&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Text Egyptian Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb/GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianTextEgyptianWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  @font-face { font-family: &quot;Guardian Sans Web&quot;; src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.eot&quot;); src: url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.eot?#iefix&quot;) format(&quot;embedded-opentype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.woff&quot;) format(&quot;woff&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.ttf&quot;) format(&quot;truetype&quot;), url(&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/fonts/guss-webfonts/GuardianSansWeb/GuardianSansWeb-Regular.svg#GuardianSansWeb-Regular&quot;) format(&quot;svg&quot;); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-stretch: normal; }  * { box-sizing: border-box; font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web'; color: #333; }  a { text-decoration: none; }  body { max-width: 420px; }  .contribute__wrapper { background-color: #f5f5f5; }  .contribute__header { background-color: #fb0; padding: 4px; border-top: 2px solid #333; }  .contribute__logo { position: relative; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 24px; display: inline-block; color: #333; z-index: 10; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 700; }  .contribute__body { padding: 4px; }  .contribute__paragraph { font-family: 'Guardian Text Egyptian Web'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 24px; }  .contribute__button { background-color: #fb0; color: #333; position: relative; padding: 8px 40px 8px 12px; border-radius: 24px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 6px; }  .contribute__label { font-family: 'Guardian Sans Web'; }  .contribute__icon { position: absolute; right: 4px; top: 1px; }  &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__header&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 class=&quot;contribute__logo&quot;&gt;Support the Guardian's fearless journalism&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;contribute__body&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;contribute__paragraph&quot;&gt;From mass surveillance to brutal interrogations, the Guardian's investigative reporting holds the powerful to account.

The Senate committee\u2019s Republicans, who had pulled out of the inquiry in September 2009, savaged it as a Democratic witchhunt \u2013 a critical boost for a CIA that wanted to avoid the narrative that it was pitted against the Senate. </p> <p>While in 2009 the committee Republicans had urged the CIA not to grant interviews while a parallel justice department inquiry unfolded, now they attacked their Democratic colleagues for not renewing a request once the DoJ inquiry was concluded in 2012: \u201cThe committee had a window of opportunity to invite these relevant witnesses in for interviews, but apparently decided against that course of action.\u201d</p> <p>Jones said: \u201cThe Republicans were never supportive of interviews. Period. They just played games with this.\u201d</p> <p>As the CIA\u2019s rebuttal strategy began to unfold, Democrat Mark Udall took to the Senate floor. Udall was less constrained than any intelligence committee member. He had lost his re-election campaign and had only weeks remaining in the chamber. Udall had earlier flirted with reading the entire report into the Senate record and daring the administration to prosecute him. Instead, he excoriated the White House for aligning with the \u201cflippant and dismissive\u201d CIA against the Senate.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile the study clearly shows that the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program itself was deeply flawed, the deeper, more endemic problem lies in a CIA, assisted by a White House, that continues to try to cover up the truth,\u201d Udall said on 10 December 2014. He accused the White House of \u201cletting the CIA do whatever it likes, even if its efforts are aimed at actively undermining the president\u2019s stated [torture] policies.\u201d </p> <p>Udall continued: \u201cDirector Brennan and the CIA today are continuing to willfully provide inaccurate information and misrepresent the efficacy of torture. In other words, the CIA is lying. This is not a problem of the past.\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The report was the result of six years of Jones\u2019s work. The seventh year was consumed by two tasks: defending the torture report against its CIA and Republican critics; and attempting to entrench its purpose \u2013 preventing torture \u2013 into law. Success would vary.</p> <p>Jones still wasn\u2019t speaking in public. He was a Senate committee staffer, although he recognized, now that North Carolina Republican Richard Burr was chairman, his position on the committee was untenable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd66c8937f54c93a1d96d1c359d356df37af1649\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd66c8937f54c93a1d96d1c359d356df37af1649/0_0_5080_3053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Burr, right, with Dianne Feinstein and Ron Wyden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In his first month in office, Burr took an extraordinary step. The Senate had delivered copies of the classified report across the executive branch to the various agencies \u2013 the justice department, the Pentagon, and so forth \u2013 with equities in it. Burr, in his first month as chairman, formally requested the copies back. Burr\u2019s home-state newspaper, the Raleigh News &amp; Observer, <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article44569983.html#storylink=cpy\">editorialized</a> that the senator preferred \u201cto hide the misdeeds of the CIA\u2019s secret prisons rather than have others in government review what happened\u201d.</p> <p>The ACLU, which had sued for disclosure of the document, filed an emergency motion to block Burr. In response, the administration pledged to \u201cpreserve the status quo\u201d, meaning that it wouldn\u2019t give the classified report back. If there was an opportunity to learn lessons from careful, private reading of the full report, the agencies did not take it \u2013 <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1507956/ssci-foia-gov-mtd.txt\">they did not even remove the 6,700-page classified report from its packaging</a> \u2013 an issue complicated by freedom of information lawsuits that mired the documents in bureaucratic limbo. The report\u2019s advocates considered that a final gut punch from the administration: \u201cThe point is to learn from it,\u201d Jones noted.</p> <p>Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat and intelligence committee member, has not given up. \u201cI want the full report out, with necessary redactions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Carl Levin, a recently retired Michigan Democratic senator whose chairmanship of the armed services committee made him a non-voting member of the intelligence panel, considered it a legacy issue for Obama.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe president ended the CIA program by executive order in January 2009, as one of his first actions in office. By distributing the classified Senate study throughout the executive branch as appropriate before he leaves office, he\u2019ll be making it less likely that his executive order will be rescinded by a future president,\u201d Levin said. </p> <p>As the public attacks on the report compounded through 2015, Feinstein opted to wage a continuous response. Jones\u2019s new job was to pore over each criticism from the CIA Formers or other prominent surrogates and rebut them in statements Feinstein would send to reporters and place on her website. The task was not much different from how he had spent the previous six years.</p> <p>The first major salvo came in the name of former Indiana Democratic senator Evan Bayh, himself a former intelligence committee member, barely a month after the Senate report was published.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1d2d72433dc21b6af91a134b9d026edb69b2b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1d2d72433dc21b6af91a134b9d026edb69b2b8a/0_45_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evan Bayh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After the inspector general had taken the agency to task for breaching the network firewall, Brennan asked Bayh to convene an \u201caccountability board\u201d to review the episode. As Bayh already served on the CIA\u2019s advisory board, his report, unsurprisingly, exculpated Brennan, walked back the inspector general\u2019s denouncement of the network breach, said the five CIA officials involved in the breach acted reasonably, and criticized the committee. </p> <p>Bayh\u2019s account, issued in January 2015, prominently reiterated that that the CIA and Senate lacked a \u201csigned memorandum of understanding\u201d limiting the agency\u2019s role on the network \u2013 despite the sheaves of agreements in May and June 2009 between Panetta and Feinstein explicitly laying that out \u2013 and noted that the login screen on RDINet referenced the prospect of monitoring and warned of a lack of privacy expectation. Still, even Bayh found the CIA had \u201cimproper access\u201d to the Senate files.</p> <p>Jones, who said \u2013 improbably \u2013 that he doesn\u2019t remember seeing the warning message at login, expressed exasperation with Bayh\u2019s defense. \u201cWe went back and forth, months and months, up to the principals level, where Feinstein\u2019s sitting across the table from Panetta \u2026 and they\u2019re demanding these things happen, and we\u2019re exchanging letters and we\u2019re saying: \u2018OK, we\u2019ve reached agreement.\u2019 It would just be absolutely ridiculous to think that after all those months of negotiations saying the CIA wouldn\u2019t have access to our computers that we would go in there and every time we log on we\u2019d just erase the decision that was made between the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the chair and the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee.\u201d</p> <p>Unusually, Bayh\u2019s panel was mostly anonymous. It had five members. The only other named member was Bob Bauer, the former White House counsel who had vouchsafed for the CIA no longer removing torture documents after it was caught taking 900 of them from the Senate in 2010. The other three, CIA officials, were never revealed, not even to the Senate. It is unknown if they played any role in the torture program; the CIA did not answer that question when the Guardian asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe information released with regard to this matter was extraordinary. Nonetheless, some information was appropriately redacted or withheld,\u201d said the CIA\u2019s Trapani, citing a <a href=\"http://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/CIA49.pdf\">legal provision</a> that affords the CIA leverage to withhold its officials\u2019 identity.</p> <p>Bayh has won the Democratic nomination for Senate in Indiana and is currently running to reclaim his old seat. He did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>\u201cRegarding the CIA\u2019s search of Senate computer files and their going into the emails of Senate staff, I don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said former Senate intelligence committee chairman Jay Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cYou either have oversight and separation of powers with the checks and balances that come with that, or you don\u2019t. It\u2019s amazing that, once again, no one at the CIA was held accountable.\u201d </p> <p>Feinstein told the Guardian that she is not currently inclined to \u201crehash every interaction\u201d in the years-long fight over her report. Instead, she pointed to the CIA\u2019s response as an inadvertent testimony to its rigor. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the report has been relentlessly attacked by the CIA and former agency officials, no factual errors have been found,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cContinued efforts to obfuscate the report\u2019s findings and justify a very dark chapter in our nation\u2019s history do not change the facts, which stand without correction. By contrast, the CIA itself has acknowledged numerous factual errors, not only in its representations about the program but in its 2013 response to the report.\u201d <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/527pj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2702368\"            data-video-name=\"Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1e96be4b07ac3d446a54f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\">Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As consuming as the rear-guard defense of the torture report was, Feinstein, no longer in possession of a gavel, pivoted to legislating the lesson that motivated it. In June 2015, by a wide bipartisan margin of 78 to 21, Feinstein and John McCain successfully passed an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill prohibiting the CIA from engaging in interrogations more brutal than an army field manual authorized. Obama signed the bill, giving the force of law to his 2009 executive order ending torture.</p> <p>\u201cImplementing all of the reforms needed to address the problems the report exposed is most important to me,\u201d Feinstein told the Guardian, \u201cand I am continually looking at ways to do that.\u201d</p> <p>In December 2015, Jones left the Senate. Feinstein read a tribute to Jones into the record. He joined a <a href=\"http://www.daschlegroup.com/\">Washington consulting firm led by Tom Daschle</a>, Reid\u2019s predecessor as Senate Democratic leader, and started a firm, the <a href=\"http://thepqg.com/\">Penn Quarter Group</a>, to advise businesses and nonprofits on research and investigations.</p> <p>\u201cIt was obvious I needed to leave the committee,\u201d Jones said. While he said senators encouraged him to push back against torture in public, \u201cI needed a break. It\u2019s hard to describe how much of my life\u2026\u201d Jones trailed off.</p> <p>\u201cI was gone from the world for a number of years. It\u2019s a bit of an adjustment to being a normal person.\u201d</p> <p>Rockefeller, the former senator and intelligence committee chairman who hired Jones in late 2006, said: \u201cWe were lucky to have him leading our investigations. He and others devoted so much of their lives to making sure this Senate study got done \u2013 and was done right.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cDan and his team worked under considerable pressure for more than seven years to complete the full 6,700-page classified report on the CIA program,\u201d added Levin.</p> <p>\u201cHe and his colleagues always comported themselves in a professional manner, were diligent, and maintained the highest of ethical standards throughout this ordeal, despite all of the challenges they faced.\u201d</p> <p>Jones has regrets about the way the declassified report turned out. Most prominently, Jones wishes he had gotten declassified the nearly 100-page table of contents for the full 6,700-page torture report, so readers could understand from the headings and subheadings just what the full contours of the torture was: \u201cIt has an incident on a particular day of someone\u2019s detention, and there might be 10 pages on it. Or there might be 50 pages on it. It just shows the level of detail and how these 500 pages is just scratching the surface.\u201d<br></p> <p>Still, Jones considers the inquiry a success, one he attributes to the senators who took real political risks to back him and his team against the CIA. </p> <p>\u201cFor those who worry that Congress is only dysfunctional, this is exhibit A to the contrary,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThis was a serious and high-stakes battle between two branches of government. And the legislative branch, in my view, ultimately won. I think our founding fathers would be very proud of Senator Feinstein and the others who worked to get this investigation completed and released.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was gone from the world for a number of years.

Trump has pledged to bring back waterboarding \u201cand a hell of a lot worse\u201d.</p> <p>The anti-torture law Feinstein and McCain passed is one impediment to CIA torture. But before 9/11, US laws were unequivocally against torture as well, and the adoption of torture arose due to political will driving creative lawyering. Brennan in April this year said he would refuse an order to bring back waterboarding, and in July said he would have to be fired rather than implement it. But he indicated that his departure would not necessarily be an impediment to a return to torture.</p> <p>\u201cIf a president were to order the agency to carry out waterboarding or something else, it\u2019ll be up to the director of CIA and others within CIA to decide whether or not that, that direction and order is something that they can carry out in good conscience,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/events/cias-strategy-in-the-face-of-emerging-challenges/\">told</a> the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>The CIA\u2019s clash with the Senate committee has faded. So has Brennan\u2019s summer 2014 contrition, delivered to Feinstein, about spying on Jones and the committee staff. Brennan\u2019s ire at the torture report has not. </p> <p>On 9 February 2016, Brennan had a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4579908/sen-ron-wyden-questions-cia-director-brennan\">heated exchange</a> with Wyden, who asked about the network search during an unrelated committee hearing. Brennan defended the agency\u2019s actions and again implied that Jones had himself hacked the CIA: \u201cSeparation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, Senator, goes both ways.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUEidBI-zjs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oUEidBI-zjs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>February 2016: CIA director John Brennan refuses to admit CIA unauthorized search of Senate files was improper</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Speaking on 19 July to a friendly audience, the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, Brennan <a href=\"http://www.insaonline.org/i/z/docs/2016_BrennanDinner_Transcript.aspx\">went further</a>: \u201cWhen I look at the Senate\u2019s report on the detention interrogation program, it makes my blood boil, because although there\u2019s a lot of things in there that were accurate, it really just focused on the shortcomings of the agency during that period in time.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cIf it was done in a more objective, nonpartisan and fair fashion, it would have put those shortcomings in better context. I fervently believe there was no agency more responsible for preventing a recurrence of 9/11 than the CIA. Unfortunately, that report I think misrepresented the totality of the worth of that program.\u201d </p> <p>Brennan has told colleagues that he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-03/obama-s-cia-director-wants-to-stick-around-for-clinton\">wishes to remain CIA director</a> under Hillary Clinton. In August, Morell published a New York Times op-ed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/opinion/campaign-stops/i-ran-the-cia-now-im-endorsing-hillary-clinton.html\">excoriating Trump and endorsing Clinton</a>, which intelligence observers understood as an audition to run Langley. For Jones, their apparent eagerness to lead the CIA is a reminder of a lack of accountability for torture and what he calls a \u201cfailed coverup\u201d by CIA officials, aided by both the Bush and Obama administrations.<br></p> <p>\u201cBoth Morell and Brennan are unfit to be CIA directors based off their response to the report, the way they responded to the Senate, how they view oversight. Under Brennan and Morell, the CIA is defending rectal rehydration as a \u2018well-acknowledged medical technique\u2019 \u2013 nothing to see here,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wyden, speaking to the Guardian, said: \u201cI\u2019m exceptionally troubled by Director Brennan\u2019s extraordinary efforts to resist vigorous congressional oversight. I certainly do not have confidence in the director.\u201d</p> <p>Obama has retained Brennan without a word of public criticism. He has kept his job despite the clash with his Senate overseers, just as CIA officials involved in the torture program and its misrepresentation to Congress, the Bush and Obama administrations, and the public still work at Langley.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who played a significant role in this program, who are in the report, continue to play significant roles in sensitive programs at the agency,\u201d said Jones.</p> <p>Carle, the former CIA officer and torture critic, disagrees that the agency needed to fire officials involved in torture to hold them accountable. </p> <p>\u201cI do know a number of officers whose careers were certainly impacted, if not derailed, as the result of all this stuff,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Speaking of Brennan\u2019s reaction to the Senate report, Carle continued: \u201cI know John. This was his least impressive moment. I and colleagues have been somewhat mystified that such an intelligent, subtle and open-minded man, on this point, reacted like Jose Rodriguez,\u201d the retired CIA official and torture advocate whose destruction of videotaped interrogations began the Senate inquiry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People who played a significant role in this program \u2026 continue to play significant roles in sensitive programs</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Udall, who had called for Brennan\u2019s job in 2014, told the Guardian that he was \u201cnot aware that there has been accountability for what Director Brennan calls CIA\u2019s \u2018bad mistakes\u2019.\u201d But, he said, the CIA as a whole ought not to bear the blame for torture. </p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ascribe the bad behavior of some to all the employees of the CIA or of the intelligence community,\u201d Udall said. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA writ large wasn\u2019t responsible for developing, implementing and misrepresenting the truth about the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program. In fact, a small number of CIA officers were largely responsible. It is unfortunate that the refusal of the CIA\u2019s leadership to pursue accountability and tell the truth continues to tar the agency as a whole.\u201d </p> <p>Obama is more instinctively skeptical of the intelligence agencies than his potential successors, but the president who banned torture helped CIA officials implicated in torture endure at the agency. Obama\u2019s deep relationship with Brennan and his early commitment not to \u201clook backward\u201d had profound consequences that will outlast his presidency.</p> <p>\u201cThey avoided all the necessary reforms that have to happen at the CIA,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a huge lost opportunity. Here\u2019s an administration that came in and did all the right things within a few days, shutting down the program. But they didn\u2019t want the independent commission. They said the Senate intelligence committee was the right place to do this. And to me, we were just never given a fair airing. No one from the White House would be briefed by us. They were briefed by the CIA.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1550e86d1449a7b1c7ebaddee978e8f40989fc26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1550e86d1449a7b1c7ebaddee978e8f40989fc26/0_74_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Bush: 'The United States does not torture'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delivering a speech on the \u2018war on terror\u2019 on 6 September 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MCT via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Udall agreed: \u201cIt is incumbent on the next administration to acknowledge these mistakes and institute the necessary reforms to restore the CIA\u2019s reputation for integrity and analytical rigor.\u201d</p> <p>Carle is a rare former CIA official willing to praise the Senate torture report. \u201cIt captures exactly \u2013 exactly \u2013 the culture, reality, conversations, pressures, silences, actions, doubts, arguments that I lived.

That said, I think we did lasting harm to ourselves as an institution and as a country.\u201d</p> <p>The Senate investigation Feinstein led and Jones conducted into CIA torture is believed to be the largest in the legislative body\u2019s 227-year history. In May 2016, the CIA inspector general\u2019s office destroyed its only copy of the classified torture report. The agency, Yahoo <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/senate-report-on-cia-torture-1429636113023030.html\">reported</a>, claims the destruction was accidental and that a copy of the report is held elsewhere at Langley.

What happens if everyone opts to pay \u00a35?

  "<p>Mixed martial arts, with its complex blend of skills, is an incredibly difficult discipline to master. If anyone should feel buoyed by that, it\u2019s CM Punk the former WWE wrestler who made the walk to the Octagon for the first time on Saturday night in Cleveland, against Mickey Gall. It takes time to get ready for MMA, and it\u2019s unfair to expect more of Punk, whose real name is the rather less exotic Phil Brooks, as he fought for the first time as a pro or amateur.</p> <p> The match, one of the undercards during\u2019s Saturday\u2019s UFC 203, was the latest episode in a long history tying pro wrestling and mixed martial arts. Known as shooters, these type of pro wrestlers can legitimately fight. Japan\u2019s Kazushi Sakuraba, who beat the great UFC champion Royce Gracie in 2000, was perhaps the most successful modern version.</p> <p> It wasn\u2019t clear coming in if Brooks would be in the mold of wrestlers who knew how to shoot, or wrestlers who didn\u2019t. He said he was aware of the history he was stepping into but didn\u2019t want to say how he thought he stacked up in the tradition of wrestling tough guys like Karl Gotch and Billy Robinson.</p> <p> But Brooks, 37, was confident. Unfortunately, the big dreams he spoke of during a two-year odyssey from wrestling to MMA were broken when Gall, a 24-year-old welterweight prospect with a strong grappling game and a beaming smile, beat him in the opening round.</p> <p>On the advice of his trainer, Milwaukee\u2019s Duke Roufus, the former WWE champion charged out of his corner, throwing a wild right that gave Gall, now unbeaten in his first three fights, the opening for an easy double-leg takedown. In a matter of moments, he had capitalized on Brooks\u2019s inexperience by smoothly securing back-control. By the time Gall had finished with him, Brooks was cut over his right eye, lumped up around his face and his right ear was swollen. The worst part of the experience wasn\u2019t that Brooks didn\u2019t win. It was that he never looked competitive. </p> <p>However, if he was disappointed after the defeat, Brooks didn\u2019t show it. \u201cIn life you go big or you go home,\u201d he said. \u201cI just like to take challenges. This was a hell of a mountain to try to climb. I didn\u2019t get to the top tonight. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going give up or stop. Obviously Mickey\u2019s a hell of a fighter. I will be back believe it or not. This is the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Second best night in my life other than marrying my wife. I know there\u2019s a lot of doubters. Life\u2019s about falling down and getting back up.</p> <p> Gall made the most of the moment, asserting that he planned on making a mark in the UFC. \u201cI\u2019m no gimmick,\u201d Gall said before calling out another UFC prospect, Sage Northcutt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96e17c86ec9ec3d0d2737afa99150a01885d0e21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96e17c86ec9ec3d0d2737afa99150a01885d0e21/0_0_3501_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alistair Overeem, left, connects with Stipe Miocic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair Overeem, left, connects with Stipe Miocic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dermer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Brooks\u2019s UFC debut has attracted a lot of attention, it was not the night\u2019s main event. The home crowd in Cleveland was out to support one of its own, Stipe Miocic, who stepped into a rabid Quicken Loans Arena laying claim to the title of baddest man on the planet. There\u2019s no question that the UFC heavyweight champion needs to be looked at this way, and the adoration from Miocic\u2019s hometown, buoyed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/20/cleveland-cavaliers-win-nba-title-golden-state-warriors-game-7-nba-finals\">the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 NBA title in June</a>, reflected that.</p> <p>He gave Cleveland a rollercoaster ride of a title defense against Dutchman Alistair Overeem, Miocic\u2019s first since winning the belt in a very different setting against Fabricio Werdum in May. Back then, a first round knockout in front of 45,000 Brazilians put Miocic in the position to make his first defense at home.</p> <p>On Saturday, the imposing fighters, each standing 6ft 4in and weighing close to 250lbs, touched gloves in the center of the Octagon. They were pleasant right before they weren\u2019t. The whole thing drove Cleveland wild.</p> <p> After stalking Overeem for the first minute, teasing the crowd with the moment they showed up for, it looked like Miocic wouldn\u2019t come through on home soil, when a sneaky left straight from Overeem put him on the canvas. \u201cHe put me on my ass, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Miocic said after the fight. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hurt but he put me on my ass.\u201d</p> <p> Miocic (16-2) kept his wits and immediately needed to defend a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillotine_choke\">guillotine choke</a>, which he did. Overeem claimed afterwards that he thought Miocic had tapped out to escape the choke. Replays showed otherwise. Still, it was hard to believe the champion survived. But there he was, a paramedic services worker from a suburb 20 miles east of Cleveland, taking Overeem\u2019s best and giving it back way worse.</p> <p>The home fans had helped bring in a gate of $2.6m and as the fight progressed it became clear it had been worth every penny. Recovered from his shaky start, and making the most of his athleticism and movement, Miocic piled on the punches, before a scramble brought the back-and-forth action to the floor. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(grappling)\">In the guard</a>, Miocic went to work peppering Overeem about his head. Ground-and-pound was invented by another UFC heavyweight champion from Ohio, Mark Coleman, and Miocic made the most of his example as \u201cThe Hammer\u201d watched from cage-side.</p> <p> After getting back to his feet, Miocic scored repeatedly until the first of four straight right hands crushed his challenger. It only took one to render Overeem unconscious, but referee Marc Goddard didn\u2019t jump in until another three had landed. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cA veteran who fought the best in the world. But I said .... I want to be keep [the title] here for a long time.\u201d</p> <p> The co-headlining fight featured an odd series of events as Fabricio Werdum asserted his claim to a rematch with Miocic, walking through a fairly easy decision over Travis Browne, a late replacement for Ben Rothwell. Referee Gary Copeland incorrectly paused the action in round one when a Werdum punch injured Browne\u2019s hand.</p> <p> Werdum was aggressive after being put down by Miocic in the spring. He started the fight with a jumping side kick and mixed up his attacks enough to stifle Browne, who heard it from his coach Edmond Taverdyan, who has also worked with Ronda Rousey. Taverdyan lost his voice yelling for Browne to attack, imploring him between rounds to give everything he had. Browne didn\u2019t muster much in response until the final 90 seconds, though by then it was far too late.</p> <p> As the scores were read Werdum and Taverdyan mixed it up, the former heavyweight champion going so far as to kick at the much smaller Armenian. The sides were separated, and Werdum had a chance to watch the main event. He picked Miocic to retain the title, hoping for a chance at redemption. He saw Miocic produce the kind of performance he and his hometown can be proud of. One they won\u2019t soon forget. \u201cThe last four months have been crazy in my life,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cI was training very, very hard for this fight.\u201d</p>",

Not unless there\u2019s something going on that\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>Please allow me to disabuse you of that notion, sir. Plenty of people \u201ccough like that\u201d, myself included. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 19.1 million adults over 18 were diagnosed with seasonal allergic rhinitis \u2013 also known as \u201chay fever\u201d \u2013 in 2014, along 6.1 million children. </p> <p>I\u2019ve got big sinuses. It\u2019s part of what makes my singing voice able to cut through layers of drums and guitars \u2013 a network of large, resonant holes in my skull. My late mother sang opera and had a glorious lyric soprano voice that could fill a whole theater and shake the chandeliers. </p> <p>Twice a year, for two to four weeks in the spring and fall, those holes in my head fill up with gunk and it makes my face and forehead feel like a huge, throbbing, aching, seriously clogged bottle of rubber cement. </p> <p>If I don\u2019t get enough sleep, drink quarts of water, eat right and keep my stress levels down, that respiratory distress will move straight down into my chest and I will develop a booming, persistent cough.</p> <p>For some reason, the fall of 2009 was particularly nasty. I\u2019d quit smoking the year before and thought that would make my seasonal battles with pollen and mold less miserable, but that first year, it seemed to have the opposite effect.</p> <p>That was when I was a late-night classical music DJ. My show went out live to the whole state of Georgia four nights per week. I remember it was Thursday, 10 September, because I was queuing up John Adams\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jCdOjOaJsU\">solemn, exquisite symphonic remembrance of the 9/11 victims, On the Transmigration of Souls</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOur next selection,\u201d I began, \u201cis John Ad\u2013\u201d and I was seized with a violent coughing fit. Most radio consoles have what\u2019s known as a \u201ccough button\u201d for just such an emergency. It mutes your microphone until the cough or sneeze or period of hoarseness passes. </p> <p>But this coughing fit didn\u2019t pass \u2013 it just kept going on and on. I killed my mic and started the music because I wasn\u2019t sure what else to do. I was mortally embarrassed and for an awful moment felt sure I was disgracing the memory of all those people who were killed in the terror attacks of September 11 2001.</p> <p>The control room phone rang. I gulped down two swallows of tepid coffee and answered, still weak-voiced and froggy.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay in there?\u201d It was my boss calling from home. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I sputtered. \u201cJust fighting for breath.\u201d</p> <p>He asked if I needed someone to come take over. I said no, I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s already passing. I hung up the phone and it immediately rang again.

  "<p>I\u2019m going to Shake Shack, specifically the one in the new Westfield World Trade Center mall, desperate to sample a burger designed by and bearing the name of Today Show presenter Al Roker. I\u2019m told that this burger has been smothered with pulled pork, which intrigues me greatly, but on my way there my attention is diverted by a peculiar sight: a store ominously titled the Freedom Wine Cellar. </p> <p>We were told many things in the days after 9/11 \u2013 that they hated us for our freedom, that the evildoers would be brought to justice, and most importantly, that we needed to go shopping. The highest form of patriotism was buying a boat, or a few hundred dollars worth of clothes we didn\u2019t need. Our protectors \u2013 George W Bush, Rudolph Giuliani \u2013 were the equivalent of Ivana Trump imploring the women of the film the First Wives Club <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUXsERduwyo\">to not get mad, but to \u201cget everything\u201d</a>.</p> <p>And now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/congress-911-rememberance-ceremony-capitol\">15 years on</a>, \u201ceverything\u201d can be bought on the very parcel of ground where America\u2019s greatest modern collective trauma unfolded. The Westfield World Trade Center, which opened last month, offers us a most baroque form of retail therapy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/september-11-mattress-ad-backlash\">'Tasteless' mattress ad is latest 9/11-themed promotion to spark backlash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A Time magazine article from 2013 cited a study (paid for by the online shopping portal Ebates.com) which claims that <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2013/04/16/is-retail-therapy-for-real-5-ways-shopping-is-actually-good-for-you/\">52%</a> of Americans engage in retail therapy \u2013 the act of purchasing goods to ease feelings of sadness. The World Trade Center site has been finely calibrated to offer that experience, and so much more. </p> <p>There\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/photos-of-people-taking-selfies-at-the-911-memorial-717\">chilling memorial fountains</a> where the towers once stood that have launched a thousand cheerful selfies. There\u2019s even a gift shop where one can purchase a piece of 9/11 memorabilia. The clerks there might be the saddest employees I have ever witnessed \u2013 forced to relive the infamous date over and over again through videos of first responders and city officials discussing the attacks playing on a loop on giant monitors.</p> <p>I bought a coffee mug. It was the least I could do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5db589c3788aabf121e2781dfaaf7871f5fde572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5db589c3788aabf121e2781dfaaf7871f5fde572/0_354_5322_3193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands of visitors pack the World Trade Center transportation hub for the grand opening of the retail spaces.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands of visitors pack the World Trade Center transportation hub for the grand opening of the retail spaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naturally, I\u2019m feeling a bit down as I traverse this latest piece of the multibillion-dollar WTC redevelopment project \u2013 which is why I\u2019m so dead-set on waiting in the interminable line for the Al Roker burger. You see, I don\u2019t shop to improve my mood. I eat. And sometimes, I drink. </p> <p>Fortunately, the Westfield has both of those options, as the Wine Cellar makes clear. A portion of all proceeds must go to supporting the worthy cause of freedom, I say to no one in particular, otherwise why the incongruous name? Is there anything in this world that inspires freedom less than an addictive substance like alcohol? I suppose Freedom Discount Cigarettes would qualify. It\u2019s closed when I arrive, a nondescript exterior that reveals a wine barrel-shaped interior if you\u2019re lucky enough to get there during business hours. Freedom isn\u2019t free, and it\u2019s also not available on the weekend.</p> <p>The first thing you\u2019ll want to do inside the new Westfield mall adjacent to the World Trade Center memorial site is not to shop. In fact, shopping might be the last thing on your mind. The Westfield is part shopping center, part transportation hub. Fulton Center, nearby, is a more traditional complex with multiple subway station entry points and home to my new favorite patriotic liquor store. The only signifier telling visitors that they are dangerously close to the site of a mass murder is the armed guards. They chit-chat, grab a few moments of respite and direct hapless visitors around the labyrinthine building (it takes a moment to realize that the line for Shake Shack starts a floor below the actual Shake Shack).</p> <p>But the real draw is a heavenly monstrosity called the Oculus. When viewing it in the right light, one could be forgiven for thinking an angel had crashed to Earth and landed facedown on the concrete. Promotional material on the Westfield website says that the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava\u2019s design for the Oculus was \u201cinspired by the image of a dove being released from a child\u2019s hand\u201d. In reality, it resembles an exposed ribcage from the outside and a refurbished set from Logan\u2019s Run or Conquest of the Planet of the Apes on the inside. It\u2019s so white, futuristic and ethereal that you might find yourself thinking you had died and St Peter was waiting to ring you up at Banana Republic.</p> <p>Going deeper into the Oculus, you arrive at a cluster of stores. I walked through once during a regular workday and once on a Saturday afternoon and in both instances, stores were lightly trafficked. Where was the Pinkberry, I asked myself? Wetzel\u2019s Pretzels? At least there was an Apple Store so that I might charge my hungry iPhone, sapped of its strength by my unnatural compulsion to take pictures every 15 minutes or so. The busiest area is the observation deck, high above the main shopping floor, which affords the intrepid tourist an ideal backdrop for photos, videos, snapchats, vines, and the like. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2407956e2ae97d60492841100552e5e73f5be131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2407956e2ae97d60492841100552e5e73f5be131/0_92_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An exterior view of the Oculus during the Westfield World Trade Center Grand Opening.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An exterior view of the Oculus during the Westfield World Trade Center Grand Opening.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Befitting an expensive, high-concept mall that could be mistaken for the Judeo-Christian interpretation of the afterlife, the stores inside the Oculus are mostly high-end and unapproachable \u2013 there\u2019s a John Varvatos, a Kate Spade, and a store called Reiss that sells blazers that cost more than my television \u2013 and I avoid them as I wander. When I think of the benefits of retail therapy, I imagine an H&amp;M or a Zara \u2013 shops that sell disposable clothes at low prices. You can peruse the floor for an hour, then leave with a bag full of junk that will fall apart or go out of fashion in a year, for around $100. Retail therapy, one would think, is not pressing your wet pleb nose against the window of a Mont Blanc until an underpaid clerk swats you away with a rolled up copy of the New York Post. It\u2019s impulsive and transitory happiness, a brief whiff of the infinite possibilities of a new trenchcoat. <br></p> <p>I remember I need a birthday gift for my father-in-law, so I slink into the Art of Shaving, a store dedicated to, you guessed it, the sacred act of removing hair from one\u2019s face. I\u2019m one of three patrons, then quickly one of one. The sales associate, Richard \u2013 young, tall, black, and impeccably dressed \u2013 is eager to please. \u201cDo you shave much?\u201d he asks me. I have a beard, but I remark that I\u2019m considering ditching it. My face has been overtaken by gray hairs and a quick shave strikes me as a more efficient means of dealing with this problem than the indignity of purchasing and applying Just for Men. \u201cNo, you look fine,\u201d he responds when I mention the grays, buttering me up for an easy sale. He directs me toward a shelf of beard tonics and conditioners that no one actually needs, but offer the illusion that you\u2019re getting your life in order and grooming yourself like a real man would. This is retail therapy at its finest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/barack-obama-911-anniversary-america\">Barack Obama marks 9/11 anniversary: 'America will never give in to fear'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I point to a travel-sized case of assorted potions. \u201cOh, that\u2019s great, because they\u2019re TSA-approved bottles,\u201d he offers, unsolicited.

It must be weird working here.\u201d Part of me thinks he\u2019s about to reach for a taser to subdue me. I realize not everyone in the Westfield is preoccupied with thoughts of the terror attacks that the Oculus is meant to memorialize. In fact, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m the only one in the building that owns a copy of the 9/11 Commission Report.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think about it,\u201d Richard says. \u201cIt feels like just a regular mall. Then again, I wasn\u2019t here when it happened.\u201d I nod gently. \u201cI think I\u2019ll take the beard conditioner.\u201d </p> <p>Like Richard, I wasn\u2019t in New York on 9/11. I was safely in Merced, California \u2013 an old air force town that is most famous for its proximity to Yosemite national park and for being the birthplace of the actress Janet Leigh. Still, the memories of that day consume me \u2013 not even a hamburger or a sack of graphic tees can distract from my memories of how it felt to watch the towers fall. </p> <p>The Westfield website tells us that Calatrava and Daniel Libeskind, the head planner for the WTC site, designed the Oculus so that every year on 9/11 at 10.28am Eastern time, a beam of light will penetrate the opening in the roof of the building, dividing the structure in half. After it\u2019s over, shoppers will be able to go back to doing what Americans do best \u2013 moving on. </p> <p>Sadly, the Al Roker burger is no longer available to cheer you up.</p>",

The Nicaraguan, 29, won the World Boxing Council 115-pound belt in a unanimous decision and remains undefeated (46-0).</p> <p>With his fourth world title belt, Gonz\u00e1lez succeeded his mentor and countryman, Alexis Arguello, who won three world titles. \u201cChocolatito\u201d, who quit school after the fifth grade and worked as a door-to-door salesman in between sessions in the gym, was once trained by Arguello, a legendary fighter and divisive political figure in his homeland. \u201cHe was a father figure to me,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez. \u201cI will never be better than Arguello. He is the teacher. I am his son. He will always be No1.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/kell-brook-gennady-golovkin-world-middleweight-title\">Kell Brook left frustrated by premature end to Gennady Golovkin battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In what will be hailed as a fight of the year candidate, the action was constant for 36 furious minutes. In the early rounds, Gonz\u00e1lez pressured Cuadras with a relentless attack full of multiple combinations to the head and body. Cuadras couldn\u2019t counter punch because he was back-peddling furiously. When he did step forward to try and control the ring, he was able to land some power punches, but the Nicaraguan was too fast with his hands and feet. Gonz\u00e1lez continuously beat him to the punch. \u201cHe is very strong, but my combinations were the difference tonight,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez. </p> <p>As the fight went into the middle rounds, Cuadras altered his tactics and started moving laterally. Gonz\u00e1lez struggled with the change of strategy for a round or two as Cuadras repeatedly landed his left hook to the side of his opponent\u2019s temple. Gonz\u00e1lez was able to weather the punishment. He had trained with Gennady Golovkin at a high-altitude training camp to give himself a \u201cthird lung\u201d and his fitness showed. Cuadras \u2013 who sparred 200 rounds, more than he had ever done for a fight \u2013 was equal to the task, too. Both men never stopped punching as the fight went into the championship rounds. According to CompuBox, they threw 1,872 punches (Gonz\u00e1lez landed 322, Cuadras landed 257.) At the end of the 12th both men raised their hands in victory, but it was obvious which fighter had really won. </p> <p>The scorecards were presented to the ring MC. Cuadras\u2019 once omnipresent smile gave way to battered resignation. Dozens of people in the crowd waved Nicaraguan flags and chanted \u201cNicaragua!\u201d The scorecards (117-111; 116-112; 115-113) were in favor of Gonz\u00e1lez who had endured one of his toughest tests as he outdid his idol, Arguello, who died in 2009. Arguello attempted but was never able to win a fourth weight division, twice losing by stoppage to Aaron Pryor in the early 1980s. Cuadras, upset, escaped the ring and rushed to his dressing room.</p> <p>In the fight\u2019s build-up, the undefeated Mexican (35-1-1) played a wise-cracking antagonist, drinking \u201cChocolatito\u201d milk at a news conference and asking people in the gym: \u201cWhy does everyone ask me why I\u2019m so happy? Do you want me to be mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what he has to do to pump himself up, it\u2019s no problem for me,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, never breaking a smile.</p> <p>That these two fighters have received so much attention is unusual. Fight fans typically don\u2019t view fighters under 130 pounds as main attractions. The 5ft 3in Gonz\u00e1lez has fought several times as a co-headliner with middleweight Golovkin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/kell-brook-title-bid-ended-gennady-golovkin\">who defeated Kell Brook six hours earlier in London</a>. But it was a testament to Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s growing popularity, and sublime skills, that his size didn\u2019t matter. There were nearly 7,000 people in attendance at the storied Forum, and HBO rightly featured the fight as a main event. </p> <p>HBO, the most prominent premium network in boxing, has seriously curtailed its investment in the sport this year, disappointing boxing fans and sending shock waves through the economics of the sport. It\u2019s been a down year in boxing as promoters feud and demonstrate matchmaking cowardice, avoiding super fights, such the unrequited Canelo \u00c1lvarez versus Golovkin matchup. Even Manny Pacquiao, who has always tried to face the fiercest challengers, has chosen to fight unheralded Jessie Vargas, a fight that will be produced on pay-per-view by Top Rank, Pacquiao\u2019s promoter. HBO didn\u2019t want to broadcast it. Television networks are reacting to promoter\u2019s ineptitude and infighting by avoiding the sport. </p> <p>But on Saturday, fans worldwide were able to see how dramatic boxing can be, as one Roman Gonz\u00e1lez of the tough streets of Managua became super flyweight champion of the world.</p>",

I was covered in it \u2013 I looked like a ghost.\u201d</p> <p>Zejnuni developed a violent, chronic cough and was recently found to have breast cancer. This weekend, speaking to the Guardian, she gave her first interview. Her lawyer, Troy Rosasco, said Zejnuni only found out last month she could apply for compensation. Rosasco believes thousands of other people are sick or dying as a result of exposure around Ground Zero, away from the public eye.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a general consensus that people down there got huge exposure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut many don\u2019t even know why they are sick.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, researchers at Stony Brook University <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/health/9-11-first-responders-show-memory-problems-researchers-find-1.12234104\">announced</a> that cognitive impairment, a leading risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, was being detected among first responders who went to Ground Zero on and around 9/11.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s scary news,\u201d said Rosasco. \u201cI have probably gotten 50 calls in the last two days from people who are really frightened about that.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, after years of political <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/hillary-clinton-9-11-attacks-response\">battle</a>, Congress <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/nyregion/23health.html?_r=0\">passed</a> the $4bn Zadroga Act \u2013 named for a police captain who worked on rescue efforts at Ground Zero and died in 2006 after developing breathing problems \u2013 to cover the health costs of those poisoned by the debris and fumes of 9/11. Late last year, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/16/congress-spending-bill-budget-zadroga-911-health-and-compensation-act\">agreed</a> to extend the act\u2019s provisions for 75 years. There is a separate, official Victim Compensation Fund.</p> <p>In 2011, the federal World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) was established. It has 75,000 registered members, 87% of whom worked on rescue, recovery and clean-up. The rest are New York residents or workers. A total of 1,140 registered members have died since the program was created in 2011, WTCHP spokeswoman Christy Spring said.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the way the legislation was written,\u201d she said, \u201cthere is an understanding that there is a link between the exposure and the illnesses people are suffering from.\u201d</p> <p>Causes of death are not recorded by the WTCHP. There is no central record for how many people died between 2001 and 2011 from illnesses linked to 9/11 fumes and debris, Spring said, nor any way of knowing exactly how many other people have died without any record of their illnesses having been caused by exposure near Ground Zero.</p> <p>Melius said: \u201cWe know a significant number of people died before the WTCHP was set up; it\u2019s likely to be in the hundreds. There are also probably hundreds of people outside the program who are sick and may have died.\u201d</p> <p>The WTCHP has certified 37,000 people as suffering from serious respiratory or digestive illnesses, cancer, or a combination. Most of those registered are from New York City and 82% are male.</p> <p>Spring said: \u201cThere are health conditions covered in the program that will take years to develop and we don\u2019t think the cancers we are seeing now is the end of it. It\u2019s such an unprecedented disaster. It\u2019s mind-boggling to think not just about the day but about the ripple effect on people\u2019s health.\u201d</p> <p>The Manhattan borough president, Gale Brewer, told the Guardian she had \u201cheard very high numbers\u201d of people were at risk of dying from exposure to World Trade Center-related toxins.</p> <p>\u201cMany more than 3,000 or 4,000,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. I believe it will eclipse the number who died on 9/11 itself, because so many people were on the pile, or came to help, and so many people worked in the area.

Once political parties believe they are above the law it ends with all opposition silenced, whether it is my grandparents in Dachau, or the left in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey rounded up and held uncharged in prison.</p> <p>\u201cThe courts decided that the rules as they stand allowed it. This decision advantaged Corbyn and his <em>Sturmabteilung</em> (stormtroopers), but on Friday afternoon the appeal court handed down a big decision for British democracy.</p> <p>\u201cIt disallowed the attempt by arriviste followers of Corbyn to flood the Labour electoral college. This caused the mask of reasonableness of the Corbynista leadership to slip even further.</p> <p>\u201cSuddenly the most holy of holies, the NEC, was labelled a shoddy organisation capable of using a \u2018grubby little device\u2019. Cross this lot and you are straight into the firing line.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World This Weekend, Foster said the methodology of the political hard left in Britain was following a well-worn path. \u201cIt\u2019s an imitation of all 20th- and 21st-century extreme political parties, where they attempt to infiltrate bona fide parties by taking over an acceptable ideology and then forming a party within a party, such as Momentum,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cHere I reference the methodology of the national socialists, but could have easily referred to Mao and the red guard or Saddam Hussein and the revolutionary guard.\u201d He added that the stormtroopers were disbanded in 1934 and had nothing directly to do with the Nazi genocide that followed.</p> <p>He has stressed that he did not use the word \u201cNazi\u201d in his Mail on Sunday article, but it was included in the headline by staff. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4871b9d16cb8c1854ff7739d72400ffeea7ed8ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4871b9d16cb8c1854ff7739d72400ffeea7ed8ee/0_181_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn speaks to supporters in Barnsley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn speaks to supporters in Barnsley on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Turner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labour confirmed that Foster was suspended on 7 September because he was alleged to have breached the leadership election rule that bans \u201cabuse of any kind by members or supporters\u201d.

  "<p>Some reviews stick around and Diane Kruger had the misfortune to receive a memorably withering one when she was starting out as an actress. \u201cToo beautiful to play a role of any substance,\u201d was the offhand dismissal from the <em>New York Times </em>critic, Manohla Dargis, in 2006. The comment was mostly a judgment on <em>Troy</em>, the eye-wateringly expensive <em>Iliad</em> adaptation in which she was cast opposite Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom as a blond, blue-eyed Helen. The film-makers wanted an unknown for the part and Kruger, a German ex-model, beat more than 3,000 women to be the face that, in Christopher Marlowe\u2019s words, \u201claunch\u2019d a thousand ships\u201d.</p> <p>Ten years \u2013 and around 30 films \u2013 on, the <em>New York Times </em>line still irks Kruger. \u201cWhat an ignorant and stupid thing to say!\u201d she exclaims, on the phone from Paris; she splits her time between there and New York. \u201cBut it really affected me at the time because I thought, \u2018Why is she talking about the way I look? Why isn\u2019t she talking about what I do in the movie?\u2019 And so that really taught me to a) not read critics. And b) to just toughen up. So I was like, \u2018Fuck that!\u2019 Or, \u2018Fuck them!\u2019 It made me really want to just dig deeper and show them I could do other things.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because I had such a tumultuous childhood, I was able to express my emotions dancing or being on stage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kruger, now 40, has made a committed effort to change the public perception of her \u2013 and the project continues. She is perhaps best known here and in the States for playing kick-ass double agent Bridget von Hammersmark in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s second world war epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/23/inglourious-basterds-philip-french\"><em>Inglourious Basterds</em></a><em> </em>or as Sonya Cross, a detective with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, in the American version of the Scandi thriller <em>The Bridge</em>. But mostly she works in France, leaning towards parts for strong women in darker, independent films, some of which she produces. She\u2019s been Marie Antoinette (<em>Farewell, My Queen</em>), Abraham Lincoln\u2019s stepmother (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/06/the-better-angels-review-torpid-take-lincolns-childhood\"><em>The Better Angels</em></a>) and a Bosnian immigrant taxi driver (<em>Unknown</em>). Kruger is in demand on magazine covers and never seems to make a misstep on the red carpet, but it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not where her heart lies.</p> <p>And Kruger\u2019s new movie, <em>The Infiltrator</em>, continues to make her case. It tells the true story of a customs official in 1980s Florida called <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/things-to-do/movies/tampas-robert-mazur-talks-about-the-life-behind-the-infiltrator/2284472\">Robert Mazur</a> (played by <em>Breaking Bad</em>\u2019s Bryan Cranston) who went undercover to bring down a Colombian drug cartel and the banks that supported it. Kruger is a rookie special agent, Kathy Ertz, who comes in on the sting as Mazur\u2019s wife. It is a superior thriller, tense and twisty, and Cranston is predictably excellent, but Kruger is sharp and spirited, more than holding her own in a role that could easily have just been arm candy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7f48593a28d6d64fa251eb041bc6610027ddd91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7f48593a28d6d64fa251eb041bc6610027ddd91/0_0_1890_2173/870.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Kruger as Face of the Year 1992.\" width=\"870\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diane Kruger as Face of the Year 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kruger, it turns out, is not what you would expect in a few ways. Her perfect, accentless English is more sweary than you might imagine and her co-stars are often surprised she is an excellent joke teller. She\u2019s winningly honest about her career and personal life. And it\u2019s hard not to warm to someone who, when I ask why she gave up modelling, says: \u201cThe third time the 1960s came around I was like, \u2018Are we <em>really</em> taking this picture again? I\u2019m really, really bored.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Before modelling, there was ballet. Kruger grew up as Diane Heidkr\u00fcger, in a village in the heart of Germany, not far from Hanover. Each summer from the age of 11, she was shipped off to London on her own for intensive training with the Royal Ballet School. It sounds quite full-on, <em>Black Swan</em>-esque, but Kruger has fond memories of those trips: \u201cMy home was a little chaotic and I always loved getting away,\u201d she recalls. Her father was an alcoholic and frequently absent; her parents went through a messy divorce when she was 13.</p> <p>A knee injury around this time derailed her ballet aspirations, but, from puberty onwards, Kruger had already secretly feared the worst. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had the talent to be a prima ballerina,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was really depressed for a good year, but now I\u2019m older, [I see] it was a really great life lesson: you don\u2019t always get what you want. And I think it actually led me, through very mysterious ways, to acting. Because I had such a tumultuous childhood, I was able to express my emotions dancing or being on stage. It\u2019s so much about getting it out and putting that passion or frustration into your performance and then being rewarded for that.\u201d</p> <p>Kruger started to model, aged 15, after being chosen to represent Germany in the Elite Model Look competition that has also launched the careers of Cindy Crawford and Gisele B\u00fcndchen. When it was suggested that she move to Paris, no one was more dubious than her family. \u201cI did not grow up in a household where that was even a subject or encouraged,\u201d says Kruger. \u201cMy mother was very much into making sure that I did OK in school because she wanted me not to be dependent on a man, because her life had been turned upside down. She was very loving but very strict and, if anything, she was incredibly disappointed when I chose to do modelling. She was like, \u2018Why would you do that? You don\u2019t look like a model.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4105689212d0c2b833387f109141c7c2ddae7135\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4105689212d0c2b833387f109141c7c2ddae7135/237_0_3083_1946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Kruger with Michael Fassbender in Inglourious Basterds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diane Kruger with Michael Fassbender in Tarantino\u2019s Inglourious Basterds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kruger laughs. \u201cNot that she was condescending and not encouraging, but she was like, \u2018You\u2019re crazy!\u2019 basically. Again, now I\u2019m older \u2013 and I could have a daughter the age I was when I left home \u2013 I can only admire her faith in me, because there\u2019s no way I\u2019d let my 16-year-old daughter go to Paris for a year.\u201d</p> <p>The jump to acting in her mid-20s was, again, partly personal choice and partly Kruger\u2019s hard-headed realism. Although she booked covers for Paris <em>Vogue </em>and featured in ads for Chanel and Giorgio Armani, she often felt like the swan whose legs whir incessantly to stay afloat. \u201cI really don\u2019t look like a model,\u201d she insists. \u201cI\u2019m only 5ft 7in; I\u2019m not like your 5ft 10in obvious model strutting down the street, so I always felt insecure about how I looked and I put so much pressure on myself. The minute I decided, \u2018Why am I doing this to myself?\u2019 my life got a lot better.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a sense that I don\u2019t have any time to waste... I\u2019ve got to put myself first, no more excuses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The role of Helen in <em>Troy</em>,<em> </em>which Kruger won almost immediately after the switch, was, she says now, a mixed blessing. \u201cIt was hugely daunting, because I knew they didn\u2019t necessarily hire me because I was Julia Roberts,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was the biggest thing to get at that time in Hollywood. I\u2019d never even been to Hollywood, it allowed me to get an agent. I went from doing literally one movie to being known, or my face at least, throughout the world.\u201d</p> <p>Kruger has become more circumspect about the parts she takes, especially in American films. For <em>The Infiltrator</em>, the draw first and foremost was Cranston. \u201cI was fan-girling a lot, just because of the show,\u201d she says, meaning <em>Breaking Bad</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassing thing to say, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find any actor in Los Angeles, or even in England, who wouldn\u2019t want to work with Bryan Cranston. He\u2019s a character actor who became a movie star and that doesn\u2019t happen very often. You forget who he is, his face just changes. In fact, so much so, I ran into him in the <em>Vanity Fair </em>party, after we wrapped <em>The Infiltrator</em>, and I walked past him without recognising him. Definitely one of the best actors I\u2019ve ever worked with \u2013 ever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c3c9d2c87d723ee1ceb19c22298543d528111d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3c9d2c87d723ee1ceb19c22298543d528111d9/0_92_3648_2240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Kruger as Helen in Troy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kruger as Helen in Troy: \u2018It was hugely daunting.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Infiltrator </em>has had a decidedly odd journey to the cinema. The director is Brad Furman (who had success with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/17/the-lincoln-lawyer-review\"><em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em></a>) and the screenplay \u2013 in a possible movie-history first \u2013 is by his mother, Ellen Brown Furman, a former lawyer who has turned to writing in her 60s. \u201cThat was an interesting dynamic to say the least, but I kind of loved it,\u201d says Kruger. \u201cBrad is such a good and nice Jewish boy who adores his mom.\u201d Meanwhile, despite the story playing out in tropical Florida, the film, for budgetary reasons, was mostly shot in the UK in rainy, cold springtime. Locations included a bowling alley next to Heathrow and Dunsfold Aerodrome, home of the <em>Top Gear </em>racetrack. Did Kruger see the Stig? \u201cNo, what is that?\u201d she replies.</p> <p>Kruger turned 40 in July, but celebrations were rather muted. Shortly after the big day, it was officially announced that she and Joshua Jackson (Pacey from <em>Dawson\u2019s Creek</em>) were splitting after more than 10 years together. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the most fun time; my partner and I separated so it was a transitional time in my life,\u201d she says with a wry snort. \u201cBut a very positive one.\u201d</p> <p>Was there a sense that, as a new decade loomed, Kruger found herself assessing her personal and professional happiness? \u201cYou know, if you\u2019d have asked me that a year ago, I\u2019d have said absolutely not, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she replies. \u201cAnd it kind of didn\u2019t. And it kind of doesn\u2019t. But there is a sense that I don\u2019t have any time to waste. Like, I want to do what I want to do or I want to be with who I want to be with. I\u2019ve got to put myself first, no more excuses. I\u2019m going to live in the now.\u201d</p> <p>Career-wise, at least, Kruger is on a hot streak. And as she talks you sense that she is almost relieved to be entering a phase of her life where her looks will be less commented on. \u201cAround 70% of my career is in France, which is an amazing place for women who are getting older,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not daunted. I feel and I truly believe that the best is yet to come. I have felt better this year about where I am in life and who I am as a person than I have in the past 10 years.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhctJ52bow\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kFhctJ52bow?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhctJ52bow\">Watch the trailer for The Infiltrator.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Next up, Kruger plays Catherine Deneuve\u2019s daughter in <em>Tout nous s\u00e9pare</em>: \u201cIt\u2019s a really fucked-up movie and I loved every second of it.\u201d But the one she\u2019s really excited about is the new project from Fatih Akin, a German director of Turkish descent whose films, notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1416759,00.html\"><em>Head-On</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/22/worldcinema.drama\"><em>The Edge of Heaven,</em></a> often focus on the identity problems of immigrants. Kruger collared Akin at the 2012 Cannes festival, where she was a judge, and the new movie, <em>In the Fade</em>, which starts shooting this autumn, was written with her in mind.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give too much away, but my character is very far from what people physically think of who I am,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a transformation and I\u2019ve never been more scared about a film than this! Like truly scared. For the last month or so, I\u2019ve dreamed about it every night. I can\u2019t wait to get started, but I\u2019m dreading the emotional toll of it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m <em>really </em>scared!\u201d she repeats, but she\u2019s giggling too. Perhaps, after this, no one will dismiss her as just a pretty face any more.</p> <p><em>The Infiltrator opens on 16 September</em></p>",
  "<p>New Zealand\u2019s landscapes are well-known on the silver screen. The Lord of the Rings films showed off the majestic mountainous scenery so well they sparked a tourism boom \u2013 and 13% of travellers still cite Peter Jackson\u2019s cinematography in their decision to visit. Out next Friday (16 September), Hunt for the Wilderpeople, a comedy-drama directed by Taika Waititi and starring Sam Neill as Hec, grumpy foster uncle to Ricky (newcomer Julian Dennison), shines the spotlight on the country once again. The story of a city kid\u2019s adventures in the wilderness broke box office records at home and had rave reviews at the Edinburgh International Film Festival (winning the coveted Audience Award). It was filmed largely in the North Island\u2019s Auckland region, where beaches, rainforest and vineyards surround New Zealand\u2019s biggest city.

After tuition on the basics, he has participants foraging for logs, branches and bracken to build a makeshift bed and shelter) and trying to light a fire using cotton wool, flint and steel (a dead phone battery can also work, apparently).

  "<p>Late August became open season in the Guardian letters page for shooting cryptic puzzles for not being what they were in the good old days.

In case you missed it, you can recapture the action by clicking on: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2016/aug/26/cryptic-crosswords-im-sorry-i-havent-a-clue\">https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2016/aug/26/cryptic-crosswords-im-sorry-i-havent-a-clue</a>. </p> <p>Aware that younger solvers and all of our growing number of overseas readers do the crosswords online and do not pay to buy the paper, I checked that admirable site Fifteen Squared, where the British \u2018broadsheet\u2019 cryptic puzzles are independently monitored each day, to see what comments were being registered there. I found that Sil van den Hoek had posted a comment on 28 August to the effect that he found the collection of letters published in the Guardian two days earlier to be odd. His comment has since attracted 93 further responses. Not surprisingly, perhaps, since the Fifteen Squared site is most used by regular online crossword enthusiasts, these 93 comments are almost as universally in favour of the Guardian Cryptic as the letters in the paper were critical. The van den Hoek collection can be seen at: <a href=\"http://www.fifteensquared.net/2016/08/28/the-guardian-letters-27-08-2106-i-havent-a-clue/\">http://www.fifteensquared.net/2016/08/28/the-guardian-letters-27-08-2106-i-havent-a-clue/</a>.</p> <p>I tend to be wary of those who look at the past and find it rose-tinted. Of course, like anything else if it is to survive and prosper, the cryptic puzzle has to evolve over time. Araucaria has deservedly joined the pantheon of all-time great setters, though many crossword luminaries like Colin Dexter and Jeremy Morse were pretty snooty about his cluing when he was still active. His bank holiday jumbo specials were of the highest quality but people seem to have forgotten that they were every bit as intricate as those that Maskarade is currently producing. When I became crossword editor in 1997 Paul, who is now an established Guardian favourite, had many vociferous critics. The much-lamented Bunthorne could never have been described as a setter of easier puzzles than, say, Puck or Picaroon today. As to the tricks of the trade, they too have developed and changed. But it is certainly much easier now than it was then for tyro solvers to learn about them. If you are stuck today on a particular clue, a note of explanation is provided by the excellent commentators at <a href=\"http://www.fifteensquared.net/\">http://www.fifteensquared.net</a>.</p> <p>I inherited a policy that, in principle, each week of Guardian Cryptics should contain two average, two easier and two more difficult puzzles. In the first six months of this year we published 156 cryptic puzzles. It is subjective to classify a particular setter as difficult or easy and some, notably Paul like Araucaria before him, slips the odd easier puzzle in with his other deliveries. But, suppose you allow that Arachne, Brendan, Chifonie, Nutmeg, Orlando, Rufus and Shed are towards the more non-devious end of the spectrum, in these six months 49 of their puzzles were published, just three short of a third of the total. Of those, 19 were by Rufus, by far the most regularly published setter apart from Paul.</p> <p>In short, although things have indeed changed over the past 20 years, it is perhaps surprising, given the changes in the demographic of our crossword solvers and the changes in language and technology, that they have not been greater.</p> <p>_____ </p> <p>Many of you will be familiar with Eric Westbrook\u2019s extraordinary 3-D crossword puzzle calendars, produced in aid of BBC Children in Need and the Royal National Institute of Blind People. It is planned that there should again be a calendar for 2017, but this year the monthly puzzles are just available online. The puzzle for this September is promoted as being 3-D \u2018but with an added 4-D element\u2019. The Guardian\u2019s Puck has been closely involved in producing this September puzzle. You can download it by going to <a href=\"http://www.calendarpuzzles.co.uk/puzzle_downloads.php\">http://www.calendarpuzzles.co.uk/puzzle_downloads.php</a> and selecting the Puzzle and Answer Grid buttons for September. Downloading is free, though you are offered the option of making a contribution to charity. The deadline is the last day of September and, for every correct entry received, \u00a31 will be donated to Air Ambulance and the John Radcliffe Hospital in memory of Ray Parry-Morris, one of the grid designers for the 3-D puzzles, who died last month after a short illness.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>We have continued to have problems over the summer with uploading the Genius puzzle at the right time and with the correct format.

  "<p>One poorly thought-through action can have a devastating ripple effect. So learns Mary Levov, the 16 year-old domestic terrorist in Philip Roth\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel American Pastoral, and so, I fear, has Ewan McGregor, who decided an adaption of this rich, layered and elusive text would be good material for his directorial debut.</p> <p>McGregor directs himself as Seymour \u201cThe Swede\u201d Levov, the golden boy of 1940s Weequahic, the Jewish section of Newark, New Jersey. A living, breathing example of excellence and assimilation, Swede was the sports titan and pillar of local industry who attained legendary status with his peers when he married Dawn, a non-Jewish former Miss New Jersey. Taking over his father\u2019s glove factory in downtown Newark, Swede earns enough to buy a piece of American paradise \u2013 a small farm just a short drive from the city. Here Dawn can raise cows and their daughter Mary can frolic in sun-dappled meadows. As Woody Allen once joked \u201chad I been born in Poland or Berlin I\u2019d be a lampshade right now,\u201d but everything seems to have gone the right way for Swede.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c352416e857d59b541d1d3d933002a7144044e74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c352416e857d59b541d1d3d933002a7144044e74/27_0_597_358/500.jpg\" alt=\"American Pastoral\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if American Pastoral is about anything it\u2019s about how perception is just guess work. What we think we know is likely wrong, and no amount of examination, extrapolation or investigation is going to get at the actual truth. So who knows why young Mary, whose pre-teen years are marred by stuttering and perhaps some confused sexual feelings toward her father, became a raging, angry left-wing radical. Sure, it was the 1960s and those Jefferson Airplane records and copies of Rampart\u2019s got a lot of kids\u2019 blood boiling, but not everyone blew up the local post office and killed a man.</p> <p>The bulk of the film dwells on Swede and Dawn dealing with the after effect of their daughter\u2019s actions and subsequent disappearance in the hard left underground. The closest thing to exciting film-making comes once Swede is approached by a young woman (Valorie Curry) who knows of Mary\u2019s whereabouts and shakes him down for some cash. These tawdry scenes are quite effective as they give McGregor something active to do to show his frustration, guilt and grief. The rest of the movie consists mostly of people just talking.</p> <p>That won\u2019t be too surprising to readers of the book, as part of its strength is how it plays with time and reliability. Those unfamiliar with the source material or how Roth can dwell on one concept for paragraphs at a time with some of the greatest prose in the English language may find themselves making the \u201cget on with it gesture\u201d in their seats. When we do meet up with Mary again in her third act persona, Dakota Fanning, who is quite strong as the angry bleeding-heart teen, is quite out of her depths masquerading as a ghostly spiritual being.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAAqiO_Z9Vs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SAAqiO_Z9Vs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What we have on our hands is a dud, but there are a few grace notes that save it from being an unmitigated disaster. (As far as terrible idea Roth adaptations, Ernest Lehman\u2019s Portnoy\u2019s Complaint\u2019s position is secure.) Swede\u2019s glove factory ends up being at the epicentre of the<a href=\"https://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/race/071667race-ra.html\"> Newark race riots </a>and while McGregor\u2019s reliance on newsreel footage is cheesy (and sets up similar shots of the Moon landing, Woodstock and another use of Buffalo Springfield\u2019s For What Its Worth on the soundtrack, so help us all) it does touch on how well-meaning liberals react in the face of potential revolution. Swede proudly boasts his factory employs \u201c80% Negros,\u201d but yanks his daughter back in fear when she tries to give a black power salute to a group of men who may or may not be forming an angry mob.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/30/challenge-film-adaption-individual-reading-great-novels-the-english-patient-the-wings-of-the-dove-great-characters-powerful-cinema\">The bigger they come: how to film an 'unfilmable' book</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The best moment in the entire film is when Swede proudly shows how a glove is made, from dark leather shipped from Africa, turning a white girl\u2019s hand a similar shade to one of his devoted black workers, who then tests it out by making a fist. There are signifiers flying all over the place and McGregor is wise enough to let them stay in the background. The unfortunate thing is that it\u2019s the foreground that\u2019s so dull. Jennifer Connolly acts her guts out in a monologue sequence that is airless and uninspired. And as the movie drones on the most engaging thing is trying to figure out just what is up with McGregor\u2019s accent. American excellence may be an unattainable dream, but sometimes the facade will appear real to outsiders. This production is not such a case.<br></p>",
  "<p>Where did the \u201ccyber\u201d in \u201ccyberspace\u201d come from? Most people, when asked, will probably credit William Gibson, who famously introduced the term in his celebrated 1984 novel, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/neuromancer.html\"><em>Neuromancer</em></a>. It came to him while watching some kids play early video games. Searching for a name for the virtual space in which they seemed immersed, he wrote \u201ccyberspace\u201d in his notepad. \u201cAs I stared at it in red Sharpie on a yellow legal pad,\u201d he later recalled, \u201cmy whole delight was that it meant absolutely nothing.\u201d </p> <p>How wrong can you be? Cyberspace turned out to be the space that somehow morphed into the networked world we now inhabit, and which might ultimately prove our undoing by making us totally dependent on a system that is both unfathomably complex and fundamentally insecure. But the cyber- prefix actually goes back a long way before Gibson \u2013 to the late 1940s and Norbert Wiener\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cybernetics-or-control-and-communication-animal-and-machine\"><em>Cybernetics, Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</em></a>, which was published in 1948. </p> <p>Cybernetics was the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener\">Wiener</a>, an MIT mathematician and polymath, coined for the scientific study of feedback control and communication in animals and machines. As a \u201ctransdiscipline\u201d that cuts across traditional fields such as physics, chemistry and biology, cybernetics had a brief and largely unsuccessful existence: few<strong> </strong>of the world\u2019s universities now have departments of cybernetics. But as Thomas Rid\u2019s absorbing new book, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/rise-of-the-machines.html\">The Rise of the Machines: The Lost History of Cybernetics</a> shows, it has had a long afterglow as a source of mythic inspiration that endures to the present day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The dream of technology augmenting human capabilities is an enduring theme in the evolution of computing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is because at the heart of the cybernetic idea is the proposition that the gap between animals (especially humans) and machines is much narrower than humanists believe. Its argument is that if you ignore the physical processes that go on in the animal and the machine and focus only on the information loops that regulate these processes in both, you begin to see startling similarities. The feedback loops that enable our bodies to maintain an internal temperature of 37C, for example, are analogous to the way in which the cruise control in our cars operates.</p> <p><a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/thomas-rid(3215c4c1-55e7-4a6f-81be-b9c1a8eec2ed)/biography.html\">Dr Rid</a> is a reader in the war studies department of King\u2019s College London, which means that he is primarily interested in conflict, and as the world has gone online he has naturally been drawn into the study of how conflict manifests itself in the virtual world. When states are involved in this, we tend to call it \u201ccyberwarfare\u201d, a term of which I suspect Rid disapproves \u2013 on the grounds that warfare is intrinsically \u201ckinetic\u201d (like Assad\u2019s barrel bombs) \u2013 whereas what\u2019s going on in cyberspace is much more sinister, elusive and intractable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/virtual-reality-cool-empty-community-oculus-rift\">Virtual reality may look cool, but it will feel empty without community | Claire L Evans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In order to explain how we\u2019ve got so far out of our depth, Rid has effectively had to compose an alternative history of computing. And whereas most such histories begin with Alan Turing and Claude Shannon and John von Neumann, Rid starts with Wiener and wartime research into gunnery control. For him, the modern world of technology begins not with the early digital computers developed at Bletchley Park, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania but with the interactive artillery systems developed for the US armed forces by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperry_Corporation\">Sperry gyroscope company</a> in the early 1940s.</p> <p>From this unexpected beginning, Rid weaves an interesting and original story. The seed crystal from which it grows is the idea that the Sperry gun-control system was essentially a way of <em>augmenting</em> the human gunner\u2019s capabilities to cope with the task of hitting fast-moving targets. And it turns out that this dream of technology as a way of augmenting human capabilities is a persistent \u2013 but often overlooked \u2013 theme in the evolution of computing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4da4a7bbe7e1bc2a3f3f04c6b1c02671ab1c4f0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da4a7bbe7e1bc2a3f3f04c6b1c02671ab1c4f0f/0_0_800_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"A mechanical dog manufacuted by robot maker Boston Dynamics\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mechanical dog manufactured by robot maker Boston Dynamics. Cybernetics proposes that the gap between humans and their machines is much narrower than humanists believe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Dynamics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The standard narrative about the technology\u2019s history focuses mostly on technical progress \u2013 processing power, bandwidth, storage, networking, etc. It\u2019s about machines and applications, companies and fortunes. The underlying assumption is that the technology is empowering \u2013 which of course in principle it can be. What, after all, is the web but a memory aid for people? What the dominant narrative conveniently ignores, though, is that the motive force for most tech industry development is not human empowerment but profit. Which is why Facebook wants its 1.7 billion users to stay within its walled garden rather than simply being empowered by the open web.</p> <p>The dream of computing as a way of augmenting human capabilities, however, takes empowerment seriously rather than using it as a cover story. It is, for example, what underpinned the life\u2019s work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart\">Douglas Engelbart</a>, the man who came up with the computer mouse and the windowing interface that we use today. And it motivated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider\">JCR Licklider</a>, the psychologist who was, in a way, the godfather of the internet and whose paper <a href=\"https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html\"><em>Man-Computer Symbiosis</em></a> is one of the canonical texts in the augmentation tradition. Even today, a charitable interpretation of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\">Google Glass project</a> would place it firmly in the same tradition. Ditto for virtual reality (VR).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Moonlight Maze attack was breathtaking in its ambition. It was probably small beer compared with what goes on now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given that he starts from cybernetics, the trajectory of Rid\u2019s narrative makes sense. It takes him into the origins of the concept of the \u201ccyborg\u201d \u2013 the notion of adapting humans to their surroundings rather than the other way round \u2013 an idea that was first explored by Nasa and the US military. Thence he moves into the early history of automation, and startling tales about ambitious early attempts to create robots that might be useful in combat. In 1964, for example, US army contractors built the Pedipulator, an 18ft tall mechanical figure that \u201clooked like a prototype of a <em>Star Wars</em> biped\u201d. The idea was to create some kind of intelligent full-body armour that would turn troops, in effect, into walking tanks.</p> <p>From there, it\u2019s just a short leap to virtual reality \u2013 also, incidentally, first invented by the US military in the early 1980s. Rid\u2019s account of the California counter-culture\u2019s obsession with VR is fascinating, and includes the revelation that Timothy Leary, the high priest of LSD, was an early evangelist. Leary and co thought that VR was better than LSD because it was inherently social whereas an LSD trip was just chemically induced isolation. Then Rid moves on to the arrival of public-key cryptography, which put military-grade encryption into the hands of citizens for the first time (and which had been secretly invented at GCHQ, so one can imagine its discombobulation when civilian geeks independently came up with it).</p> <p>The final substantive chapter of <em>Rise of the Machines</em> is about conflict in cyberspace, and contains the first detailed account I\u2019ve seen of the \u201cMoonlight Maze\u201d attack on US networks. Rid describes this as \u201cthe biggest and most sophisticated computer network attack made against the United States in history\u201d. It happened <em>in 1996</em>, which means that it belongs in prehistory by internet timescales. And it originated in Russia. The attack was breathtaking in its ambition and comprehensiveness. But it was probably small beer compared with what goes on now, especially given that China has entered the cyberfray.</p> <p>In some ways, Rid\u2019s chapter on conflict in cyberspace seems orthogonal to his main story, which is about how Wiener\u2019s vision of cybernetics functioned as an inspirational myth for innovators who were interested in what Licklider and Engelbart thought of as \u201cman-machine symbiosis\u201d and human augmentation.

Journalists and politicians and academics would say \u201ccyber\u201d and roll their eyes at it. Sometimes they would ask where the funny phrase actually came from. So every time my boss introduced me as, \u201cHey, this is Thomas, he\u2019s our cyber expert,\u201d I cringed. So I thought I should write a book. Nobody, after all, had properly connected today\u2019s \u201ccyber\u201d to its historic ancestor, cybernetics.</p> <p>Initially I wanted to do a polemic. But then I presented some of the history at Royal Holloway, and to my surprise, some of the computer science students warmed to \u201ccyber\u201d after my talk, appreciating the idea\u2019s historical and philosophical depth. So I thought, yes, let\u2019s do this properly.</p> <p><strong>You teach in a department of war studies, so I can see that </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/cyberwar\"><strong>cyberwar</strong></a><strong> might be your thing. But you decided that you needed to go way back \u2013 not only to </strong><a href=\"http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Wiener_Norbert.html\"><strong>Norbert Wiener</strong></a><strong> and the original ideas of cybernetics, but also to the counter-cultural background, to personal computing, virtual reality (VR) and computer conferencing. Why? </strong><br>War studies, my department, is an open tent. Crossing disciplinary boundaries and adding historical and conceptual depth is what we do. So \u201cmachines\u201d fits right in. I think understanding our fascination with communication and control today requires going back to the origins, to Wiener\u2019s cybernetic vision after the second world war. Our temptation to improve ourselves through our own machines \u2013 \u201cbig brains\u201d in the 50s, or artificial intelligence today \u2013 is hardwired into who we are as humans. We don\u2019t just want to play God, we want to beat God, building artificial intelligence that\u2019s better than the non-artificial kind. This hubris will never go away. So one of our best insurance is to study the history of cybernetic myths, the promise of the perennially imminent rise of the machines.</p> <p><strong>How long did the book take to research and write? </strong><br>It took me about three years. It wasn\u2019t hard to stay focused \u2013 the story throughout the decades was just too gripping: here was the US air force building touch-sensitive cybernetic manipulators to refuel nuclear-powered long-range bombers, and there\u2019s LSD guru <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/18/timothy-leary-papers-sale-lsd\">Timothy Leary</a> discovering the \u201ccybernetic space\u201d inside the machines as a mind-expansion device even better than psychedelic drugs \u2013 better, by the way, because the \u201cmachine high\u201d was more creative and more social than getting stoned on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/17/magic-mushrooms-lift-severe-depression-in-clinical-trial\">psilocybin</a>.</p> <p><strong>One group that\u2019s missing from your account is the engineers who sought to implement old-style cybernetic ideas in real life. For example, the </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn\"><strong>Cybersyn project</strong></a><strong> that </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries\"><strong>Stafford Beer</strong></a><strong> led in Chile for Salvador Allende. Did you think of including stuff like that? If not, why not? </strong><br>The cybernetic story is expansive. I had to leave out so much, especially in the 50s and 60s, the heyday of cybernetics. For example, the rise of cybernetics in the Soviet Union is a story in itself, and almost entirely missing from my book, as is much of the sociological work that was inspired by Norbert Wiener\u2019s vision (much of it either dated or impenetrable). Cybersyn has been admirably covered, in detail, by Eden Medina\u2019s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/cybernetic-revolutionaries-2.html\"><em>Cybernetic Revolutionaries</em></a>. I would also mention Ronald Kline\u2019s recent book, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/cybernetics-moment.html\"><em>The Cybernetics Moment</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Your account of the Moonlight Maze investigation (of a full-on state-sponsored cyberattack on the US) is fascinating and scary. It suggests that \u2013 contrary to popular belief \u2013 cyberwarfare is not just a distant possibility but a baffling and terrifying reality. It is also \u2013 by your account \u2013 intractable.

Or, at the very least, aren\u2019t we in a position analogous to where we were with nuclear weapons in, say, 1946? </strong><br>\u201cCyberwar\u201d, if you want to call it that, has been going on since at least 1996 \u2013 as I show \u2013 without interruption. In fact state-sponsored espionage, sabotage, and subversion escalated drastically in the past two decades. But meanwhile we\u2019ve been fooling ourselves, expecting blackouts and explosions and planes falling out of the sky as a result of cyberattacks. Physical effects happen, but have been a rare exception. What we\u2019re seeing instead is even scarier: an escalation of cold war-style spy-versus-spy subversion and sabotage, covert and hidden and very political, not open and of military nature, like nuclear weapons. Over the last year we have observed several instances of intelligence agencies breaching victims, stealing files, and dumping sensitive information into the public domain: often through purpose-created leak forums, or indeed though Wikileaks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/01/bjork-digital-review-somerset-house-vulnicura-virtual-reality-vr\">Bj\u00f6rk Digital review \u2013 to virtual reality and beyond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Russian agencies have been leading this trend, most visibly by trying to influence the US election through hacking and dumping.

One of the interesting parts of your story is the revelation that we have been here before \u2013 except last time, enthusiasm for VR was inextricably bound up with psychedelic drugs. Then, it was tech plus LSD; now it\u2019s tech plus money. The same cycle applies to artificial intelligence. So cybernetics isn\u2019t the only field to have waxed and waned. </strong><br>Absolutely not. I was often writing notes on the margins of my manuscript in <a href=\"http://www.fernandezandwells.com/\">Fernandez &amp; Wells</a> in Somerset House, where London fashion week used to happen. Technology is a bit like fashion: every few years a new craze or trend comes around, drawing much attention, money, and fresh talent. Right now, it\u2019s automation and VR, a bit retro-60s and -90s respectively. Of course our fears and hopes aren\u2019t just repeating the past, and the technical progress in both fields has been impressive. But we\u2019ll move on before long, and the next tech wave will probably have a retro feature again.</p> <p><strong>At a certain moment in the book you effectively detach the prefix \u201ccyber\u201d from its origins in wartime MIT and the work of Norbert Wiener and use it to build a narrative about our networked and computerised existence \u2013 cyborgs, cyberspace, cyberwar etc. Your justification, as I see it, is that there was a cybernetic moment and it passed. But had you thought that a cybernetic analysis of our current plight in trying to manage cyberspace might be insightful?

Or is that pushing the idea too far? </strong><br>You\u2019re raising a fascinating question here, one that I struggled with for a long time. First, I think \u201ccyber\u201d detached itself from its origins, and degenerated from a scientific concept to an ideology. That shift began in the early 1960s. My book is merely chronicling this larger history, not applying cybernetics to anything. It took me a while to resist the cybernetic temptation, if you like: the old theory still has charm and seductive force left in its bones \u2013 but of course I never wanted to be a cyberneticist.</p> <p><em>The Rise of the Machines is published by Scribe (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/rise-of-the-machines.html\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a316.40</em></a><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Across Europe, with growing numbers of baby boomers clinging to their office chairs, it has become harder for unskilled and semi-skilled young people to find work. Even graduates struggle to find work commensurate with their expertise.</p> <p>\u201cEurope needs an immediate answer on growth, youth and security issues,\u201d said Sandro Gozi, Italian secretary of state for European affairs at a meeting of European leaders in Italy last month.</p> <p>Most European leaders have wrung their hands and expressed their sympathy for the young as first the financial crash and then a succession of crises sent unemployment rates for 15- to 24-year-olds soaring.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande described France\u2019s unemployment rate as an \u201ceconomic and social emergency\u201d. <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-economy-hollande-idUKKCN0UW11Q\" title=\"\">Announcing a \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) jobs package</a>, the French president said he was particularly upset at a youth unemployment rate that had topped 24%.</p> <p>His answer was deeply traditional \u2013 before the end of the year he intended to put 500,000 unemployed into vocational training programmes, in addition to the 150,000 announced last October.</p> <p>To tackle youth unemployment more specifically, 150,000 would be enrolled in civic service volunteer programmes, almost three times as many as the 60,000 youngsters enrolled in 2015.</p> <p>State-run training programmes are nothing new in France and are often used to fill a jobs void. The suspicion must be that when <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\" title=\"\">the July youth unemployment figures</a> for the eurozone showed a drop of 136,000, and France\u2019s unemployment rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/french-unemployment-rate-falls-first-time-2012-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">fell below 10% for the first time</a> in his presidency, the falls could be largely attributed to Hollande\u2019s civic service scheme, rather than a resurgent private sector.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93a0d19aa44e3458a8cad70ae43ec66b37d174af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93a0d19aa44e3458a8cad70ae43ec66b37d174af/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi overturned rules that restricted firms from hiring and firing, making the jobs market even more flexible and insecure.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi overturned rules that restricted firms from hiring and firing, making the jobs market even more flexible and insecure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imago / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Germany\u2019s, and France\u2019s, answer has been to devise work schemes and skills centres that aim to make the young ready for work at least by the time they are 30. And the use of internships, short-term and flexible contracts is equally rife. Like companies in the UK, German firms look around for ways to cut costs to afford the hugely expensive benefits negotiated by older, often unionised, workers. Invariably, they turn to the young for savings.</p> <p>The scale of this attack on the terms and conditions of young workers in France and Germany pales compared to the brutal exploitation of under-25s in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. These countries have always assumed young people will live at home while they are educated and trained for the workplace. Eight years after the financial crisis, this situation can only be described as extreme.</p> <p>In Italy, around 80% of under-30s live in their parental home and the average age for achieving \u201ceconomic independence\u201d is estimated at 35. Thousands still leave for Germany and Britain and those who stay must work with few benefits and little job security.</p> <p>Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi spent his first months in office overturning rules that restricted firms from hiring and firing, making the jobs market even more flexible and insecure. This policy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/italian-pm-matteo-renzi-electoral-reform-law-italy\" title=\"\">tax cuts</a> and the end of a long recession last year has brought Italy\u2019s youth unemployment rate down from 43% in 2014 to 39.2% in July 2016.</p> <p>It is also worth noting that, as with the other Mediterranean countries, the official figures fail to reveal a huge hidden economy that offers work cash-in-hand to young people. These tax-free payments keep their heads financially above water from week to week, but don\u2019t allow them to purchase a home, start a family or save for a pension.</p> <p>Renzi wants Brussels to sanction a huge investment drive across Europe, in the wake of Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, to encourage private companies to train young workers. It\u2019s easy to see why, when the Italian economy is weighed down by troubled banks and the finance ministry is out of funds. But getting agreement from the rest of Europe, and Germany in particular, will be difficult. In the meantime, the continent\u2019s youth will experience differing fortunes.</p>",
  "<p>In 1931, Nancy Astor, owner of one of the most expensive houses in England, accompanied George Bernard Shaw to the Soviet Union. Armed with enough tinned food for two weeks, she embarked on the trip with the entitled confidence of the English aristocracy, though she was an American by birth. \u201cWhen will you stop killing people?\u201d she asked Stalin, who\u2019d granted her a two-hour interview. \u201cWe are living in a state of war,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen peace comes we shall stop it.\u201d</p> <p>With sufficient wealth and privilege, English women could be anywhere and talk to anyone. Si\u00e2n Evans\u2019s new book is an account of six English hostesses (three originally American and one Scottish) who flourished in the interwar years. Nancy Astor, Mrs Laura Corrigan, Sibyl, Lady Colefax, Lady Emerald Cunard, Lady Londonderry and Mrs Margaret Greville all lived in houses that are difficult to conceive of as domestic residences now, when most of them are owned by the National Trust. The grandest was Cliveden, the Astors\u2019 Buckinghamshire home, where at the end of Nancy\u2019s life the Profumo affair began.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Evans is too anxious to defend her subjects to scrutinise their place in history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Evans, this is more than an escapist tale of privilege. She claims both that \u201cto be a great hostess was a career choice for those resourceful and energetic women\u201d and that her six \u201cqueen bees\u201d had \u201cprofound effects on British history\u201d. Neither claim is convincing. Being a great hostess is not a career choice and it demeans the pioneering women who did manage to have jobs in this period to call it one. Indeed, some of these hostesses also had careers, which took up more time than their hostessing.</p> <p>When her husband inherited a title and was debarred from his political seat in 1919, Nancy Astor stood for election. As the first female MP to take her seat, she managed to weather male disapprobation and to influence the law, pushing through an act in 1923 banning the sale of alcohol to those under 18. \u201cWhen you took your seat, I felt as if a woman had come into my bathroom and I had only a sponge with which to defend myself,\u201d Churchill complained. \u201cYou are not handsome enough to have worries of that kind,\u201d Astor retorted. Meanwhile, Sibyl Colefax set up a successful interior-decorating business, starting her 12-hour days at 7am so that she could finish in time for the daily round of drinks and dinner, changing her clothes in the back of her chauffeur-driven Rolls on the way.</p> <p>Did these women have much influence as hostesses? Certainly between them they managed to entice most of the social, political and artistic elite to their competing salons. But ultimately, this was a series of parties. Reminiscing about Emerald Cunard, Oswald Mosley looked back on her house as a place where \u201cthe cleverest met with the most beautiful and that is what social life should be\u201d. No doubt it was all \u201cenormous fun\u201d, as he recalled, but surely Astor had more influence as an MP than she did at home. The suggestion that they influenced art also seems overstated. Though their houses were popular, they were not especially respected by serious writers and artists. Mocking Colefax, Virginia Woolf coined the term \u201cColefaxismus\u201d for casual remarks intended to imply privileged knowledge of a subject. Emerald Cunard\u2019s influence in the opera scene was acquired chiefly as a result of the financial support she gave her lover, the conductor Thomas Beecham. But this was an increasingly humiliating affair with a serially unfaithful man.</p> <p>Most of them lost face in the lead up to the second world war, when all but one were sympathetic to Hitler. The Londonderrys made their final visit to Germany in June 1938 and insisted afterwards that Britain should \u201cextend the hand of true friendship to the Third Reich\u201d for the sake of world peace. The hostesses did their best to regain prestige by aiding the war effort and some were impressive in their sacrifices and achievements. Laura Corrigan remained in Paris once it was overrun by Nazis, managing to sell her jewellery to Goering in order to support wounded soldiers in France.</p> <p>There are important historical questions to be asked here, but Evans is too anxious to defend her subjects to scrutinise their place in history. She also doesn\u2019t seem especially interested in analysing her cast as individuals. The portraits are done with a broad brush and I found that I didn\u2019t know these women intimately enough to care what happened to them and was frequently inclined to agree with Harold Nicolson, complaining that \u201cthe harm which these silly, selfish hostesses do is immense\u201d. Nicolson didn\u2019t turn down their invitations, though, and I didn\u2019t stop reading about them. Insofar as it\u2019s always pleasurable to read about the quirks and feats of eccentric and redoubtable women, the book, like their parties, is often \u201cenormous fun\u201d.</p> <p><strong> <br></strong></p> <p><em>Lara Feigel is the author of </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/24/bitter-taste-of-victory-lara-feigel-review-in-the-ruins-of-the-reich-auden-hemingway-spender-mann\"><em>The Bitter Taste of Victory: In the Ruins of the Reich</em></a><em>.

What that might look like is still under construction.</p> <p>Street art and the outlaw sloganeering of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/banksy\">Banksy</a> was one effort to test the in-house freedoms of the gallery in less permissive spaces. Another, more rigorous attempt would be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/03/theaster-gates-artist-chicago-dorchester-projects\">inspiring project of the American Theaster Gates in Chicago\u2019s South Side</a>. Gates is using the material of his historically blighted neighbourhood, repurposed as art, to regenerate entire blocks of that community and connect its residents with a radical civil rights past, making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">black lives matter </a>in bricks and mortar. His 2011 collection,<em> In the Event of a Race Riot</em>,<em> </em>coiled a series decommissioned fire hoses from the civil rights era in gilt-frame boxes.

Protest, which opens later this month at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, will dramatise some of them. It is a show, in some ways, nostalgic for the dualities of 60s protest (currently celebrated in the V&amp;A exhibition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/21/san-francisco-exhibition-victoria-albert-revolution-silicon-valley\">You Say You Want a Revolution?</a>). Taking as a starting point the American painter Alice Neel\u2019s prophetic 1936 painting, <em>Nazis Murder Jews</em>, which depicts a Communist party torchlight parade through the streets of New York City, it collects new and recent pieces that address in different ways our own disorienting political moment.

The first was that, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">phenomenon of Trump</a> in America and the threats to cohesive democracy in Europe, the need for a politically engaged art has rarely been more urgent. The second was that the means to that end are necessarily nuanced. It is harder to challenge power if, in a globalised world, you don\u2019t know precisely where power lies. How do you stick it to the man, when the man in question is not a state or a corporation, but, increasingly a tax-dodging global network of information systems run by smart former hippies with untold wealth?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81a3bb6b47f2e91635f706a9e7085523134556d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81a3bb6b47f2e91635f706a9e7085523134556d6/0_0_2289_3215/712.jpg\" alt=\"Nazis Murder Jews 1936, by Alice Neel\" width=\"712\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazis Murder Jews, 1936, by Alice Neel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the Artist\u2019s Estate and Victoria Miro, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Western artists are generally uneasy at being viewed as political in the way that Weiwei has come to accept; they see it as a limit on their asserted freedom.

Sarah Sze, the American sculptor, who creates wonderful, unsettling mind maps of consumerist detritus that spill across the gallery floor, fell foul of the Chinese censors in Guangzhou. While in no way comparing her situation to that of Ai Weiwei, in some ways confronting the blunt instrument of censorship gave her work extra force and clarity, she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cProtest requires focus,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Occupy movement could have focused around one moment or image \u2013 like John and Yoko in a bed \u2013 it would have helped that movement a lot. My work really reflects the sense, I think, that we have masses of information coming at us from sources we don\u2019t know, and the speed of that makes the hierarchy of what to protest against very slippery all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Sze is somewhat wistful for the simple visual protests of her student years. \u201cAt my American college the entire main campus was filled with shanty towns protesting apartheid. A lot of students were kicked out as a result. Those are the kinds of things where art can be dangerous to power.\u201d</p> <p>In our digital age did she feel that any solid act of making becomes a political act?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible longing for stillness,\u201d she said, \u201cin the way that you stand in front of a Vermeer and are having a physical conversation with Vermeer across time and place. The idea of the hand-made itself can be quite conservative. But what seems important to me is how you create a moment where you feel the presence of the maker, a live conversation. You see it in the growth of live events and talks and happenings. The premium on storytelling.

To be open to what crosses your path.\u201d</p> <p>What were the moments in that journey that he enjoyed most?</p> <p>\u201cI think of an artist like Ed Ruscha, famous for his painting.

So we were able to do that in an abandoned drive-in theatre in the middle of the desert where the train stopped, and the sound of this vocal was like a huge turbine engine, at dusk, and the warm wind blowing and you are in the middle of nowhere in America. It feels untethered to any existing system.

It is an honourable tradition. The abstract painter Joan Mir\u00f3 was never a political activist in a conventional sense, but he was always his own man. When he was asked late in life what he had done to oppose General Franco, he didn\u2019t hesitate to reply: \u201cFree and radical things.\u201d</p> <p>Aitken agreed. \u201cAny worthwhile art is never optional,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political strategy.

And fear of offence shows you are scared of what happens if people express their opinions. That often ends up in a kind of stagnation, with everyone holding each other at gunpoint. It also ends up giving men like Nigel Farage or Donald Trump their popularity, because people are fed up being told what they can or cannot say in public. They vote as a protest, no matter what the consequences of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The really frightening thing is that the generation now in their 20s, they don\u2019t believe things can be better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How do we process these things?

We recently did a <a href=\"http://www.tamuseum.org.il/about-the-exhibition/elmgreen-dragset\">show in Israel</a> at the Tel Aviv museum. In their main hall, we put a full-scale replica of a section of the Berlin Wall. We moved to Berlin soon after the wall came down, so we felt we could speak about walls in general and hoped that it would make people think about the wall that had been built between Palestine and Israel. We come from outside, we don\u2019t live with that conflict. But we could speak about our experience of how important it was for us that the Berlin Wall came down</p> <p><strong>What response did you get?</strong><br>People were moved by it, I think, especially because we did no finger pointing. It was something for them to stand in front of a wall as a single person being blocked in their movement.

We have lost our sense of being good citizens, of having a wider vision. That sounds quite old school and nostalgic, but it is true. Politics has just become economics \u2013 how much do I pay in tax, how much do I get? The internet has made us very egocentric individuals. We are no longer proud of, say, being part of a third generation of steel workers that built a country. We call ourselves \u201cworking class\u201d or \u201cartist\u201d or \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201chomosexual\u201d in a very different way from the way we would have said those things in the 1960s.

That piece was then accepted for a triennial in Guangzhou. When we were shipping it we were contacted by the Chinese authorities saying they wanted specific front pages to be removed.</p> <p><strong>What was the problem?<br></strong>It turned out that every front page I was being asked to remove said something about China; it could be just a phrase or something. So I made a new version for China. The piece was actually on the floor, like it was protecting the floor, spattered with paint and so on. So I took black paint and painted out the parts they wanted redacted and then mentioned the fact in the wall note. For this show, I have done the opposite.

He lives, inevitably, in California. </strong></p> <p><strong>Did you see <em>Station to Station</em> in the tradition of the great American road trip of the 50s and 60s?</strong><br>I did, but the project was born out of a desire for action. It\u2019s really interesting how segregated music, art, cinema, books and so on are. With <em>Station to Station</em>,<em> </em>instead of critiquing this, we tried to create something that erases the separation, that allowed many artists to be in motion together.</p> <p><strong>Do you think that fragmentation is a way of controlling those cultural forces?</strong><br>I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a conspiracy. Different mediums create infrastructures and infrastructures slow down the possibilities for change. It\u2019s funny. When I was talking to the gallery about Protest it conjured those ideas of a feminist rally in 1978 and people standing out in the cold with placards. The tools we have to work with now are so different. The power of an image to transmit an idea coherently is so much reduced. Take those seminal images from Vietnam \u2013 the monk setting himself on fire or the child running from the napalm. Those images were disseminated by conventional media. Now there\u2019s a constant river of images from millions of iPhones. The question is: what has potency? Technology is opening up incredible new possibilities but also dangers, not least a sense of the loss of self. It is a twilight that we are living in right now, which is very unpredictable and also very stimulating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t separate social and political work from any other art.

Do we not need to find a direct way to engage with it?</strong><br>It\u2019s an interesting question and a strange time to ask it. What I see mostly is an incredible political apathy. By and large, the political system appears so corporate-driven that people have a hard time seeing how they can affect it. When you get to that point, real change comes from secession. The most interesting projects or groups or actions now don\u2019t exist in opposition in a traditional protest way, but as something entirely separate from the mainstream, for example, the Slow Food Movement, which is people following something they believe in ethically but also taking away the capital that is funding the existing system. They are voting with what they purchase or don\u2019t purchase.</p> <p><strong>Can art work in the same way?</strong><br>I don\u2019t separate social and political work as different from any other art. The value of any art is to be curious and to forge new languages and questions. The whole landscape has changed. You don\u2019t have to wait for a single critic in New York to come to your exhibition or hear your music. We don\u2019t have those high peaks of culture and dark valleys of culture \u2013 everything is eroded down to this kind of universal jungle.

  "<p>In the theatre, work in progress is fiercely protected from journalists. Write even so much as a preview, and its establishment is likely to come down on you with all the weight of a full props cupboard. At the very least, you can expect a firm tweet from Sam West. But the performance artist and director Bryony Kimmings is not yet a fully paid-up member of the theatrical establishment, for all that her new show, a musical called <em>A Pacifist\u2019s Guide to the War on Cancer</em>, will shortly arrive at the National Theatre. And so it is that, one afternoon in early September, I\u2019m invited to a \u201cshare\u201d of several scenes from the production in a windowless South Bank rehearsal room alongside some of the cancer patients who helped her research it and \u2013 oh, yes \u2013 two leading representatives of the aforementioned theatrical establishment: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/31/rufus-norris-national-theatre-artistic-director-interview\" title=\"\">Rufus Norris, the National Theatre\u2019s artistic director</a>, and Simon McBurney, the actor and artistic director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/complicite\" title=\"\">Complicite</a>, the company that is producing the show.</p> <p>Norris and McBurney, both of whom can be said to be taking something of a gamble on Kimmings, appear tantalisingly impassive, at least at first, and as I find my seat, I have to tell myself to look at the actors rather than at them. The problem is, though, that I\u2019m nervous of looking at the actors. Forty-eight hours ago I was at the funeral of a friend who died from leukaemia \u2013 my second-oldest school friend \u2013 and while I know not to expect mawkishness from Kimmings, who is nothing if not fierce and plain-speaking, there is still every possibility I will burst into tears. Sure enough, this is exactly what happens. The cast are singing a riotous song called <em>Even C***s Get Cancer </em>(this production includes, audiences will be warned, \u201cadult content\u201d). It\u2019s very funny, the tune is great, and there is tap-dancing, which never fails to make my heart soar. Even so, something about it \u2013 a particular combination of vulnerability and determined optimism \u2013 has me leaking like a colander, the lump in my throat the size of Scafell Pike. At which point, I find myself thinking: this is going to be a hit. Are others thinking the same? I can\u2019t believe that they\u2019re not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaac78af96dbf25b1d7464ca303333085719b414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaac78af96dbf25b1d7464ca303333085719b414/0_270_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rehearsals for A Pacifist\u2019s Guide to the War on Cancer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rehearsals for A Pacifist\u2019s Guide to the War on Cancer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Ainslie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The atmosphere in the room, it seems to me, has shifted from coiled nervousness \u2013 after all, it\u2019s only two weeks, now, until <em>A Pacifist\u2019s Guide to Cancer </em>makes its debut at Home in Manchester \u2013 to relieved excitement. Norris is smiling; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/24/ben-power-national-theatre-hush\" title=\"\">Ben Power</a>, his deputy, seems not to be able to stop jiggling his knee; McBurney is about to urge the cast to eat the cakes \u2013 \u201csugar!\u201d \u2013 he has brought with him. Kimmings wanders through the audience, the huge black and white bow in her hair flopping over her forehead, shaking hands and smiling, receiving compliments in the way only she can (\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to be brilliant\u201d). I look over my shoulder, in the direction of Judith Dimant, the Complicite producer to whom this singular show owes its miracle birth. Her eyes, like mine, are red. But she exudes a kind of steely happiness, too. For her, this is a hugely significant moment. This production is certainly about bums on seats, not to mention the triumph of a certain kind of creativity. But it also marks the point when she decided that, for her, the post-cancer world \u2013 if such a thing can ever be said to exist \u2013 would be replete with new possibilities, new energy, new life.</p> <p>Dimant has worked at Complicite, a company described by Emma Thompson as the \u201cmost trailblazing in our theatrical history\u201d, for more than two decades, a job that has given her nerves of steel, and allowed her to build up a production company that thinks nothing at all of taking on difficult work (one definition of \u201cdifficult\u201d, in case you\u2019re wondering, might be a production that lacks a script until the very last moment).</p> <p>Three years ago, however, it occurred to her that it was time to think about the next generation. The question was: where would she find this particular unicorn? Having been sequestered with McBurney for so long, she wasn\u2019t exactly sure. \u201cBut the young people I work with are very well informed, and they said: you should see Bryony Kimmings. She is just fantastic. You\u2019ll love her. So I went to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/19/credible-likeable-superstar-role-model-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\"><em>Credible Likeable Superstar Role Model</em></a> [Kimmings\u2019s hit 2013 show about the sexualisation of childhood, in which she co-starred with her nine-year-old niece], and it was incredible. Her work is very different from what McBurney makes, but there are similarities, too, particularly in the creative process. So, we met, and we decided we\u2019d do a new programme of work \u2013 only by that time, I had got ill.\u201d Dimant had recently been told that she had breast cancer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/09/bryonny-kimmings-and-tim-grayburn-special-romance-fake-it-til-you-make-it\">Performers Bryony Kimmings and Tim Grayburn on their unusual romance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kimmings interjects (the three of us first meet at the National Theatre in early August). \u201cNo, what happened was that I pitched loads of ideas at her, and she didn\u2019t like any of them, and she kept backing away from me every time I coughed. I was thinking: what is wrong with this woman? Finally, she said: \u2018I might as well tell you, I\u2019m having treatment for cancer.\u2019 So I said: \u2018Would you ever want to make something about that?\u2019 She said: \u2018Yes, but not my own story.\u2019 And I knew I had always wanted to make a musical. So, it was agreed: Judith would produce my musical about cancer, and it would be the next stage in my practice.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmings\u2019s work has always, until now, been highly autobiographical. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/aug/22/sex-idiot-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sex Idiot</em></a> (2010), she tracked down her ex-boyfriends after discovering she had chlamydia; in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/19/7-day-drunk-review\" title=\"\"><em>7 Day Drunk</em></a><em> </em>(2011), she spent a week intoxicated to see if it would improve her creativity; and last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/08/fake-it-til-you-make-it-edinburgh-festival-review-traverse-bryony-kimmings-tim-grayburn-depression\" title=\"\"><em>Fake It \u2019Til You Make It</em></a> was about her partner Tim Grayburn\u2019s depression (he co-starred). Has she had experience of cancer? \u201cNot direct experience, no. But my last two shows really told the stories of other people, so I just carried on with that. I thought: I\u2019ll work with real cancer patients. We had a group of about 10 who helped us, all with different stories. One had had cancer seven times; one had late-stage terminal ovarian cancer; one was a lad with lymphoma who was in denial and out raving all the time; one had bowel cancer and was pissed off with everyone saying breast cancer is sexy and bowel cancer is disgusting; one was living with long-term cancer. Basically, the kind of alternative cancer stories you don\u2019t see in films like <em>Wit</em>, or whatever.\u201d She also spoke to doctors and scientists.</p> <p>\u201cI hate musicals,\u201d says Kimmings. \u201cWell, when I was young [she\u2019s 35], I really liked <em>Hairspray </em>and <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, but that was it. I like camp musicals, not ones that take themselves really seriously.\u201d So why did she want to create one? \u201cI thought I could do them better. I mean, I like them <em>now</em>. OK, there are some that I hate. No, I\u2019m not going to say which ones\u2026 OK, I hated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/24/book-of-mormon-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Book of Mormon</em></a>. But I liked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/11/london-road-film-review-gripping-macabre-verbatim-musical\" title=\"\"><em>London Road </em></a> [the National Theatre\u2019s show about the 2006 Ipswich murders]. So I started off with the idea that I\u2019d use verbatim text, like they did in <em>London Road</em>. We tried for a whole week! But in the end, we couldn\u2019t do better than <em>London Road</em>. So we had to start again.\u201d By \u201cwe\u201d, she means her collaborators Brian Lobel, with whom she wrote the book of <em>A Pacifist\u2019s Guide to Cancer</em>, and Tom Parkinson, who wrote the music (she wrote the lyrics). \u201cBrian has been making shows about cancer for years, and he\u2019s one of my friends anyway, so it would have been weird not for him to be involved, especially since he loves musicals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4b6ecc1cf58df42caf717650b3544ea923aa2d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4b6ecc1cf58df42caf717650b3544ea923aa2d6/0_376_5563_3338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The company rehearsing A Pacifist\u2019s Guide to the War on Cancer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The company rehearsing A Pacifist\u2019s Guide to the War on Cancer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Ainslie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, she came up with the idea of a narrative in which someone is trying to write a guide to cancer, for which reason she must poke around inside the kingdom of the sick \u2013 a concept she borrowed from the US intellectual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jan/19/politics\" title=\"\">Susan Sontag</a>, who in her 1978 book, <em>Illness as Metaphor</em>, suggests that we are all of us born with two passports: one for the kingdom of the well, and one for the kingdom of the unwell. \u201cThis narrator poses the question: why don\u2019t we know about illness until we have it? But then, her kid gets sick, and everything changes: her pragmatism, her ability to be non-emotional about it. It\u2019s very funny and it\u2019s very silly in places, but it\u2019s also quite sad. My work\u2019s always like that. It\u2019s super-bonkers. It starts as a musical, but it ends up being just a lot of people sitting in a room talking about death. That\u2019s what it\u2019s really about: death. It deconstructs itself. In the end, the stage gets cancer, and the performers are pushed off it, and into the auditorium.\u201d It sounds clever. \u201cWell, I\u2019m a clever person.\u201d Kimmings, you soon gather, doesn\u2019t go in for false modesty.</p> <p>What particularly fascinated her about cancer? \u201cI was interested in people who\u2019ve caused their own cancers. There\u2019s a character in the show who smokes while he\u2019s ill. I was interested in Li-Fraumeni syndrome [a hereditary predisposition to cancer]. There\u2019s a character in the show who has it, and she\u2019s pregnant and thinking: \u2018Do I keep this baby?\u2019 I was interested in people who look for miracles, in the way cancer can make you non-rational. And I\u2019m very interested in afterwards. Earlier, you asked Judith if she was well again. She is, but that doesn\u2019t mean she is ever going to be the same again. She\u2019s never not going to have had cancer. That\u2019s a very important theme in the play.\u201d</p> <p>Dimant is nodding. \u201cEveryone wants you to go back to normal, but you never do, even if you look the same, wear the same clothes. The impetus to work with Bryony became even stronger after being ill because I suddenly thought: I\u2019ve got to do something completely different. I\u2019ve had an amazing career, but I\u2019ve still got so much to give to something else.\u201d Does the show replicate some of her own experiences? \u201cIt is very, very accurate.\u201d They both hate the language of cancer: the talk of courage, of battles won, or lost. \u201cOur characters aren\u2019t brave,\u201d says Kimmings. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that choice. Cancer is outside their control. That\u2019s what\u2019s so terrifying about it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/03/national-theatre-rufus-norris-second-season-experiment-new-generation\">Rufus Norris's National Theatre ushers in new generation of writers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To say that all this has been an intense experience for them both is an understatement. As they worked on the show, Dimant underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery (sometimes, Kimmings accompanied her); meanwhile, Kimmings had a son, Frank, who was diagnosed with epilepsy when he was just a few months old (he is the main reason she\u2019s glad not to be appearing in it herself; she no longer wants to go on the road). It has made them close, and they are certain they\u2019ll work together again: Kimmings wants to do a musical in which all the performers are in their 80s; Dimant wants to make a piece about suffrage.</p> <p>For Kimmings, though, this is also a gear change; plucked from the smaller fringe venues she\u2019s used to filling, her creation will soon land bang, smack in the National Theatre. (Every theatre with whom, early on, they shared the work wanted to stage it; she and Dimant chose the National simply because \u201cit is the biggest\u201d.) Does she feel under pressure? I can\u2019t tell if she is being blithe, or merely pretending to be. \u201cI feel under pressure when people talk to me about budgets,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, <em>whatever</em>. But I don\u2019t come from a world where this was my dream. I didn\u2019t start making small studio pieces so I could have a musical at the National, so it\u2019s not blowing my mind.\u201d She pauses, has a little rethink. Ah, so she <em>was</em> pretending. \u201cLook, I\u2019m really pleased about it, of course. I\u2019m super-psyched. Fuck, yeah, I\u2019m excited. I hope it gets bigger and bigger, and goes into the Olivier [it will be staged first in the National\u2019s smallest space, the Dorfman], and then into the West End. That\u2019s what should happen.

It closes, as all the company\u2019s programmes close, with <em>Revelations</em>, a full-company work danced to spirituals and song sermons. Created by Ailey in 1960, <em>Revelations</em> is an expression of sorrow, longing and trust in the divine. It brings us joy, but from a hard place; the songs on the soundtrack were sung by slaves.</p> <p>The evening opens with Rennie Harris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.alvinailey.org/performances/repertory/exodus\"><em>Exodus</em></a>. Like <em>Revelations</em>, it is an acknowledgment of human frailty and charged with the belief of a better world to come. Harris makes hip-hop dance of thrilling intricacy. To a pulsing fusion of house and gospel music, the dancers ripple across the stage, led by the charismatic Jamar Roberts. Footwork flows; shoulders, torsos and hips are galvanised into liquid and independent articulation. But the piece opens and closes with horror. Freeze-frame images, like onlooker footage, of a man shot dead. And we are reminded that in 2015, the year Harris made <em>Exodus</em>, more than 100 unarmed black men were killed by American police officers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not about virtuosity, it\u2019s about the physical crafting and fine-tuning of emotion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The dream of transcendence, of deliverance from oppression and life\u2019s sorrows, is echoed in Ronald K Brown\u2019s African-inflected <a href=\"https://www.alvinailey.org/performances/repertory/four-corners\"><em>Four Corners</em></a>.

  "<p>A grimly efficient but somewhat depressing horror picture pits a trio of housebreaking youngsters against a blind war veteran. Sound design is cranked up to a nerve-shredding overload as the teenagers negotiate creaking floorboards and crunching glass to try and escape the deadly old man with a gun. The camera lurches towards a sledgehammer above a workbench, leaving us in no doubt that it will be employed in some horribly gory way later on in the film. But while the director, Fede Alvarez (who was responsible for the 2013 remake of <em>The</em> <em>Evil Dead</em>), pushes all the torture porn tension buttons, it\u2019s hard to care much what happens to any of the highly unsympathetic cast.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76yBTNDB6vU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/76yBTNDB6vU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76yBTNDB6vU\">Watch the trailer for Don\u2019t Breathe.</a></figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p><strong>The Archers (</strong>Radio 4) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07tc1rp#play\">iPlayer</a></p> <p>There is really only one audio story this week: the trial of Helen Titchener. Sit down, dear listener, for there will be wobbling. Even sporadic Ambridge visitors, like me, have been gripped, flipped and twisted. Rollercoastered. The culmination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/25/how-the-archers-abuse-story-helen-rob-titchener-has-divided-fans\">the slow-burn story of Rob\u2019s domestic abuse of Helen</a> \u2013 the kind that \u201cdoesn\u2019t leave any bruises\u201d, as Kirsty, Helen\u2019s best friend, shouted out during her testimony \u2013 has lifted <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qpgr\"><em>The Archers</em></a> out of the old-fashioned minutiae of country life and into contemporary problems that can affect anyone, anywhere. Weirdly, <em>The Archers</em> is now.</p> <p>Helen is facing a charge of attempted murder. She stabbed her husband Rob during an argument that blew up when she tried to leave him. The ins and outs (sorry) of the stabbing are not what the trial is truly about, however. It\u2019s about everything around the knife, the lives that led up to that horrible domestic scene. Yet how can the full story be told when even Helen is unsure about what happened? How can anyone feel sane when they\u2019ve been convinced that they\u2019re mad for so long?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Shame is such a humiliating emotion. It keeps people in the wrong relationships for years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The stage is set. But despite the emotion, the drama, <em>The Archers </em>still manages to irritate. Pat and Tony \u2013 Helen\u2019s parents \u2013 flap and stage-whisper during the trial. They make everything about them. Shutting up and listening would have served their daughter better, then and now. Still, they\u2019re better than Rob\u2019s parents. Domineering, hateful Bruce; snobby, wheedling Ursula: a family therapist\u2019s golden ticket. You sense that Ursula and Rob\u2019s lives were not lived with much joy, back when they shared a house with Bruce.</p> <p>And the main characters? On day one, Rob (boo, hiss) gave a bravura performance, his recollection of the stabbing culminating in \u201cseeing my own eye reflected back at me in the side of the saucepan\u201d. Odd detail, I thought: like a Cluedo clue. (Can someone check on the shininess of the Titchener saucepans? If they\u2019re dull, he\u2019s a liar!) On day two, Kirsty, a prosecution witness, shouted out everything she wanted to say: \u201cHe\u2019s the worst kind of abuser!\u201d Go Kirsty! Pat, though, felt she\u2019d failed Helen, as did old friend Ian on day five. Our adversarial court system is inappropriate in such cases. Words and facts can be twisted every which way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7283b163576dcf5728f277e8aaf2e0d0f236aeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7283b163576dcf5728f277e8aaf2e0d0f236aeb/0_190_2498_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob in the dock, with Helen looking on.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boo, hiss\u2026 Rob in the dock, with Helen looking on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Julia Quenzler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On day three, Helen took the stand and revealed, for the first time, that Rob had raped her repeatedly. Shame is such a humiliating emotion. It keeps people in the wrong relationships for years. Day four: Rob\u2019s counsel used Helen\u2019s words against her. Day five: Rob\u2019s ex-wife testified, in support of Helen. Bruce started shouting, the courtroom was cleared. Up and down\u2026 and then the trial nearly ended because a juror tweeted about what was going on. This led to much frenzied <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcthearchers?lang=en-gb\">real-life tweeting</a>: surely the BBC couldn\u2019t put us all through a retrial? Luckily, no: day six gave us Rob back in the stand, smoothing his way through all the \u201cdefamatory allegations\u201d made by his two wives. Maybe there\u2019s something about him that\u2019s attractive to needy, unstable women, he said. Maybe there is, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/coercive-reationship-helen-tichener-archers-domestic-abuse\">Are you in a coercive relationship like Helen\u2019s in The Archers?

Assuming the total included the deposit, I signed. </strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cI discovered that the initial \u00a3139.91 had not been ringfenced so the total hire charge was \u00a3346.32. I called both companies who said that, since I had signed the contract, there was nothing to be done. It turned out that Goldcar had charged me an extra fee for a premium insurance policy, which was not mentioned by the Goldcar agent.\u201d</strong></p> <p><strong>SM of London has a similar tale. \u201cI am an experienced traveller and have an annual insurance waiver and always refuse \u2018supercover\u2019 (or whatever the hire company name their excess). </strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cThe Goldcar agent in Marseille. did not even try to sell me cover as I showed him my annual waiver policy. He said my status as a regular Goldcar hirer meant he did not need a deposit. </strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cHe mentioned the fuel deposit and asked me to sign an electronic pad. When he printed the contract he covered the charges section with a map. He then folded the contract and, just as he passed it to me, thrust a white sheet of paper at me and said I needed to sign. </strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cI have no idea what the paper actually said. Only later did I discover that \u20ac74 had been debited from my account to pay for \u2018supercover\u2019 insurance. Goldcar has fobbed me off by saying I got benefit from the \u2018supercover\u2019 even though I did not ask for it and they will train their staff better.\u201d</strong></p> <p><strong>CB of London used Goldcar on a 12-day trip to Italy. \u201cWe had paid for a car through Holiday Autos and I took out extra insurance with insurance4carhire.com as a precaution. We were asked to produce the credit card we had used on collection of the car. </strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cThe Goldcar agent never mentioned any extra insurance. However, when we received our credit card statement we found an extra \u00a3207.46, including Super Relax Cover.\u201d</strong></p> <p><strong>RM of Cambridge also found himself paying \u00a360.78 for Super Relax Cover when he hired a Goldcar vehicle in Bologna. \u201cI was told I didn\u2019t have the choice and would have to query it afterwards. I have come to realise that this is a common problem in multiple Goldcar locations.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Indeed it is. Car hire desks will do their darnedest to flog extra insurance because agents earn a commission.</p> <p>Goldcar is a notorious offender \u2013 so notorious they have been on a PR mission to reassure the public that they are mending their ways. And who are they blaming? Why, customers in their ignorance and the third-party websites through which they book. \u201cGoldcar is aware of the problems,\u201d says a spokesperson. \u201cIt is taking measures to educate customers about insurance requirements and the different options. It is also working with intermediaries to improve transparency regarding bookings through their sites.\u201d</p> <p>Goldcar is hardly telling the full story. These intermediaries may be less than helpful to customers who find themselves paying twice for insurance, but they include in their prices all legally required insurance \u2013 collision damage waiver, third party cover and theft protection.</p> <p>However, Goldcar tells me that it offers the only comprehensive cover on the market, by which it means that its policy covers any excess payable.</p> <p>Customers who choose not to buy it have to pre-authorise a deposit of at least \u20ac950, although it would seem many are not offered this option. And some Goldcar customers report that they are told that unless they buy it, they cannot hire the vehicle.</p> <p>Again, Goldcar blames third-party websites. It says: \u201cWe know it is hard for some intermediaries to control the information displayed as they work with thousands of affiliates, but unfortunately this is their responsibility. We hope this will improve soon.\u201d</p> <p>Goldcar refuses to refund any of the customers above, stating they all signed the contract agreeing to the extra charges and these were clearly explained. So, the next time you\u2019re at a car hire desk, no matter how late the hour or long the queue, always make sure you understand what you are signing and query any unexpected costs.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/13/huxley-great-dynasties-aldous\">Thomas Huxley</a> knew a thing or two about the White Cliffs of Dover. \u201cWith vast needles and pinnacles standing out in the sea, sharp and solitary enough to serve as perches for the weary cormorant, [they] confer a wonderful beauty and grandeur,\u201d he wrote in an essay which he simply titled <em>On a Piece of Chalk</em>.</p> <p>For Huxley, a 19th-century pioneer of evolutionary biology, the white stuff was the perfect substance to demonstrate Earth\u2019s antiquity, made up, as it is, of microscopic, calcified creatures whose powdery remains give us the means to record events and express ourselves artistically. It even gave the country its name, Albion, from <em>albus</em> the Latin for white \u2013 a reference to the White Cliffs of Dover.</p> <p>So where better to sample a new national walking route than the chalk cliffs near Dover? The place that helped define the nation and the site of a recently opened section of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/26/england-coast-path-step-closer\">England Coastal Path</a> which, by 2020, will allow outdoor enthusiasts to walk round the 2,790 miles of the nation\u2019s shoreline. This journey will begin at the Scottish border near Bamburgh and take walkers down to Kent and the white cliffs, then along the south coast to Lyme Regis and to Land\u2019s End before heading up to Chepstow \u2013 for a brief break to enjoy the 870-mile Wales Coast Path \u2013 before rejoining its England Coastal Path at Queensferry and then heading to its northwestern extremity at Gretna. According to Nature England, this will be the longest continuous coastal walking route in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad68256f143c20c3a2d709a0caa7db6892fe1580\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad68256f143c20c3a2d709a0caa7db6892fe1580/0_138_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sea kale on the pebbles at Sandwich Bay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green shoots: sea kale on the pebbles at Sandwich Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wouter van Caspel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of these sections will absorb existing paths that are being tarted up to the standards of a national trail while completely new sections are being constructed. My walk \u2013 from the National Trust\u2019s White Cliffs reception centre to Sandwich \u2013 would take in both refurbished path and new track and is part of the newly opened Kent section of the coastal path.</p> <p>And although only a few miles long, the section covers a startlingly diverse and strikingly beautiful chunk of countryside. The White Cliffs, in mid-summer, burst with colour and wildlife: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/16/alys-fowler-knapweeds\">greater knapweed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/24/plant-of-week-scabiosa-blue-jeans\">scabious</a>, lady\u2019s bedstraw, wild mignonette, sea kale, wild marjoram and thyme providing a multicoloured home for marbled white, chalkmill blue, skipper and meadow brown butterflies.

Patches of bare chalk protrude all along the coastal path here and reveal how painfully thin is the soil layer that supports its plants and wildlife.</p> <p>Nor are the cliffs immutable. Their chalk crumbles at a fairly substantial rate, eroding at an average of a centimetre a year. Every so often a giant chunk collapses into the sea. And for a coastal path this could be bad news. You cannot have the ravages of natures regularly wiping out chunks of your pathway.</p> <p>Fortunately, the new trail, which was launched in 2007 by the then environment secretary David Miliband, has been established so that Nature England will have the power to rebuild, further inland, any path lost to erosion. In addition, land between the coastal path and shore can now be used for recreation, for example, picnics \u2013 a right that was also established when setting up the Coastal Path\u2019s legislation.</p> <p>With its spectacular plant and insect life, together with the hustle of Dover, the world\u2019s busiest passenger port, behind you and the sight of the Calais coastline to your right, this first section was the most intriguing part of our six-mile walk. It is an exhilarating stroll which, after a couple of miles, takes you to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/20/churchill-wartime-tunnels-dover-national-trust\">Fan Bay Deep Shelter</a>, a gun battery cut out of the Kent chalk in 1941 that allowed Britain to shell enemy shipping in the Channel. Recently restored by the Natural Trust, its tunnels, scrawled with 40s graffiti, also provide access to a First World War sound mirror, a giant concrete dish which focused sound waves, rather than radio waves, as a not-very-successful method for detecting incoming planes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"183e518bcc70a2d6cdabf4ffa4b2f4ea8df6cc3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/183e518bcc70a2d6cdabf4ffa4b2f4ea8df6cc3d/0_134_5174_3106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walmer Castle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ancient stones: Walmer Castle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bailey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/south-foreland-lighthouse\">South Foreland Lighthouse</a>, you head down steeply to St Margaret\u2019s at Cliffe and head north to Deal and Henry VIII\u2019s Walmer Castle which later provided a home for Pitt the Younger and the Duke of Wellington (who died there). From Deal, the path then follows the coast to Sandwich along a beach made of steep shingle. The pace here is slow and heavy though the place is not without its fascinations, the coast being rich in populations of waders and wildfowl.</p> <p>Two thirds of the way to Pegwell Bay, the path used to turn east to Sandwich, but now has an extra three miles of route added to it to take walkers round the peninsula at Shellness and down the River Stour to Sandwich, creating a series of new ponds and reserves that are already being colonised by egrets and other wildfowl. It is a stunning little thoroughfare bursting with history and wildlife and as pleasant a few miles as I have ever walked.</p> <p>Chalk one up to the coastal path.</p>",
  "<p>The news will come as little surprise to weary parents used to wrangling with household budgets: while first-time students, newly empowered with their university loan, feel confident they can manage their money over the year, the reality is often very different.</p> <p>New research shows that despite their best intentions \u2013 nine out of 10 students think they can deal with their finances effectively \u2013 most spend it all before the end of term. More worryingly, according to the study by the University of Sheffield and Comparethemarket, one in every nine blow a term\u2019s loan of about \u00a32,700 within two weeks.</p> <p>With newly attained independence, coupled with the draw of nights out and unexpected bills, many students have to turn to their parents for financial assistance.</p> <p>Dr Thomas Webb, a social psychologist from the University of Sheffield, says the research shows the gaps which exist between intentions and actions. \u201cThey go into the year with good intentions to spread their money out, to make it last, make sure they eat healthily \u2013 and they feel confident about doing so. But the research indicates, and a lot of anecdotal information suggests, that students really struggle and get into debt,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So what can students do to keep their finances in shape throughout the academic year?</p> <h2><strong>Choose the right bank account</strong></h2> <p>With the first term approaching, so do the offers from banks attempting to lure customers in. Free NUS cards, National Express Coachcards and cashback from selected retailers are just some of the sweeteners that come with new accounts.</p> <p>Both Halifax and HSBC, for example, are offering interest-free overdraft facilities of \u00a33,000. Having an overdraft is, in the absence of another cash buffer, a useful facility in case of unforeseen events. It will, of course, have to be repaid, warns Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts. \u201cThere is a huge danger of racking up a large amount of debt and not being able to pay it back when the time comes, which is why students should do everything in their power to use [an overdraft] sparingly and do their best to earn additional income to reduce what they owe,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The perks that come with accounts should be viewed with scepticism to ensure they are the right fit, she adds: \u201cSome perks are just gimmicks and don\u2019t really give much value to the longevity of the account. Two of the most lucrative incentives to entice students would be a railcard (available from Santander) or a coach card (from NatWest), as these will reduce the cost of travelling across the country for family visits or even mini trips.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Watch the house deposit</strong></h2> <p>Comparison site Money.co.uk says 40% of students lose an average of \u00a3164 when they move out of their private rented accommodation, mostly down to failing to leave it clean and tidy.</p> <p>Landlords concur, saying that in more than half of cases this is down to properties not being cleaned to a high enough standard. Other students lose out when they don\u2019t sign a detailed inventory on moving in, leaving them open to financial loss if there are disagreements about the contents when they move out.</p> <p>\u201cLandlords are not the enemy \u2013 students must make sure they keep the property in a decent state so that there\u2019s no reason for their landlord to keep their cash. This is money students will be relying on getting back,\u201d says Hannah Maundrell of money.co.uk.</p> <p>Needlessly losing money from a deposit will be especially frustrating for anyone grappling with spiralling rents, especially in the capital. The cost of halls for a week now stands at \u00a3226, according to Shelly Asquith of the National Union of Students. \u201cThat is not sustainable for most people,\u201d she says. The union offers advice to students who have problems with their tenancy and advises them to check with students\u2019 unions for a list of credible landlords.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would definitely warn against going down the path of payday lenders and loan sharks</p> <footer> <cite>Shelly Asquith, NUS</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Do a trial run</strong></h2> <p>For an 18-year-old who has just moved out of home, dealing with a budget can lead to simple yet unsurprising pitfalls. Webb points out that something as simple as using an oven for an hour can cost many multiples of using the rings on a cooker \u2013 a minor cost which can mount up, and one that may not be noticed by a teenager.</p> <p>\u201cBecause these people are managing their finances for the first time, one of the things I think would really help is to give them experience of doing so. With three weeks to go, maybe students who are going to university should be encouraged to go to the supermarket to see how much food costs, and to see the costs of energy bills,\u201d he says, adding that energy monitors be used to accurately show the cost of appliances.</p> <p>Jody Baker of Comparethemarket says avoiding corner shops and instead going to supermarkets can also result in useful savings, while student discounts should be pursued with rigour.</p> <h2><strong>Get the right cover</strong></h2> <p>It is estimated that the average student has possessions worth almost \u00a33,400 when phones, laptops and printers are added up alongside their other belongings. Insurer Endsleigh, which was created to service the student market, warns that relying on family home insurance may not give the right level of cover. \u201cDeciding what to take from home to university can be daunting \u2013 favourite possessions along with the right kit can amount to a lot of stuff that\u2019s worth a lot of money,\u201d says Sara Newell from the insurer. \u201cIt is vital that students starting university feel safe in their accommodation, and secure in the knowledge that their valuable items are protected.\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Break it up and budget</strong></h2> <p>Budgeting for outgoings should be a given when trying to ensure there is money left at the end of the term \u2013 not always easy when student loan instalments typically come in three stages throughout the year. Although there is a campaign to get this changed to a monthly payment, students have been advised to do it themselves in the meantime. \u201cMove your lump sum into another account and send yourself a standing order each week or month,\u201d says Baker.</p> <h2><strong>What to do if trouble strikes</strong></h2> <p>The NUS says half of students have difficulties in paying their rent. Some succumb to payday lenders, which Asquith says aggressively target students in the period before their next loan cheque arrives, when they can be in financial peril. Some students succumb and can then be subject to the aggressive interest fees which are attached to this type of borrowing.</p> <p>\u201cI would definitely warn against going down the path of payday lenders and loan sharks. There are a significant proportion of students, based on our own data, who are accessing these loans and it is obviously very high risk, with a high level of interest,\u201d Asquith says.</p> <p>In case they do find themselves in financial difficulties, students are advised to approach advisors at their university and see what financial support may be available.</p> <p>\u201cOften there are things like bursaries and emergency loans that you can access if you need to put a deposit down on something,\u201d Asquith says.</p> <h2>\u2018ALL OF US HAVE MONEY WORRIES\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"469c461f3e138fd236675d4d551cf207db3cb5f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/469c461f3e138fd236675d4d551cf207db3cb5f6/46_31_353_353/353.jpg\" alt=\"Daizy Dervishali\" width=\"353\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daizy Dervishali</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Daizy Dervishali and her friends, money worries are an ongoing subject.

All of my friends that are at uni stopped going out at the end of last year because they couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe majority of the time I don\u2019t see them because they\u2019ve all got jobs.\u201d</p> <p>While she is confident she will be able to keep her budget on track for her final year, she is less sure of when she will be able to repay her student loans - possibly not until she is in her mid- to late-30s - well past 2030.</p>",

It\u2019s the embodiment of the Spanish carmaker\u2019s 20-year quest to create a usable family saloon that goes like the absolute clappers; a car that\u2019s as easy to use as a pair of slippers one minute, as resolute as a sprinter\u2019s spikes the next. It has a gurgling turbocharged petrol engine that generates 290bhp (that\u2019s a lot) and whips you to a top speed of 155mph, slamming you to 62mph in just under 6 seconds. It\u2019s a car for which adjectives like \u201cblistering\u201d, \u201cballs-out\u201d and \u201chooning\u201d were created. So why am I stuck axle-deep in a muddy field in Wiltshire\u2019s <a href=\"https://cvhf.org.uk/\">Chalke Valley</a>? Top speed about 2mph\u2026</p> <p>Well, clearly, the best way to test a high-performance saloon is to take your mother-in-law to a charming history festival where the car park is doing its best impression of a First World War battlefield. And I have to say the race-tuned Seat put in a memorable performance. I blipped the throttle and its low-pro race wheels sent showers of gloopy mud over the volunteers pushing us out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638d1c75727fb176983cb2af9f038ae86139f2ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638d1c75727fb176983cb2af9f038ae86139f2ac/0_215_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside story: the interior of the Seat Leon Cupra complete with squared-off steering wheel and suede bucket seats\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the interior of the Seat Leon Cupra complete with squared-off steering wheel and suede bucket seats</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back on the tarmac the Leon quickly settles down to doing what it does best. Seat\u2019s engineers have fiddled about beneath the bonnet so that performance from the engine (it\u2019s the same 2-litre used in Golf\u2019s GTi) has been maxed out. This means that with a flick of a rubbery button you can snap out of everyday mode and opt for dynamic handling and white-knuckle acceleration. It certainly spices up your trip to the supermarket.</p> <p>Seat\u2019s sports division takes its name from Cup and Racing. The \u201cCupra\u201d programme was launched in 1996 after the brand won the World Rally Championship. The word Cupra is also, apparently, the name of a fertility goddess worshipped by the ancient Etruscans. My mother-in-law was more impressed by this historical reference than my talk of its tweaked 2-litre boy-racer power plant.</p> <p>The Leon Cupra is a wonder to drive \u2013 the engine may have been beefed up but it hasn\u2019t been overwrought. It\u2019s not some twitchy stallion. Squeeze the throttle and the power grows smoothly in a wonderful and satisfying crescendo. Chassis control and progressive steering add to the pleasure.</p> <p>All good then? Yes, except for one thing: the price. It\u2019s jarringly expensive. The list price is \u00a328,380, but add some metallic paint and a decent sound system and you soon soar past 30 grand. I spend a lot of time marvelling at how much disposable income other people seem to have, but it seems wildly indulgent to blow that much on a saloon racer \u2013 no matter how good it is in the mud.</p> <p><em>Email Martin at </em><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\"><em>martin.love@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\"><em>@MartinLove166</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Dame Sarah Storey, who knows a thing or two about track cycling, did say that Kadeena Cox was going to smash her rivals out of the Velodrome in the C4-5 500m time trial. Tempting though it was to suspect that Storey was trying to lure her younger team-mate into a false sense of security, her prediction was spot on. By the end of Cox\u2019s ride, it was worth a check to see if there were any bike-shaped holes in the roof of this boisterous, sweaty arena.</p> <p>Over at the Olympic Stadium, Hannah Cockroft was making a successful defence of her T34 100m title, a victory that was impossible to greet with anything other than a shrug of the shoulders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/09/hannah-cockroft-paralympics-rio-2016\">Cockroft\u2019s superiority in wheelchair racing </a>meant that her third Paralympic gold was never in doubt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/paralympic-debut-triathlon-team-gb-rio-lauren-steadman-alison-patrick\">Paralympic debut for triathlon sees Britain going for gold in Rio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It could not match the tension in the velodrome, where Cox survived the stress of waiting until the final ride before becoming the first British Paralympian to win medals in two sports in the same Games since Isabel Newstead in 1988. Her second racked up the track team\u2019s sixth gold from these Games.</p> <p>Cox, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/09/paralympics-2016-day-two-live?page=with:block-57d32bdee4b08465d44ff1c0\">who claimed bronze in the T38 100m on Friday night</a>, must have felt jittery by the time she got on her bike. Storey, who became the most successful British female Paralympian of all time when she won her 12th gold on Thursday, was in third place after clocking a time of 37.068sec. China\u2019s Jianping Ruan had moved above the defending champion with a Paralympic C4 record of 36.557. Jufang Zhou, a Chinese C5 rider, was therefore looking at gold after setting a world record of 36.004.</p> <p>The stakes could not have been higher. The target looked unreachable. It seemed that Cox had a mountain to climb; she had run a 100m race the night before. Later she would admit to being physically and mentally exhausted.</p> <p>In keeping with Storey\u2019s prediction, however, Cox did not just beat Zhou\u2019s time, she smashed it. Cox, a 25-year-old from Leeds who was a budding able-bodied sprinter before she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis following a stroke two years ago, looked shaky at the start line. She finished in 34.598sec.</p> <p>There were doubts that she could pull it off. She only took up professional cycling 18 months ago and divides her training time between Leeds and Manchester. Her coaches have told her to pick one sport in the past, but she wants it all. She was moved into a tougher classification in athletics but still finished third in the 100m. \u201cI said two years ago in my hospital bed I would go to Rio and now I have done that,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI have showed that whatever the setbacks in life you can do it. I never expected this.\u201d</p> <p>There could be more to come. Cox is in the 400m and 4x100m relay in the athletics and the road race in the cycling. Her stunning ride meant that Storey finished outside the medal places in Paralympic track cycling for the first time since 2008.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/11/more-gold-team-gb-day-three-paralympics-rio-2016-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52g58\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2708378\"            data-video-name=\"More gold for Team GB on day three of the Paralympics \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"Channel 4\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d50282e4b013613fffc178\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/09/11/160911ParalympicsHighlights_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/09/11/160911ParalympicsHighlights_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/09/11/160911ParalympicsHighlights.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/11/more-gold-team-gb-day-three-paralympics-rio-2016-video-highlights\">More gold for Team GB on day three of the Paralympics</a> <a href=\"http://channel4.com/paralympics\">Live coverage from Rio starts from 1pm on Channel 4</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Cockroft, who claimed Britain\u2019s fifth gold in athletics, is the Storey of wheelchair racing. The 24-year-old from Halifax was too fast for her team-mate, Kare Adenegan, who was delighted with her silver medal.</p> <p>Adenegan, a 15-year-old from Coventry, ended Cockroft\u2019s seven-year unbeaten run by pipping her in the 400m in London last year. Not this time. Cockroft was unstoppable, managing a Paralympic record of 17.42sec, while Adenegan clocked a personal best of 18.29sec. \u201cKare has never come as close to me before in the 100m,\u201d Cockroft said. \u201cShe pushed a brilliant race.\u201d</p> <p>Cockroft\u2019s victory was Britain\u2019s third gold on day three in Rio. There was no reason for Megan Giglia to be disappointed after she missed out on a second cycling medal in the C1-3 500m time trial, while Louis \u201cRocket\u201d Rolfe finished fifth in the men\u2019s C1-3 1km time trial despite briefly rising to second place in the standings. China\u2019s Li Zhangyu won gold with a world record time of 1min 6.678sec.</p> <p>Competing in her first Paralympics, Giglia won Britain\u2019s first gold in Rio on Thursday, dominating the 3km individual pursuit. She was on her way to collecting her second gold after posting a world record time of 41.252sec but was pushed into fifth place. Alyda Norbuis of the Netherlands won gold with a C2 world record time of 36.908sec.</p> <p>In the swimming, Britain\u2019s Ellie Robinson, the 15-year-old who won gold in the S6 50m butterfly, finished fourth in the S6 50m freestyle final. Robinson was inspired by watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/01/ellie-simmonds-gold-medal-paralympics\">Ellie Simmonds win gold in London four years go</a>. They were in the pool together last night. But Simmonds finished sixth.</p> <p>Alice Tai, a 17-year-old swimmer from New Milton, finished third in the S10 100m backstroke to claim her first Paralympic medal.</p>"
