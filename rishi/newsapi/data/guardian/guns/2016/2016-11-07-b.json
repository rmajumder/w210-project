  "<p>When Emojipedia founder Jeremy Burge sent his fiancee to the wrong side of London for dinner, he sent an apologetic text message. He received an emoji-less reply: \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWe all know that\u2019s not what it means at all. That means \u2018it\u2019s not fine\u2019,\u201d he said, pointing out that emoji have infiltrated language so deeply that their absence from that message carries a meaning that we all understand. Once considered a nerd topic, emoji have now become a mainstream medium, Burge says \u2013 and San Francisco\u2019s first Emojicon conference seems to agree.</p> <p>Hundreds of adults (and surprisingly few children) turned up for sessions including Emoji Karaoke, where participants had to translate the lyrics of pop songs such as Call Me Maybe into strings of emoji; emoji spellcasting, which revealed how modern witches have embraced technology; and a specialist emoji balloon artist whose biggest request was the poop symbol. There was even a stall selling <a href=\"http://emojibator/\">Emojibator</a>, a vibrator in the shape of the aubergine/eggplant emoji.

She concluded that there was no intention to actively exclude people, but that the icons did align with a belief that inadvertently marginalizes people \u2013 the belief that technology is neutral.</p> <p>\u201cEmoji may seem trivial, just silly little faces, but when you aren\u2019t represented by something that\u2019s so widely used, it\u2019s a problem. The values either intentionally \u2013 or unintentionally \u2013 baked into the systems we use on a daily basis can deeply impact people and how they navigate their world,\u201d said Miltner, a PhD student at USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, who conducted extensive interviews with, and analyzed hundreds of emails from, the Unicode Consortium, the official body which standardizes emoji.</p> <p>Both Unicode and its partner, the International Organization for Standardization, approached their task as a technical process, Miltner said, to encode the characters originally created by Japanese telecoms firms and avoid \u201cthe messy politics of representation\u201d. Yet there is no such thing as a neutral or apolitical technological system.</p> <p>\u201cDesign and engineering choices are made by people \u2013 people who have belief systems, who work for organizations that have belief systems, and who direct their products to a market or a set of consumers who have certain belief systems,\u201d said Miltner. \u201cThis is not necessarily bad \u2013 it\u2019s just how things are.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eea38e8e662fd52f99fc2cdf7b845d62b43ce76c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eea38e8e662fd52f99fc2cdf7b845d62b43ce76c/287_0_657_394/500.jpg\" alt=\"Apple worked with the Unicode Consortium to introduce more diverse emoji\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple worked with the Unicode Consortium to introduce more diverse emoji.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cInvesting in the idea that technology is neutral ignores and even erases the influence of engineers, designers and the organizations they work for. When this happens, it often works out that marginalized groups \u2013 people of color, LGBTQIA folks, differently abled people \u2013 are not taken into consideration because they are not considered to be the default, or the norm.\u201d</p> <p>The author <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/157837-in-this-country-american-means-white-everybody-else-has-to\">Toni Morrison</a> once said: \u201cIn this country, \u2018American\u2019 means white. Everybody else has to hyphenate.\u201d Hosiery, clothing and bandages sold as \u201cskin tone\u201d are typically the colour of white skin, Miltner said, because whiteness is considered the default skin in the western world. The same happens with gender and sexual orientation; until 2015 the family emoji represented a heterosexual, white-skinned couple with two children. \u201cWhen people say default or standard that usually means western, white and usually male,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Miltner says we need to think beyond binary interpretations of gender and race, especially in technologies that \u2013 however \u201ccute\u201d or \u201csilly\u201d \u2013 are used by millions of people worldwide. </p> <p>\u201cIt behooves us all to acknowledge the power and politics that are involved in the formation of widely used technologies, especially if we are to move beyond the \u2018default\u2019 and towards more inclusivity.\u201d</p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>After tomorrow\u2019s US election, whoever emerges as the winner will inherit an economy in a much better state than the one Barack Obama took control of eight years ago. But a number of issues remain \u2013 not the least being that if history is any guide, the winner will have to deal with a recession.</p> <p>Fortunately it seems most likely that Hillary Clinton will win the election tomorrow. And clearly her winning would be better for the US (and world) economy. While you can debate about the worthiness of Clinton\u2019s tax and economic plans, it\u2019s pretty clear that in Trump the USA would have an historically corrupt, incompetent and erratic president \u2013 not something you want when the office involves nuclear weapons and oversight of an economy of around 150 million jobs. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/nov/07/investors-fear-president-donald-trump-economy-volatility-recession\">Analysts fear 'volatile' economy \u2013 and perhaps recession \u2013 under Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With that caveat, let us look ahead to what the new president will have to deal with.</p> <p>Firstly those who champion the Obama presidency most generally look at the unemployment rate. At 4.9% it is well below the 7.8% it was in January 2008, when Obama took the oath of office, and half the 10% peak reached later that year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA unemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XJf0L/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But, as in Australia, the US unemployment rate hides some important details \u2013 including the decline in the participation rate. </p> <p>In February 2008, when the US unemployment rate was also 4.9%, the participation rate (the percentage of adults either working or looking for work) was 66%; now it is 62.8%.</p> <p>The impact of this can be seen in the employment to population ratio. While the unemployment situation is now back roughly where it was prior to the GFC, the level of the US population employed remains worse \u2013 indeed it is worse than it was when Obama became president:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA employment to population ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uzRUL/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But it is not all bad news. A major cause of the decline is not a weaker economy, but (again, as in Australia) an ageing population. </p> <p>While the overall level of the adult population in the US who are employed is worse now than in January 2008, the proportion of 25-54 year olds is actually higher (though still below the pre-GFC high):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA employment to population ratio changes (Jan 2007=100)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kww9f/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Obama government (and the Clinton campaign) has also made great note of the fact that employment in the USA has now grown for 73 straight months \u2013 a post WWII record. </p> <p>But that record hides that the level of growth has been weaker than in other similar recoveries. While there has been now six years of employment growth, all up that has only seen 11% more employed in that time \u2013 well below the six year peak growth of 16% observed under Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, or the 21% during the Reagan-Bush years, let alone the massive growth of the 1960s:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA 6 year employment growth (non-farm)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eVYLo/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The employment growth also points to a big issue for the next president \u2013 one that has been a key issue of the election \u2013 the hollowing of the middle class.</p> <p>As in most nations, education is a key determinant of employment in the USA. </p> <p>While the overall unemployment rate is currently 4.9%, for those with a bachelor degree or higher it is just 2.6%. For those with some college education, or an associate diploma, the rate is 3.8%. The rate for those who only have a high school diploma is 5.5%, while it is 7.3% for those who didn\u2019t even finish high school.</p> <p>So the situation is better the more educated you are. But in the past four years something odd has occurred. The proportion of people without a high school diploma who have a job has increased \u2013 to the point where it is now back to the level it was prior to the GFC. But the proportion of those employed at all other levels of education remains worse than in the past:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA employment to population ratio by education (Jan 07=100)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/anPQs/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"440\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So there has been a bit of a boom for the lowest paying jobs and jobs for workers with high levels of education faired best through the GFC. But for those in the middle have fared the worst. </p> <p>Not surprisingly then, despite the ongoing employment growth, wages in America are growing poorly \u2013 it\u2019s now nearly five years since average earnings grew by more than 3% in any 12 month period:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA average weekly earnings - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FuYpL/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So to an extent the issues of the USA economy are of a kind with Australia \u2013 ongoing but weak employment growth, weak wages growth, and an ageing population.</p> <p>But there is another wrinkle for the new president. </p> <p>Since world war two, the USA has had 11 recessions, and in the past 40 years there were five recessions in 1980, 1981-82, 1990, 2000 and 2007-09:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"USA Annual GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YkxSX/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The next presidential term ends in 2020. By then it will have been 11 years since the end of the \u201cgreat recession\u201d \u2013 well within the usual time frame for another recession. </p> <p>Right at this moment a recession isn\u2019t on the cards. The US economy is improving just enough that the US Federal Reserve is even thinking about raising interest rates. But if the next president gets through the term without experiencing a recession it will have been quite an achievement.</p> <p>While economic issues will be ever present, as ever politics will do its best to make things just that bit worse. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/the-big-con-what-is-really-at-stake-on-election-day\">The Big Con: what is really at stake in this US election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both candidates have economic plans that would increase the US government debt.

The celebration was not bad either, lying on the ground while his team-mates squirted drink into his mouth to re-enact one of the more infamous nights involving England\u2019s players. \u201cOnly he could have done that celebration,\u201d Southgate says. \u201cI mean, how does it even cross your mind? \u2018Oh yes, got to do the Dentist\u2019s Chair.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>That goal will feature prominently in the video montage the Football Association has put together, on Southgate\u2019s request, for England\u2019s players before Friday\u2019s World Cup qualifier and an occasion the caretaker manager is absolutely determined will not pass with the opposition having a better understanding of the sporting enmity that exists between the sides.</p> <p>One story Southgate recalled was of the Wembley crowd cheering Patrick Kluivert\u2019s consolation goal in England\u2019s 4-1 defeat of Holland, their next match at Euro 96 after the Scotland win, on the basis it meant the Dutch qualified on goal difference at the expense of Scotland. The video regales England\u2019s finest moments against the old enemy, going back to the 1930s, with an unapologetic bias that means the players will not be getting a history lesson about Jim Baxter\u2019s ball control or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/nov/12/euro2000.sport2\" title=\"\">Scottish invasion of Wembley, 1977</a>. It does not, Southgate confirmed, feature \u201cany keepy-uppies or anybody sitting on the crossbars\u201d.</p> <p>Southgate, it may be no surprise to learn, was not among the players who accompanied Gascoigne to a Hong Kong club, having been given a free night by Terry Venables, and were photographed, in various states of disrepair, strapped into a leather chair while tequila was poured down their throats.</p> <p>The man now angling to become England\u2019s full-time manager is willing to admit it was a close call. \u201cThat was the night Terry had cut the squad,\u201d Southgate says. \u201cHe had left out Ugo [Ehiogu], Wisey [Dennis Wise], Peter Beardsley and a couple of others [Rob Lee and Jason Wilcox]. I had got pally with Stuart Pearce and I said to him: \u2018We\u2019re having a night out with the lads.\u2019 He said: \u2018Nah, in my experience of England if you go out for a drink it\u2019s as if nobody has ever drunk before in their lives \u2013 my advice is swerve it.\u2019 I\u2019d just got in the squad. Sometimes advice like that is good.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years on Southgate bristled slightly when it was put to him that England, post Euro 2016, and Scotland, 18 years since competing in a major tournament, had never met with the two teams at a lower ebb. \u201cHistory sometimes paints a slightly rosier picture of the past,\u201d he countered. \u201cThere have been tournaments in the past when we haven\u2019t qualified. There have been matches and tournaments, when I was growing up, with defeats that were considered the worst-ever.</p> <p>\u201cI was with Gordon Taylor [the chief executive of the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association] on Saturday and he said: \u2018I can remember 1950, losing to America, and everybody was saying the same thing then.\u2019 Maybe we colour the past with a different view but I don\u2019t think England\u2019s games in the past were always as great as our memories think they were.\u201d</p> <p>The point remains that the qualifier is one England dare not lose on the back of a traumatic few months and, however much Southgate tried to argue his own position was immaterial, it is a huge occasion for him personally given the common perception that he will be offered the job full-time on the back of a strong performance.</p> <p>\u201cThe last game at Wembley was an incredible atmosphere, probably as good as I\u2019ve seen at the new Wembley,\u201d he said, recalling England\u2019s 3-2 win in August 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s a special fixture. These are the games you want to be involved in and, if I go back to my days working as a TV broadcaster, the viewing figures will be five times that of a Premier League game. What more could you want?\u201d</p> <p>Southgate intends to tell his players they \u201chave a chance to make some history or to play in a game that people will remember forever and that\u2019s incredibly powerful. I want them to be aware of that and pitch it in the right way so the performance level is right and we are not over-emotional.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be cool-headed,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s the oldest international fixture, with all the history between the two countries, and, if the players don\u2019t understand that already, \u2013 and I\u2019m pretty sure they do \u2013 we\u2019ll make sure this week they are aware of it. I want the players to understand the importance of the shirt. We have to embrace the emotion of the occasion. Scotland\u2019s mentality for a game like this will be unquestionable. Their spirit will be unquestionable. We\u2019ll have to better that and outplay them.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Marjorie Greenfield has many stories to tell about how employers are failing to create a workplace that encourages women to excel.</p> <p>Greenfield, author of The Working Women\u2019s Pregnancy Book, recalls an interview with a female pilot who worked for an airline that didn\u2019t allow women to fly during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy because of morning sickness and fatigue. The first time the pilot became pregnant, she notified her boss immediately and was taken off work, despite feeling fine.</p> <p>So when she was pregnant with her second child, she kept the news secret until her second trimester so she could continue working.</p> <p>The story of the pilot shows the complexity of finding the right approach to help employees balance work and pregnancy without making them feel unproductive or worse \u2013 less competent. Failing to do so could cost employers significant money: <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-right-and-wrong-ways-to-help-pregnant-workers\">a new study</a> found that the more help a pregnant woman received at work, the more she wanted to quit her job after her baby was born.</p> <p>\u201cThere are unintended consequences of well intentioned efforts to support women,\u201d said Judith Clair, associate professor in the management and organization department at Boston College in Massachusetts and co-author of the study. \u201cSome of those efforts can backfire.\u201d</p> <p>Clair and her three co-authors tracked 120 working pregnant women and had them fill out weekly surveys about their experiences at work. They then followed up with the women nine months after their babies were born to see how the support that they received at work while pregnant influenced their career decisions postpartum.</p> <p>The study found that women who received more help were more likely to develop negative views about their abilities to be working mothers. The type of help mattered. Pregnant women tended to be grateful for practical help, such as getting to leave early for a doctor\u2019s appointment, or being allowed to take a short nap during working hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/15/women-workplace-promotions-raises-mckinsey-leanin-study\">Why your 'personality' is getting in the way of a promotion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More problematic was help that aimed to ease employees\u2019 workload and stress, such as being taken off a challenging assignment when the employee felt capable of taking it on. The negative reaction reflects a psychological theory called the \u201cthreat-to-self-esteem\u201d model, in which assistance can sometimes confirm the fears of people who already question whether they are performing as well as usual.</p> <p>According to the study, women do worry about their job performance during pregnancy and how they will balance competing demands, such as coping with morning sickness while still keeping up their workload.</p> <p>\u201cThese worries and challenges set women up for a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d write the authors of the report. \u201cWhen help is received, women take this as a sign that they can\u2019t keep up any longer.\u201d</p> <p>These worries aren\u2019t unfounded. The stigma of pregnancy in the workplace remains very much alive. Pregnant workers are often seen as a safety risk. There are also more insidious factors at play with how people respond to the pregnant body, and a belief, often unconscious, that a pregnant woman belongs in the home. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/511799?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents\">Studies have shown</a> that pregnant workers are viewed as less competent and dependable \u2013 and more caring and irrational \u2013 than women who are not visibly pregnant.</p> <p>This prejudice has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/24/maternity-leave-discrimination-54000-women-lose-jobs-each-year-ehrc-report\">cost women</a> promotions, or even their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cPeople still have a lot of stereotypes about whether mothers are good workers, and those come into play when women are pregnant,\u201d said Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for Workplace Justice at nonprofit National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cThey may assume, without realizing they\u2019re assuming, that once she gets pregnant, her job is not her priority and may treat her accordingly, and that\u2019s discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>The study focused more on the informal interactions between pregnant women and their superiors and colleagues rather than company policies and support programs for women.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s harder for organizations because it requires companies to increase awareness of managers and colleagues about appropriate and inappropriate interactions,\u201d said Clair. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to track those kinds of behaviors.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/03/constituency-statues-workplace-innovation-mit-google-android-apple-facebook-linkedin\">This little-known state law promotes happy employees and innovative ideas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For instance, one of the study participants met with her manager to discuss her maternity leave and specified when she planned to return to work. Her boss responded by telling her to keep her plans loose because she couldn\u2019t predict how she would feel when the baby arrives and starts to make heavy demand of her time and energy.</p> <p>\u201cHer boss was well-meaning, but he was projecting onto this woman and sending signals about how she was being viewed, creating an environment where she was starting to question herself and how people valued her,\u201d said Clair.</p> <p>It\u2019s not an easy terrain for companies to navigate, said Clair. The study said businesses should instead design programs and management training that allow room for their pregnant workers to have more of a say in the kind of help they receive.</p> <p>\u201cWhat some women truly experience as supportive might be quite different from one person to the other, and these aren\u2019t easily resolved tensions,\u201d she said. \u201cOrganizations should appreciate the complexities and recognize that things we think are well meaning might have ill effects.\u201d</p> <p>The issue gets even more complex in industries where safety and liability are overriding concerns, said Greenfield, who is also the director of general obstetrics and gynaecology at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. But employers don\u2019t have the legal right to decide whether a job is safe or not simply because a woman is pregnant, Martin noted. Rather, it\u2019s up to the pregnant woman herself to assess the risk unless she has the potential to cause harm to people around her \u2013 which one could argue was the case with the airline pilot.</p> <p>\u201cEmployers should not be assuming that women want changes on the job,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIf an employer responds to a pregnancy by taking her off big accounts or assuming she doesn\u2019t want to travel anymore, even if it\u2019s motivated by some desire to help her, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p> <p>While there isn\u2019t research into the costs of retaining pregnant workers versus hiring new candidates, studies show that replacing a salaried employee can cost a business as much as <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/research/documents/retaining%20talent-%20final.pdf\">50% to 60% of the worker\u2019s annual salary</a>. The number<a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CostofTurnover.pdf\"> increases the higher up the position</a>, and replacing a top executive can cost a company 213% of annual salary.</p> <p>Considering women make up<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/qf-laborforce-10.htm\"> nearly half</a> of the workforce and more women are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/31/working-while-pregnant-is-much-more-common-than-it-used-to-be/\">working while pregnant</a> than they did 50 years ago, companies need to figure out the most effective ways to accommodate pregnant employees.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can make an environment that supports women and help them ease back in, they\u2019re going to be more loyal to your institution,\u201d Greenfield said. \u201cThe bottom line is don\u2019t make assumptions. Talk to the woman about what her needs are and be respectful.\u201d</p>",

Key states such as Florida, North Caroline and Pennsylvania will determine who wins the White House.</p> <p>And the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight. Here\u2019s a flavour of our latest news story:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US presidential campaign ended on Monday where the fiercest nomination battles began \u2013 in the rustbelt \u2013 as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent the last hours of a bitter election focused on the country\u2019s deep economic divide. </p> <p>Democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion polls confirmed a small but steady lead for Clinton. Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. </p> <p>But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright.<br></p> <p>Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce Springsteen....<br></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-turnout-latino-vote\">Clinton campaign buoyed by high Latino turnout in election's final hours</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Do stay tuned to our general election liveblog, and we\u2019ll be back in the morning with more market action.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long.</p> <p>Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen.</p> <p>The flip-side is that we don\u2019t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u2019s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u201cmajors\u201d, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.</p> <p>As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u2019 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u2013 potentially Democrat-controlled \u2013 Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u2019t alter investors\u2019 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president.</p> <p>Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c27e4b029b92ca464fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:23:59.316Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Monday has proceeded in a way eerily similar to the scenes before the Brexit back in June. In the run-up to the referendum the markets saw a last minute surge as investors prepared to Britain to remain in the EU, only to suffer a shock when the votes were counted.</p> <p>The market has a bit more time to steady itself before the results of the election are announced; as the US electorate head to the polls tomorrow it will be interesting to see whether investors opt for continued Clinton confidence, sensible stability, or a sharp turn Trump-wards.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209af8e4b029b92ca464f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:19:48.392Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here, courtesy of Nomura, is a look at how the last four US elections played out (timings Eastern time):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a73f9f0865d67d52d3dac649d7dbc2809f8add49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a73f9f0865d67d52d3dac649d7dbc2809f8add49/0_0_1506_671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The last four US elections\" width=\"1000\" height=\"446\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last four US elections</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nomura</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582093ade4b0d073c27d23fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T14:59:00.587Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan - he of <strong><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irrationalexuberance.asp\">\u201cirrational exhuberence\u201d</a></strong> - is critical of both candidates in terms of their economic acumen:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/795637752033181696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Neither candidate has addressed the fundamental problems facing the economy, former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan says <a href=\"https://t.co/EYmHTvbi73\">https://t.co/EYmHTvbi73</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/EoByaWJqNX\">pic.twitter.com/EoByaWJqNX</a></p>&mdash;

  "<h2>The Clinton Crush</h2> <p>In which Donald Trump loses every state with even a hint of Democratic flavor and drops a few big Republican ones too \u2013 the fantasy scenario for every American who yearns for his/her sense of shock and offense at Trump\u2019s candidacy to be reflected in the electoral result. </p> <p>Trump not only loses the big battleground states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, he hemorrhages support everywhere, losing Iowa, losing Colorado, and then \u2013 in the stroke that places the election among the all-time routs \u2013 losing in states where Republicans have simply never lost in the modern era. African American voters in Georgia turn out in Obama-era numbers to defeat him; Hispanic voters do the same in Arizona. In Texas, second- and third-generation Mexican immigrants unite with educated white voters, including a lot of moderate Republicans, to deliver the first Democratic presidential victory in the Lone Star state since Watergate. </p> <p>Clinton even beats Trump in Utah, where pious Mormon voters decide at the moment of truth that no, they cannot vote for a candidate who wants to \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d. Republican leaders get on TV the day after the election and declare that the nomination of Trump was a historic mistake. Thousands of words are spilled haranguing Republicans for nominating a candidate whose appeal to the base may have been strong but who obviously was not a serious contender to lead so great and diverse a nation.

As the night grows late, Trump realizes that he has lost Nevada and Colorado, owing to a strong Hispanic vote against him both places. He has lost Virginia because there are too many people in the DC suburbs who have some actual experience of the federal government and who are horrified to their teeth at the idea of his taking the White House. Surprisingly strong turnout among Trump supporters in the white working-class communities of Pennsylvania has failed to push Trump over the Democratic wall of Philadelphia and its suburbs. But Trump has performed strongly all night in the battleground states that count, winning Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa. </p> <p>And then, luck strikes: Trump picks up a single electoral vote in northern, rural Maine, one of two states that split their electoral votes. Finally, against all odds and the predictions of most polls, he pulls off an upset win in Wisconsin, which has not gone Republican in a presidential election since 1988, but which is more homogeneously white than its neighboring states, where Hillary Clinton ends up having failed to inspire African American voters in Milwaukee to turn up on election day, and where Republican governor Scott Walker\u2019s political machine has once again succeeded.

The people who were supposed to vote for her are voting for her \u2013 women, nonwhite voters, educated white voters \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason she won\u2019t win. But the night has been interrupted, over and over, by signals that have made Democratic eyes twitch. First, the independent voters of New Hampshire have responded to Trump\u2019s late-race momentum, and concluded that no, they\u2019d really rather not have a Clinton dynasty in American politics. They give Trump four electoral votes. Then Trump wins North Carolina, where there admittedly are plenty of white Republican voters, where Republican efforts to quash voting have succeeded and, let\u2019s be honest, if Barack Obama lost it in 2012, how was Hillary Clinton supposed to win it? </p> <p>It gets really white-knuckle, however, when the Colorado result comes in. A large share of voters in Denver\u2019s suburbs are registered independents, and maybe they\u2019ve had the same kind of feeling New Hampshirites have had: enough with the Clintons. So Clinton stalls out at 266 electoral votes. Trump gets to 243. And all eyes are on Florida. Nonwhite voters in Miami haven\u2019t turned up at the polls as they might have. Meanwhile, turnout among white voters in retirement communities has proven absolutely crushing. The Puerto Rican vote around Orlando seems to have failed to materialize. And they\u2019re still counting Tampa and St Petersburg. Then final results in Broward County, where Obama won by more than 260,000 votes in 2012, come in, and the state is clearly Clinton\u2019s. Trump cries foul but nobody can hear him through the cacophony of popping corks.

The election turns out to be close \u2013 closer than anyone would have thought. Maybe Trump wins New Hampshire and makes a sweep of the other battleground states, save Colorado, to produce a 269-269 electoral vote tie. Or maybe Florida, which even in the relatively placid year of 2012 took four days to report its election result, comes down to a razor-thin margin like the one that separated Al Gore and George Bush in 2000, resulting in recounts, fights over <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-lieberman-put-democrats-in-retreat-on-military-vote.html\">absentee ballot postmarks</a>, a refusal to concede on either side and, ultimately, the mother of all legal battles. </p> <p>The 2016 election cycle has proven its ability to soar beyond the human imagination, and surely no mere mortal can comprehend how hairy things could get. The most horrible scenarios appear to lie down the path of an electoral tie. What happens then? Nobody really knows. While the constitution prescribes that Congress shall step in to resolve such a tie, and while <a href=\"http://www.leinsdorf.com/House.htm\">a couple of early 19th-century elections</a> were close enough for Congress to get involved, there really are no applicable precedents. Since presidents are technically chosen by electors who meet to cast formal votes in December, it is conceivable that a so-called \u201cfaithless elector\u201d might break a tie in favor of, say, Clinton, by going against the will of his or her state\u2019s voters. But then Congress must formally count the ballots in January, and if but one senator and one representative disagree with the result, each chamber must vote on the validity of the count. You see where this is going. This is a Congress that cannot so much as tie its shoes, much less leap constitutional hurdles. </p> <p>Would a result ever emerge on the other side? Would the supreme court get involved, again? (When they\u2019re still one justice down? What if they tied, too?) Who would ultimately prove more litigious, Trump or the Clintons? Eesh. Some bridges are better left uncrossed until necessary. Final tally: pass the Scotch. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e459878d2c40f95f315a274eda07c9ad86ac68b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e459878d2c40f95f315a274eda07c9ad86ac68b1/0_0_1290_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Electoral scenario map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"845\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>The Make America Great Again</h2> <p>Britain Brexited. The Cubs won the World Series. And guess what? These things happen in threes. It\u2019s 2016. The age you thought you were living in is yesterday. This is the age of reality television, the era of entertainment uber alles, the time of Trump. And any fool not foolishly attached to her or his notions of the false-glorious yesterday could see it coming. American voters unbothered by the worst of what Trump had to say simply voted for him. But millions of additional voters \u2013 suburban moms, second-generation immigrants who have already paid their dues, Republicans who came to their senses, and men everywhere \u2013 found that when they stepped into the polling booth, they either couldn\u2019t check the box for a relic of America\u2019s political past \u2013 a woman, no less \u2013 or they weren\u2019t as bothered by Trump\u2019s words, and by the actions of his supporters, as they thought. After all, he\u2019s not serious about wanting to deport millions of American residents, just as he wasn\u2019t serious when he said what he did about women, wasn\u2019t serious when he impugned American democracy, wasn\u2019t serious when he said Mexicans were rapists and Muslims were terrorists, wasn\u2019t serious when he called for a nuclear Saudi Arabia and wasn\u2019t serious when he said journalists should be silenced and when he said, over and over, that Hillary Clinton should be in prison. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s big night begins in New Hampshire, continues shortly thereafter in Virginia and North Carolina, rolls through Iowa and Ohio and then \u2013 earlier than anyone could have thought \u2013 through Florida, where he maintains a second home. Nobody can believe it when Trump wins Pennsylvania \u2013 it turns out that African American voters in Philadelphia stayed home, and a surprising number of centrists in the Philly suburbs decided that no candidate who loved golf so much could be so bad. Trump wins Colorado, maybe misses in Nevada and misses in the upper midwest \u2013 but by then he\u2019s over 300 electoral votes, so who cares? Hang the White House with a big gold T, and brace yourselves for whatever may be.

But I think it is the proper role of government to wait and respect the judgment we get from the supreme court, full stop.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis rejected calls from several MPs for the government to hold a vote on triggering article 50 before the supreme court judgment.</strong> It was right to wait until the supreme court issued its decision, he said. But he told the Conservative <strong>Nicky Morgan</strong> that, although he could not agree to her proposal for an early vote on a one-line article 50 bill, he was \u201cvery tempted\u201d by the idea. And when <strong>Peter Bone</strong>, a Conservative, said the government should just hold a vote on a resolution backing triggering article 50, Davis said that the government was not proposing that, but that the Commons itself could decide to have a vote. He also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative powers generally, not least because they cover decisions like going to war.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, although the high court ruling implied that the government had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article 50, the supreme court ruling could say something different.</strong> He was responding to questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the government to trigger article 50, or whether just passing a resolution (a quicker, easier process) would be enough if the government loses its appeal to the supreme court.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He defended the independence of the judiciary, although he refused to condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their article 50 ruling. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of pillars of our democracy, one of them is the independence of the judiciary which we have maintained for centuries, and one of the others is the freedom of the press which we are still maintaining after centuries.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said some of the online trolls who have attacked Gina Miller, the woman who brought the article 50 case, should be prosecuted.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me comment on the issue of Gina Miller.

In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire, he used much of the same language that he did in his Today interview (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/07/labour-wants-brexit-plan-but-will-not-block-artice-50-outright-starmer-says-politics-live?page=with:block-58203b7de4b029b92ca46369#block-58203b7de4b029b92ca46369\">9.26am)</a> but he also went marginally further in saying that Labour would not block the triggering of article 50. He told the programme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have accepted the mandate. There was a clear mandate on 23 June to leave the EU. Article 50 triggers that process, and therefore we are not going to frustrate that. But we are going to argue very loudly and very strongly for the government to disclose its plan so that we can debate it and try to reach agreement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if there were any circumstances in which Labour would vote against triggering article 50, he replied: \u201cWe are not going to frustrate the process.\u201d Was that a no, he was asked. \u201cYes\u201d, he replied.</p> <p>But he also confirmed that Labour might try to amend the legislation allowing the government to trigger article 50.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it is legislation, then of course there might be amendments put down.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he gave some indication as to what those amendments might cover. This is what he said when asked about possible amendments.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are clear that we need the fullest possible access to the single market, that we should be in the customs union, and that there should be special arrangements for Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because, in two respects, it goes further than <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-gives-theresa-ultimatum-9204393\">by Jeremy Corbyn in his Sunday Mirror interview</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-position-tom-watson-article-50-brexit-a7400976.html\">by Tom Watson in his Radio 5 Live interview yesterday.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer says Labour wants UK to stay in customs union.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He says the Brexit deal should include special arrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Starmer\u2019s comments about not blocking an article 50 bill imply that, if Labour\u2019s amendments on, for example, the customs union were voted down by the government, it would not vote against the bill as a whole at third reading.<br></p> <p>But his words are also an open invitation to Tory MPs who favour a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit to vote with Labour in favour, for example, of an amendment saying that staying in the customs union should be a priority.</p> <p>Starmer also said in his interview that Labour accepted that the Brexit talks would have to involve some curbs on freedom of movement. But he suggesting that protecting the economy was more important than controlling immigration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I accept also that freedom of movement, and changes to the way freedom of movement rules operate, have to be part of the negotiation. What I want is for the government to aim high, to put the economy and jobs first, of course to negotiate on freedom of movement, and get the best possible outcome. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer suggests protecting the economy more important than curbing immigration in Brexit talks.</strong></li> </ul> <p>This is significant because over the summer Theresa May indicated that, for her, controlling immigration was the number one Brexit priority (although recent comments from the government, perhaps influenced by the economic impact assessments ministers have been reading, suggest that business interests are increasingly seen as pre-eminent.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd7e2c3f499693301a553e9de0deb1a475d7b35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd7e2c3f499693301a553e9de0deb1a475d7b35/59_0_707_424/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Keir Starmer.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Keir Starmer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58205dfbe4b029b92ca463d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T10:57:17.267Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are two statements in the Commons this afternoon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/795576345162027009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2 statements from 3.30pm - your guess is as good as ours on actual titles 1.

He has identified three.</p> <p>First, the UK government should have been more ambitious.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First: we under-bid. In fact, though we had plenty of media and party political tactics, we went into the talks without a sufficiently clear strategy for change in Europe. Cameron\u2019s brilliant 2013 Bloomberg speech \u2013 envisioning sweeping EU reform (but not mentioning immigration ironically) \u2013 was incrementally distilled down to a less ambitious opening bid in the renegotiation. Even some European leaders suggested more ambition. As one diplomat put it, \u201cIn Europe, we ask for 10 things in order to get 6, you ask for 4 things to get 4. Why?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Second, the politicians gave officials too much power.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The second mistake: we outsourced political decisions to UK and EU civil servants, who, naturally, are more cautious about what\u2019s achievable. Between June and mid-autumn 2015, the most substantive discussions were conducted between officials from the UK, European Commission and European Council. These \u201ctechnical talks\u201d were meant to be purely legal but were in reality at least in part political, with options effectively being taken off the table.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, third, the government ran out of time.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The third mistake: we got timed out. European partners knew we were very unlikely to walk away from the table at the EU summit in February this year as that would kill a June vote. That self-imposed deadline hurt our leverage.</p> <p>The two year time-table contained in Article 50 is, arguably, the government\u2019s biggest challenge in achieving a successful Brexit. Control over the clock equals leverage. The government should jump at any opportunity to build in more time.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is his conclusion.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If there is one rule for a Conservative prime minister in EU talks it\u2019s probably that you can get more than your civil servants claim, but less than your backbenchers think.

The article was headlined \u201cJeremy Corbyn gives Theresa May ultimatum: Agree to Labour\u2019s Brexit terms or I\u2019ll force election in spring\u201d, although Corbyn\u2019s own quotes did not put it as starkly as that.</p> <p>Then yesterday <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-position-tom-watson-article-50-brexit-a7400976.html\">Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, seemed to give a different messsage when he appeared on Radio 5 Live. </a>He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hold this up. The British people have spoken and article 50 will be triggered when it comes to Westminster.\u201d</p> <p>This morning Starmer was on the Today programme. Broadly he was taking the Watson view, saying at least twice that Labour would \u201cnot frustrate the [article 50] process\u201d. But he also said four times that Labour would \u201cnot simply vote down article 50\u201d, implying its support for article 50 was conditional, and that it would only back triggering article 50 if the government gave certain assurances.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course we must have discussions about [the terms of Brexit]. We can\u2019t have a vote in a vacuum. And we can\u2019t proceed with this approach where the prime minister says I hold all the cards for the future of the UK in Europe, and its relationship with Europe, and indeed the world, and I\u2019m not going to disclose even the basic terms to parliament. So of course we need that discussion.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when Starmer was pressed on this, he did at one point say Labour would \u201cnot vote down article 50\u201d without including the word \u201csimply\u201d. He also said Labour would not vote down article 50 \u201ccome what may\u201d (ie, under any circumstances).</p> <p>He said Labour wanted the government to set out its plans for Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want to have the plan before parliament. That needs to be subject to scrutiny ... This is the future of all of us, and the future of our children. We should be proceeding on the basis of a consensus across parliament, not forced divisions. </p> </blockquote> <p>But he left it unclear what Labour might do if the government failed to proved it with the assurances it is seeking. He ruled out blocking article 50 completely, but he did not rule out using the legislation that will have to go through parliament (assuming the government loses its case in the supreme court) to attach some sort of conditions to article 50 approval.</p> <p>I will be covering any reaction to his interview that comes in.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>1.45pm:</em> Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, visits the University of Sheffield, where she will later deliver a lecture on \u201cScotland and the UK: economic policy after the EU referendum\u201d.</p> <p><em>3.30pm: </em>David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is expected to give a Commons statement about the high court ruling last week saying parliament must be consulted on triggering article 50.</p> <p><em>Around 4.30pm: </em>MPs are due to begin a debate on exiting the EU and workers\u2019 rights, the first of several debates being scheduled by the government ahead of article 50 being invoked.

  "<p>This time last week, the last thing Theresa May really fancied was a trade mission to India.

But after the embarrassment of last Thursday\u2019s high court ruling that the government couldn\u2019t invoke article 50 by royal prerogative, India looked a much more attractive destination. Let someone else take the flak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/david-davis-parliament-will-not-dictate-brexit-talks\">David Davis: supreme court may not rule on article 50 until January</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the justice minister, Liz Truss, having gone to ground after taking rather too long to realise that part of her job was to actually defend the independence of the judiciary \u2013 who would have guessed? \u2013 that person was the Brexit minister. As this was the third time in almost as many weeks that David Davis has been made to come to the house to try and fail to persuade MPs that the government really did know what it was doing, it was understandable that Grumpy was at his grumpiest.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to bring back control of our laws to the UK,\u201d he growled. Except for those ones which we don\u2019t trust British judges to adjudicate on in the way we would like them to. Sovereignty has its limits apparently. \u201cThe government came to the conclusion that it was perfectly OK to invoke article 50 using prerogative powers,\u201d he continued. Kindness prevented him from commenting on whether May had made a misjudgment of her own in appointing Jeremy Wright \u2013 a man described by former Tory MP, Stephen Phillips, as \u201ca third-rate conveyancing lawyer\u201d \u2013 as attorney general. \u201cThe court came to a different view and we are disappointed by that.\u201d</p> <p>Disappointment was the least of it. Fury, outrage and humiliation were more like it. But Grumpy was in no mood to back down. Having repeatedly told MPs that the result of the referendum must stand and there should be no going back, Grumpy sounded awfully like someone who was having a major sulk about not getting his way and was going to carry on fighting until he did. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the supreme court, who we believe will tell us we are being proper and lawful,\u201d he insisted. And if the supreme court let him down, he\u2019d go to the supreme supreme court. And if that failed he\u2019d just appoint some judges of his own. Job done.</p> <p>Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit minister, took a more measured tone. He\u2019s in for the long haul and his doctor has told him to watch his blood pressure. \u201cThis is the third statement you\u2019ve made and we are still none the wiser,\u201d he observed. Grumpy had failed to condemn the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph for their attacks on the judges; he had failed to explain the government\u2019s contingency plan in the event of it losing its appeal; he had failed, end of.</p> <p>There was no way Grumpy was going to condemn the press \u2013 it\u2019s always easier to overlook a bit of homophobia and racism when they\u2019re coming from your own supporters, so he went back to his default setting. Anyone who tried to stop the government from doing exactly what it wanted was trying to thwart the will of the people and was therefore an enemy of the state. There could be no question of the government revealing its negotiating strategy \u2013 not least because it doesn\u2019t have one \u2013 as it would undermine its already ropey position. The idea that the government has already given away a key bargaining position by declaring it will invoke article 50 before the end of March, doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to Grumpy.</p> <p>MPs from both sides of the house invited the government to put forward a resolution to invoke article 50, in order to allow the house to prove its concerns on this issue were over parliamentary sovereignty and not to delay Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. \u201cNo,\u201d snapped Grumpy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to the supreme court and that\u2019s that.\u201d Giving parliament any say in Brexit would be the thin end of the wedge. Give MPs an inch and they\u2019ll take a mile.</p> <p>Could Grumpy give any hint of what transitional arrangements might be made if, as everyone expects, the EU negotiations cannot be concluded within two years? No, he bloody well couldn\u2019t. They were a secret which was his. The more reasonable the request, the grumpier Grumpy became. By the time the speaker concluded the session, a fuse had blown and Grumpy had become almost entirely monosyllabic. Yes and no. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure which. But one of the two. Definitely, maybe.</p>",
  "<p>Janet Reno, who has died aged 78, was the first woman attorney general of the US. Appointed by Bill Clinton in 1991, she served throughout his two terms of office, the second longest tenure in American history. It made her a figure of stability in a cabinet often in flux and frequently rocked by the steady stream of partisan attacks on both President Clinton and the first lady, Hillary Clinton, most notably the Whitewater investigation.</p> <p>Never part of Clinton\u2019s inner circle, Reno displayed great independence, and her courage to stand behind decisions she felt were right often left her vulnerable to critics from both sides of the political fence. Her controversial decisions included the assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas; the return of the six-year-old Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez to Cuba; the anti-monopoly prosecution of Microsoft and a racketeering lawsuit against the tobacco industry to recover the healthcare costs of treating smokers. Each time she would stand behind her actions publicly, often quoting Harry Truman\u2019s \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Miami, she was the daughter of two of the city\u2019s journalists. Her father, born Henry Rasmussen, came to the US as a child from Denmark; his parents reportedly chose the more American name Reno from a map. He worked as a crime reporter on the Miami Herald for 43 years. Her mother, Jane Wood, was a reporter on the Miami News, and a naturalist famed locally for wrestling alligators. When Janet was eight and she and her three siblings moved to a home on the edge of the Everglades, her mother built their new house herself.</p> <p>Janet was debate champion at Coral Gables high school and left Cornell University in 1960 with a degree in chemistry; commentators sometimes noted her almost scientific approach to both the law and to the facts of a case. She graduated from Harvard law school in 1963, one of only 16 women in her class, but when she returned to Miami she was turned down by the city\u2019s most prestigious firm, Steel Hector &amp; Davis. After opening her own firm, in 1971 she was appointed counsel to the Florida state house of representatives\u2019 judicial committee and, in 1972, she lost in a race for a state house seat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54261e91884b88f036ea4a1a34c0150089e44f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54261e91884b88f036ea4a1a34c0150089e44f7c/0_26_1005_603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Reno with Bill Clinton as she is named the new attorney general during a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janet Reno with Bill Clinton as she is named the new attorney general during a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But she was offered a job by R<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/us/richard-e-gerstein-dead-at-68-prosecuted-key-watergate-figure.html\">ichard Gerstein</a>, the state attorney for Dade County, which includes Miami. She informed Gerstein that her father thought he was a crook; he replied that that was why she had been offered the job. Although she left the office briefly in 1976, when offered a partnership by the same firm who had rejected her 13 years earlier, she returned, and when Gerstein retired she was appointed to his job, a difficult one given Miami\u2019s high crime rate and racial conflicts.</p> <p>She prosecuted a number of high-profile child abuse cases where doubts over convictions led to changes in the ways such cases were handled. Most tellingly, she brought charges against five white policemen for beating a black insurance salesman to death. Their acquittal in 1980 (by a judge and jury in Tampa) sparked rioting in Miami during which 18 people died. Reno resisted calls for her resignation, instead working for improved relations with the black community.</p> <p>Bill Clinton offered Reno the attorney general\u2019s post after his first two choices, Zo\u00eb Baird and Kimba Wood, both withdrew because they had hired undocumented immigrants as nannies.</p> <p>Before she had taken office in 1993, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-david-koresh-1457125.html\">David Koresh</a> and his Branch Davidian sect of the Seventh Day Adventist church began a showdown against federal agents seeking to search their Waco compound for illegal weapons. Ten people, including four agents from the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were killed when they tried to serve a warrant in Feburary. In April, Reno ordered a full-scale assault on the compound in which Koresh and 75 other people, many of them children, died. She was criticised fiercely by the right, for murdering American \u201cpatriots\u201d, and by the left for claiming she feared children were being abused by the Davidians. Reno took full responsibility; in 2004 she said that \u201cthe tragedy is we will never know what was the right thing to do\u201d.</p> <p>In 1994 Reno appointed a special prosecutor, the Republican <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/us/man-in-the-news-aggressive-prosecutor-robert-bishop-fiske-jr.html\">Robert B Fiske</a>, to investigate the Clintons\u2019 real estate deal known as Whitewater, but Fiske was viewed by the right as too bipartisan, and Congress empowered an independent counsel, George HW Bush\u2019s former solicitor general <a href=\"http://\">Kenneth Starr</a>, to replace him. Starr\u2019s investigations ran for five years, resulting in the impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton for lying about his sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. In the middle of Whitewater, Reno refused to appoint another prosecutor to investigate the Clintons\u2019 campaign financing, saying the was no evidence to justify such calls.</p> <p>Her efforts against Big Tobacco ran head on into powerful voices in Congress funded by the industry in the states they represented. In 1998 she pursued the suit against Microsoft despite critics who claimed the issues were \u201ctoo complicated\u201d for juries to understand.</p> <p>But her political legacy was again sealed by a raid, in the case of Gonz\u00e1lez, the Cuban boy found in an inner tube off the coast of Florida after his mother was one of 10 people who drowned when the small boat in which they left Cuba sank. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s relatives in Miami refused to send him back to his father (from whom his mother was divorced) in Cuba. The boy, who later said he had wanted to return, became a political football, until the family refused to follow a court order, and Reno ordered a pre-dawn raid on their house in which Eli\u00e1n was seized and returned to his father. The attorney general who believed so strongly in the facts and the law was again left with no option but the use of governmental force.</p> <p>Over six feet tall and resolutely lacking glamour, Reno was a figure of cruel abuse on rightwing talk radio, and a somewhat gentler satire on Saturday Night Live, where Will Ferrell\u2019s skits of \u201cJanet Reno\u2019s Dance Party\u201d were a running gag. After leaving office in 2001, Reno showed a more relaxed side to her character by appearing on the show alongside Ferrell.</p> <p>In 2002, Reno mounted a challenge to Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Jeb Bush, but she lost the Democratic primary to Bill McBride.</p> <p>Reno had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 1995. In later years she served on numerous boards, including that of The Innocence Project, and devoted herself to her extended family.</p> <p>She is survived by her sister Maggy. Loretta Lynch, the second woman to serve as US attorney general praised Reno, saying \u201cShe was guided by one simple test, to do what the law and the facts required... regardless of which way the political winds were blowing.\u201d</p> <p><em> </em>\u2022 Janet Wood Reno, lawyer, born 21 July 1938; died 7 November 2016</p>",
  "<p>Tesco Bank\u2019s chief executive Benny Higgins isn\u2019t paid \u00a32.2m a year (plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/20/tesco-bank-boss-benny-higgins-spent-more-than-18000-pounds-on-taxis\">fabulous taxi expenses</a>) on a whim. He commands a banker\u2019s princely pay packet because the supermarket chain intends to be big in banking.</p> <p>Expanding in financial services is a sensible strategy if, like Tesco, you think you have three factors in your favour. First, your brand enjoys greater \u201ctrust\u201d than those of the old institutions that disgraced themselves in the crash, like Higgins\u2019 former employers HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland. Second, the regulatory winds are favourable because politicians are desperate to see a few so-called \u201cchallenger\u201d banks provide some stiffer competition. Third, Tesco Bank doesn\u2019t have any costly branches.</p> <p>That backdrop is important as Tesco Bank suffers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/tesco-bank-freezes-transactions-online-attack\">an online bank robbery</a> that, on the sketchy details to date, looks bigger and more alarming than any recent cyber-attack in the sector. Tesco Bank customers hold 135,000 current accounts. Of those, \u201csuspicious\u201d transactions were seen in 40,000 accounts, with around half seeing cash removed. That\u2019s a lot, which is why Tesco investors\u2019 apparently sanguine view of the affair \u2013 the share price fell only 1% \u2013 is odd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/tesco-bank-freezes-transactions-online-attack\">Tesco Bank freezes transactions after cash taken from 20,000 accounts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The direct cost of reimbursing customers may be merely a rounding error for a company of Tesco\u2019s size but the knock-on effects, in the form of regulatory intervention and criticism, could be severe. Among the bodies who want to know what went wrong are: the Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England, the National Crime Agency and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.</p> <p>It\u2019s odds-on that somebody on that list will insist on root-and-branch reform of the systems to detect and prevent fraud. Tesco, remember, has offered current accounts for less than three years and its IT systems ought to be state-of-the-art because they are relatively new. It is early in the adventure to suffer an attack of this magnitude. A repetition might oblige the bank to retreat to the safer worlds of car insurance and credit cards.</p> <p>Judgment must be reserved until full details are clear. But it seems quite likely the fine for the security breach could easily be bigger than the accumulated profits Tesco Bank has made from current accounts to date. In the shoes of Tesco shareholders, you\u2019d surely want to know more about this failure before assuming it\u2019s a hiccup that could happen to anyone.</p> <h2>Sports Direct: MPs\u2019 visit kicks off further scrutiny</h2> <p>\u201cI have nothing to hide,\u201d Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley declared to the MPs on the business select committee during his appearance in June. Apart, that is, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/six-mps-surprise-visit-sports-direct-shirebrook-warehouse\">the camera that was allegedly hidden in the corner of the room</a> where the parliamentarians took sandwiches on Monday.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s the latest chapter in the Sports Direct saga, each plotline more absurd than the last. As it happens, Ashley was abroad on Monday so, unless he was relaying orders to his staff, he\u2019s innocent of the charge of attempting to bug the MPs at the end of their unannounced visit to the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. But, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/six-mps-surprise-visit-sports-direct-shirebrook-warehouse\">the MPs\u2019 account of events</a> is accurate, somebody authorised the camera wheeze. Wright would be entitled to insist on knowing who. Such matters, however amateurish in execution, are meant to be serious.</p> <p>Either way, the corporate paranoia has probably ensured MPs will refuse to close the book on Sports Direct just yet. It could have been different. A brisk trot around the aisles might have revealed little, allowing the MPs to declare their work to be done and to take their sandwiches back in London. Instead, says Wright, they were received with delays, hostility and \u201cdiversionary tactics.\u201d They\u2019ll be back. Sports Direct, it seems, doesn\u2019t know when to stop shooting itself in the foot.</p> <h2>Volkswagen\u2019s P\u00f6tsch likely to motor on</h2> <p>How is the reinvention of Volkswagen after the diesel emissions scandal going? Not well. German criminal prosecutors have widened their investigation into potential manipulation of the market to include Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the former finance director who was inexplicably promoted to be chairman of the supervisory board.</p> <p>The investigation may come to nothing, of course, but the probe underlines why the appointment of P\u00f6tsch provoked fury among those VW investors who think German carmaker doesn\u2019t understand what proper boardroom reform means. Fund manager Hermes spoke for many at the annual meeting in June when it said it was \u201cstruggling to understand\u201d how P\u00f6tsch, after 12 years as finance director, could be put in charge of a supervisory board whose duties include examining whether claims could be made against former executives.</p> <p>The probe by public prosecuters concerns the timing of VW\u2019s confession to investors that it had used illegal \u201cdefeat\u201d devices to get around emissions tests. As such, it could be deemed secondary to the central question of how the devices were installed in the first place. But secondary does not mean unimportant: VW is aleady inundated with lawsuits that concentrate on the disclosure point.</p> <p>P\u00f6tsch\u2019s continuing presence at the top of the company adds complication on complication. In a rational world, he would stand aside until the German authorities have decided whether to bring charges. But he won\u2019t.</p>",

  "<p>The UK government is fighting a rearguard action to prevent Guernsey, Jersey and British overseas territories from going on an EU blacklist of tax havens.</p> <p>At a meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday in Brussels, David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, will tell his counterparts that the UK opposes attempts to put territories with a zero rate of corporation tax on an EU list of \u201cnon-cooperative\u201d jurisdictions.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/06/britain-under-pressure-opposition-tax-haven-blacklist\">The EU vowed to draw up a blacklist of tax havens</a> following the revelations in the Panama Papers, an unprecedented leak of 11.5m files from the database of the world\u2019s fourth-biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. Brussels pledged to throw light on the shady \u201ctreasure islands\u201d that help multinationals and wealthy clients avoid paying tax. </p> <p>Crown dependencies Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, as well as British overseas territories Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, are among the jurisdictions that have a zero rate of corporation tax, according to the EU\u2019s executive arm, the European commission, in a recent <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/2016-09-15_scoreboard-indicators.pdf\">analysis</a> of risk factors intended to show whether a jurisdiction may be promoting tax avoidance.<br></p> <p>The commission has been leading the charge for greater transparency on tax havens and wants to draw up a list of \u201cnon-cooperative jurisdictions\u201d by the end of next year.<br></p> <p>Brussels officials think that a zero or near-zero rate of corporation tax in a non-EU country should be a red flag for \u201cunfair taxation\u201d. </p> <p>But EU member states are split on whether zero corporate tax rates should count in the criteria for determining whether a country is a \u201cnon-cooperative jurisdiction\u201d, according to draft conclusions seen by the Guardian. The UK, Ireland, Sweden, the Baltic states, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are blocking a plan to put jurisdictions with a zero or almost zero rate on the blacklist.</p> <p>These countries argue that the EU has no right to penalise outside jurisdictions for setting zero rates because corporate tax is not an EU competence. In contrast, Germany and France think zero rates should automatically mean a country is deemed \u201cunfair\u201d on taxation and goes on to the blacklist.</p> <p>The division may frustrate hopes of agreeing the blacklist criteria on Tuesday, as EU tax policy has to be agreed unanimously. <br></p> <p>The UK is also pressing to allow potential blacklistees more time to meet the EU criteria: jurisdictions would be allowed until 2020 to meet all EU rules on transparency, rather than 2017.<br></p> <p>Although the UK is not the only country looking for extra time, London\u2019s support for delays has caused anger, because Britain could have left the EU before the rules would come into effect.<br></p> <p>Sven Giegold, a German Green MEP, said he did not have a problem with the UK raising its voice as an EU member state, but the British government should not be allowed to set deadlines that clashed with the Brexit timetable.</p> <p>\u201cIt is particularly nasty that the UK does not only want to weaken the criteria of the blacklist but also wants a transitional period until [31 December] 2019,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cSuch negotiation strategies are inconsistent [and] unfair during a Brexit process.

It is unacceptable that member states are trying to water down the good draft of the commission.\u201d</p> <p>Aurore Chardonnet, tax and inequality adviser at Oxfam, said the EU would be missing an opportunity by failing to target zero corporation tax rates.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU should be explaining to people that some jurisdictions are providing advantages to some multinationals to help them avoid paying taxes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot only blame the multinationals by doing name and shame. We need to target those countries that are helping those multinationals avoid paying tax. It is not only a matter of secrecy, it is also a matter of the tools they give to those multinationals.\u201d </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the European commission said it would continue to insist on including \u201cextremely low rates\u201d of corporate tax being considered as part of the criteria\u201d, adding that transitional periods should be \u201cas short as possible\u201d.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>When will we know the result?</strong></h2> <p>The US goes to the polls on Tuesday. Results will start to come in on Wednesday from about 11am AEDT (8am in Perth) when some states close their polling stations on the eastern seaboard of the US. Some states with clear majorities for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be called very quickly. Depending on how close it is and how certain key states fall, the final result could be known anywhere between 2pm AEDT and the early evening. Bear in mind that 4pm in Sydney is midnight in New York, so it is likely that Clinton and Trump will speak to supporters sometime late Wednesday afternoon AEDT.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be getting results from Michigan and Pennsylvania from around noon AEDT, though it may take a while to know who has won in either place. If Trump pulls off a surprise in Michigan, he will be in a strong position. The result in Pennsylvania will be a big indicator one way or the other, followed by Arizona, New Hampshire and North Carolina. </p> <p>Many Trump-supporting states will call early. At about 3pm Clinton will win California \u2013 and, if she\u2019s going to win the presidency, this could put her ahead on the day for the first time.

If a candidate wins a state, then that candidate wins all of that state\u2019s electoral college votes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/my-year-with-donald-trump-campaign-2016-election\">My year with Trump: covering a curiosity that became a dark phenomenon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The number of electoral college votes a state gets is based on its population size. A state gets a vote for each of its House of Representatives districts plus two votes for its two senators. The more people in a state, the more members of the House of Representatives it has and the more electoral college votes it has: California has 55 votes, North Carolina has 15, Nevada has six, Wyoming has three, and so on. </p> <p>There are 538 electoral college votes in total. That means the first candidate to reach 270 electoral college votes wins the presidential election. There have been cases in which there is an electoral college tie: in 1800, when Thomas Jefferson finally emerged as president, and more recently, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/06/24/could-veeps-election-meltdown-ever-come-true/\">in the sitcom Veep</a>. In 2016, a tie would likely look more like the latter than the former. </p> <h2><strong>Is it possible to win the popular vote but not the electoral college vote?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. Just as Labor under Kim Beazley won the popular vote in the 1998 Australian election but didn\u2019t win a majority in the Australian parliament, a presidential candidate in the US can win the popular vote but fall short in the electoral college vote. This has happened four times in US history: 1824, 1876, 1888 and 2000, when George W Bush beat Al Gore in the electoral college despite losing the popular vote. </p> <h2><strong>Can Trump really win?</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/american-voters-in-australia-could-have-crucial-role-in-tight-us-election-race\">American voters in Australia could have crucial role in tight US election race</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, he could win, though it isn\u2019t looking likely. In the past week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/trump-campaign-clinton-panic-losing-blue-states\">Clinton\u2019s lead has narrowed</a>, largely off the back of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">the FBI\u2019s announcement that it was reopening an investigation into her email server</a>. Some national polls have even showed Trump drawing even with her. But Clinton has consistently led in the electoral college, and many polls project her electoral college result at 270 or more. Most polls now project Trump at 200 to 215 electoral college votes, making his task of winning 270 more difficult. </p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s a blue state and what is a red state?</strong></h2> <p>Since the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/weekinreview/ideas-trends-one-state-two-state-red-state-blue-state.html?_r=0\">2000 election the US media</a> have used the colours red and blue to depict how states are likely to vote. Democratic states are shown in blue. Republican states are shown in red. Frankly, it\u2019s weird, because red is usually the colour of the left, and blue is traditionally the colour of the right. </p> <h2><strong>If I look at one of those </strong><a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\"><strong>electoral college maps</strong></a><strong>, it looks as though Trump is winning everywhere. There\u2019s a sea of red. What\u2019s going on here?</strong></h2> <p>Trump is winning a lot of states but many of the states he is winning are not full of people. So they have small numbers of electoral college votes. By contrast, Clinton has a \u201cfirewall\u201d of delegate-rich states, including California (55 votes), New York (29), Wisconsin (10), Minnesota (10) and Michigan (16).</p> <h2><strong>What are swing states, and which ones are they?</strong></h2> <p>Swing states are like Australia\u2019s marginal seats \u2013 the ones on a knife edge that can swing between the two parties. Sometimes they are referred to as purple states (a mixture of red and blue). Swing states to watch in this election are Florida (29 votes), Ohio (18), North Carolina (15), Nevada (six), Iowa (six) and New Hampshire (four). Clinton only needs to win all the blue states plus one of these swing states to win the election, whereas Trump needs to win all the red states and all of these swing states to reach 270 votes.</p> <h2><strong>How do Americans actually vote? </strong></h2> <p>There is no consistent method of voting across the US, with each state running their elections. Polling hours will vary by city or county as well. Some states use paper ballots, as Australia does. Some use electronic voting, where it looks as though the voter is using an ATM. Three states \u2013 Colorado, Oregon and Washington \u2013 conduct voting by mail for everyone, though in Colorado voters also have the option of attending a polling place.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/us-election-quiz-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">US election quiz: how much do you remember from the presidential race?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some states use punch card voting, where the voter uses an implement to punch a hole through the ballot paper, which is then read by a vote-tabulating device. (The first time I voted in a US election from Australia, the state of Illinois mailed me a punch ballot, a foam-backing pad and a metal spike so I could cast my vote.) This form of voting gave rise to the term a \u201changing chad\u201d in 2000, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/28/uselections2000.usa2\">Florida\u2019s result was challenged</a> on a number of bases including whether a vote was valid if the punch didn\u2019t seem to go all the way through the paper.</p> <h2><strong>Are Americans only voting for president?</strong></h2> <p>No. Americans are voting for a wide range of measures and candidates:</p> <p>\u2022 Local tax levies \u2013 for instance, should the county impose a tax to provide more funds to the local library?<br>\u2022 State laws, eg, should the state legalise marijuana?<br>\u2022 County officials such as coroners and dog catchers (seriously, yes).<br>\u2022 Judges (yes, they elect judges in America).<br>\u2022 Governors (12 states are voting for governors this year).<br>\u2022 State legislators (like voting for your state MP).<br>\u2022 All 435 members of the federal House of Representatives, elected every two years.<br>\u2022 34 federal senators.</p> <p>Imagine voting for your local council, state government, federal government and in several state and local plebiscites all at once: that\u2019s the equivalent of what Americans are voting for tomorrow. It\u2019s a democracy smorgasbord. </p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s the difference between Congress, Senate and the house? </strong></h2> <p>The Congress is the general term for the entire legislature. The House of Representatives is like the lower house in Australia, and the Senate is like our Senate (in that it is an upper house: it may or may not have its own quirky individuals, \u00e0 la Rod Culleton and Malcolm Roberts). The Republicans are likely to control the House of Representatives, mainly because the state legislatures get to draw their own boundaries and have ensured the districts are as friendly as possible to the Republican party.</p> <p>The Democrats may well control the Senate. It is on a knife edge. If it is tied at 50-50, then the vice-president casts the deciding vote \u2013 meaning the presidential election and the Senate election are two to watch in tandem. </p> <h2><strong>I\u2019m so tired of hearing about Clinton\u2019s emails. Just give me the potted history, quickly</strong></h2> <p>When she was secretary of state (the US foreign minister), Clinton used a private email server to send and receive work emails, rather than use the Department of State\u2019s secure email server.<br></p> <p>Republicans have sought to assert she violated state department protocol as well as federal laws regarding record keeping. The FBI opened an investigation to determine if any of the information was classified. Some of it was. But the FBI determined in July that while Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d it would not recommend charges against her. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s email issues pale in comparison to George W. Bush, who <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/09/23/george-w-bush-white-house-lost-22-million-emails-497373.html\">\u2018\u2019lost\u201d 22 million emails </a>he kept as president on a private email server. But the controversy has dogged Clinton\u2019s campaign, as it fed a perception that she was not an honest person. </p> <p>Last week, 11 days from the election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">the FBI announced it was reopening the Clinton email investigation</a> based on newly discovered information, that is emails on another computer.

In the #blacklivesmatter era, this was a movie the liberal media classes were naturally preparing to get behind, until it became known that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/05/nate-parker-criticizes-press-coverage-rape-case\">Parker had been accused of raping a fellow student</a> while at Pennsylvania State University in 2001; he was acquitted. The complainant later took her own life, in 2012. It should be irrelevant to the question of how good the film is. But it can hardly be set aside, especially for a film with lofty ideals. </p> <p>The news story looms over the film. How to reconcile the two? Richard Brody in the New Yorker boldly tackled the dissonance head on with his comment about <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-cinematic-merits-and-flaws-of-nate-parkers-the-birth-of-a-nation\">the way Parker shows the rapes in his movie</a>. They are \u201cdepicted entirely from their significance to men,\u201d Brody writes. \u201cParker appallingly shifts the scenes around to the male view of the action, and never shows women in discussion among themselves, never presents how enslaved women endure and confront their own oppression.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a7f9bba5e8728fd53cd8dacd534ce6ec868ee6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a7f9bba5e8728fd53cd8dacd534ce6ec868ee6/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nate Parker in The Birth of a Nation, about a US slave uprising.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Counter-reading \u2026 Nate Parker in The Birth of a Nation, about a US slave uprising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jahi Chikwendiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similar kind of real-life counter-reading has been happening for decades with Roman Polanski\u2019s films, to which the director has long made it silently plain he will not concede an inch. Time will tell if Parker must pursue the same course, although their legal positions are different.</p> <p>These cases are quite different from the phoney stories planted by studio flacks from time immemorial, dependent on co-operative artists and a complaisant press. Fixers from the Hollywood golden age like MGM\u2019s Howard Strickling and Eddie Mannix and Fox\u2019s Harry Brand were always creating bogus romances, fake intrigues and hokey life-stories to promote movies or distract attention from brewing scandals. The Coens\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/11/hail-caesar-coen-brothers-eddie-mannix-reel-history-josh-brolin-george-clooney\">Hail Caesar!</a> (2016) and Alexander Mackendrick\u2019s Sweet Smell of Success (1957) have scenes about this seedy byproduct of the fantasy-factory.</p> <p>Press rows sometimes dwarf their films and sometimes they don\u2019t. Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/24/doctor-strange-review-benedict-cumberbatch-marvel-eyepoppingly-freaky-extravaganza\">Doctor Strange</a> was released, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/04/doctor-strange-tilda-swinton-whitewashing-row\">widespread unease</a> about the portrayal of the Ancient One, regendered and reconceived for the movie and played by Tilda Swinton, with a \u201cCeltic\u201d origin. Was the Tibetan identity erased out of deference to the important Chinese market? Very possibly. As things turned out, her weirdness seemed to go beyond national identity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a7221aeb93a282fdf936a85a260000390f29bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a7221aeb93a282fdf936a85a260000390f29bb4/0_0_2096_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phenomenon \u2026 Samuel L Jackson in Snakes on a Plane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will change film-making for ever (or not)\u2026 Samuel L Jackson in Snakes on a Plane</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New Line/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or take a movie that was once the most discussed film of its day, a film which the commentariat regarded with saucer-eyed seriousness as a zeitgeist phenomenon: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/aug/18/1\">Snakes on a Plane</a> (2006). It is difficult to believe now, but this all-but-forgotten Samuel L Jackson thriller about \u2014 well \u2014 snakes on a plane, was once feverishly discussed, because of its much-vaunted but wildly exaggerated status as an internet phenomenon. The producers allegedly incorporated online feedback into production with extra shooting days. Pundits believed that this Wiki-ised technique could be used for all films from then on. But it wasn\u2019t. And when the film turned out to be a bit of a dud, this wall of chatter turned to sheepish silence.</p> <p>The list of dissonant films goes on. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/feb/06/the-interview-video-review\">The Interview</a> (2014) was a film satirising North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that led to hacking attacks, which in turn led to apparently craven industry moves to re-edit the film and limit its distribution. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/10/10000-copies-of-the-interview-to-be-sent-to-north-korea-by-balloon\">resulting hype</a> built the movie up in everyone\u2019s mind as a classic of satire, standing up heroically to both the North Koreans and the cringing producers. When it finally came out, it was clear that it wasn\u2019t that great. It didn\u2019t fit the narrative created for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"588101feb933fbd42879abd4a09c2c4d508aa3b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/588101feb933fbd42879abd4a09c2c4d508aa3b1/0_39_1550_930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not the disaster everyone said it would be \u2026 Titanic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not the disaster everyone said it would be \u2026 Titanic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other films have identities which leaked into the real world of the news: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jun/01/pressandpublishing.usnews2\">Watergate mole</a> took his nickname from the title of the porn film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/11/film.filmnews\">Deep Throat</a> (1972). It wasn\u2019t simply arbitrary. In the Watergate era, when cynicism about a dodgy president was becoming widespread, there was a kind of weird karmic alliance between this blase mood and the new porno chic. </p> <p>Very strangely, in recent times, there has been an attempt to force this kind of branding. In the runup to the Brexit vote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/brexit-independence-day-claim-nonsense-says-david-cameron\">Boris Johnson was bellowing that the referendum would be \u201cindependence day\u201d</a> \u2014 apparently attempting to coattail the publicity of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/21/independence-day-2-resurgence-review-sequel-jeff-goldblum-charlotte-gainsbourg\">sci-fi movie sequel</a> with that name. Brexit was victorious, but no-one remembers Boris\u2019s cheery, lame film-title wheeze.</p> <p>The strangest example of publicity dissonance was that which accompanied the release of James Cameron\u2019s gigantic blockbuster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/05/titanic-review\">Titanic</a> (1997). Of course, this is remembered as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/apr/03/titanic-event-movie-james-cameron\">colossal triumph</a>, which involves a willed amnesia about the huge groundswell of stories before its release about the impending opposite: how terrifyingly unsafe the production was and how brutally Cameron had been driving his cast. There were stories about how Kate Winslet had chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and how she seriously thought she might drown in the tank in which the \u201csinking\u201d scenes were filmed. The narrative was clearly all about how the curse of Titanic was about to strike again \u2026. But it all vanished like snow off a ditch when the film emerged and became a hit.</p> <ul> <li>Allied is in cinemas from 23 November</li> </ul> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2016 because an earlier version wrongly said Tilda Swinton\u2019s scenes in Doctor Strange were shot in Tibet; they were shot in Nepal.</p>",

On Thursday the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/high-court-brexit-ruling-what-does-it-all-mean\" title=\"\">high court ruled</a> that the prime minister was acting unlawfully in seeking to use prerogative powers to invoke article 50, and reminded her that only parliament can make or repeal laws. The court also reminded Theresa May that when it comes to legislation, parliament is sovereign.</p> <p>Then on Friday, Stephen Phillips \u2013 a Conservative MP and a leave campaigner \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">resigned, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d</a> with the prime minister\u2019s approach to Brexit, in particular her desire to sideline parliament and avoid scrutiny.

But we all have a duty to stand up for the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. Many people, myself included, think the lord chancellor has been far too slow and too reluctant to do so.</p> <p>The one aspect of Davis\u2019s statement that was clear was that ministers intend to appeal the high court\u2019s ruling to the supreme court. They are, of course, perfectly entitled to do so. But would it not be better for the government to stand back and ask whether the national interest is really served by spending the next month fighting a high court ruling, while providing no further clarity or accountability on the basic terms of Brexit?</p> <p>The government, however, seems determined to carry on down the same path, adamantly insisting that the executive alone should have the right to trigger our exit from the EU. I have repeatedly made it clear that Labour accepts and respects the outcome of the referendum: there is a mandate to leave and Labour will not frustrate it by voting down article 50. But there is no mandate for the terms upon which we exit, and the stakes are too high for the prime minister to decide this by herself.</p> <p>That is why the government should come clean and put the basic terms of its Brexit plan before the Commons, allowing scrutiny, transparency and challenge. Those are \u2013 along with judicial independence \u2013 central tenets of our democracy. They are also far more likely to lead to the right outcome for all of us and for generations to come.</p>",
  "<p>The belated response of the lord chancellor to the shameful attacks on three senior judges by the Mail, Express and Telegraph (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/truss-and-may-forced-to-stand-up-for-article-50-judges-after-tabloid-abuse\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 7 November) was the bare minimum required of her by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and by her oath of office: to \u201cdefend the independence of the judiciary\u201d. It fell far short of the forceful condemnation which she should have delivered to those who seek to undermine the crucial role of the judges as guardians of our democracy against the abuse of executive power.</p> <p>The fault originates in the 2005 act itself, which robbed the office of lord chancellor of its stature at the head of the judiciary with the added authority of a cabinet minister. By relegating the office to a purely nominal adjunct to the political function of justice secretary, Tony Blair\u2019s government (against the advice of his mentor Lord Irvine) paved the way for a succession of inadequately qualified appointees.

This is a clear statement by government on parliament\u2019s role, found in the \u201cGovernment response to the report on Referendums in the United Kingdom\u201d, comprising a report by the House of Lords select committee on the constitution (HL Paper 99), published on 30 September 2010, replying to the committee report issued on 7 April that year.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldconst/34/3404.htm\" title=\"\">letter to the committee</a>, Mark Harper MP wrote: \u201cI welcome the report \u2026 and, given the profile and importance of the subject, the government has considered its response carefully in light of the recent introduction of the parliamentary voting system and constituencies bill.\u201d</p> <p>In its substantive response to recommendations the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldconst/34/34.pdf\" title=\"\">government asserted</a>: \u201cUnder the UK\u2019s constitutional arrangements parliament must be responsible for deciding whether or not to take action in response to a referendum result.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Downing Street\u2019s response to the high court judgment was to say: \u201cThe government is disappointed by the court\u2019s judgment. The country voted to leave the European Union in a referendum approved by act of parliament. And the government is determined to respect the result of the referendum. We&#xa0;will appeal this judgment.\u201d<br><strong>Dr David Lowry</strong><br><em>Stoneleigh, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Four centuries ago England was engaged in civil war to wrest power from an autocratic king and place it in the hands of parliament. Having been arrested, Charles I was indicted in 1649, offered every opportunity to formulate a defence which he refused (as he believed himself to be above the authority of the courts), tried and found guilty of treason; the punishment for which was execution. He was not assassinated but convicted by due process.</p> <p>England thus began the road to the first modern democracy, whereby the rule of law, as established by the principle of the separation of powers: the executive, parliament and the judiciary, was to prevail in the interests of protecting all citizens; a model to follow by all aspiring democracies.</p> <p>England had no bloodthirsty French-style revolution. No Napoleon, Hitler or Mussolini arose in this land. Nor has extra-parliamentary action ever found traction since. To observe the country\u2019s institutions degenerate into the tyranny of mob rule, whereby Brexiters who won a referendum by 4% feel emboldened to abuse with impunity all that disagree with them, is the most unedifying spectacle one is likely to have witnessed in this country, and profoundly disturbing.<br><strong>Serena Wylde</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The ministerial rhetoric around Brexit is extraordinary and needs to be challenged. According to Boris Johnson, speaking in Berlin, \u201cThe will of the British people was expressed very clearly\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/theresa-may-told-to-act-to-calm-brexit-mob-anger\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 5&#xa0;November). David Davis even said that it was the largest mandate in history because more than 17 million people voted leave. What nonsense, when over 16 million voted the other way!</p> <p>Not only was the referendum purely advisory, but the majority was extremely narrow compared with the two previous UK-wide referendums, about staying in the EEC in 1975 and whether to adopt the alternative vote in 2011 \u2013 both of which produced huge two-thirds majorities in favour of the winning side. The international human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson pointed out in these pages that many countries which have referendums don\u2019t allow change by simple majority. In some a proposal must pass by what Robertson rightly called a \u201cvery clear\u201d majority such as two-thirds (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/stop-brexit-mp-vote-referendum-members-parliament-act-europe\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 28 June). Johnson\u2019s \u201cvery clearly\u201d is a gross exaggeration, as are similar statements by other ministers.An attempt is being made to write the narrowness of the result out of history. It must be resisted.<br><strong>Prof Ron Glatter</strong><br><em>Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Nigel Farage\u2019s words on Sunday\u2019s Andrew Marr programme came dangerously near to incitement to riot. His subsequent decision to lead a march on the supreme court must be seen as an attempt to intimidate our judges. Sadly we are now seeing a rapid and disturbing shift in the centre of gravity of British politics. Mainstream MPs who, until recently, would have fought shy of criticising normal court processes now seem to find it very easy to do so.&#xa0;The prime minister and lord chancellor who, again until recently, would have spoken out clearly and loudly against the kind of press headlines we have seen now seem, for whatever reason, unwilling to do so. For liberals and democrats these are disturbing times.<br><strong>Rev Andrew McLuskey</strong><br><em>Staines-upon-Thames</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p><strong></strong>All eyes are on the race to be the next US president, but the battle to control Congress may be almost as consequential.</p> <p>The next Congress could determine whether the supreme court goes back to having nine justices, whether the USA makes good on its climate promises and whether, for example, Hillary Clinton is impeached, should she be elected president.</p> <p>If the Senate and the House stay Republican and Donald Trump wins the presidency, he would not necessarily have carte blanche. As much as Trump may want to build a border wall with Mexico, he would not be able to spend the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/11/trumps-dubious-claim-that-his-border-wall-would-cost-8-billion/\">estimated $25bn</a> it would cost until Congress legislated for it. (That\u2019s assuming Mexico does not pay for the wall upfront, as Trump has sometimes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\">promised it would</a>.)</p> <p>Trump would likewise need Congress\u2019s help to deport undocumented migrants, slap new tariffs on Chinese goods or fine US companies for moving manufacturing overseas. It\u2019s unclear whether the GOP would back him on these issues. But a quick agreement on issues such as repealing the estate tax and Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law might well be in the cards.<br></p> <p>It is extremely unlikely that the Democrats will seize control of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, owing to an overwhelming, 60-seat Republican majority in the lower chamber.</p> <p>Artful gerrymandering at the state level means there aren\u2019t many toss-up House races this cycle \u2013 only 18 out of 435, according to the <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings\">Cook Political report</a>. Democrats could win every single one of the toss ups and still fall around eight seats short of a House majority. </p> <p>But the Senate is a different matter, with most analysts putting the Democrats\u2019 chances of overcoming the GOP\u2019s current eight-seat majority and taking the upper chamber at about even. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically 50-50,\u201d Harry Enten, a polling analyst with FiveThirtyEight, told CNN on Sunday. \u201cYou have in my opinion maybe six or seven seats that are going to really determine this.\u201d</p> <p>If Democrats controlled the senate, and Clinton were president, the supreme court vacancy could soon be filled \u2013 although Republicans have already hinted at a procedural fight to stop that from happening. </p> <p>As with every aspect of the 2016 election cycle, Trump\u2019s presence is palpable. Some Republican incumbents appear to have been wounded by associations with the GOP nominee. Senator Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire saw her numbers drop after she was asked at a debate whether Trump would be a good role model for children, and replied \u201cabsolutely\u201d.<br></p> <p>If Nevada representative Joe Heck loses his senate bid, analysts will point to the record number of Hispanic voters who lined up in the state to cast early ballots for Clinton (and against Trump). Senator Richard Burr in North Carolina may fall victim to the abandonment of Trump by moderate Republicans in his state.<br></p> <p>In other races, there is no perceivable Trump drag \u2013 and there may be Trump coattails. In Ohio, where Trump and Clinton appear to be neck-and-neck, Republican incumbent Rob Portman is polling 16 points ahead of his opponent, a former governor. And in Missouri, where Trump appears to be crushing Clinton, Republican incumbent Roy Blunt is in a seemingly tight race with the Democratic state secretary of state. In Pennsylvania, incumbent Pat Toomey appears to be running behind his opponent, but not as far behind Clinton as Trump is running in the state.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just very difficult to understand exactly what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Enten said.<br></p> <h2>Races to watch</h2> <p><strong>New York\u2019s 19th congressional district:</strong> Big outside money is trying to block progressive star Zephyr Teachout from making it to Washington. Teachout, a law professor, has strong support from senator Bernie Sanders, but her opponent says she\u2019s a carpetbagger.<br></p> <p><strong>Arizona\u2019s first congressional district:</strong> Republican Paul Babeu, a county sheriff, dropped out of a congressional race in 2012 after an ex-lover, who was also an undocumented Mexican immigrant, outed him as gay and said the sheriff threatened him with deportation if he said anything. Democrat Tom O\u2019Halleran, a state legislator, appears to have the edge.</p> <p><strong>California\u2019s 49th congressional district: </strong>One of the sweetest of all potential pickups for Democrats, because it would send incumbent Darrell Issa, the loathed former chairman of the oversight committee (read: Benghazi), packing. He faces retired Marine colonel Doug Applegate.</p> <p><strong>North Carolina governor\u2019s race:</strong> Will Tar Heel voters make incumbent governor Pat McRory pay for signing the notorious House Bill 2, which allowed discrimination against transgender people in access to public bathrooms? State attorney general Roy Cooper looks strong.</p> <p><strong>California\u2019s senate race:</strong> The moment when state attorney general Kamala Harris, touted as a future national star for Democrats, could step onto the main stage of politics. Representative Loretta Sanchez, like Harris a Democrat, is putting up a fight.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/us-election-voting-polls-mood\">What\u2019s the mood where you are?</a> Share your pictures and views with us</em></p> <p></p>",

Clark pledged that all rights Britain\u2019s workers currently enjoy because of EU membership would be protected and incorporated into UK law as part of the government\u2019s great repeal bill.</p> <p>\u201cNo one listening to this debate should think that we have any intention of eroding the rights that we enjoy in this country through our process of leaving the European Union, because in fact the opposite is true,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be using the legislation before this house to entrench all existing workers\u2019 rights in British law, whatever the future relationship that the UK has with the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Protecting existing workers\u2019 rights after exiting the EU was one of the key \u201cred lines\u201d Labour set out for assessing the government\u2019s approach to Brexit.</p>",
  "<p>My neighbourhood is inundated with feral cats, scraggy wild things that cadge food from animal lovers in winter and cadge baby blackbirds and robins from their nests each spring.

Luckily she was at school when the door slammed on an adorable kitten. Clueless about what I should actually do, for the first time in my life I called the RSPCA. Rather like the first time I needed a hospital and was astounded by the brilliance of the doctors and nurses, <a href=\"http://www.rspcaeastnorfolk.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the RSPCA</a> was amazing.</p> <p>The charity knew all about my street\u2019s cat problem and had caught 20 feral cats so far. I was asked to take \u201c21\u201d to meet an RSPCA officer at a nearby vet, where the kitten was checked (cats are assessed and adults scanned for microchips to ensure they are not pets) and pronounced a feral tomcat.</p> <p>Because 21 is only eight weeks old, he will be found a home as a pet. Adults are neutered and released wherever they came from, which my neighbourhood blackbirds won\u2019t welcome, but feral cats have hard lives and only survive for a couple of years.</p> <p>The RSPCA has now lent me a better trap so I can join other neighbours in helping feral cats and other wildlife, at no expense to the taxpayer.

  "<p>US military scientists have used electrical brain stimulators to enhance mental skills of staff, in research that aims to boost the performance of air crews, drone operators and others in the armed forces\u2019 most demanding roles.</p> <p>The successful tests of the devices pave the way for servicemen and women to be wired up at critical times of duty, so that electrical pulses can be beamed into their brains to improve their effectiveness in high pressure situations.<br></p> <p>The brain stimulation kits use five electrodes to send weak electric currents through the skull and into specific parts of the cortex. Previous studies have found evidence that by helping neurons to fire, these minor brain zaps can boost cognitive ability.<br></p> <p>The technology is seen as a safer alternative to prescription drugs, such as modafinil and ritalin, both of which have been used off-label as performance enhancing drugs in the armed forces. <br></p> <p>But while electrical brain stimulation appears to have no harmful side effects, some experts say its long-term safety is unknown, and raise concerns about staff being forced to use the equipment if it is approved for military operations. <br></p> <p>Others are worried about the broader implications of the science on the general workforce because of the advance of an unregulated technology.<br></p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00589/abstract\">new report</a>, scientists at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio describe how the performance of military personnel can slump soon after they start work if the demands of the job become too intense. <br></p> <p>\u201cWithin the air force, various operations such as remotely piloted and manned aircraft operations require a human operator to monitor and respond to multiple events simultaneously over a long period of time,\u201d they write. \u201cWith the monotonous nature of these tasks, the operator\u2019s performance may decline shortly after their work shift commences.\u201d<br></p> <p>But in a series of experiments at the air force base, the researchers found that electrical brain stimulation can improve people\u2019s multitasking skills and stave off the drop in performance that comes with information overload. Writing in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, they say that the technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has a \u201cprofound effect\u201d.<br></p> <p>For the study, the scientists had men and women at the base take a test developed by Nasa to assess multitasking skills. The test requires people to keep a crosshair inside a moving circle on a computer screen, while constantly monitoring and responding to three other tasks on the screen. <br></p> <p>To investigate whether tDCS boosted people\u2019s scores, half of the volunteers had a constant two milliamp current beamed into the brain for the 36-minute-long test. The other half formed a control group and had only 30 seconds of stimulation at the start of the test.</p> <p>According to the report, the brain stimulation group started to perform better than the control group four minutes into the test. \u201cThe findings provide new evidence that tDCS has the ability to augment and enhance multitasking capability in a human operator,\u201d the researchers write. Larger studies must now look at whether the improvement in performance is real and, if so, how long it lasts.<br></p> <p>The tests are not the first to claim beneficial effects from electrical brain stimulation. Last year, researchers at the same US facility found that tDCS seemed to work better than caffeine at keeping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/19/electrical-brain-stimulation-caffeine\">military target analysts vigilant</a> after long hours at the desk. Brain stimulation has also been tested for its potential to help <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910014667\">soldiers spot snipers</a> more quickly in VR training programmes.<br></p> <p>Neil Levy, deputy director of the Oxford Centre for Neuroethics, said that compared with prescription drugs, electrical brain stimulation could actually be a safer way to boost the performance of those in the armed forces. \u201cI have more serious worries about the extent to which participants can give informed consent, and whether they can opt out once it is approved for use,\u201d he said. \u201cEven for those jobs where attention is absolutely critical, you want to be very careful about making it compulsory, or there being a strong social pressure to use it, before we are really sure about its long-term safety.\u201d<br></p> <p>But while the devices may be safe in the hands of experts, the technology is freely available, because the sale of brain stimulation kits is unregulated. They can be bought on the internet or assembled from simple components, which raises a greater concern, according to Levy. Young people whose brains are still developing may be tempted to experiment with the devices, and try higher currents than those used in laboratories, he says. \u201cIf you use high currents you can damage the brain,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>In 2014 another Oxford scientist, Roi Cohen Kadosh, warned that while brain stimulation could improve performance at some tasks, it made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/09/warning-experimental-brain-boost-equipment-research-oxford\">people worse at others</a>. In light of the work, Kadosh urged people not to use brain stimulators at home.<br></p> <p>If the technology is proved safe in the long run though, it could help those who need it most, said Levy. \u201cIt may have a levelling-up effect, because it is cheap and enhancers tend to benefit the people that perform less well,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>My former colleague Palmer Newbould, who has died aged 87, was a champion of scientific nature conservation, an innovative university teacher and a generous, warm-hearted man with broad interests.</p> <p>His nature conservation work was based mainly in Northern Ireland, where wide-ranging conservation legislation was introduced only in 1965. Palmer served on two statutory committees in the 1970s \u2013 the Nature Reserves Committee and Ulster Countryside Committee \u2013 before becoming chairman of the <a href=\"https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/council-nature-conservation-and-countryside\">Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside</a> in 1989, for which he was appointed OBE. He was also a Northern Ireland representative on the UK\u2019s <a href=\"http://jncc.defra.gov.uk\">Joint Nature Conservation Committee</a> and served on Ireland\u2019s Nuclear Energy Board.</p> <p>Born in south-west London, he was the son of Dorothy (nee Pugh) and Alfred Newbould. His father played a significant role in the early cinema industry and was a Liberal MP between 1919 and 1922. Palmer was educated at Charterhouse school, Surrey, and Balliol College, Oxford. His academic career began as a plant ecology lecturer at University College London in 1955, where he had earlier met Jo, his wife, while they were both botany PhD students. They were married in 1954.</p> <p>Respect for his research on peat bogs and ecosystem productivity led to involvement with the International Biological Programme and appointment as vice-president of the <a href=\"http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org\">British Ecological Society</a>.</p> <p>At UCL he was convener of Europe\u2019s first MSc in conservation, which quickly became the model for similar courses elsewhere. In 1968 he was made a professor of biology at the New University of Ulster (NUU), helping to introduce undergraduate courses in ecology and environmental science, among the first of their kind. His horticultural skills were invaluable in beginning the transformation of the exposed Coleraine campus into today\u2019s wooded landscape.</p> <p>At NUU his good humour, integrity, and interest in the arts as well as the sciences made him a successful, if reluctant, administrator. As acting vice-chancellor during the merger between NUU and the Ulster Polytechnic the trust he enjoyed among colleagues helped bring complex negotiations to a successful conclusion. The merged institution became the University of Ulster (UU) and Palmer became provost of UU\u2019s Coleraine campus.</p> <p>In retirement, in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, he became a trustee of the <a href=\"http://www.nhmf.org.uk/Pages/home.aspx\">National Heritage Memorial Fund</a>, which distributes some of the National Lottery funds, and, with Jo, worked on a project monitoring biodiversity in Mallorca\u2019s S\u2019Albufera wetlands.</p> <p>He is survived by Jo and their children, Elizabeth, Andrew and Susan.</p>",
  "<h2>KLOPP AT THE TOP</h2> <p>Following a weekend of exhaustive poppy-related remembrance ceremonies during which several football matches broke out, Liverpool find themselves on the summit of the Premier League for the first time since May 2014 as the club game pauses briefly for another quiet period of reflection on the next World Cup and the efforts of various countries to qualify for it. The day after imperious Chelsea had swatted Everton aside, Liverpool\u2019s entertainers swashed their particular buckles once again, winning by a tennis score against a Watford side that must have been relieved their match wasn\u2019t the best of five sets.</p> <p>It was the Liverpool many neutrals have come to know and not dislike as much as usual: free-scoring up front, while remaining incapable of keeping a clean sheet in a match where their goalkeeper was far from idle. \u201cIt was a good performance on the pitch and on the stands, so it was a really nice afternoon,\u201d beamed J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who quickly poured icy cold water all over the notion that Liverpool city council should start making plans for an open top bus tour to celebrate the club\u2019s first title win since 1990. \u201cThere are no guarantees,\u201d he laughed. \u201cThe only thing we have is a pretty good football team, so let\u2019s try to use it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-watford\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Liverpool can still improve after thrashing Watford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Klopp\u2019s not wrong. So enamoured are Liverpool\u2019s fans with their pretty good football team, they spent time yesterday singing \u201cif we still had Su\u00e1rez he\u2019d be on the bench\u201d, a song name-checking the star of their most recent brush with title glory, which ended in disaster at Selhurst Park with the man in question covering his face and sobbing uncontrollably at the horror of the shambles that had just unfolded. While several of the players who started for Liverpool that night remain at the club, none are first-choice starters under Klopp. Others have moved on and after a season-long farewell tour in which he enjoyed a longer goodbye than Frank Sinatra, speculation is rife that former midfield general $tevie Mbe could be on his way back to Liverpool now that his time as an LA Galaxy player appears to be over. Galaxy lost their MLS play-off match against Kevin Doyle\u2019s Colorado Rapids on penalties to bring an end to the club\u2019s season. And with Gerrard\u2019s contract due to expire next month and the player having expressed a desire to move back to Merseyside from California, the club are unlikely to offer him another one. The midfielder has previously hinted that a return to Liverpool in some coaching capacity could be on the cards, having already spent 25 years at a club where he won every trophy available \u2026 except one. </p> <p>An occasional pundit with BT Sport, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/jurgen-klopp-steven-gerrard-liverpool-role\">Gerrard has already discussed a return to Liverpool with Klopp</a> and it seems the door is open for a return should he wish to go back. \u201cI\u2019ve got dreams and aspirations of one day going into coaching and management but at the moment I\u2019m nowhere near ready for management,\u201d said Gerrard in January. Now it is believed an apprenticeship spent teaching Liverpool\u2019s youth players to ping 60-yard Hollywood balls out of the training ground could appeal as he completes his coaching badges. </p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Michael Butler brings you the FA Cup second round draw \u2013 live at 7.10pm GMT! </a></p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>\u201cMy brothers are older than me \u2013 I was the youngest, and they used to tease me about a kids TV character called Alf.

Given that I am English, it is of course a source of great discomfort for me to bring this up, but then it is easy enough to suggest that we adopt the less formal second-person singular \u2018you\u2019 rather than that awfully impersonal second-person plural \u2018you\u2019 in our dialogue.

  "<p>Hundreds of bats are being killed in collisions with wind turbines in the UK each month, despite ecological impact assessments predicting that many windfarms were unlikely to affect such animals, according to a new study.</p> <p>All UK species of bats are<a href=\"http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/bats_and_the_law.html\"> protected by law</a>, and ecological impact assessments - carried out before construction of windfarms or other sites - should weigh up the risks for local habitats and wildlife. But new research suggests that such assessments are simply not up to scratch.</p> <p>Using sniffer dogs, scientists at the University of Exeter report that they hunted for bat carcasses at 46 windfarms across the UK, 29 of which had ecological impact assessments available. For 18 of the sites the assessment reported that a windfarm would be unlikely to affect protected species, or an investigation into bat activity was unnecessary. </p> <p>However the researchers found that nearly all of the 29 sites showed evidence of bat activity, while half had seen collisions between bats and wind turbines with estimated death rates of up to 64 fatalities per month, taking into account factors such as possible removal of carcasses by predators.</p> <p>Among the sites flagged as posing a high risk to bats, the authors found that efforts to reduce the impact of wind turbines had had little effect.</p> <p>\u201cThe sorts of mitigation that have been used, like moving the turbine a bit further away from woodland, just wasn\u2019t doing the job,\u201d said Dr Fiona Mathews, lead author of the research that was published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)31188-5\">Current Biology</a>. <br></p> <p>The authors conclude that ecological impact assessments do not adequately predict the risk of windfarms to bats. But it is not clear whether the failings are down to changes in the behaviour of bats after windfarm construction, or are simply down to poor surveying of the area beforehand.</p> <p>\u201cThat is something that really needs urgent attention,\u201d said Mathews. \u201cAt the moment tens if not hundreds of thousands of pounds are paid on infrastructure projects all the time to do ecological surveys with nobody actually doing any follow-ups to see whether they\u2019re effective or not.\u201d </p> <p>As well as improving pre-construction surveys, the authors say that assessments should be carried out after windfarms have been built, while better approaches should be developed to reduce the chances of collisions - such as re-positioning the turbine blades out of the wind at night during periods in the year when bats are most active. More research is also needed into why the bats are flying so close to the turbines, said Mathews.<br></p> <p>But, she adds, wind turbines remain an important source of clean energy. \u201cWhat we want is something that actually works for conservation rather than it just being a box-ticking exercise,\u201d she said. </p>",

All three of them are aware of this arrangement.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) Their father puts a hat on each of their heads and says: \u201cEach of your hats is either red or blue.

Likewise, Bob must be able to see a red hat, or would be able to deduce the colour of his own hat (given Alice\u2019s answer). Hence Charlie\u2019s hat is red.</p> <p><strong>Charlie\u2019s hat is red</strong>. 74.1 per cent of you got it correct. 25.9 per cent got it wrong.</p> <p>(iii) Alice must be able to see two hats of the same colour in order to deduce the colour of her hat. Bob knows this, and so deduces his hat is the same colour as Charlie\u2019s. Hence Alice\u2019s hat is blue, and Bob\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s are red. </p> <p><strong>Charlie\u2019s hat is red</strong>. 78.8 per cent of you got it correct. 21.2 per cent got it wrong.</p> <p>(iv) Alice must be able to see two hats of opposite colours, or else she would be able to deduce her own hat colour. Bob knows this, so deduces his hat is a different colour from Charlie\u2019s. Hence Charlie\u2019s hat is blue. </p> <p><strong>Charlie\u2019s hat is blue</strong>. 89.2 per cent of you got it correct. 10.8 per cent got it wrong.</p> <p>(v) If Bob and Charlie had different colour hats, Alice would know that she and Bob both had red hats.

The US-led coalition has said it will provide air support, signalling at the minimum that the US wants to put simultaneous pressure on the extremists in Raqqa and in their other urban stronghold of Mosul, in Iraq.</p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e558ea06513b0477598df5b49d2142debf7719d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e558ea06513b0477598df5b49d2142debf7719d/939_0_2146_2683/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Owen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe SDF is making sure the IS forces that are in Mosul cannot reinforce the IS forces in Raqqa, and that the force in Raqqa cannot conduct external operations into Turkey, into Europe and into the United States,\u201d Dunford said.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe always knew the SDF wasn\u2019t the solution for holding and governing Raqqa. What we are working on right now is to find the right mix of forces for the operation.\u201d</p> <p>The right mix is for local tribes and other people from the vicinity of Raqqa to spearhead the operation and remain to hold and govern the city once it is taken from Isis, Dunford said.</p> <p>\u201c[The operation needs] a predominantly Arab and Sunni Arab force,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are forces like that. There is the moderate Syrian opposition, the vetted Syrian forces and the Free Syrian Army forces, and there is some initial outreach to forces in Raqqa proper.\u201d</p> <p>He was speaking after meeting his opposite numbers in the Turkish military in Ankara, at which he promised to be completely transparent with the Turks about the Raqqa operation by embedding Turks in the planning operation.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmu\u015f, said on Monday the Turkish priority was to limit Kurdish advances in Syria.</p> <p>Using non-Arab elements to drive Isis out of Raqqa would not contribute to peace in the region, he said. He argued that Sunnis in Raqqa, regardless of their dislike of Isis, would not welcome a Kurdish liberation force. </p> <p>Kurtumulu\u015f also added that \u201clegitimacy cannot be obtained through a terror organisation brandishing arms\u201d and that the \u201cUnited States will sooner or later see this reality\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/20/kurdish-troops-advance-towards-mosul-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58c28\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2823479\"            data-video-name=\"Kurdish troops advance towards Mosul \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5808d1b3e4b0cd26ff71f29a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020mosulstefedit_KP-29881379_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020mosulstefedit_KP-29881379.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020mosulstefedit_KP-29881379_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/20/kurdish-troops-advance-towards-mosul-video\">Kurdish troops advance towards Mosul</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Raqqa operation is in part designed to reduce Isis options as Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces join others in trying to storm Isis-held towns north-east of Mosul.</p> <p>The Iraqi operation, involving a 100,000-strong alliance of troops, security forces, peshmerga and Shia fighters backed by US-led airstrikes, has made inroads to the south of Mosul and entered the city from the east.

In the quest for 270 electoral votes to secure the presidency, the coveted prize of the \u201cKeystone state\u201d saw Clinton, Trump, their running mates or high-profile surrogates, and on many weeks all of these, campaigning throughout Pennsylvania. It has not voted Republican since George HW Bush in 1992, but Trump is fervently contesting it. </p> <p>Working on a photo-essay of the rust belt, a stronghold of Trump\u2019s, I drove past a derelict home with his surname spray-painted in bold scarlet lettering on the facade. For a region decimated by the collapse of the coal industry, the Republican presidential nominee represents the prospect of renewal and returned prosperity. In fact, Trump campaigns on that exact promise that he will bring back jobs through \u201cclean coal\u201d. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b4b358b20ee7e2c6c7eeb26764c5190752b0ae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b4b358b20ee7e2c6c7eeb26764c5190752b0ae8/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump campaign sign is displayed in the storefront of a firearm pawn shop in Minersville, Pennsylvania on 6 June\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump campaign sign is displayed in the storefront of a firearm pawn shop in Minersville, Pennsylvania on 6 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>A Donald J.

But it is beginning to feel as if liberal democracy in Britain is, too, \u201cdrawing on resources it does not possess\u201d.</p> <p>Across the world, a succession of near-catastrophes has over the past two years begun to drain progressive politics of its resilience. Anti-racists, globalists and believers in the virtues of science over mumbo-jumbo are still winning elections. But the effort is going to exhaust us unless we become more radical.</p> <p>In America, whether he wins or loses, Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2013 by sidelining the respectable right and creating a mass movement based on hate \u2013 has eroded American democracy to a new and fragile baseline. All the right needs to do in 2020 is to find a more respectable candidate and, until then, unleash a resistance struggle against the legitimacy of Clinton, her supreme court appointments and any Democratic majority in Congress that emerges.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to understand the new cross-fertilisation that has begun between Trump\u2019s white-supremacist revolt and the revolt being planned by Ukip. Virtually nobody in mainstream politics a decade ago used the term \u201cwhite working class\u201d. Now it\u2019s common to hear even BBC presenters parrot the phrase, as if the separation between white and non-white populations in Britain\u2019s post-industrial towns were an accomplished fact, not a far-right fantasy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/brexit-vote-british-citizenship-german\">After the Brexit vote, my pride in taking British citizenship is fading | Fran Lawther</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Britain, since the high-court decision, and with the tabloids ramping up their attack on the judiciary, people have been asking: what do Jonathan Harmsworth, owner of the Daily Mail, and Rupert Murdoch want? What would make them stop?</p> <p>The answer is: they want Britain ruled by a xenophobic mob, controlled by them. The policies are secondary \u2013 as long as their legal offshore tax-dodging facilities are maintained. They also want a Labour party they can control and a Tory party they can intimidate.</p> <p>In pursuit of that, they have created what the sociologist Manuel Castells calls a \u201cswitch\u201d. You create a constituency of angry rightwing voters, assembled around using language no respectable politician could utter, and you switch them on, or off, against the government of the day as long as that government does your bidding.</p> <p>It\u2019s facile to call Trump and Farage \u201cfascists\u201d. They are elite, rightwing economic nationalists who have each stumbled upon the fact that a minority of working-class people can be fooled by populism \u2013 especially when the left refuses to play the populist game. And they are moving forward fast.</p> <p>So we need to catch up. \u201cWe\u201d is no longer about leave versus remain, still less Corbynistas versus the rest. \u201cWe\u201d should include everybody who wants this country to be run by parliament, with the judiciary guaranteeing the rule of law, to remain engaged with the multilateral, global institutions and be tolerant to migrants and foreign visitors.</p> <p>The first thing we have to make is a rhetorical break with neoliberalism: the doctrine of austerity, inequality, privatisation, financial corruption, asset bubbles and technocratic hubris. It is entirely possible to construct a humane pro-business version of capitalism without these things.</p> <p>There doesn\u2019t have to be a bunch of apologies and confessions. You could assuage a large part of the anger that\u2019s driving the ultra-right simply by a demonstrable change of path: pump money into communities and hope will follow. Likewise, get HMRC on to the case of the tax-dodging rich, and off the backs of small-business owners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-nigel-farage-fascists-intolerance\">Are Farage and Trump really fascists?  | Kevin Passmore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next thing is to do something radical about the inequality of voice in Britain\u2019s media. Enact Leveson. Ask companies such as British Airways why they are distributing the Mail mid-Atlantic, for free, as a kind of \u201cunwelcome to Britain\u201d card for visitors. People with resources should set up \u2013 or, even better, acquire through hostile takeover \u2013 mass-circulation newspapers that champion democratic values, tolerance and restraint. Plus we need to challenge supine editorial leadership of the BBC. There are no minutes of a meeting where the BBC\u2019s bosses decided to give free rein to hate speech and intimidation on programmes such as Question Time; no instructions exist that say reporters should run unchallenged vox-pops with racists, back to back. But this is what\u2019s happening. It would take one email from the director general, Tony Hall, to stop it.</p> <p>The philosopher Walter Benjamin wrote in the 1930s that the success of the radical right was fuelled by the failure of the radical left. Benjamin took it as read that the business class would either support, or flip over to, fascism once the demagogues had created a street movement and an atmosphere of crisis.</p> <p>Today, however, the vast majority of business leaders, professionals and educated people operate in a world regulated to global standards, where markets depend on freedom and the rule of law. Today, therefore, it is the failure of the radical centre that\u2019s the problem. It needs, like Fitzgerald after his famous \u201ccrack-up\u201d to recharge its batteries.</p> <p>If Nigel Farage leads 100,000 people to intimidate the supreme court, I intend to be on the other side of a police crash barrier opposing him. I don\u2019t want to be flanked by only my anti-fascist mates from 30 years ago: I want to see an alliance of the left and the radical centre on the streets. That means bond traders from Canary Wharf, arm in arm with placard-carrying Trots. Masked-up Kurdish radicals alongside Mumsnet posters. Eighty years on from Cable Street, we don\u2019t have many dockers and miners around, to help face down rightwing intimidation. Puny as we are, it\u2019s up to us.</p>",

Lou went to the bathroom at one point, came out, got a paper. There\u2019s a series in my book of him pulling out the newspaper. I think the headline on it was Skyjacker Kills Hostage. And he proceeded to stand against the wall with papers all over the place. Then he walked away, stood and lit a cigarette, which you can\u2019t do anymore. It\u2019s one of my favorite shots and Lou kind of spoke to Total Excess.

It wasn\u2019t as hard or frantic like the leads, but he was still post-Cream when I took this shot and I love that because the 70s were still a cocaine era. It was the same in sports. There was a lot of blow. These athletes, musicians, writers, cinematographers, actors, actresses. They reflected the age and the time they were living in and that\u2019s what art does. The irony at the time for me \u2026 the people that really demonize it the most were the previous two generations, who half of them were alcoholics.

The first time I saw Rod, he was with Jeff Beck. It was 1968 and Truth had just come out, which was this incredible fucking blues riff album and Jeff had just left the Yardbirds.

That was the Rolling Stones as good as it gets musically. They\u2019re still high-energy now, but that was incredible and kind of from the Exile on Main St. They were playing that album, that whole genre, and they were white-hot. And the stage was much smaller than it is now and they had Mick Taylor with them. You could see Mick kind of just galvanized everything.</p> <p>\u201cI was so naive in those days. I thought if you want to shoot somebody like that you just call them up, tell them who you are and they\u2019ll put you on the tour. I called up a month and a half, two months before. It took me two weeks to finally get somebody and I was told no, they already had a tour photographer. The only way you could shoot them was to be on a magazine assignment. Rolling Stone, I think, had Annie [Leibovitz] shooting for them at the time. And I thought, \u2018God, what am I gonna do?\u2019 We magazine was just starting, so I called them. They weren\u2019t going to assign me. So then I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve seen a lot of things over the years with the Stones at Vogue.\u2019 David Bailey had shot them. I saw that Leo Lerman was the photo editor and I decided, \u2018Fuck it, I\u2019m just gonna call.\u2019 I called Jo Bergman \u2013 if not the Stones\u2019 manager, it was Mick\u2019s manager \u2013 and said [in an English accent], \u2018It\u2019s Leo Lerman here, Vogue magazine.

Well, maybe next time.\u2019 She goes, \u2018Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is this guy? He can meet us in Vancouver.

It was 1975. She was just starting to really get known nationally. We were backstage, actually in the same dressing room that Etta had used. We\u2019re at the Boarding House again and she was hanging with her band. Ivan Kral was with her in one picture, but Patti had this great sense of theater and every picture I took, she was not posing, but she was posing and having these different characters. I think I was shooting for After Dark magazine and I said, \u2018Patti, they\u2019re looking for some kind of a portrait.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Portrait?\u2019 And steps across the hall into the bathroom and says, \u2018How \u2019bout this for a portrait?\u2019 That\u2019s the great shot in the book of her standing looking like she\u2019s peeing in the room.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"398f02163e8ec8ca363a81beade69d8ceffd736e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/398f02163e8ec8ca363a81beade69d8ceffd736e/0_0_2500_1689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Page photographed at Day in The Green in 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Page photographed at Day in The Green in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Michael Zagaris Photography LLC/Reel Art Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cThat was the last time Led Zeppelin ever played the United States as Led Zeppelin because Bonzo [John Bonham] died about a year and a half later. And that concert was very checkered because Peter, their manager, John Bonham, the drummer, and one of their roadies had beaten up one of Bill Graham\u2019s backstage helpers. A kid named Jim Matzorkis. He was actually a friend of mine, but I was working for the band.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the show, the band flew on to New Orleans, where they were gonna play two days at the Superdome. The first day in, they got a call that Robert Plant\u2019s son Karac, who was four years old, had died. They flew back to England, never again to play in the United States. The last show the Beatles ever did was in San Francisco at Candlestick Park. The last show the Sex Pistols ever did was at Winterland. The last show Led Zeppelin did in the US was right across the street at the Oakland.

  "<p>Samir Nasri has finished training, his heart monitor laid on the window ledge with the others. The scans say he shouldn\u2019t play but he says he will and his manager appreciates it. He\u2019s perhaps La Liga\u2019s best midfielder so far; the man his coach says makes the team breathe. Steven N\u2019Zonzi, perhaps the second-best, ambles by in flip-flops and baggy shorts. Lifesized inflatable footballers lean against the fence; actual footballers ride buggies, alighting at the gym. Sergio Escudero grins and staff embrace him. News just in: he\u2019s in the Spain squad. The groundsman, in cricketer\u2019s shirt and sunhat, takes corners wide on his lawnmower. Alongside, a stand is being built; the B team play here and they\u2019re second in Segunda, occupying a prohibited promotion place. As for the first team, they\u2019re just three points off the top. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/06/sevilla-v-barcelona-la-liga-live\">Sevilla 1-2 Barcelona: La Liga \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Friday afternoon at Sevilla\u2019s Ram\u00f3n Cisneros Palacios training ground with its giant billboard showing Jes\u00fas Navas and Sergio Ramos holding the World Cup and there\u2019s optimism \u2013 lots of it. There\u2019s whitewashed walls and it\u2019s lived-in enough to feel real, not sterile and sanitised \u2013 laundry room in one corner, a couple of those pump-up players lie on the floor like casualties, air slowly escaping. Yet they\u2019re the only thing about this place that\u2019s deflated. Fourth domestically, virtually through in the Champions League, delighted to be denied a defence of the Europa League title <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/sevilla-liverpool-europa-league-final-basel-party\">they have won three years running</a>, life is good. Sevilla are playing well and winning sooner than expected, the sporting director admits. \u201cWe thought the adaptation would be slower,\u201d Monchi says. </p> <p>His manager disagrees: \u201cyou always have that hope,\u201d he has said. But, then, his manager is Jorge Sampaoli, an optimist and enthusiast whose influence is felt here, a man who laments footballers becoming \u201cfunctionaries\u201d, preferring them to be \u201cartists\u201d. He wants them to enjoy this. If at first the play wasn\u2019t entirely convincing, the ideal remained and the results sustained them; now, they have both. They\u2019ve won every home match and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/sevilla-get-the-monkey-off-their-back-at-last-but-still-seek-to-find-their-groove\">even managed to win away, a year later</a>. They\u2019ve lost just once \u2013 at San Mam\u00e9s \u2013 and they beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid whose captain, Gabi, claims they\u2019re candidates for the title. Deep down, Sevilla\u2019s players don\u2019t think they are \u2013 then again, Gabi didn\u2019t think Atl\u00e9tico were in 2013-14 \u2013 but they are indeed enjoying this. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/01/manchester-city-barcelona-champions-league-match-report\">Defeated at the Etihad</a> without Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Andres Iniesta, and not at their best, Barcelona are next at the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n and some even consider Sevilla favourites. They\u2019ve won five out of five and scored 17 there. Since the Super Cup, there\u2019s been just one game when they\u2019ve had less of the ball then their opponents \u2013 away at Juventus \u2013 and that was by just 1%. \u201cIt\u2019ll be difficult,\u201d the Barcelona manager Luis Enrique says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to suffer,\u201d Sevilla president Jos\u00e9 Castro says proudly. He invites the cast of Game of Thrones to see it; a game approached with anticipation, rather than anxiety. Friday, two days away, and there are smiles, chats, warmth, enthusiasm. Why shouldn\u2019t they win? </p> <p>Here\u2019s why not, one member of the coaching staff confides: \u201cIf he has one those moments.\u201d </p> <p>He is Leo Messi. And he does. Asked if he could explain his footballing identity a fortnight ago, Sampaoli said: \u201cYes. Don\u2019t be scared. Don\u2019t wait. Think more about their goal than your own. Want the ball. Go for it.\u201d That ball is yours: when it\u2019s not, get it back. A five-second limit accelerates that. He is totally different to Unai Emery, Nico Pareja admits: attack, always. Don\u2019t wait, dominate. There is a word Sampaoli uses a lot which others don\u2019t, expressing something about his idea: <em>someter</em>. It doesn\u2019t translate that well, but it\u2019s in the vein of conquer, subjugate, impose, subject. He wants his team to impose itself on its opponents \u2013 to overrun them. His Chile team was perhaps the ultimate expression: a stampede, charging forward fearlessly. </p> <p>When Sunday came, Sevilla did the same. Their first shot came after 34 seconds, their second after 48. On 1.21, they had their third. Seventeen seconds later, Barcelona had their first, breaking through the pressure. It was rare that they did so, the waves more often crashing into them. Sevilla stampeded. Escudero volleyed wide. Vitolo\u2019s shot was blocked. Then Vitolo scored. 15.02, the clock said. Sevilla had gone from one end of the pitch to the other, screeching through the space. One-nil and, it seemed, with more to come. </p> <p>Quicker and quicker they went. Higher, too: cornering Barcelona, often quite literally squeezed into the smallest space by the corner flag and the fans \u2013 no way out. Pablo Sarabia was played in, but tried to lay it off with a backheel. Then he had a shot blocked. Vitolo put another one wide. Sevilla tore into their opponents. This was <em>someter</em>, right there. An attack ended with one full-back delivering for the other. Sevilla were flying: Mariano, Vitolo, Luciano Vietto, Escudero \u2013 all of them, in fact. N\u2019Zonzi and Nasri controlled; Barcelona, the team once defined by its midfield, didn\u2019t have a midfield: it was all they could do to watch Sevilla go by, too fast to be stopped. It was breathless and brilliant. Samuel Umtiti resisted. The shots racked up: seven to two. The ball was theirs, against Barcelona. The lead, too. </p> <p>And then, with three minutes to go until half-time, Barcelona broke and Messi scored \u2013 gently, subtly sidefooting past the keeper \u2013 and something shifted. Something? Everything. Messi, above all. \u201cThat was decisive, emotionally,\u201d Sampaoli admitted. Suddenly, Messi was everywhere. \u201cWe have a plan for Barcelona and another for Messi,\u201d the Sevilla manager had said before the game; for 40 minutes it was successful, a minute later it was in pieces. Why didn\u2019t the plan to stop Messi work, he was asked. \u201cBecause sometimes Messi lets you stop him and sometimes he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Sampaoli said. \u201cWhen the game breaks [open], he\u2019s unstoppable.\u201d </p> <p>The game broke open. Space appeared as Sevilla tired, unable to maintain that pressure, and Barcelona took control, even if control was never complete and the match remained alive until the last. From Neymar\u2019s chance after 92mins, Sevilla went racing up the other end and could have equalised, the Pizju\u00e1n appealing for a penalty and complaining when only three minutes were added. Not just the Pizju\u00e1n either: everyone bar the shattered players wanted this to go on for longer. When the final whistle did go, with the final score 2-1 to the visitors, there was delight and relief for Barcelona and a kind of sad satisfaction for Sevilla. They had been brilliant even if they had been beaten. </p> <p>Luis Enrique\u2019s side, meanwhile, had responded superbly, amid the doubts. He described the game as \u201clovely, intrepid, between two teams that take risks\u201d. It was also an important one, huge for his side. He insisted that it was a \u201cdeserved\u201d one, too.</p> <p>Denis Su\u00e1rez produced his best performance since returning in the summer, passing his way into the match; Neymar ran at Mariano, easing the pressure at key moments; Sergio Busquets eventually got back on the ball, slowing the game down; Umtiti and Javier Mascherano sped about, putting out fires; Luis Su\u00e1rez scored the winner. And Leo Messi, well, Leo Messi did everything and was everywhere. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4413be83f4dff79b898d84f82e174fd5c06fc0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4413be83f4dff79b898d84f82e174fd5c06fc0d/0_122_3251_1950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Su\u00e1rez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s goal for Barcelona shortly after the hour mark ultimately proved decisive as his side came from behind against Sevilla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sevilla\u2019s coaching staff always knew he might do something like this. They\u2019d seen it before, after all. But even they didn\u2019t expect something quite this good. </p> <p>There is a cliche that gets trotted out endlessly when a less well-known player does something wonderful: <em>if</em> <em>Messi had scored that we would be banging on about it for weeks</em>. It\u2019s not true; in fact, at times it feels like the opposite is true: Messi has made the remarkable so routine that it stops being so remarkable. It\u2019s just him doing what he does. There\u2019s not much new to say; all the good words ran out some time ago. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/mar/22/leo-messi-barcelona-la-liga-spain\">Even swearing won\u2019t do now</a>. </p> <p>They say you could get a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters and they would eventually come up with the complete works of Shakespeare. Maybe, but you could get a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters \u2013 God knows, the Spanish sports media have tried \u2013 and they still wouldn\u2019t come up with much that was new to describe Messi. Pep Guardiola was right when he said: \u201cDon\u2019t write about him \u2013 watch him.\u201d Yet this time was different. Messi scored the goal that changed this game \u2013 so far, so standard \u2013 and then, even by his own standards, produced a second half performance that was absurd. Ludicrously good. So good as to warrant talking about for once, maybe even writing about. He\u2019d scored one and assisted one; but for wasteful finishing, he could have scored three and assisted three. One of them, dribbling through a space that wasn\u2019t there, would have been among the best two or three goals he has ever scored. If Messi had done that, we really would have been banging on about it for weeks. We may well go on about this display for weeks anyway. Perhaps even for years. </p> <p>With the Game of Thrones cast up in the stands, the puns in the papers were inevitable: kings, thrones and majesty were all over the place, empires and ruling too. Perhaps the most telling was the quote from Lord Varys that made it into the media: \u201cA very small man can cast a very large shadow.\u201d Messi is a small man, but El Pa\u00eds called him \u201cgigantic\u201d. He passed, dribbled, controlled: he dominated and defended, deactivated opponents and activated team-mates. He cast a shadow over this entire game. A shadow? Light, more like. Usually seen playing at his own pace, this time he was hyperactive and he was everywhere. A No10, No4, No9, No7 and No8 in one: Messi, Xavi and Iniesta. \u201cHe can play anywhere,\u201d Luis Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cMessi \u2018Distefanoed\u2019 Sevilla,\u201d AS claimed. </p> <p>That is some statement. There may be no player who has ever impacted on the club game like Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, the man who was everything. As his team-mate Amancio Amaro put it: \u201cHe was a defender, a midfielder and a striker. He was a fucking robot!\u201d L\u2019Equipe called him \u201c<em>L\u2019Omnipresent</em>\u201d. Helenio Herrera famously remarked: \u201cif Pel\u00e9 was the lead violinist, Di St\u00e9fano was the whole orchestra.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMessi is football, football is Messi,\u201d one headline claimed. \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything new: Messi is the best player in history,\u201d Vitolo said last night. \u201cNo one is like Messi,\u201d Luis Enrique insisted. The Sevilla president Jos\u00e9 Castro called him \u201can extraterrestrial\u201d. Asked to explain the result, he said: \u201cThey have Messi and we don\u2019t.\u201d Castro looked exhausted \u2013 they all did. Yet they had been exhilarated too. We all had. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with people leaving the stadium with a smile on their faces, having seen a team play with no inferiority complex and no fear against Barcelona,\u201d Sampaoli had said. They saw that. They also saw Leo Messi. </p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Celta Vigo 2-1 Valencia; Espanyol 0-0 Athletic Bilbao; Granada 1-1 Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a; Las Palmas 1-0 Eibar; M\u00e1laga 3-2 Sporting Gij\u00f3n; Osasuna 0-1 Alav\u00e9s; Real Madrid 3-0 Legan\u00e9s; Real Sociedad 2-0 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid; Sevilla 1-2 Barcelona; Villarreal 2-0 Real Betis</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Two belting good goals and two men might decide Gus Poyet\u2019s future. Betis were beaten 2-0 by Villareal with goals from Roberto Soriano and Trigueros, leaving them just two points above the relegation zone and their manager on the edge. Last week fans chanted for him to be sacked; this week at least he avoided that away at the Madrigal but he is under no illusions. \u201cHaving a job depends on two people: the person who offers it and the person who takes it,\u201d he said. \u201cNot having a job is the same. No one knows what will happen tomorrow, or the day after.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 Carlos Vela\u2019s face said it all. He looked like he had been told a particularly good joke just before he went to do the touchline interview and seemed to be trying not to crack up all the way through, a huge smile seeking to escape, but just about kept under control. Obvious, perhaps, after his Real Sociedad side defeated Atl\u00e9tico 2-0, with two penalties, one of them coolly finished by him, the other scored by Willian Jos\u00e9. And yet it was more significant that it might seem. For some time, Vela had disengaged and seemed disinterested. His recovery is hugely important for the side. Eusebio seems to have reached him in a way that others have not \u2013 and, yes, that does mean David Moyes in particular, but not only him. Real Sociedad are flying: they\u2019ve won every game since the Basque derby in mid-October.</p> <p>\u2022 This is Atletico\u2019s worst start under Diego Simeone. Which seems odd when they\u2019ve played better than before. But the explanation might be more simple than it seems: the fixtures. They have already been away to Barcelona, Celta, Real Sociedad, Sevilla and Celta. Next up, Real Madrid at home. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/real-madrid-barcelona-gareth-bale-sevilla-la-liga\">Real Madrid maintain lead over Barcelona after Gareth Bale double</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022 Saturday\u2019s afternoon games featured four goals \u2013 all of them penalties. The most controversial was for Las Palmas, who won 1-0 in the 94th minute after a tumble that looked suspiciously dive-y. And Osasuna felt very hard done to as well, Alav\u00e9s getting a doubtful penalty quarter of an hour from the end. But it wasn\u2019t all bad.

He is, they say, the new leader of a team that has now gone 28 unbeaten. But this week it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/cristiano-ronaldo-signs-new-five-year-real-madrid-contract\">Ronaldo who has signed a new contract</a>. </p> <p>\u2022 Valencia are the only team in Spain without a clean sheet this season. But it\u2019s worse than that: they have now got just one clean sheet in 39 games, spread across five different managers. This week, they were beaten 2-1 by Celta Vigo thanks to one from John Guidetti and a beauty from Facundo Roncaglia. The relegation zone is just one point away. </p> <p>\u2022 Time to start talking about the second division, then?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\"

  "<p>Bret Easton Ellis may well go down as one of this era\u2019s epochal novelists, a singular essayist on the icy inhumanity of 20th- and 21st-century living, delivering grim librettos on the emptiness of privileged youth. As a film-maker, his legacy is less assured, as anyone who has seen The Informers will be aware. But that has not stopped Ellis joining the merry band of blowhards who enjoy giving Warner Bros\u2019 DC expanded universe (DCEU) of superhero movies a good kicking at every available opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cI was having dinner with a couple of executives who know other executives who are working on the Batman movie, The Batman,\u201d <a href=\"https://theringer.com/movie-industry-shifts-peak-tv-arrival-moonlight-f0a5ddd85384#.jojsd8cgi\">Ellis told The Ringer</a>. \u201cAnd they were just telling me that there are serious problems with the script. And that the executives I was having dinner with were complaining about people who work on the Batman movie. And they just said they went to the studio and they said, \u2018Look, the script is \u2026 Here\u2019s 30 things that are wrong with it that we can fix.\u2019 </p> <p>\u201cAnd [the executives] said, \u2018We don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t really care. The amount of money we\u2019re going to make globally, I mean 70% of our audience is not going to be seeing this in English. And it doesn\u2019t really matter, these things that you\u2019re bringing up about the flaws of the script.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>To be fair, Ellis was being interviewed for a piece on the death of movies and concurrent rise of television as an art form when he made his comments. It was probably not his intention to add to the chorus of disapproval that has greeted the launch of Warner\u2019s DCEU among critics. Moreover, the novelist and <a href=\"http://podcastone.com/Bret-Easton-Ellis-Podcast\">noted cineaste</a> has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BretEastonEllis/status/794676696565694464/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">now made an apology of sorts on Twitter</a>, clarifying that his anecdote was at best third hand, and that he has \u201cno idea\u201d personally what the screenplay is like for Ben Affleck\u2019s debut solo Batman outing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BretEastonEllis/status/794676696565694464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/4mHqtwTZzw\">https://t.co/4mHqtwTZzw</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/J6Pc4LxHKy\">pic.twitter.com/J6Pc4LxHKy</a></p>&mdash; Bret Easton Ellis (@BretEastonEllis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BretEastonEllis/status/794676696565694464\">November 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>None of this matters a jot, of course. The word is now out there in the blogosphere that The Batman is \u201cstruggling\u201d, just as Patty Jenkins\u2019s Wonder Woman is deemed to be experiencing difficulties thanks to <a href=\"http://www.pajiba.com/think_pieces/an-open-letter-to-warner-bros-ceo-kevin-tsujihara-about-layoffs-zack-snyder-and-donuts.php\">an anonymous open letter</a> from a disgruntled ex-Warner employee to CEO Kevin Tsujihara in September. Then there\u2019s The Flash, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/the-flash-loses-director-rick-famuyiwa-1201905032/\">which recently lost its second director</a>, and Justice League, which has been squeezed down into one movie because <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice/\">everyone hated</a> Zack Snyder\u2019s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"179d3ea988f659260cbe68e406d3af744e02c438\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179d3ea988f659260cbe68e406d3af744e02c438/44_0_1935_2418/800.jpg\" alt=\"Given free rein at DC \u2026 Zack Snyder, director of Superman vs Batman: Dawn of Justice.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Given free rein at DC \u2026 Zack Snyder, director of Superman vs Batman: Dawn of Justice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harvey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem for Warner Bros is that it has brought this on itself. The studio has a reputation as a place that allows film-makers free rein to deliver their own original visions, a policy that worked superbly for Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman movies but proved disastrous for Dawn of Justice. So freaked out do executives appear to have been at the reaction to it, the first instalment in an ambitious slate of 10 new films based on the DC comics back catalogue, that they <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/suicide-squads-secret-drama-rushed-916693\">reportedly intervened</a> to try and ensure David Ayer\u2019s Suicide Squad didn\u2019t go the same way. Hence that movie emerged as a right royal mess stuck half way between two radically different cuts.</p> <p>Jenkins has complained that talk of her own movie being in similar difficulties <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/wonder-woman-director-patty-jenkins-responds-claim-mess-1201836794/\">couldn\u2019t be further from the truth</a>. And Affleck probably has a right to be irritated that The Batman is already getting bad press given his own film-making credentials are rather more polished than those of Snyder (or Ellis himself).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2016/aug/03/from-suicide-squad-to-batman-v-superman-why-dc-films-so-bad-zack-snyder\">From Suicide Squad to Batman v Superman, why are DC\u2019s films so bad?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem is that there\u2019s a lingering reek of putrescence surrounding the DCEU, thanks largely to its two early efforts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2016/aug/03/from-suicide-squad-to-batman-v-superman-why-dc-films-so-bad-zack-snyder\">both proving to be stinkers</a>. And until Warner puts its house in order and begins pumping out quality movies in the manner of rival Marvel, these kind of stories are just going to keep on coming. The idea that the script for The Batman is riddled with errors, and that executives can\u2019t be bothered to fix them because international markets will make up the box office, is like something from a bad clickbait tagline. And yet it feeds into fears that Warner is happy to continue putting out substandard product while utilising huge marketing budgets to paper over the cracks, just as it did relatively successfully with both Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad.</p> <p>The reality is that far from being blase about its upcoming superhero roster, Warner appears terrified at the prospect of failure. That\u2019s why Suicide Squad was <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/suicide-squads-secret-drama-rushed-916693?utm_source=twitter\">reportedly </a>edited in part by the team who came up with the movie\u2019s eye-popping trailers, rather than being left under Ayer\u2019s full control. And it\u2019s also why <a href=\"http://www.geek.com/tech/justice-league-set-visits-signal-zack-snyders-second-thematic-pivot-in-three-movies-1659011/\">Snyder and his team struck such an apologetic tone</a> towards bloggers and critics at a recent Justice League set visit.</p> <p>Whether Snyder really can learn from his mistakes is one thing. But those of us hoping the DCEU can be turned around will be hoping that at least part of Ellis\u2019s anecdote \u2013 the bit about studio executives leaving the creatives to their own devices \u2013 is true. Whether they end up being classics of the genre or not, I want to see what a Ben Affleck-directed Batman movie looks like and how a Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman flick turns out. Like Marvel, Warner needs to have an overarching vision for its comic book movies \u2013 the creation of DC Films and <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-v-superman-fallout-warner-895174\">comics legend Geoff Johns\u2019 elevation to head geek</a> should help in that regard. But no one wants to see these movies being directed by committee.</p>",

The outfield is a consistent green, which means reverse swing may be tough to find. The ubiquitous bucket seats in the stands are clean. We wait to see how many of them will be filled.

It is not like the ones that greeted England in Chittagong or Dhaka. Some green grass is visible alongside some cracks; there are one or two bare patches, which suggests the surface is not entirely flat.</p> <p>On Monday it was unprotected from an unrelenting sun unlike in Bangladesh, left open to bake a bit more.

That live grass may yet disappear.</p> <p>The pitch will offer turn for the spinners \u2013 but we are not sure when \u2013 however, the expectation is that batting will not be as treacherous early in the game as it was in Bangladesh.</p> <p>With such an even covering of grass everywhere reverse swing may not be so easy to find especially since the Kookaburra ball will not be in use as it was in Bangladesh. As Stuart Broad confirmed the Kookaburra tends to reverse earlier in its life. The SG ball, which will be used in this series, has properties more similar to the English Duke. All we know for certain is that it will be a good toss to win.</p> <p>If England were playing on a pitch like those in the nets, then they may well opt for four seamers and two spinners. There is just enough live grass on the strip in the middle for them to consider playing that formation for the first time this winter, but the three-and-three lineup is still the most likely. Which three spinners should be in the team continues to cause debate, certainly beyond the squad and probably within it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/27/the-spin-tackling-cricket-test-vacuums-empty\">Tackling cricket's Test vacuums</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the off-spinners on view in the nets exhibited fine control and subtle variation but that was Kamlesh Makvana, who has taken 212 wickets in 78 first-class games for Saurashtra at a lower cost than any of England\u2019s spinners (and he is six years younger than Gareth Batty). He is the son of the groundsman and a high-quality addition to the battalion of net bowlers.</p> <p>My hunch is England will revert to the trio who played in the Test in Chittagong, which would mean Batty and Adil Rashid alongside Moeen Ali despite the proliferation of India right-handers.

The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a missile, and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so yet, they will soon. It is also widely anticipated that in the next few years, North Korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US west coast. Former and current US administrations have taken the strategic decision that Pyongyang should be prevented from reaching that point, by force if necessary. But the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next president.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton\u2019s foreign policy advisers have signalled that she would focus on the looming Korean crisis early in her term in office, reassuring Japan and South Korea that the US will not abandon them, and seeking to put pressure on China to enforce UN-mandated trade sanctions more effectively. That may well not succeed, leaving a Clinton administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of dialogue with Pyongyang and accepting its nuclear weapons status, as long as it restricts missile development. If that were possible, it would alarm US allies who are already within North Korean missile range.<br></p> <p>American allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if Trump reaches the Oval Office. He has questioned the value of US alliances in the region, and he has <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-japan-south-korea-might-need-nuclear-weapons/\">floated the possibility</a> that countries like Japan or South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the US strategic umbrella. If he sticks to that policy in office, there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in north-east Asia and possibly beyond. Ultimately, a Trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a North Korean long-range missile. He has said he would put more pressure on China to get tough with its neighbour, and he has said he is willing to meet Kim in the US, on the grounds \u201cthere\u2019s a 10% or a 20% chance that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-north-korea-nukes-224385\">I can talk him out of those damn nukes</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>Failing that, he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the US nuclear arsenal. If the weapons cannot be used, he asked: \u201cThen why are we making them? Why do we make them?\u201d </p> <h2>China </h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/china-tantalized-mayhem-us-election-prospect-thug-donald-trump-president\">China tantalized by US election mayhem and prospect of 'thug' Trump as president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within his or her first year in office, a new US president would also face a direct challenge to US power in the western Pacific. The Chinese programme of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the South China Sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives Beijing potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world. US influence is under further threat by the rise of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/philippine-president-calls-for-removal-of-all-us-troops\">threatened to eject US troops</a>, casting doubt on his predecessor\u2019s agreement to allow new permanent American presence. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s likely policy will be to continue Obama\u2019s faltering \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d, and to prioritise restoring the faith of US allies in the region that Washington will help them resist Chinese attempts to dominate the South China Sea. It is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by Duterte\u2019s ultimate intentions, and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region. </p> <p>Trump has pointed to the Chinese reef-building programme as a reflection of US weakness but has not said what he would do about it. He has focused more on the threat posed to the US by its trade relations with China. In the transactional model of foreign relations Trump favours, he <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-china-idUSKCN0ZR2MN\">could agree</a> to turn a blind eye to creeping Chinese takeover in the South China Sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with Beijing on better terms. </p> <h2>Syria </h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">Why Clinton's plans for no-fly zones in Syria could provoke US-Russia conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A new US president will arrive in office at a time of significant military advances against <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> in Syria and neighbouring Iraq, but diminishing options when it comes to helping shape the opposition battle against the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian backers. It is possible that the rebel stand in Aleppo will have fallen by then, giving the regime the upper hand and postponing yet again any hopes of a political transition.</p> <p>In the presidential debates, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">talked of establishing</a> a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d or a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria. However, it is hard to see how that would be done without risking a direct clash with Russia, with all the risks that entails. The generals at the Pentagon, who have long argued against the feasibility of establishing such a zone, would work hard to block such a scheme. A Clinton White House is also likely to explore ways of increasing the flow of arms to moderate opposition groups.<br></p> <p>Trump has indicated that he would seek to work with Assad and Putin in a combined fight against Isis, and has not voiced criticism of the bombardment of rebel-held areas such as eastern Aleppo. That policy would also have heavy costs. The Syrian opposition and the Gulf states would see it as a betrayal, and the new administration would have to deal with the reality that neither the regime nor Russia has much immediate interest in fighting Isis. </p> <h2>Russia and Ukraine</h2> <p>A Clinton administration is expected to take a tougher line with Moscow than the Obama White House, all the more so because of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">substantial evidence of the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to try to intervene in the US presidential election</a> in her opponent\u2019s favour. Clinton could well seek to take a leadership role in negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine and the stalled Minsk peace process, which have hitherto been left to Germany and France.

He avoided criticism of Russia for its actions in Ukraine, hinted he might accept the annexation of Crimea, and ignored US intelligence findings that Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic party\u2019s email. A Trump administration is unlikely to contest Russian enforcement of its influence in eastern Ukraine.</p> <h2>Europe and Nato</h2> <p>Clinton aides have signalled consistently that one of her priorities would be to show US willingness to shore up EU and Nato cohesion, and will attend summits of both organisations in February.<br></p> <p>Trump has suggested, by contrast, that Nato is obsolete and questioned whether its security commitments in Europe are worth what the US is currently spending on them. He said he would check whether US allies \u201cfulfilled their obligation to us\u201d before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-america-automatically-nato-allies-under-attack\">coming to their defence</a>, calling into question the purpose of the defence pact. Later in the campaign, he changed tack, saying he would seek to strengthen the alliance, but a win for Trump on Tuesday would nonetheless deepen anxiety in eastern European countries, such as the Baltic states, that a US-led Nato would come to their defence in the face of Russian encroachment. </p> <h2>Trade</h2> <p>The two major free trade projects of the Obama administration, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with the countries on the Pacific rim, will probably still be under negotiation when the new president comes into office, giving him or her the option of killing or completing them.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trade-tpp-20160926-snap-story.html\">first supported</a> the TPP and then criticised it in the face of the primary challenge from Bernie Sanders.

He has promised to seek bilateral trade deals on better terms and to punish other countries deemed to be trading unfairly with sanctions, ignoring the threat of retaliation. </p> <h2>Climate change</h2> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/27/donald-trump-i-would-end-paris-climate-deal-video\">promised</a> to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, which comes into force on Friday, and to \u201cstop all payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programs\u201d.

A total of <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">94 nations have fully signed up</a> to a commitment to keep global temperatures below a 2C increase on pre-industrial times, in the hope of staving off catastrophic sea level rises, heatwaves and extreme weather.</p> <p>The emissions cuts pledged by countries currently aren\u2019t enough to avoid climate calamity, meaning that recalcitrance from the US, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter and the \u201cglobal leader\u201d in fighting climate change, according to Barack Obama, would risk ossifying a process that needs a further hefty shove.</p> <p>American involvement in the Paris deal \u2013 which has the support of nearly 200 other countries \u2013 is based upon the presidential scrawl of Obama. The accord wasn\u2019t presented to Congress as a formal treaty, meaning that Trump could undo it himself.</p> <p>Extricating the US from the deal, along with its financial support of countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, would take some time, however. Now the agreement is in force, any signatory nation faces a three-year delay before it could opt out, with a further one-year wait as the process plays out.</p> <p>\u201cThat means,\u201d said Robert Stavins, an expert at environmental law at Harvard University, \u201cit would be impossible for a President Trump to remove the United States during what would be his first term.\u201d</p> <p>But the uncertainty would undoubtably spook countries that rushed to embrace the Paris deal after the US and China, the world\u2019s two greenhouse gas superpowers, jointly announced they were committed to the process last year. Some countries, aware of the dangers of climate change, may redouble their efforts to slash emissions but others may use it as a convenient excuse to slack off.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s antipathy to climate action is underscored by fierce support for fossil fuels, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/07/trumps_three_messages_for_pa_i.html\">telling coal miners</a> that he will \u201cput you back to work\u201d and that \u201cgas will be a beautiful thing\u201d in his administration.

Words matter as they are often the first step towards actual violence.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why political leaders have a duty to stand up to those sectors of the media that are stirring up hatred.

Our judges are robust, not some precious shrinking violets. Frankly, the Bar Council sound like they want to gag debate, which is hardly democratic. All sides need a greater sense of perspective.\u201d</p> <p> The Sunday Times claimed that four of the justices on the supreme court panel expected to hear the appeal \u201chad links to the EU\u201d \u2013 in some cases referring to their involvement with the European court of human rights, which is not part of the European Union.</p> <p> Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the London School of Economics, retweeted pictures of the Daily Mail\u2019s \u2018enemies of the people\u2019 front page and noted its similarities to a 1933 German newspaper that used the same phrase to refer to the need for judges to \u201cget out of the way of the German people\u2019s will\u201d. </p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s an election on Tuesday, and voters in Grant County, Oregon, face a stark choice. They have to choose their sheriff, and the result of that race will resonate far beyond the county. Many observers will see it as a referendum on the gains made in the west last year by the Patriot movement.</p> <p>Just as in the presidential race, those involved see it as having an almost existential significance. \u201cThis is a pivotal moment in the history of Grant County, and the entire west,\u201d says Todd McKinley, the wiry, clean-cut contender who\u2019s hoping to dislodge the three-term incumbent, Glenn Palmer.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke with McKinley in a coffee shop in the main street of John Day (population 1,707) .

They argue that federal agents should not arrest people or seize property \u201cwithout first notifying and obtaining the express consent of the local sheriff\u201d. </p> <p>In short, they believe that the county sheriff is the highest legal authority in the land (they even<a href=\"https://cspoa.org/about/\"> claim</a> that \u201cthe power of the sheriff even supersedes the powers of the president\u201d). In that, they share the same basic hostility to the federal government, and the same reading of the constitution, as the Malheur occupiers.</p> <p>Mack is also a board member of the <a href=\"https://www.oathkeepers.org/\">Oath Keepers</a>, a group founded in 2009 whose goal is to defend the constitution \u2013 and in particular the second amendment right to bear arms \u2013 against what they see as federal government overreach.</p> <p>More disturbingly for locals, Palmer has according to local press appointed 65 \u201cspecial deputies\u201d \u2013 far more than any other Oregon sheriff \u2013 who report directly to him. In the letter of complaint written by Lutrell, the 911 dispatch manager, she complained that Palmer had provided no list of the people he had deputized, but had said that \u201canyone that I deputize\u201d should be given access to the town\u2019s dispatch systems. </p> <p>Odd incidents have been reported involving these special deputies. In October 2015, according to Lutrell\u2019s letter, Palmer asked a forest service officer to release a man he had detained because he was a special deputy. In September this year, another deputy <a href=\"http://www.bluemountaineagle.com/Local_News/20160923/gcso-investigates-its-own-special-deputy-who-shot-a-dog-she-says-attacked-her\">shot a dog</a> in the street in Canyon City, saying it had attacked her. </p> <p>Because of this lack of transparency, some local residents were not willing to be named after talking to the Guardian, fearing possible intimidation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6a41c6fd0c0be91f2f6ec7368e12b539e09f386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a41c6fd0c0be91f2f6ec7368e12b539e09f386/0_85_4572_2743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Becker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Becker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One who is less reticent is Dan Becker, a local McKinley supporter who has retired from the US Forest Service.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger here,\u201d he says of his community, explaining that Palmer, his local supporters, and his Patriot connections are trying to harness it.

It burned up 110,000 acres of giant Ponderosa pines and Douglas firs in and around Grant County\u2019s share of the Malheur national forest.</p> <p>Of those events, McKinley says: \u201cI ran the operations. We got it done and we didn\u2019t have a life lost.\u201d </p> <p>McKinley says the success in preserving local lives is evidence that cooperative relationships between between county and federal agencies help everyone. But the trauma of lost homes further soured local politics, and many ended up blaming changes in the US forest service\u2019s fire management practices. Old school strategies \u2013 such as thinning out trees with logging and clearing undergrowth \u2013 have become less prevalent as environmental values have exerted greater influence.</p> <p>In August 2015, the Guardian was present at a meeting in neighboring Prairie City at which US Forest Service officials who were preparing the community for possible evacuation were subject to sustained, hostile questioning from some residents about fire prevention.</p> <p>This blame game played into the hands of Palmer and his tight group of local, rightwing allies, who, in keeping with Patriot movement ideology, see federal land management and ownership as a usurpation of local prerogatives.</p> <p>Specifically, according to a report by the social justice thinktank Political Research Associates, Palmer and other Patriots adhere to a particular doctrine of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/2016/10/29/coordination-how-the-patriot-movement-re-imagines-governmental-ties/\">coordination</a>\u201d, which is interpreted by those hard-right groups to give local governments an equal position at the negotiating table with federal and state government agencies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a299c6778c5b24cfea9747a6b9ea186f76468f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a299c6778c5b24cfea9747a6b9ea186f76468f/51_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Canyon Creek Complex fire advanced along a canyon leading to John Day, destroying homes in the process.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Canyon Creek Complex fire advanced along a canyon leading to John Day, destroying homes in the process.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Les Zaitz/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the fires, in September last year, Palmer deputized 11 Grant County residents to draft a <a href=\"http://www.eastoregonian.com/eo/local-news/20151009/grant-county-sheriff-demands-coordination-with-forest-service\">natural resources plan</a> for county-level land management. Such a plan, developed outside county processes, is in keeping with Patriot tactics of establishing bodies which are intended to function as shadow governments pushing their own agenda. </p> <p>The plan calls for negotiations between the United States and the county \u201con a government-to-government basis\u201d in determining public land use, not mere consultation. This means the county is seen as having equal or greater authority than the federal government. </p> <p>One of those deputised to write the plan was Jim Sproul, of Prairie City. <br></p> <p>Sproul told the Guardian that the plan was intended for \u201cuse in the coordination process, which is federal law and allows local government agencies to have a meaningful say in these land use decisions\u201d. Sproul describes the writing committee as \u201ca citizens\u2019 group\u201d, adding that \u201cGlenn [Palmer] supports us 100% because he knows what\u2019s right and wrong.\u201d </p> <p>The group was small, though, and neither elected not formed by any recognized process.

But according to figures from Oregon\u2019s office of economic analysis, employment in Grant County peaked in 1992, and is still around 15% down on 2003, with very few signs of improvement.</p> <p>Whereas some timber belt towns have increased in size as retirees and others move in, Grant County\u2019s demographics look a lot more typical of the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/the-graying-of-rural-america/485159/\">rest of rural America</a>. In 1980 there were 8,210 people there; in 2035 it\u2019s projected there will be just 6,785, while Oregon as a whole will have practically doubled its population to almost five million over the same period.</p> <p>Grant County is still dependent on its remaining timber mill as a private sector employer, but the future may be even bleaker than its immediate past. </p> <p>Environmental protections and more stringent management of public lands have played some role in this, but only some \u2013 more efficient milling, cheap imports, the disappearance of the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of old growth timber, and the decline of the US labor movement have also badly affected the logging industry.</p> <p>This complex misfortune heightens the temptation to blame federal agencies for local problems, says McKinley. \u201cThere\u2019s less logging, unemployment \u2013 people want to blame someone, so they blame the Forest Service.\u201d</p> <p>According to Becker, the disappearance of timber jobs from the 1980s on led many unionised, Democratic-voting mill workers to leave town. This tipped the balance further toward conservatism in a now deep-red county.</p> <p>Glenn Palmer\u2019s politics, though, go beyond mere conservatism. He\u2019s part of a gathering movement that wants to challenge the very idea of federal public lands, and Democrats have few incentives to challenge such candidates in conservative areas.</p> <p>Some of Grant County\u2019s problems come down to the fact that is it a long way from anywhere \u2013 but versions of this political dynamic are visible everywhere, to the extent that they have come to define the political landscape of 2016. In the face of change and decline, Palmer, politicians like him throughout the west, and the Patriot movement as a whole are offering their own version of the promise to make America great again. </p> <p>There aren\u2019t any polls in Grant County.

  "<p>IUDs, implants, condoms and the ever-present pill: for years, contraceptive methods have remained run-of-the-mill while the search for a new alternative that could revolutionise the industry has come up short. Recent headlines have focused on the negative aspects of traditional hormonal birth control: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/women-taking-contraceptive-pill-more-likely-to-be-treated-for-depression-study-finds\">the pill causes depression</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/02/water-system-toxic-contraceptive-pill\">gender mutation in freshwater fish</a>, while a clinical trial for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\">male contraceptive jab</a> was abandoned when the subjects began suffering side-effects already well-known to women.</p> <p>But 50 years since it first became available, the pill remains the default option, and women still shoulder the responsibility for preventing pregnancies. Could software be the solution? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elina-berglund-scherwitzl-43b68331\">Elina Berglund Scherwitzl</a>, founder and chief technical officer of <a href=\"https://www.naturalcycles.com/en/\">mobile fertility app Natural Cycles</a> thinks so.</p> <p>Using a sensitive thermometer and sophisticated mathematics, Natural Cycles is an old-fashioned period tracker, with extra features. The app, which launched in 2014, asks users to take their temperatures in the morning, preferably before getting out of bed, then input that into the app, which tells them where they are in their menstrual cycle. Days when a woman can get pregnant become red; \u201csafe\u201d days are green. So far, so low-tech. What makes Natural Cycles unique, though, is the algorithm developed by Berglund.</p> <p>The 32-year-old from Malm\u00f6 in Sweden holds a PhD in particle physics and was a member of the team that discovered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson\">Higgs boson at Cern</a>, before developing her life-changing formula.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bb3822204295bf30654705386446105b713924a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bb3822204295bf30654705386446105b713924a/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Natural Cycles app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Natural Cycles app</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danijela Froki/Natural Cycles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through daily use, the algorithm learns not just how to map an individual\u2019s ovulation but to predict it, too. That allows the five days prior to ovulation to be identified in real time, alerting women to the fact that male sperm can linger for that long in their bodies, ready to pounce on an egg when it is released.</p> <p>The app fills a gap in the market, spotted by Berglund when she felt fed up with the limited options on offer other than hormonal contraception. She devised the algorithm and started mapping her own cycle, as well as those of female colleagues at Cern. It proved so succesful that Berglund and her husband, fellow physicist and Natural Cycle\u2019s CEO Raoul Scherwitzl, decided to devote more time to the app.</p> <p>Berglund has hired a team of researchers that includes Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor in obstetrics and gynaecology at <a href=\"http://ki.se/en/startpage\">Karolinska Institutet</a> in Stockholm. Their most recently published clinical study showed that Natural Cycles, when used correctly, is as efficient in preventing pregnancies as the pill. Unlike the pill, though, it doesn\u2019t offer any cover for fertile days, which means that comparing the app to medical contraception can be tricky.</p> <p>Asking women to put faith in their phones to protect them from getting pregnant is a complicated business. In Sweden, the app was criticised for targeting young lifestyle bloggers and their impressionable readers. One example was <a href=\"http://www.blondinbella.se/\">Blondinbella</a>, by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blondinbella/?hl=en\">Isabella L\u00f6wengrip</a>, who is now a Natural Cycles investor. (L\u00f6wengrip says that the average age of her 1.3 million weekly readers is just over 30 \u2013 two years older than the typical Natural Cycles subscriber.) In December last year, the Swedish Medical Products Agency also banned the app from calling itself a <em>preventivmedel</em> \u2013 the Swedish word for \u201ccontraception\u201d, which is associated with purely medical birth control. As a result, it\u2019s now marketed as a \u201cfertility monitoring device\u201d that \u201ccan be used to avoid pregnancies\u201d. Berglund doesn\u2019t seem too worried, though.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we do is track fertility, right? And then women can use it how they want \u2013 it\u2019s a tool for them to use this information either to prevent or plan a pregnancy.\u201d Plus, she says, the company\u2019s research shows that younger women are more disciplined in using contraception on red days; their pregnancy rates were much lower than those of users above the age of 35.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"618802328583eb0a0fd912449b6d1532130711e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/618802328583eb0a0fd912449b6d1532130711e4/0_26_2430_1457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Natural Cycles app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Natural Cycles app</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natural Cycles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ideal app user, Berglund says, is a woman in a stable relationship who is planning to have children at some point, and who would like a break from hormonal contraception ahead of trying. Gemzell Danielsson points out that it\u2019s not a good option for women who absolutely want to avoid a pregnancy. Nor does she recommend it for anyone who has what she describes as \u201can irregular lifestyle\u201d, irregular menstrual cycles or lacks the motivation to stay on top of their cycles. The latter of these categories might account for the 45% drop-out rate that the app is currently experiencing; women who sign up but fail to keep to their thermometer schedule.</p> <p>The most important thing about Natural Cycles, Berglund and Gemzell Danielsson argue, is that it adds an alternative method to the mix. \u201cI\u2019m still surprised that there hasn\u2019t been such a product before,\u201d Berglund says. \u201cI have been thinking about this since I was a teenager, because I didn\u2019t feel well from taking the pill.\u201d</p> <p>Berglund is critical of the conveyor-belt style in which young women are prescribed it, and the fact that birth control is still very one-sided within relationships. \u201cSweden is supposed to be the most gender-equal country, but I think when it comes to contraception \u2026 the burden is very much on the woman.\u201d Natural Cycles, she insists, is \u201cmore of a couple\u2019s thing \u2013 the woman measures her temperature and the man sometimes has to wear a condom.\u201d \u201d</p> <p>The most important thing for the company, Berglund says, is to gain trust. \u201cThat\u2019s why we keep performing clinical studies and why we try to achieve a higher ISO class of medical device status.\u201d</p> <p>But before Natural Cycles can become as trustworthy a contraceptive option as hormonal methods, larger-scale, independent studies will need to prove its efficacy. So while the app hasn\u2019t killed the pill just yet, it is a welcome addition.</p>",
  "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is published after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld\">Westworld</a> </em><em>airs on HBO in the US on Sunday night. Do not read unless you have watched episode six, which airs in the UK on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday at 9pm.</em></p> <p>It\u2019s the most unlikely partnership since Mel B and Eddie Murphy. She\u2019s the host with the most, the whorehouse madam with a mouth the size of the Mississippi. He\u2019s a Delos lab rat, who gets his kicks from fiddling with robotic bird DNA. But put them together and you can\u2019t deny the electricity. Specifically the electricity passing through Maeve\u2019s system after Felix does what any sensible human being should never do under any circumstances; willingly make a robot smarter.</p> <p>Maybe Felix\u2019s fiddling will be the act that sparks a rebellion from Westworld\u2019s hosts. Certainly Maeve would have enough motivation. Before messing with her \u201cattribute matrix\u201d, Felix had obligingly given Maeve a tour of \u201cupstairs\u201d \u2013 the spaces within the park\u2019s HQ where employees get creative, whether it be making sure a buffalo walks convincingly, or sculpting the face of a new host in putty like that woman did in the Lionel Richie video so many years ago. With each new floor she visits, Maeve is more and more disturbed. Everything she thought to be true turned out to be fabricated. The only exception to this being her dreams, which in fact weren\u2019t a subconscious fantasy but memories of an earlier build. When hosts are rebuilt, their memories are supposed to be wiped. But, says Felix, that doesn\u2019t always happen because it\u2019s a bit fiddly. Oops!</p> <p>As a measure of their guilt, and a result of being busted in their roles as host pimps to Delos employees, Felix and his scenery-chewing colleague Sylvester (played by the impeccably named Ptolemy Slocum) have turned Maeve\u2019s \u201cperception\u201d levels up to \u201c55\u201d. Not only does this make her cleverer than any human, she\u2019s also clued up as to precisely how badly she and her fellow hosts are being treated in Westworld. If I were her, I might be inclined to do something about it. Which perhaps is what she means by her third consecutive episode ending zinger, \u201cDear boys, would you like to have some fun?\u201d At least, I certainly hope it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d614d7f7062d37cc5e55f732c9b1dcdac6c787f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d614d7f7062d37cc5e55f732c9b1dcdac6c787f/0_223_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ford\u2019s fake family, it turns out, have been hidden from the rest of Westworld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ford\u2019s fake family, it turns out, have been hidden from the rest of Westworld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><br>The thing about this week\u2019s episode is that, suddenly, the robot revolution could come from anywhere. We\u2019ve got Felix\u2019s coding, the hunt for Arnold (of which more later), and Ford\u2019s fake family, hidden out in sector 17 where no one ever goes but which looks quite nice actually and would be ideal for a family on a mini-break. </p> <p>The fake family is a recreation of Ford\u2019s actual blood relatives, only made from metal and rubber. They were built by Arnold back in the day and given to Ford as a present and are some of the last remaining original hosts in the park. They\u2019re so cute: if you say \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d to them, their cheeks actually turn inside out and reveal their mechanical innards. They also throttle people and drink a lot and kill dogs in the woods. Honestly, you\u2019d love them.</p> <p>This revelation answers the question of little Robot Robert\u2019s identity (he is a simulacrum of a young Ford). But elsewhere the mystery deepens. Ford\u2019s fake family, it turns out, have been hidden from the rest of Westworld. What\u2019s more, they haven\u2019t been upgraded to the latest software and were only stumbled across thanks to Bernard\u2019s investigation into the runaway woodcutter. </p> <p>Ford makes out to Bernard like the whole thing is just a sentimental trip, a reminder of his upbringing and the heady early days of the park. And yet, you wonder. First, the hosts\u2019 lack of updated programming means they can\u2019t be controlled by anyone but Ford. Second, in a twist on last week\u2019s opener where Ford recalled watching his dog kill a cat, the family dog has died at the hands of little Robert. Robert justifies it as a necessary homicide to stop the dog killing rabbits. But if that\u2019s the kind of logic he applies to dogs, wait till little Robert sees what some of the park\u2019s guests are getting up to. All in all, if we\u2019re looking for insurrectionist robots, it feels like this cabin in the woods might be worth keeping an eye on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576c9a55bb354bccf7b0ad064418bbc3bc6bb7c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576c9a55bb354bccf7b0ad064418bbc3bc6bb7c1/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ford makes out to Bernard like his cabin the woods is just a sentimental trip.

And yet, you wonder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last up in terms of bad robots (brought to you by Bad Robot), we have the mysterious case of the transmitters. In this week\u2019s late twist we learn it\u2019s Theresa, the boss of QA and intermediary between Westworld and the Delos board, who\u2019s been smuggling data off-site through transmitters buried inside first generation hosts. In a further surprise, it turns out the communication wasn\u2019t one way and that someone from <em>outside</em> has been using the transmitters to reprogram the hosts too, including their \u201cprime directives\u201d.<br></p> <p>It turns out the bicameral mind was more than just a theory that inspired Arnold\u2019s development of androids, but an actual practical application. Someone is now using that application to talk to the hosts in their \u201cminds\u201d and change their behaviour. This is what we are hearing when, for example, Dolores was incited to kill Rebus in episode four. The identity of the outsider remains unknown, but we all know who we think it is: Arnold. For someone who\u2019s dead, notes Elsie, he appears to be quite a prolific coder.</p> <p>Unfortunately this could be the last observation Elsie makes, because the intrepid programming department employee ends the episode getting throttled. Some might say this is what happens when you ignore every single horror movie ever and unduly hang around in an abandoned theatre trying to uncover a conspiracy. But maybe it\u2019ll turn out ok. Perhaps it\u2019s just little Robert mistaking her for a dog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"697eab070c41aae5661c8410046c0344309e4862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/697eab070c41aae5661c8410046c0344309e4862/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Man in Black and Teddy are edging ever closer to Wyatt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Man in Black and Teddy are edging ever closer to Wyatt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, and in the hunt for the maze, the Man in Black and Teddy are edging ever closer. In trying to track down Wyatt, the pair have found a tunnel to the \u201cold territories\u201d guarded by a bunch of Yankee soldiers. After marching into the camp dressed in Yankee uniforms, Teddy is recognised as the man responsible, alongside Wyatt, for the massacre at Escalade. This is the guilt Ford was talking about when he updated Teddy\u2019s back story and it\u2019s real. So real that the previously clean-cut Teddy is now dirty and unshaven with bags under his eyes. This has its upside: after the duo are detained by the soldiers, bad Teddy is capable of busting himself out of his bonds and shooting all the Yankees dead with a machine gun. The Man in Black watches with a look that says he\u2019s both impressed by Teddy\u2019s newfound sangfroid and a little scared. The pair are now free to enter the tunnel, which may even be the maze itself.</p> <h2>Notes from the prairie</h2> <p>Lee \u201cthere\u2019s nothing likeable about me\u201d Sizemore makes his return this week. It turns out that since his last story idea was rejected by Ford, the head of narrative has been on sick leave. This convalescence has largely involved him lying on a recliner in the Delos resort (on the top floor of the Westworld complex) and necking margaritas, crying about how his creative vision has been stymied. Theresa tells him he should get his ass back to work to fix all the glitches Ford\u2019s new narrative has provoked. Instead, he starts chatting up a young woman by telling her how incompetent his bosses are. That woman turns out to be a board member. So Lee follows it up by urinating on QA\u2019s interactive map. At this rate, he won\u2019t be getting his bonus at Christmas.</p> <p>The map for the maze makes two uncommon appearances this week, first in Lawrence\u2019s village as Ford visits, and second on a brand about to be applied to Teddy\u2019s flesh. Once you know what it looks like, that map turns out to be everywhere \u2013 and yet the Man in Black still keeps the one he found on a scalp. Guess he\u2019s sentimental like that.</p> <p>Finally, if you haven\u2019t already, why not give my comment piece about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/03/westworld-fan-theories-are-the-future-of-tv\">Westworld and fan theory</a> a spin?

No minor detail is too small to master, for either of them.</p> <p>As the Scottish journalist Hugh MacDonald says in his concise and exquisite book, Murrayball: How He Gatecrashed the Golden Era, Murray rose from the most unpromising tennis environment imaginable in a small Scottish town to the heights of the game by \u201ctaking the small steps, by intuitively and then efficiently employing the theory of the aggregation of marginal gains\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/05/andy-murray-becomes-world-number-one-for-the-first-time-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5azm9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2872134\"            data-video-name=\"Andy Murray becomes world tennis No1 for the first time \u2013\u00a0video report\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com, SNTV, Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581df421e4b0d073c27d1c42\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161105murrayparis_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/06/161105murrayparis_V6.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/06/161105murrayparis.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/05/andy-murray-becomes-world-number-one-for-the-first-time-video-report\">Andy Murray becomes world tennis No1 for the first time \u2013 video report</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Murray has never lacked for friends in the game \u2013 as the vanquished John Isner testified after losing in three sets to him in the final on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that everyone is looking up to right now,\u201d the American said after his eighth straight defeat to him. One of the first messages of congratulations Murray received from outside his immediate family on the evening he reached the pinnacle of his sport came from Tim Henman, who was similarly misunderstood in the years he carried the weight of British expectations at Wimbledon and on less amenable surfaces to his particular talent.</p> <p>Henman has been a generous and supportive ally of Murray\u2019s since their careers briefly overlapped and said in one early biography: \u201cI remember when word first reached me about \u2018this kid with an unbelievable feel for the game \u2026 always seems to play the right shot at the right time \u2026 but he\u2019s a bit temperamental on court.\u2019 That should remind us of someone.

There will be twinges and grimaces, certainly \u2013 but the superstructure he has constructed is as strong as it could be. So is his mind. Murray is 29.

We\u2019ve got some real talent at our quarterback position. I think Tony Romo is one of the best quarterbacks that has played this game. My real regret would be to have had him here and not win a Super Bowl with him. He\u2019s that talented. And then I look at Dak and how he\u2019s playing, his future. I just don\u2019t have a problem with this situation.</em></p> <p>That was Cowboys owner Jerry Jones after the Cowboys routed the Browns, 35-10, to improve to 7-1 on the season. They\u2019re currently the top seed in the NFC. They\u2019re tied with the Patriots for the best record in the NFL. And Dak Prescott \u2014 who went 21-of-27 for 247 yards and three touchdowns in Sunday\u2019s win \u2014 has thrown 12 touchdowns and just two interceptions. But he\u2019s only playing because Tony Romo got hurt in preseason. On a normal team, Prescott would absolutely start for the rest of the season. But this is the Cowboys, and Jones really cares about Tony Romo. He\u2019s already hedging about getting Romo a Super Bowl win. It may be moot, however: Romo is <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000734143/article/tony-romo-still-not-ready-to-return-to-dallas-cowboys\">only in the beginning</a> stages of his return.</p> <h2>Stat of the week</h2> <p><strong>158 yards</strong>. A week after being benched for fumbling, Mark Ingram ran for 158 yards on 10 carries, including a 75-yard touchdown. Tim Hightower, as predicted, got the bulk of the carries for the Saints, rushing 23 times for 87 yards. The Saints ran for 248 yards \u2014 their highest total of the season by more than 100 yards. Of course, they were playing against the 49ers \u2014 a team that Football Outsiders says has the 30th-worst rush defense and has given up more than 200 yards rushing three times this year.</p> <h2>Fantasy player of the week</h2> <p><strong>Melvin Gordon, Chargers</strong>. Gordon was a high pick in fantasy drafts last year as a rookie, and ended up a huge bust. He rushed for just 641 yards and didn\u2019t score a touchdown. But fantasy players who held onto him in dynasty leagues or drafted him this season are reaping the rewards. In San Diego\u2019s 43-35 win over the Titans on Sunday, Gordon rushed for 196 yards and a touchdown. He also caught four passes for 65 yards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Chargers remain one of the most interesting teams in the league. They blew second-half leads in all four losses in their 1-4 start, and have been ravaged by injuries. Unfortunately for the Chargers, they\u2019re 4-5 while everyone else in the AFC West has a winning record.</p> <h2>Video of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dhm/status/795389569524989952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When your friend from Pittsburgh tries to make fun of Philadelphia <a href=\"https://t.co/o9ceuENug0\">pic.twitter.com/o9ceuENug0</a></p>&mdash; Dan McQuade (@dhm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhm/status/795389569524989952\">November 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Steelers could do nothing offensively for the first three quarters. But after the Ravens returned a blocked punt for a touchdown, Ben Roethlisberger led a nine-play, 75-yard drive for a touchdown that ended with a TD pass to Antonio Brown, then ran it in from four yards out to cut it to a one-score game with 48 seconds to play. The Steelers would need to recover an onside kick next to keep the game alive.</p> <p>Chris Boswell attempted to fool the Ravens by stepping past the ball and kicking with his legs crossed with his opposite leg. In soccer, that\u2019s called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabona\">rabona</a>. In the NFL today, it didn\u2019t work. He knocked the ball into his own leg, then effectively downed it after just a yard when he kicked it downfield. The Ravens won, 21-14. It was such a hilarious attempt that it was the most memorable play in a game that included a Mike Wallace 95-yard touchdown reception. Roethlisberger looked just so-so (264 yards passing, one TD, one pick) in his first game back from injury, while Le\u2019Veon Bell had just 32 yards rushing. Both teams are 4-4.</p> <h2>Elsewhere around the league</h2> <p> \u2014 It looked like the Minnesota Vikings were going to win when tight end Rhett Ellison took a jet sweep into the end zone from a yard out with 23 seconds left. But Matt Stafford drove the Lions 35 yards and Matt Prater hit a 58-yard field goal at the gun to send the game into overtime. Detroit got the ball first in overtime, and Golden Tate broke two tackles on the sideline and jumped into the end zone for a 28-yard touchdown and the stunning road victory.</p> <p>It was a defensive game, with each team getting into the end zone twice. Minnesota could\u2019ve won in regulation, but Blair Walsh missed an extra point after the Vikings\u2019 first score \u2014 allowing Detroit to drive for the game-tying field goal. After a 1-3 start, the Lions are just a half-game out of first in the NFC North at 5-4.</p> <p> \u2014 Travis Kelce was ejected from the Chiefs\u2019 19-14 win over the Jaguars after a bizarre sequence in the third quarter. Nick Foles, playing in place of injured starter Alex Smith, threw a pass to Kelce in the end zone. It fell incomplete, but Kelce thought he was a victim of pass interference. He argued with the referees, and even did John Cena\u2019s \u201cU Can\u2019t C Me\u201d taunt from WWE. He got a 15-yard flag. After seeing that he\u2019d been penalized for his argument, he threw his towel at a second official.

A missed call is just that, missed. No matter how much frustration builds on the field, the refs don\u2019t deserve that kind of response.\u201d</p> <p> \u2014 The Jets went down 23-27 to the Dolphins in a game that could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 spell the end of the Ryan Fitzpatrick era in New York. He tossed another couple of interceptions in the loss, although he wasn\u2019t helped by some costly penalties from his team-mates. But with the Jets now at 3-6, their season is all but over and Fitzpatrick clearly isn\u2019t repeating the form he showed last year. Todd Bowles may as well put in Bryce Petty to see if he has the potential to be a competent starter in the league.</p> <p> \u2014 Helped by a few early Carson Wentz interceptions, Eli Manning threw for 257 yards and four touchdowns on a day where he also didn\u2019t have his best. The Eagles picked him off twice in the fourth quarter; the second pick gave them a chance to win the game. But Wentz could only get the Eagles as far as the Giants 17, and New York held on for a 28-13 victory.</p> <p>Odell Beckham Jr only caught four passes for 46 yards, but two of them went for scores. Sterling Shepard and Roger Lewis had the other scores for the Giants, who improved to 5-3 on the year and moved into second in the NFC East. The Eagles, who started 3-0, are now 4-4 and in last place in the division. Wentz threw interceptions on back-to-back passes early in the first quarter; both turnovers led to Giants touchdowns. He did end up throwing for 364 yards, but the Eagles 3-0 start seems worlds away now.</p> <p>\u2014 The Oakland Raiders\u2019 best start in ages continued with a Sunday night win over the Broncos, 30-20. Latavius Murray lead the way for Oakland with 114 yards rushing and three 1-yard touchdown runs. The team rushed for 218 yards overall and committed just (\u2018just\u2019) eight penalties a week after setting the NFL record for infractions with 24. The Broncos rushed for 33 yards, and fell to 6-3. Oakland is 7-2, first in the division and the No2 seed in the AFC.</p>",

  "<p>Earlier this year, the departing chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/29/prisons-inspector-nick-hardwick-interview\" title=\"\">described the former justice minister</a> Chris Grayling\u2019s attempts to interfere with his conclusion that overcrowding and a shortage of staff were contributing to worsening standards across the prison estate. In September, <a href=\"https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/09/Bedford-Web-2016.pdf\" title=\"\">a report</a> by Hardwick\u2019s successor Peter Clarke on an inspection of Bedford prison said that standards there were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and fell short of \u201cbasic levels of decency\u201d, partly because of staffing shortages. Last week, the head of the Prison Officers Association (POA), Mike Rolfe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/02/prisons-in-england-and-wales-given-boost-of-2500-new-staff-to-tackle-violence\" title=\"\">said that staff across the country</a> were on their knees, and that prisons were succumbing to a \u201cbloodbath\u201d. Last night, 200 prisoners were involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/07/bedford-prison-riot-recent-inspection-found-unacceptable-conditions\" title=\"\">a riot in Bedford prison</a> that took more than six hours to get under control. Whatever else anyone thinks about Sunday\u2019s disturbances, no one can say that they weren\u2019t warned that it was coming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/prison-doctor-jails-inmates-addicts-sentences\">As a prison doctor I\u2019ve seen the crisis in jails \u2013 half the inmates shouldn\u2019t be there | Gordon Cameron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To participate in a riot is obviously a mistaken response to the kinds of dismal conditions that Clarke\u2019s report described. But it isn\u2019t enough to say this. It\u2019s possible to recognise the personal responsibility that any of the inmates involved must hold, and then to ask: if I were in those circumstances, what would I do? And what can be done to make such an eruption less likely in future?</p> <p>Since the justice minister, Liz Truss, doesn\u2019t seem to feel that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/05/lawyers-war-liz-truss-over-abuse-judges-brexit-barristers\" title=\"\">the defence of the independence of the judiciary</a> need take up too much of her energy, she should have ample time to consider these questions. She might start with the number of inmates held at Bedford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/27/prisons-inspector-slates-hmp-bedford-as-abject-failure-over-standards\" title=\"\">493</a>, and compare that with <a href=\"http://howardleague.org/news/bedfordprisoninspection/\" title=\"\">the number it is intended to hold, 322</a>. Or she might go back to Clarke\u2019s report and read again the paragraph about the effect of staff shortages on the conditions under which inmates are held, noting that for the fifth of prisoners who are unemployed, 21 hours a day locked in their cells is not unusual \u2013 with some banged up for 23. If you cage prisoners like animals, deny them the chance to do anything productive with their time or feel as if they are progressing towards a useful goal, you should expect them to respond in the same spirit.</p> <p>Quite often since 2010, union warnings that cuts are making a difference to safety standards in all sorts of fields have been met with the cynical assumption that the truth has more to do with an attempt to preserve a cushy way of life. But the POA\u2019s warnings are backed by concrete evidence. In the year to June, there were about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/02/prison-violence-crisis-talks-elizabeth-truss-union-calls-off-protests\" title=\"\">6,000 assaults on staff</a> \u2013 an increase of 43%. Over the past four years they have risen 171%. Suicides and assaults generally are at an all-time high. In the second quarter of this year there were 9,500 detected cases of self-harm in three months and 31 self-inflicted deaths, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/28/suicides-and-assaults-in-prisons-in-england-and-wales-at-all-time-high\" title=\"\">also a record</a>. These figures should be a source of shame, but the truth is that they are hardly noticed: the persistent and uncivilised decline of our prisons is simply not surprising any more. And when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/03/prisoner-arrested-after-death-at-surrey-jail\" title=\"\">7,000 officers have been made redundant</a> in the past six years \u2013 or about 30% \u2013 it is entirely logical that the ability of the remainder to manage a safe prison estate has been drastically compromised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f800a05eae4ff4973a8e74e0c847f105fbdf704f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f800a05eae4ff4973a8e74e0c847f105fbdf704f/0_38_5727_3436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene outside Bedford prison on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scene outside Bedford prison on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week, Truss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/02/prisons-in-england-and-wales-given-boost-of-2500-new-staff-to-tackle-violence\" title=\"\">announced the recruitment</a> of 2,500 new officers at the cost of \u00a3104m \u2013 a start, but a small one against the scale of the previous reduction (when it is, anyway, not as if the prison estate in 2010 could be characterised as a rehabilitative utopia). If she is unwilling or unable to find the money to make the more significant investment needed, what else is she going to do? Not take steps to reduce the prison population, she insists: such a step would be \u201carbitrary\u201d. And yet when Hardwick was leaving, he argued forcefully that a large proportion of the prison population simply shouldn\u2019t be there because they had mental health problems, or were guilty of minor crimes for which a custodial sentence was actively counterproductive. In these cases, it is incarceration that seems arbitrary, not the idea that there might be a better way to deal with the problem.</p> <p>If Truss is really concerned about the risks that come with \u201carbitrary\u201d changes to the prisons system, she will have to go much further in reversing the cuts that Grayling instituted years ago, and which were always motivated not by the security and rehabilitation of inmates \u2013 and hence the security of the rest of us \u2013 but by the bottom line.</p> <p>In the meantime, we should get used to the kind of trouble that unfolded yesterday at Bedford. Blame the prisoners if you want, but they do not exist in a vacuum; their disorder is a howl of protest at a system that is simply not fit to keep them safe, and their plight is a stain on our national conscience.</p>",

  "<p>Presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years. They fit the great-man or -woman narrative of history, seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are. They erase our memory of grassroots power, direct democracy and civil society. Leaders beget followers; people pin their hopes on one person, and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office. Or, they wash their hands of any further involvement if it\u2019s not their one person. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We forget our own influence, the innumerable times we\u2019ve swayed outcome</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And so it is this time around. With the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all fights, it sometimes seems as though we\u2019ve lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not them, and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power. The intensely personal nature of this campaign \u2013 and the particular danger of Donald Trump \u2013 has created a kind of tunnel vision.</p> <p>Which is not to say that the outcome is unimportant. Far from it. Many Clinton supporters seem quietly confident of a win. I am less complacent. We\u2019ve had enough surprises this year \u2013 in Britain, in Colombia \u2013 to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them. A Trump presidency would be a terrible thing. But a Clinton victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with relief, sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream. A Clinton victory, in fact, would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign. </p> <p>A politician is not a given. Each one is in part what we make them, by pushing, blocking, pressuring, encouraging, fighting, reframing, emphasizing, organizing. Every election season we pretend that one person will have all the power and that whatever they promise up front is exactly who they\u2019ll be, for better or worse. We forget our own influence, the innumerable times we\u2019ve swayed outcomes, such as the decision to veto the Keystone XL pipeline. We forget the way culture and activism set the norms for political decisions on matters such as same-sex marriage rights.</p> <p>Election seasons erase the memory of movements that worked for years or decades, outside and around, below and above electoral politics. They drown out the histories that matter: how women got the vote, how the civil rights movement progressed, how the Free Trade Area of the Americas trade deal withered and died, how the World Trade Organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great 1999 shutdown in Seattle, how fracking got banned in New York State, how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse. In all these cases, the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the people.</p> <p>To reiterate: it matters who is president, but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do themselves, and what the House and Senate send them or sabotage. </p> <p>Mitt Romney promised to build the Keystone XL pipeline himself if elected; Republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the fossil-fuel industry. Democrats are not necessarily our friends or allies, but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed. Obama wavered on that pipeline for several years. When he vetoed it, it was not because of who he is, but because of who we are, we the members of a climate movement that organized, educated, campaigned, blockaded and demonstrated for years, building a powerful movement. </p> <p>That the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement did: it educated us on the science, made the case for the urgency and importance of action, built global coalitions, shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice issue, started innumerable campaigns to block pipelines, divest, implement efficiency and good design, and shift to renewable resources. A lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as cities, regions and states have done great work on climate, led by community organizers, small groups and minor politicians you\u2019ll never hear about. </p> <p>The Obama administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the corporations, well-organized conservatives and big-money interests. Which is not to even raise the question of that administration\u2019s principles; it\u2019s more useful to ask what are our own, if most of us do little or nothing about policies we deplore or ideals we praise. </p> <p>The same will be true of a Clinton administration, if that\u2019s the one voters choose on Tuesday. The extent to which it serves the interests of people and our planet depends in part on the extent to which citizens apply pressure to it. You may feel exhausted right now; tired of a bruising cycle which has left no personal stone unturned (often to the detriment of policy scrutiny). But the truth is, we\u2019re at the beginning \u2013 either of a period of sustained resistance against a racist, misogynist, deranged climate-denier \u2013 or a period of sustained action to push the first female president to deliver a genuinely progressive, climate-conscious agenda. </p> <p>If we end up with a Democrat (and I regret that that\u2019s the best choice we get in this binary election), a lot is up to us. That\u2019s a gift and a responsibility. I\u2019ll take it. I hope you\u2019ll join me. </p>",
  "<p>Not long after he launched his rocket of a campaign last summer, Donald Trump walked into a gathering of hardcore conservative activists in Nashville, Tennessee. Meeting a Manhattan businessman with no clear ideological discipline, the crowd could have been skeptical at best and hostile at worst. </p> <p> The National Federation of Republican Assemblies casts itself as the keeper of the flame of modern conservatives, claiming a big role in the Goldwater and Reagan revolutions that defined the party for a generation. \u201cWe are the Republican wing of the Republican party,\u201d the group likes to say.</p> <p> The group would go on to endorse Ted Cruz, but at the time members happily ignored Trump\u2019s flip-flops on abortion and his lack of religious roots to cheer on his anti-establishment war cry.</p> <p> \u201cYou know, I\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d he claimed. \u201cBut I\u2019m just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens \u2013 they become weak \u2026 Then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go: \u2018Oh, I made it, darling, I made it. I vote for you. I vote for you. I vote for Obamacare expansions. I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do. I\u2019m in Washington.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing. Isn\u2019t it amazing? Don\u2019t you agree? It won\u2019t happen to me, I promise. And if it does, you can let me know about it. But it won\u2019t. I promise.

Its leader, Donald Trump, dreaming big, building bigger.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the outlandish assertions to emerge from Trump\u2019s mouth, this one is by far the most credible. Win or lose, Trump has catalyzed a movement that has destroyed the conventional wisdom \u2013 and the establishment \u2013 that has led the Republican party for a generation. Whether he built the movement or simply rode its wave, Trump has profoundly reshaped the politics of the Grand Old Party. From his opposition to trade to his admiration for Putin, from his authoritarian tendencies to his anti-Nato stance, Trump has trampled across several red lines of Republican politics. In many ways, the biggest unknown in American politics is not about the winner of Tuesday\u2019s election; it\u2019s about the future of the Republican party and the power it continues to wield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/my-year-with-donald-trump-campaign-2016-election\">My year with Trump: covering a curiosity that became a dark phenomenon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are several GOP establishment types who believe that Trump\u2019s hold on the GOP is weak.

That moment came at a high point of President George W Bush\u2019s power, soon after his re-election in 2004.</p> <p>At the time, the establishment consensus was clear about the rise of Latino voters. Republicans could not afford to concede them to Democrats, and instead could win them over with an agenda of family values, faith and support for small business.</p> <p>So when Bush pushed for immigration reform in 2005, he fully expected his political capital to pay dividends. Instead, he found himself outflanked and outgunned by House Republicans and nativist hosts on conservative talk radio. A comprehensive approach died that year and a more limited version was killed two years later, just as the financial crisis was beginning to emerge.</p> <p>The crash of 2008, and the Great Recession that followed, transformed a political landscape that was already shifting against the pro-business, pro-immigration culture that once represented mainstream Republican opinion.</p> <p>Steve Schmidt was a senior staffer on Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign and in effect campaign manager of McCain\u2019s 2008 effort as the economy collapsed. He sees the emergence of Trump and Bernie Sanders as part of a far bigger shift in global politics that threatens the security and economic order we have known since the second world war.</p> <p>\u201cThe absolute acquiescence of the Republican establishment, who discarded a generation of conservative ideology at the knees of an authoritarian wannabe, and the fact that someone so manifestly unprepared intellectually, emotionally and morally came this close to achieving real power in this country is a historic event that is truly unprecedented,\u201d says Schmidt. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/03/trump-supporters-us-elections\">What I learned after 100,000 miles on the road talking to Trump supporters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe notion that there\u2019s a snap-back to normal is naive in my view.

  "<p>I wouldn\u2019t call myself a baker, but I have found myself baking bread in some unusual situations; cowboy bread in big cast-iron pots around campfires, and flatbreads on a fire pit on a Navajo reservation in Arizona. I spent a few days working in a supermarket bakery, baking loaves from frozen in vast, eerie ovens. But the jewel in the crown, and where I learned the most about bread, was a few months spent baking with my dear friend <a href=\"http://www.hobbshousebakery.co.uk/blogs/bread-heads-bakers/146622791-tom-herbert\">Tom Herbert,</a> from Hobbs House bakery just outside Bristol. Tom comes from a <a href=\"http://www.hobbshousebakery.co.uk/pages/our-bakery\">long family line of amazing bakers</a>. He taught me a lot about bread.</p> <p>So many people avoid bread these days \u2013 some for serious health reasons. For others, a lot of it is probably down to bad bread. The standard loaves our generation has grown up with have a lot to answer for \u2013 I\u2019ve seen first hand what goes into them, and it\u2019s no wonder a lot of people react badly. Most of them have a long list of additives, as you can see for yourself by looking on the labels. The industrial process strips the flour of most of its goodness and can be processed so fast it feels as if the last bit of fermenting is done in our stomachs.</p> <p>My time in the supermarket bakery changed how I look at bread, and I buy the best stuff I can get my hands on. My local bakery is a couple of miles away, but I make the effort to pass by there once a week. They make sourdough breads that we eat with at least one meal a day. This is small-batch stuff, mostly using a sourdough starter, allowing long, slow proves to let the yeast do all its work: a completely different experience. Sure, it is a little dearer \u2013 but a proper crust means it lasts longer, so less is wasted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/31/quick-saffron-polenta-bake-recipe-charred-mushrooms-anna-jones-the-modern-cook\">Anna Jones\u2019 recipes for quick polenta bakes made two ways | The modern cook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the nights draw in, I am drawn to baking bread \u2013 it\u2019s the sort of cooking that allows me to switch off for the day and, more often than not, it happens at the weekend with a little boy kicking at my heels. I follow my wise mother-in-law\u2019s advice when I do it \u2013 baking two loaves, keeping one fresh and slicing one for the freezer.</p> <p>I like a bread with a mix of a white flour \u2013 usually white spelt for a good rise, a nice crumb and a lightness that toasts well \u2013 and another more interesting and textured wholemeal or rye flour for some depth.</p> <p>The recipes that follow are my current favourite loaves: one half spelt and half rye, with a little honey and lots of seeds \u2013 it\u2019s a rye bread that isn\u2019t too serious, but has that malty, savoury back note that rye brings.</p> <p>The other is an easy soda bread, lurid pink from the beetroot and mixed with fennel and caraway to counter the sweetness of the beets, and to help with digestion.

This is delicious warm with salted or almond butter.</p> <p><strong><em>If you are roasting the beetroot yourself:</em></strong></p> <p><em>Wash the beetroot well and trim off the stalks. Place the whole beetroot in a foil parcel, wrapped really tightly so the steam doesn\u2019t escape. Cook for around an hour (depending on the size of your beetroot) until tender.

Extra roasted beetroot can be used in salads or alongside dips such as hummus.</em></p> <h2><strong>Seeded rye bread (main picture)<br></strong></h2> <p>The darker the rye flour you use the more deep and savoury your bread will be. I used a dark rye flour bought from the supermarket: the rise will be a little slower than a normal bread as rye flour is heavier, so don\u2019t expect the usual doubling in size; it will rise by about half. A teaspoon of spices \u2013 cumin, caraway and fennel \u2013 all make a lovely addition here, too.</p> <p><strong>Makes 1 x 800g loaf</strong><br>2 tsp (10g) dried yeast<br>350g warm water<br>3 tbsp runny honey<br>250g dark rye flour<br>250g white spelt flour<br>1 tsp fine sea salt<br>50g seeds, plus extra to sprinkle (I use poppy and sunflower)<br>Olive oil, for greasing</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Dissolve the yeast in the warm water, add the honey and set aside.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Combine both flours in a large mixing bowl along with the salt and seeds, then mix well.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Pour the yeast and water over the flours. Mix first with a fork, then with your hands, until you have a sticky dough. Tip it out on to a floured chopping board or work surface. Form the dough into a ball, then knead by hand, pulling and stretching the dough for 4-5 minutes. If you have a stand mixer with a dough hook you can use it to get the dough to this point.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Lightly oil the bowl, then return the dough to it, cover with a tea towel or clingfilm and set aside in a warm place for about an hour, or until the dough has risen by half (remember it won\u2019t rise as much as a normal loaf because of the rye flour).</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Remove the dough from the bowl, put on a lightly floured board and knead again briefly \u2013 for just a minute or two.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Shape the dough into a flat oval and put it on an floured baking tray. Cover with the tea towel again and leave to rise once more for 30 minutes or so, until it has risen by half again. Preheat the oven to 240C/475F/gas mark 9.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> After 30 minutes, use a sharp knife to slash the top of the dough in a criss\u2011cross pattern, then scatter the seeds over the top.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Half-fill a deep baking tray with boiling water and put it on the bottom of your oven. This will create steam as the loaf bakes and help give your bread a lovely crust and texture.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Bake the loaf for 30\u201335 minutes, or until golden all over. Be really careful when you open the oven door, as some hot steam may come out. To check if your bread is ready, lift it up and give it a tap on the bottom. If it sounds hollow, like a drum, it\u2019s good to go. Cool on a wire rack so the bottom keeps its lovely crust.</p> <h2>Baker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tom_Herbert_\">Tom Herbert</a>\u2019s tips for baking at home</h2> <p><strong>Don\u2019t be a flour floozy </strong>Flours might look the same but they aren\u2019t.

Here, Facebook has a grip on society like nowhere else, and few Instagram accounts express Joinville as well as, ironically, the local newspaper\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anoticia/\">account</a>, which shows a more intimate view of the city than most personal accounts.<br></p> <h2><strong>Biggest controversy</strong></h2> <p>In 2014, the city was (and still is, to a lesser degree) <a href=\"http://anoticia.clicrbs.com.br/sc/geral/noticia/2014/09/carros-parados-sobre-corredor-de-onibus-voltam-a-gerar-polemica-em-joinville-4599551.html\">overtaken</a> by a heated debate over bus lanes. Parents at one of Joinville\u2019s private schools were using one of the most important bus lanes in the city for parking space, so they could pick their kids up hassle-free. And this was even after city hall built a special overpass for that exact purpose in 1998.</p> <p>Students and parents refused to use the overpass and a civil movement, <em>N\u00e3o \u00e9 S\u00f3 Pelo Corredor,</em> was formed in defence of the bus lane. However, a local columnist claimed that, since the school came before the lane and donated the land for the street, it had the right to ignore legislation. And so the city, civil activists and the school went to court over whether or not the school had the right to park in the bus lane. </p> <p>At the height of the controversy, the school was adamant in refusing any solutions other than \u201cremoving the bus lane from our parking space\u201d. In a judicial tug-of-war, the school lost the case, went to a <a href=\"http://ndonline.com.br/joinville/noticias/liminar-obriga-prefeitura-de-joinville-a-reabrir-vagas-de-estacionamento-em-corredor-de-onibus\">higher court</a> and got a court order preserving the parking. The court order got repealed by another judge and in the end the surreal parking space inside a bus lane was removed. </p> <h2><strong>Worst building</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0e19d84dada4f4e7d105cf752febdb91db79efe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e19d84dada4f4e7d105cf752febdb91db79efe/81_0_2479_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crumbling reminders of the past.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crumbling reminders of the past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aline Seitenfus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A very ugly representation of the worst problem in our local public space \u2013 and very nearly falling apart \u2013 is the old Migrant\u2019s Hotel in Rua XV de Novembro.

While a seemingly a trivial affair (a dead animal in a city river is not usually a huge historical event for most cities), but for the last 15 years the reptile was one of the incentives to reduce pollution on the river. After all, there aren\u2019t many cities who can claim to have a live alligator as their mascot. The sad news was followed by a report showing that there are far more alligators on the river than just Fritz and his two mates, Jaca and Lacoste, and sightings of other gators in the river lead to doubts over the death of the beloved mascot. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq75O6WtIZA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qq75O6WtIZA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>Best local artist</strong> </h2> <p>Novelist, journalist, and comic book writer <a href=\"https://garotadistraida.wordpress.com/\">Vanessa Bencz</a> rose to prominence in 2014 with her graphic novel <em>Menina Distra\u00edda </em>(Girl Distracted), which deals with bullying and emotional pressure in schools, including from teachers.

Both are gathering spots for rising poets, writers and protesters, with gatherings and <em>Saraus </em>(an event held to promote artistic expression) most Fridays. Another option are the <em>Ocupa Cidadela</em> gatherings on the Cidadela Cultural near the Art Museum. Announced over Facebook and organised by local social movements, those events are marked by alt bands and discussion of social issues.</p> <p> While the National Immigration and Colonisation Museum is a must-see, at night the area around it is best avoided. Poor lighting make the beautiful Palm Street one of the most crime-ridden areas of the city centre after dark. </p> <h2><strong>What does your city do better than anywhere else?</strong></h2> <p>For most locals, Joinville is a city of two things: industry, and more industry. But for most outsiders and especially<em> </em>for a week and a half per year, Joinville shows its true colours and its real talent: dancing. Joinville hosts the only Bolshoi Ballet School outside Russia and the world\u2019s largest dance festival, hosted yearly in late July, the <a href=\"http://www.festivaldedanca.com.br/\">Festival de Dan\u00e7a de Joinville</a> hosts over 6,000 dancers in various styles, from the classics to modern street and urban dancing. The festival has taken place annually since 1985, and is growing in popularity each year. The Bolshoi School opened in 2000, and in 2005 the festival was honoured as the largest in the world by the Guinness Book of Records.</p> <h2><strong>How green is your city?</strong></h2> <p>We are slowly improving our city\u2019s green credentials. Once the most polluted river in the state, the Cachoeira River might be the best example of how Joinville is cleaning itself up and changing the old ways of the past. Beginning in 2001, the river has seen progressive changes, with new legislation against chemical pollution, changes in sewage treatment (which rose from less than 3% of the city in 1999 to 40% today) and public awareness, spurred on in part by our former reptilian mascot.</p> <h2>Smell of the city?</h2> <p>Given the pollution in the river, the old chemical smell near its banks has been replaced by a (still terrible) earthy odour, and the formerly toxic waterway now hosts schools of fish, cranes, alligators, capybaras and even fishing bats. But where the stench is concerned, there is still much more to be improved. The rest of Joinville has your average urban fragrance, except when it rains \u2013 then the whole city has a peculiar earthy pong that isn\u2019t quite as unpleasant as the river\u2019s smell, but your nostrils will certainly notice it.<br></p> <p><strong>Five to follow</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chuvaacida.info/\">Chuva \u00c1cida</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jessiemichels/\">Jessiemichels</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlesvoos?lang=pt\">Charlesvoos</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EEEguaaa/?fref=ts&amp;__mref=message_bubble\">\u00c9\u00c9\u00c9\u00e9guaaa</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Metranca/?fref=ts\">Metranca</a></p> <h2>From me</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23045d1003660c1e61206882d50249089f29b9a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23045d1003660c1e61206882d50249089f29b9a9/0_400_2827_1696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joinville journalist, Pedro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joinville journalist, Pedro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scheila Silveira</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pedro Leal writes on pop culture and politics in the city of Joinville and translates independent books for a living.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/tesco-bank-freezes-transactions-online-attack\">Current account customers at Tesco Bank have had online payments frozen</a> after tens of thousands of accounts were attacked by fraudsters.</p> <h2><strong>How many people were affected?</strong></h2> <p>The bank said suspicious transactions had been spotted on around 40,000 accounts, and that money was taken from around 20,000 customers. Many account holders reported losing hundreds of pounds, with one customer telling the Guardian that more than \u00a32,400 had been taken. Tesco Bank will not say how much money is involved in total.</p> <h2><strong>So what happened?</strong></h2> <p>The bank says it fell victim to online criminal activity. Tesco spotted suspicious activity on accounts on Saturday evening and texted customers who had been affected. Several people have reported that their accounts show transactions made overseas, such as in Spain and Brazil. A criminal investigation has been launched.</p> <h2><strong>How was its security breached?</strong></h2> <p>Tesco has not given any details, but technology specialists have speculated on what might have happened. Cliff Moyce, global head of financial services at technology firm DataArt, said the chance of the problem being cause by a \u201cremote technical hack\u201d was less than 50%. \u201cFar more likely is the (in)action of a human actor, or weak process/management controls when information is shared between providers,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/21/safe-internet-banking-cyber-security-online\">So you think you\u2019re safe doing internet banking?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moyce said Tesco would need to investigate the possibility of an \u201ceconomic hack\u201d in which an offshore employee is offered a large sum of money in return for a tranche of customer data. \u201cBut incompetence rather than ill intent from an employee or subcontractor remains the more likely factor to be correlated with the malintent of the criminals,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ed Macnair, chief executive of cloud security company CensorNet, agreed that a remote attack was unlikely. \u201cPeople are the weakest link for most organisations, and I would not be at all surprised if that\u2019s the case here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to remotely hack into a network without some sort of assistance \u2013 which is often provided accidentally. People tend to do stupid things, like reusing passwords or clicking on random links, giving hackers the access they need.\u201d </p> <p>Moyce suggests that the hack was timed for the weekend when banks have reduced staff and the response time will have been slower than during the week. \u201cAutomated fraud detection systems appear to have worked well, but a lack of people at desks will not have helped,\u201d he said. </p> <h2><strong>What happens now?</strong></h2> <p>An investigation by the National Crime Agency is under way. For customers, the bank says it plans to return to normal service as soon as possible. It has said that all direct debits and bill payments will go through as usual, and people can still withdraw cash and use their debit cards. Customers should also still be able to log in to online banking and check their accounts.</p> <p>But there will be some disruption \u2013 those affected can still use their debit cards, but will be sent new ones within seven to 10 days.</p> <h2><strong>Will customers be compensated?</strong></h2> <p>Tesco Bank has told customers that it will refund accounts as soon as possible, hopefully on Monday, and cover any financial loss that they have suffered as a result of the fraud. For some customers who have paid penalties to other organisations, perhaps because of missed payments, this may mean providing proof to Tesco of those losses.</p> <h2>What should customers do?</h2> <p>As well as keeping an eye on their account, the chief executive of Get Safe Online, Tony Neate, said they should change their passwords immediately.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d also strongly advise people to change the security question they get when forgetting their passwords, as these answers may have been compromised as a result of this breach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would also suggest that Tesco customers look at any other online accounts they currently have to make sure that no suspicious activity has been taking place \u2013 particularly if you have used the same login details, which is something you should never do.\u201d </p> <p>Although not directly linked to their Tesco Bank account, Neate said cyber criminals may have been able to gain access to personal information which could potentially help them unlock other online accounts.</p> <h2><strong>Will customers stick around?</strong></h2> <p>Tesco Bank offers a competitive current account: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/05/tesco-3-per-cent-current-account-santander-halved-rate-123-account-savers\">it is paying 3% interest on balances of up to \u00a33,000</a>. This may be enough to keep and attract some people. Previously, RBS managed to keep hold of customers after IT problems that went on for weeks. </p> <p>Others may decide to go elsewhere. On Twitter some said they would be off. One customer said this was not the first time it had happened, and that it was \u201cTime to move to a secure bank\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tweet from Tesco Bank customer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This has happened before at Tesco Bank.

  "<p>Masked anti-capitalism and pro-civil liberties protesters descended on central London on Saturday, Guy Fawkes night, to march near the Houses of Parliament. </p> <p>Supporters of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous\">Anonymous</a> hacking collective wore Guy Fawkes masks in reference to the cult pro-revolution film V for Vendetta. Young and older people marched together, shouting and holding banners declaring: \u201cCapitalism, monarchy, change, revolution\u201d.</p> <p>Despite an increased police presence and stricter rules on protest boundaries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/06/dozens-of-arrests-at-million-mask-march-in-central-london\">the march was largely peaceful</a>, though by 10.45pm there had been 47 arrests, the majority for drug offences and obstruction.</p> <p>We asked attendees why they took part in the demonstration. Here\u2019s what they said:</p> <h2>\u2018I am protesting against the rise in xenophobia\u2019</h2> <p>I feel really strongly about the situation in our country and feel that I need to do something. I\u2019ve never taken part before but I am protesting against the recent rise in xenophobia in our country and the government\u2019s lack of initiative to do anything about it. Being English, I am ashamed of our collective behaviour over the past few months since the Brexit vote. I voted leave but I did not anticipate the wave of racism that followed, and I am deeply disturbed and embarrassed by what Britain now stands for and how the rest of the world views us.</p> <p><strong>Gareth Smith, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The 99% are getting stronger and more people are waking up\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0adc98c19c80792b25353a24fd9b5cc4d76bd2f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0adc98c19c80792b25353a24fd9b5cc4d76bd2f4/0_0_5500_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters climb the base of Nelson\u2019s column chanting \u2018One solution: revolution\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters climb the base of Nelson\u2019s column chanting \u2018One solution: revolution\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GuardianWitness/Sergei Petrazhitski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People are beginning to stand up against the bullying, exploitation and oppression by the people at the top, the global elite, who are wealthy beyond anything we could imagine. I have been to most of the marches and do so because I support Anonymous and the Occupy movement. </p> <p>People have been bought by money for centuries, and ordinary people will go along with it because of the carrot being dangled. Money is a huge illusion: money is debt; we have been enslaved by money. Now they want to control us completely in this New World Order scenario. We, the people, say no. Enough is enough. We are turning back to caring for each other and for the planet. </p> <p>The 99% are getting stronger, more people are waking up, and it is really important at this point in human history that we stand up to the tyranny of the corrupt governments that back the corporations that are destroying the planet. </p> <p>I have always spoken to the police and had interesting discussions with them. Many protesters feel negative stories about violence are set-ups by the police, and I would tend to agree with that. The police are there to do their jobs, which pay their rent and mortgages. They are just like us, and many feel sympathy with the cause. Hopefully one day soon they will take off their helmets and join us. </p> <p>I have been to all but one of these protests. It is great to be with other people who feel as passionately about corruption and want to see big changes. It\u2019s always interesting \u2013 meeting lovely people, having fun \u2013 but also feeling that we need to be doing this. It\u2019s a drop in the ocean but this movement is not going to go away. If we can get more people to wake up to what is going on, then fantastic.</p> <p>I have always believed in standing up to oppression and tyranny. It is our duty to do so. We have been fed so many lies \u2013 and the media is mostly propaganda to maintain people as units of production and consumption. </p> <p>V for Vendetta provides the image of the Guy Fawkes mask, but it feels as though our future could be like that if they think they can get away with it.

The ignorance of a large portion of a nation, because of a corrupt media and unelected bunch of leaders.</p> <p>Do you think the civil rights movements in the US in the 60s and 70s were allowed? No, they don\u2019t want us to protest, not just because of the potential violence but to block our freedoms and rights. The police try this every year, and with about 0.5% of the people there acting in a violent way, they feel it\u2019s justified. Last year, no one in the main march had any idea of this police car being blown up. The march went nowhere near Scotland Yard. Funny that there was a whole group of news reporters stood conveniently near the vehicle when it happened, yet I probably saw about one reporter near the march for the whole evening. Something fishy was going on there. </p> <p>It\u2019s exhilarating \u2013 until you see someone throw a firework at a police horse. But that was just one guy, clearly an idiot, and he deserved to be arrested. I\u2019ve spoken to a number of police each year and some have expressed sympathy as many have had their own pensions and benefits cut. However, the majority of them are arrogant and see themselves as better. They view us as a bunch of criminals, though we are also protesting for their sake. </p> <p>I\u2019ve offered officers Mini Cheddars because they looked hungry. Most have turned up their noses at them but the odd one or two were really grateful. I also witnessed many people being arrested for not moving behind a certain line the police had made up. The officers were trying to scare everyone off by pretending to arrest this guy but all they got was abuse from the crowds.</p> <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Bob, 22, Southampton </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b979f2d2dbeb718a2510ffcc4e0acead5014276e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b979f2d2dbeb718a2510ffcc4e0acead5014276e/0_0_5500_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters wore Guy Fawkes masks in reference to the film V for Vendetta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters wore Guy Fawkes masks in reference to the film V for Vendetta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GuardianWitness/Sergei Petrazhitski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018We are being manipulated into believing austerity is in our best interest\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m annoyed at the current status quo of our elected representatives riding roughshod over the needs of the people who pay their taxes and keep the wheels turning. Decisions are made by faceless individuals in Whitehall and elsewhere. We are being deceived and manipulated into believing austerity is in our best interest yet public services are being decimated. </p> <p>These protests represent a group of like-minded individuals coming together to demonstrate their frustration and unhappiness at a system that is rigged in favour of an elite of unelected cabals who have undue influence over the lives of working people. It\u2019s theatre, with an undercurrent of violence aimed at the property of big companies and police dressed in riot gear.</p> <p>I try to attend as much as I can. I protested outside parliament on the eve of the Syria bombing. It didn\u2019t change a thing. I went along to the anti-dolphins-slaughter demo last year. That was fun. Didn\u2019t change a thing either. I used to go to the May Day protests but now don\u2019t as they inevitably end up in a kettle. But they didn\u2019t change a thing. I went to the anti-Iraq war demo. I remember seeing \u201c1,000,000 people on the streets of London\u201d on the boards at Piccadilly Circus and thinking: \u201cWe\u2019ve cracked it! They have to listen to us!\u201d but, as we now know, they didn\u2019t. </p> <p>I don\u2019t believe protesting can change much in Britain. But the point is that that we still have to protest, we still have to demonstrate our displeasure at things we don\u2019t agree with or they \u2013 whoever they are \u2013 will continue unchecked. </p> <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Antony, 36, teacher</strong></p>",

But amid all this desolation Trump gains three things. He fuels doubt and fear, leaving people vulnerable; he denigrates his opposition en masse, blaming the world on them; and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage. </p> <h2>Embiggen big league</h2> <p>Like a man who once took <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/04/media/donald-trump-fingers-hands/\">a joke</a> about the size of his hands too hard, Trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as possible, from his never-proven $10bn worth (Forbes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/09/28/the-definitive-look-at-donald-trumps-wealth-new/#3d4c500d7e2d\">estimates</a> $3.7bn) to crowds at his rallies and his success in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/donald-trump-fact-check-debate-polls-us-jobs\">meaningless</a> internet polls.</p> <p>This self-inflation is pierced throughout by paperwork.

He ignores that reporters quote him extensively, call his campaign for comment, interview his supporters, his rival\u2019s campaign and independent voters and experts. He often cites news stories about Clinton, and even praised fact-checkers in a presidential debate for catching her in a falsehood.</p> <p>At every rally, Trump says the cameras refuse to show his audience, even though his campaign <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/how-donald-trump-bent-television-to-his-will\">forces cameras to stay within a small pen</a>, where they pan to show the crowd \u2013 as anyone at his rallies or watching online can see. Only one camera at each event stays fixed on Trump: the shared \u201cpool\u201d camera, whose footage networks share and which stays on Trump so as not to miss his speech.</p> <p>Last week, NBC\u2019s Katy Tur, a target for criticism from the podium, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisgolden/status/794024376496553985\">noted</a> that Trump \u201chas joked in private with reporters about how he understands how the pool camera works\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a shtick that he does to rile up his base,\u201d she said, \u201cto give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his favor, to give them an excuse to berate someone that\u2019s not Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s scorched earth insults, like his attacks on other institutions, try to delegitimize authority and leave only himself in its place. But while most Americans still respect <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/7177/americans-respect-military-honor-veterans.aspx\">other institutions</a> that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-suggests-fire-the-generals-227862\">Trump</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">has</a> <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-father-fallen-soldier-ive-made-lot/story?id=41015051\">demeaned</a>, the press was vulnerable.

No evidence supports the claim of widespread fraud and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-fact-check-rigged-election-voter\">decentralized electoral college makes such a conspiracy functionally impossible</a> \u2013 but the claim gives Trump something to blame failure on besides himself.

For example, <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/story/tech/science/watchdog-earth/2016/10/10/trump-looks-burn-coal-1000-years/91850954/\">he wants to burn coal indefinitely</a> because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">he denies the climate change consequences</a>. Trump also wants to <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trump-zero-out-federal-clean-energy-56cca794790#.rdszdpyie\">eliminate government spending on clean energy and climate research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trumps-tax-plan-now-favors-the-ultra-rich-even-more/\">cut taxes predominantly for the most wealthy</a>, build a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602494/bad-math-props-up-trumps-border-wall/\">costly and pointless border wall</a>, engage in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/donald-trumps-immigration-tab-166-billion-121500\">expensive mass deportations</a>, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/trump-dodd-frank-wall-street/\">deregulate the financial industry</a>. Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/\">extensive policy plans</a> are <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/3/13318750/hillary-clinton-vision-government\">effectively the opposite</a> of Trump\u2019s.<br></p> <p>Many are puzzled that a candidate with such generally unpopular policy plans and who has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/01/the-kkks-official-newspaper-has-endorsed-donald-trump-for-president/\">endorsed by the KKK</a> could be supported by over 40% of Americans and have a chance at winning the presidency of the United States. Unfortunately <a href=\"http://www.shapingtomorrowsworld.org/lewandowskyTrumpUK.html\">we seem to have entered a post-truth era</a> in which facts simply don\u2019t matter. <br></p> <p>The two American political parties have become so different that <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13496688/swing-voters-dying-cartoon\">swing voters have virtually gone extinct</a> and most conservatives would vote for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Ed\">Mister Ed</a>, were he the Republican Party nominee. Political ideology trumps facts, truth, and reality. And Trump\u2019s support comes heavily from a single demographic: white men, mostly older and without a college degree.<br></p> <h2><strong>Trump wants to regress to the white male-dominated 1950s<br></strong></h2> <p>The Trump campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d suggests that he wants to return the country to some bygone era. Based on the candidate\u2019s words and his supporters\u2019 feelings about science, women, and minorities, that era resembles the 1950s.</p> <p>In the 1950s, only about <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2000/feb/wk3/art03.htm\">one-third of women participated in the American work force</a>, and African-Americans were still fighting for equality in <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement\">the Civil Rights Movement</a>. The tobacco industry created the playbook followed by the fossil fuel industry today:<a href=\"http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/21/2/87.full\"> spread misinformation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/\">sow doubt</a> to keep the public consuming its deadly products.<a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762370.html\"> Nearly half of Americans smoked cigarettes</a> in the 1950s (as compared to <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig_smoking/\">under 17% today</a>). The tobacco industry <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/TobaccoExplained.pdf\">already knew that smoking caused cancer</a>, but used the denial playbook to keep Americans puffing.<br></p> <p>These characteristics fit the era that Trump and his supporters appear to yearn for \u2013 an era in which white men dominated American society. Older, white male Americans who comprise the core of Donald Trump\u2019s base are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/04/the-similarities-between-trump-support-and-climate-denial\">the predominant climate science-denying group in the country</a>. Social scientists theorize this is due to the group\u2019s historical societal advantages. They have benefited from the societal status quo, and hence are least concerned with risks, especially when addressing those risks would mean changing the status quo from which they benefited.</p> <h2><strong>Like it or not, the status quo is changing</strong></h2> <p>White, male Americans are in the process of losing those historical societal advantages. As minority populations grow, they\u2019re losing their grip on the American majority. The first racial minority president was elected and re-elected. Women are <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/qf-laborforce-10.htm\">approaching even footing with men in the labor force</a>. Even social norms are changing, for example with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court\">gay marriage becoming legal</a>.</p> <p>And of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/21/global-warming-continues-2016-will-be-the-hottest-year-ever-recorded\">the Earth\u2019s climate itself is changing rapidly</a> due to human-caused global warming, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/24/the-atmosphere-is-being-radicalized-by-climate-change\">causing all sorts of negative consequences</a>. Climate scientists are <a href=\"http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2016/11/dont-make-a-choice-that-your-children-will-regret/\">pleading with American voters not to make a choice our children will regret</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>You have a fateful choice to make.

Only by continuing the progress we\u2019ve made toward cutting carbon pollution can we slow global warming. Problems are not solved by denying their existence.</p> <p>America has many great characteristics; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/28/obama-hillary-clinton-convention-speech-trump\">many argue the country is <em>already</em> great</a>. But like every country, there are also dark periods in its past; for example, in the treatment of minorities and women as second-class citizens. Donald Trump aims to return America to those deplorable periods, and to put the world on a path toward a catastrophic future by undoing the progress we\u2019ve made in tackling climate change.</p> <p>The world is counting on Americans not to make a catastrophically wrong choice in tomorrow\u2019s election.<br></p>",

They have closed down more than 200 media outlets and publishing houses, more than 100 universities and hospitals, and expelled 100,000 teachers, academics and civil servants.

At the time, no TV channel in Turkey covered the protests. In fact, one of the biggest news channels was broadcasting a documentary about penguins while whole streets in Istanbul were filled with people clashing with police. Since then, the phrase \u201cpenguin media\u201d has been commonly understood in my country.</p> <p>The government exercise a pernicious influence over Turkish broadcasters, meaning that people have turned their attention towards social media platforms and independent websites to get their news.

The latest development was the arrest of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/turkey-arrests-pro-kurdish-party-leaders-mps\" title=\"\">Selahattin Demirta\u015f and Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f</a>, co-leaders of the pro-Kurdish party HDP, alongside some of their MPs, on Friday.

During both incidents, the internet was cut off and social media accounts were out of reach across the country.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan recently extended the state of emergency and is using it to the advantage of the ruling party. The AKP now has \u201clegal\u201d permission to bypass parliament and rule by decree. For example, they recently removed the rights of universities to appoint their own rector in free elections. From now on, Erdo\u011fan himself will appoint the head of each university.</p> <p>While all of these things are happening in Turkey, most people are unaware of them due to media restrictions and bias. The majority of TV channels won\u2019t cover certain stories or will broadcast them in a distorted way. On the other hand, these channels will live broadcast all of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speeches, as was the case on 12 January this year when a suicide bomb attack killed 10 tourists in Istanbul. Erdo\u011fan gave a speech on the same day and dedicated a mere 44 seconds to the tragedy without mentioning the attacker\u2019s link to Isis. However, he spoke for exactly 10 minutes about Academics for Peace, a group of university teachers who signed a declaration demanding a peaceful solution to the Kurdish conflict.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/16/turkey-media-repression-general-mayhem-erdogan\">General Mayhem guides Turkey\u2019s media repression</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Erdo\u011fan accused them of sympathising with terrorists and of threatening Turkey\u2019s national security.

So he went back on the offensive by widening the paper\u2019s assault on \u201cone of the last great unreformed British institutions\u201d. His editorial contended:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cBy scrutinising the backgrounds of the judges, the press - which, thankfully, is still free in this country - is simply doing its job of holding the powerful to account\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s a fair enough point. And many will agree with the Mail\u2019s concern about the judiciary being \u201ca virtual closed shop, with supreme court judges largely selected by their peers\u201d. </p> <p>Many newspapers of the left have made similar arguments down the years, but what is the Mail\u2019s solution and, more pertinently, what is its motive? It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cCalls for public hearings to gauge candidates\u2019 views and any political leanings - as happens in the US - have been resisted. Isn\u2019t it time for a change? </p> <p>Surely, if judges have allegiances which may affect their decisions, the public has a right to know. For example, one of those involved in the high court ruling and several at the supreme court have links with the EU and European courts.</p> <p>How can such detail not be of relevance? Of course the high court insists its ruling was purely legalistic. But the political motivation behind the case - and those who brought it - is unashamed and transparent\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the paper doesn\u2019t explain what should happen after such hearings. Will judges with \u201cpolitical leanings\u201d unacceptable to those who oversee such public hearings - politicians? newspapers editors? - be denied their post?</p> <p>Will the public then be called upon to vote for their favourite candidates, after having the benefit of sensibly impartial advice from the Mail?</p> <p>In fact, the paper gave a clue about such advice in an article by its associate editor, Andrew Pierce, the journalist who puts the squeak in pipsqueak.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3911656/And-s-lot-lining-EU-links-judges-rule-Brexit-impact.html\">scrutiny of four law lords</a>, he highlighted their links to Europe (how scandalous). He made much of the fact that two of them (Lords Reed and Kerr) had sat on the European court of human rights. Worse still: Kerr \u201cis an unashamed champion of the human rights act brought in by the Blair government\u201d. </p> <p>As for the career of Lord Mance - who is \u201cfluent in several languages\u201d - it \u201chas been saturated in the processes of European law\u201d. And Lord Carnwath is just as bad, having been \u201csteeped in EU laws and tradition\u201d.</p> <p>Nudge, nudge to readers: don\u2019t vote for them! <br></p> <p>And here\u2019s another example of the Mail\u2019s straightforward, factual reporting. A headline across two pages on Monday said \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3910708/The-press-free-criticise-Theresa-backs-newspapers-attacks-judges-ruled-EU-deal-Parliament.html\">May backs Press in judges row</a>\u201d. But did she?<br></p> <p>In fact, her statement was even-handed between press and judiciary and, therefore, utterly unremarkable. Indeed, it was much more significant, given the storm, that she backed the judges.</p> <p>Looking way down the Mail\u2019s article was the following quote: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI believe in the value of the independence of our judiciary. I also value the freedom of our press. I think those both underpin our democracy and they are important\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in a second quote, the prime minister also said: \u201cIt is important that we have the independence of the judiciary. It is also important that we have a free press\u201d.</p> <p>So that headline could just as easily have said: \u201cMay backs judges in Press row\u201d. </p>",
  "<p>Google has been accused of hiding a competitor\u2019s webmail service from its search results in a \u201csuspicious\u201d manner for almost a year, costing the service hundreds of thousands of pounds in lost traffic.</p> <p>The company, ProtonMail, provides encrypted email accounts for users, and has been one of the most popular services of that type since its launch in 2014, as reflected by its Google search ranking: <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/blog/search-risk-google/\">the company says</a> it was placed \u201con the first or second page of most [relevant] queries including \u2018encrypted email\u2019 and \u2018secure email\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2015, however, ProtonMail\u2019s ranking plummeted, from the first page to the fifth, tenth, and, by the following spring, nowhere visible at all. \u201cAll throughout spring 2016, we worked in earnest to get in touch with Google,\u201d <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/blog/search-risk-google/\">the company says</a>. \u201cWe created two tickets on their web spam report form explaining the situation.

It has been a mixed bag in the biggest matches and now feels like the trip to Manchester United after the international break will be instructive. Against Tottenham on Sunday, they failed to make a statement and it was a source of frustration for them that they surrendered the initiative after being 1-0 up at half-time. Physically, they were flat and creatively, they came to look laboured. Arsenal have the ability to look like world-beaters but it feels impossible, at present, to make any pronouncements on their title hopes. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Arsenal 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/arsene-wenger-victor-wanyama-arsenal-tottenham-hotspur\">\u2022 Victor Wanyama was lucky not to be sent off, says Wenger</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/tottenham-mauricio-pochettino-unbeaten-arsenal\">\u2022 Pochettino happy to get through tough month still unbeaten</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/07/harry-kane-tottenham-london-derby-injury-england-fitness-test\">\u2022 Harry Kane happy with Tottenham derby performance after injury break</a></p> <h2><strong>2) Ibe needs to find consistency for Bournemouth</strong></h2> <p>Jordon Ibe has been substituted in all 11 starts since joining Bournemouth, which may seem cruel on a player who is still learning. On Saturday he was hooked at the break but Eddie Howe was right to point out the 20-year-old\u2019s only problem is a lack of consistency. Ibe was mostly ineffective in the defeat to Sunderland and while his potential is undisputed, he too often drifts in and out of games. \u201cHe has some great moments and some really good 10 or 15 minutes but he has not put it together for any consistent period, hence why he\u2019s come off the pitch,\u201d Howe said. \u201cI feel he has great potential and could be anything he wants to be but I think we tend to forget how young he is.\u201d Consistency, though, is something that is often learned over time and Howe will remain patient with the winger. At the same time, the manager was frustrated by the line of questioning. \u201cIt\u2019s not deliberately harsh but I\u2019m thinking in the best interests of the team \u2013 that\u2019s my job.\u201d <strong>Alan Smith</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/bournemouth-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 1-2 Sunderland</a></p> <h2><strong>3) Burnley look better equipped for survival this time</strong></h2> <p>A despondent Alan Pardew admitted that Palace \u201creally needed a result\u201d at Burnley, but Turf Moor is no longer the sort of place where visitors can expect to pick up points easily. Even when Palace thought they had a foothold in the game the home side hit back with a dramatic stoppage-time winner, scored by Ashley Barnes but created by Johann Gudmundsson, Burnley\u2019s most impressive performer on the day. Steven Defour, Dean Marney and Jeff Hendrick were pretty good too, for this season Burnley are not just being stingy in defence but creative in midfield. They have goalscorers and goalmakers, and in Gudmundsson they had both. The Iceland winger provided assists for two of Burnley\u2019s goals and scored the one in between. Andre Gray and Patrick Bamford remained on the bench unneeded. After 11 games two years ago the Clarets had one win, seven points and had scored only six goals. They have improved their attacking outlook, and 11 goals to date have brought four wins, 14 points and a visit to the top half of the table. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/burnley-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Burnley 3-2 Crystal Palace</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd2f010ede9445ac9b46bcd99b1c864587fb37e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd2f010ede9445ac9b46bcd99b1c864587fb37e9/61_3_3364_2018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johann Gudmundsson, Burnley\u2019s most impressive performer, gets in a shot during his side\u2019s 3-2 home win over Crystal Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johann Gudmundsson, Burnley\u2019s most impressive performer, gets in a shot during his side\u2019s 3-2 home win over Crystal Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4) Koeman has an off day but should be celebrated</strong></h2> <p>Ronald Koeman has not got a lot wrong since replacing Roberto Mart\u00ednez at Everton, although the Dutchman will probably wonder whether it was an error to attempt to counter Chelsea\u2019s 3-4-3 by using the same system. The charge against Koeman was that he was worrying too much about Antonio Conte instead of playing to his team\u2019s strengths. Kevin Mirallas dropped to the bench, Phil Jagielka joined Ramiro Funes Mori and Ashley Williams as part of a back three, Everton were 2-0 down after 20 minutes and Koeman was forced to bring on Mirallas nine minutes before half-time. Perhaps Koeman was guilty of overthinking. But if Everton are looking for positives, maybe they should celebrate a manager who recognises danger, reacts during matches and tries to find a solution. The problem with Mart\u00ednez was a lack of pragmatism, his utter conviction that his team\u2019s talent in attack would cover up deficiencies elsewhere. Look where that got them. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/chelsea-everton-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Chelsea 5-0 Everton</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/antonio-conte-tells-chelsea-players-improve-everton-win\">\u2022 Conte tells Chelsea players they can improve after win</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/nov/05/conte-thrilled-with-chelsea-dismantling-everton-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5ap6j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2872441\"            data-video-name=\"Conte thrilled with Chelsea's dismantling of Everton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581e5c33e4b0d073c27d1dd2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/05/161105chelsea_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/05/161105chelsea.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/05/161105chelsea_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/nov/05/conte-thrilled-with-chelsea-dismantling-everton-premier-league-video\">Conte thrilled with Chelsea\u2019s dismantling of Everton</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>5) Hull have hope before Sunderland six-pointer</strong></h2> <p>Saturday week promises to be a potential watershed afternoon for Hull City and their manager, Mike Phelan. The term \u201crelegation six-pointer\u201d can be overused but Sunderland\u2019s next fixture at the Stadium of Light surely promises to offer the perfect definition of this particular form of torture. With David Moyes\u2019s side finally having won a first league game of the season, at Bournemouth on Saturday, and Hull curtailing a run of six straight league defeats with Sunday\u2019s home victory over Southampton, it promises to be highly intriguing. A 45,000-strong crowd is expected and the modern day version of the old \u201cRoker Roar\u201d could turn the ground into a formidably hostile venue for Hull but they do have the outstanding Robert Snodgrass on their right wing and he could well enjoy himself against Patrick van Aanholt. And as Phelan says: \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve had some soul-destroying defeats, there remains an inner belief.\u201d <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/hull-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Hull City 2-1 Southampton</a></p> <h2><strong>6) West Brom must hope they can hang on to Rond\u00f3n</strong></h2> <p>West Bromwich Albion\u2019s new Chinese investors have said they will make money available for transfers in January, which is why Tony Pulis set off on a short scouting mission to the continent last week. The manager says he is particularly keen to add creativity and youth to Albion\u2019s squad, and the club\u2019s supporters will surely welcome both. Everyone at the Hawthorns, however, must be braced for inquiries for Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, the striker whose part in a fine team performance at Leicester was merely the latest evidence that he is good enough to enhance practically any squad. The Venezuelan dominated Robert Huth and Wes Morgan, not only eluding them with his movement and deft touch but also outmuscling them, a feat beyond most forwards. He is a relentless and clever worker, a technically deft link man and a sharp finisher both on the ground and in the air. He will score or contribute to at least as many Premier League goals as, say, Romelu Lukaku, if Albion improve their play around him on a regular basis \u2013 or if he is bought by a more inventive team. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/leicester-city-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Leicester City 1-2 West Brom</a></p> <h2><strong>7) Karius keeps Klopp smiling</strong></h2> <p>It was clearly not the reason Liverpool are top of the Premier League for the first time since May 2014 but Loris Karius\u2019s performance against Watford ensured the positives were not confined to the front end for J\u00fcrgen Klopp. For the first time since usurping Simon Mignolet, and despite the scoreline, the 23-year-old was able to demonstrate why he has Klopp\u2019s backing. \u201cLoris was really busy, which is not usual in a game that finishes 6-1,\u201d his manager said. Karius saved well from \u00c9tienne Capoue, Miguel Britos and Troy Deeney, while those training sessions designed to rough up the goalkeeper are clearly paying dividends, judging by the improvement in how he dominated the penalty area. Klopp added: \u201cHe can improve a lot but he has all the skills we think we need for a goalkeeper. We all expect 22-, 23-, 24-year-old boys to be ready for everything in the world but he is on the right way.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter </strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/liverpool-watford-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Liverpool 6-1 Watford</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-watford\">\u2022 J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Liverpool can still improve</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/nov/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-can-still-improve-after-hitting-watford-six-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aq84\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2873209\"            data-video-name=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Liverpool can still improve after hitting Watford for six \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581f7310e4b029b92ca4617a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161106liverpool_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846496&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846496&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/nov/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-can-still-improve-after-hitting-watford-six-premier-league-video\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Liverpool can still improve after hitting Watford for six</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>8) Middlesbrough belief gives them positive outlook</strong></h2> <p>A late Marten de Roon header grabbed a share of the points on Saturday as Aitor Karanka\u2019s Middlesbrough followed Everton and Southampton in City\u2019s previous two home league games by taking a draw. Adam Forshaw outlined how they did it. \u201cMaybe we did surprise them a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we were a little bit too passive in the first half, we were a lot more positive in the second half and we\u2019ve got ourselves a point at Man City. The manager said we needed more belief, he reminded us what we did well [in the away draw] against Arsenal, getting forward and creating chances.\u201d The key word here is \u201cbelief\u201d. Four days after City downed Lionel Messi\u2019s Barcelona 3-1 at the same venue, Boro walked out for the second half and decided to take no notice of that result and so pressed and took the game to Pep Guardiola\u2019s men \u2013 and the Catalan knows the aura of frightening invincibility built by the 10 straight wins at the season\u2019s start is now gone. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/manchester-city-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Manchester City 1-1 Middlesbrough</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1f818719266e120beff058e89caf6328db1c811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1f818719266e120beff058e89caf6328db1c811/154_296_5028_3018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marten de Roon\u2019s late equaliser earned Middlesbrough a 1-1 draw at City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marten de Roon\u2019s late equaliser earned Middlesbrough a 1-1 draw at City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>9) Carrick gives United much-needed control</strong></h2> <p>In many ways the Manchester United team at Swansea was full of square pegs in round holes, yet the inclusion of one player gave them balance. Michael Carrick made his first Premier League start of the season and helped United to take control of the game. He completed 95% of his passes and it seemed a fair point when a journalist informed Jos\u00e9 Mourinho that United have won all six of the matches in which Carrick has taken part this season and, on the back of that statistic, wondered whether the manager would consider playing the 35-year-old, who is only three months older than Zlatan Ibrahimovic, more often. \u201cI would love to play him every game, but that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Mourinho said. When asked to elaborate, Mourinho replied: \u201cFor the same reason I cannot go to the gym every day any more. But [Carrick] started today and he played very, very well.\u201d <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/swansea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: Swansea City 1-3 Manchester United</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-players-mentalities\">\u2022 Mourinho questions United players\u2019 mentalities after win</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/nov/06/jose-mourinho-questions-manchester-united-players-after-win-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aqax\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2873260\"            data-video-name=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho questions his Manchester United players after win \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581f8343e4b0d073c27d20c1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161106utd_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846497&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846497&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/nov/06/jose-mourinho-questions-manchester-united-players-after-win-premier-league-video\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho questions his Manchester United players after win</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>10) Hughes lets talented Bojan off the leash</strong></h2> <p>Joe Allen has been the key man for Stoke of late, scoring four goals during a five-match unbeaten run. Bojan Krkic, the player Allen has eased out of the side, ensured that run continued at West Ham on Saturday with a deft late equaliser for a valuable away point. Mark Hughes deserves credit for the double substitution that brought Krkic into play. Alongside Peter Crouch, he asked different questions of a wobbly Hammers back four, while Allen dropped out of his new No10 role and back into central midfield. Hughes had cast Krkic to the bench, after a worrying start of only two points from six games. Now, seeing confidence return, Hughes felt comfortable enough to bring the sparkling Spaniard back to his first XI. \u201cClearly we have a really talented player within our ranks,\u201d Hughes said of Krkic. \u201cI\u2019d suggest that given we\u2019re on a six-game [unbeaten] run, he\u2019s going to get opportunities. But we just had to be a little patient.\u201d <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/west-ham-united-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">\u2022 Match report: West Ham United 1-1 Stoke City</a></p>",
  "<p>Charities have a growing transparency problem. Scarcity of funding is driving us to tell ever more hard-hitting stories about the beneficiaries we serve, without balancing them with information about whether or not we achieve an impact.</p> <p>Many charities think they are measuring their impact by reporting that they have helped huge numbers of people. But what does this actually mean? Are they just saying a couple of kind words to somebody, or are they truly making a change in their life? Too often, the culture of telling a good story has taken over from accurate, impactful reporting.</p> <p>The epitome of this storytelling culture came with the collapse of Kids Company \u2013 which was seemingly built solely on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-fall-of-kids-company-a-social-policy-morality-tale\">good stories </a>with very few facts to back them up.</p> <p>We need to change. We need to balance our stories with the facts, even if they don\u2019t always tell a good story. If we as charities are truly focused on those in need, then we have to accept that sometimes our work is difficult, and that it doesn\u2019t always get the results we want. We have a duty to tell this story, talking about what we do \u2013 and what we don\u2019t do \u2013 with accuracy and transparency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/jun/07/charities-control-let-beneficiaries-tell-own-story\">Charities need to put beneficiaries before their brand when campaigning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There have been many attempts to produce a unified impact measurement system for the charity sector. These virtuous attempts have usually been too complex to be workable. I believe there is a more straightforward alternative.</p> <p>All charities should agree to three rules for reporting. At Street League, the charity of which I am chief executive, we have three golden rules:</p> <ol> <li>Never over-claim </li> <li>All percentages must also include absolute numbers</li> <li>All outcomes must be auditable</li> </ol> <p>Take a measurable outcome like getting someone a job. In many ways it is a binary outcome because someone will either get a job or they won\u2019t. Unfortunately, this is where many charities stop \u2013 they simply tick the box and report that they have helped someone. </p> <p>But that means we don\u2019t actually know anything about that person and whether they truly needed the help of the charity. What if the person who got the job was a university graduate? What if a charity helps someone get a job but they walk out of it the following day, or week? In the current culture, the box is still ticked regardless of whether someone genuinely needed help and what the longer-term impact will be. This isn\u2019t good enough.</p> <p>Soft outcomes \u2013 for instance, improving somebody\u2019s self-esteem \u2013 are even harder to measure.</p> <p>To fully understand what is going on with the people we help, we need much more information to determine whether a charity is genuinely making a difference. We need to know whether the person we\u2019ve helped needed our help and what long-term change we actually made in their lives.</p> <p>Street League has been fortunate enough to work with Impetus-PEF and Inspiring Scotland, two top venture philanthropy organisations, over the past seven years. They have pushed us hard to develop more transparent measures of our impact. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/may/06/good-news-charities-help-tell-stories\">Good news is good for charities \u2013 help us tell those stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before 2010 we used to just measure \u201cparticipation\u201d, or the number of people who took part in our sessions.

That was better, but still a long way from the transparency we wanted.</p> <p>Three years ago we introduced a new system which tracks the whole journey of a young person from the moment we meet them right through to helping them stay in a job for six months or more.

Day told an official of the finance department on January 25 2016 that, in the complicated financial arrangements surrounding the building, that he, Day, retained the loan from the National Australia Bank. </p> <p>He told the department that Fullarton Investments was to receive rent from the commonwealth to cover Day\u2019s occupancy in the building \u201cthen make vendor payments to me using those funds. No rent, no vendor finance payments,\u201d Day tells finance official <strong>Shane McGaughey </strong>on 25 January.<br></p> <p>Then there is correspondence between the special minister of state, <strong>Scott Ryan</strong>, and Day in early August. </p> <p>In this correspondence Day characterises the arrangements with the building in the following terms:<strong> \u201cI have an agreement with someone else who has an agreement with the crown.\u201d</strong> This explanation is provided by Day to Ryan in the event \u201cthe department pulls the pecuniary interest card\u201d.</p> <p>In this email on 7 August, Day says he has spoken to finance about the pecuniary interest issue, and told them it isn\u2019t relevant.<br></p> <p>Ryan clearly disagrees with this and seeks further advice. Day also furnishes him with further particulars. </p> <p>In this email exchange on 29 August, Day says he has not been given clear advice by either the department, or by the special minister of state when he was elected in 2013 (which was <strong>Michael Ronaldson</strong>) on the problems associated with him having some kind of financial relationship with the building which houses his electoral office.<br></p> <p><strong>Bob Day</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Their advice basically centred on the principle that it was \u201cnot a good look\u201d for a senator to own his or her own office.

Day gave a guarantee to the bank over the mortgage so that essentially if the commonwealth doesn\u2019t pay rent to the company that owned the building, Day or his trust has to pay.<br></p> <p>Ryan said that may lead to the conclusion that Day has an indirect pecuniary interest in the lease, which would make him ineligible to be in the Senate.

Under clause 5 of the bill, <strong>the question to be asked would be \u2018Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry</strong>?\u2019. The result of the plebiscite would be determined by whether more than 50% of the votes cast are in favour or not in favour of the plebiscite proposal under clause 6 of the bill. The bill would also provide that, should this bill become an act, the writ for the plebiscite must be issued within 120 days after the act commences.</li> <li>Clause 15 of the <strong>bill would require the establishment of two committees, each comprising five members of Parliament and five citizens. These committees will be known as the Committee for the Yes Case and the Committee for the No Case</strong> and will be appointed jointly by the attorney general and the special minister of state. Each committee will have two government members (one of whom will be the chair), two opposition members and one crossbench member. Each committee would receive $7.5m in public funding to conduct official yes and no campaigns and the ability to receive up to $1,500 in tax deductible gifts from donors. </li> <li>The Electoral Commission will be responsible for overseeing the vote under clause 7 to ensure Australian voters are informed about the procedural elements of the plebiscite, <strong>the Electoral Commission will prepare and distribute to households in Australia general information about how to vote in the plebiscite</strong>. This is appropriate given the role of the Electoral Commission as an independent impartial body responsible for overseeing parliamentary elections.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T23:35:39.454Z\">at 11.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581fb8d5e4b07ceadb3a30e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T23:13:42.406Z\">11.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The special minister of state, <strong>Scott Ryan</strong>, is now speaking to the marriage equality plebiscite bill.</p> <p>It is mostly mechanics but makes a quick political point that this is the first government to bring this (marriage equality) matter to the parliament.

As I fell in the Senate doors in a mess of earphones streaming <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> from ABC AM, I almost ran into the other Malcolm, smiling sweetly next to the security check. <strong>Malcolm Roberts</strong>\u2019 office has released an alert for a press conference for One Nation at 9am. This causes reporters to prick up their ears because One Nation senator<strong> Rod Culleton</strong> is expected to be referred to the high court this morning for a ruling on his eligibility. Former Family First senator <strong>Bob Day</strong> will also be referred. Will One Nation be talking about the future of Culleton, shearer of sheep and key collector? We shall await the hour of nine.</p> <p>Meanwhile, your prime minister has been on ABC AM. <br></p> <p>There are a couple of news points.</p> <p>Turnbull says if he accepted that the boats had stopped he would fall into the complacency that hit <strong>Kevin Rudd</strong>. It\u2019s a more challenging environment \u2013 with social media \u2013 than <strong>John Howard</strong> faced, says Turnbull.<br></p> <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> is pandering to the left of his party on speaking out against the lifetime ban on asylum seekers who have come by boat, says the <strong>prime minister</strong>. (Shorten has yet to commit to voting against the legislation).</p> <p>Turnbull moves on to 18C. His words are a bit mashed but I will relay as much as possible so you can see the nuance. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There ... has been, and <strong>I have sympathy for this argument</strong>... there is a view ... the bar that is set is too low. In other words, in particular that prescribing conduct which insults and offends is too much a restriction on free speech. You\u2019re obviously trying to get the balance between ensuring that we maintain the courteous discourse and debate that again, mutual respect that underpins our strong multicultural society and, on the other hand, freedom of speech, which is of critical importance in a democracy. <strong>I think the Human Rights Commission has done a great deal of harm to its credibility by bringing the case against the Queensland students.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>There was a lot more in that interview which I will bring you shortly but let\u2019s get this wheel spinning. <strong>Mike Bowers</strong> has been chasing the PM down corridors.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Melbourne.<br></p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Mike Katz (synths), Graeme Pogson (drums), Tamil Rogeon (electric strings).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Just imagine, right, that in a couple of days\u2019 time someone with risible hair was the de facto leader of the free world, in charge of the nuclear codes, and, according to most objective assessments, a dangerous sociopath. (\u201cBut enough about Hillary Clinton.\u201d Arf.) You might want to obliterate your senses with some good old-fashioned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_MUdmwY5io\">Swedish death metal</a>. Alternatively, you might opt for something more lightly escapist: some heady, twinkling jazz-inflected disco-funk, perhaps, redolent of happier times \u2013 the early 80s, say, when the cold war was on. Anyway, if you are in a pre-apocalyptic mood, gripped by panic and dread, you need to hear what Melbourne DJ/producer Mike Katz does as Harvey Sutherland &amp; Bermuda. It\u2019s the sound of Rhodes piano, \u201celectric\u201d (ie, synth) strings, real drums, and party-till-the-bomb-drops handclaps, all deployed in the service of some of the most mesmerising instrumental passages and sublime melodies you\u2019ve heard since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xXhJ2agJCg\">Arthur Russell</a> teamed up with Kool and the Gang, which he didn\u2019t but he didn\u2019t need to because now we\u2019ve got Sutherland and his two associates (that\u2019ll be Bermuda) doing it for us. </p> <p>Sutherland calls this live-band offshoot of his studio-based electronic work \u201clounge-room disco burners\u201d. There are echoes here of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jan/08/popandrock\">Hercules and Love Affair</a>. That is, real musicians locking together \u2013 getting \u201cin the pocket\u201d, to use the parlance of the day. In fact, Sutherland\u2019s homage-paying to his beloved golden age of club music extends to his own use of funk vernacular. \u201cPocket is essential,\u201d he says when asked whether he is trained in muso proficiency or if you have to have a degree to play with Harvey Sutherland and chums. \u201cI have no formal training, just a bit of time spent learning my <a href=\"http://piano.about.com/od/chordskeys/ss/piano_chords_min9.htm\">minor 9ths</a>,\u201d he , explaining his forays as a solo artist versus his setup with Bermuda. \u201cPlaying solo, it\u2019s more programmed drums and 808 club tracks, with improvised synthesiser loops and solos. But the band is a heavy disco excursion with a one-man electric string section and deep-pocket live drums. I just hold on for dear life behind a couple of keyboards.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"HSB\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/270687407%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-uUehr&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Whatever, it works. The song Bermuda \u2013 like all of Sutherland and his eponymous outfit\u2019s output, an instrumental and one of Spotify\u2019s Top 10 viral tracks last year \u2013 is a shimmering gem. It\u2019s a lattice of lush, jazzy keyboards, burbling bass and funk-tional groove, with an upwards-spiralling synth motif reminiscent of rappers\u2019 delight Summer Madness by the aforementioned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SFt7JHwJeg\">Kool</a>. Things take a turn for the cosmic on Bamboo. If you didn\u2019t know, you might assume this stuff was recorded back in the day. Priestess has a bleep and polish that makes it sound more recent - more late- than early-80s, with a Detroit techno sheen and some Chicago house piano. Nine minutes long and languorous, it evolves slowly, with a hypnotic quality that is positively psychedelic. Melody is key: Katz is more into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DavckVZylkg\">George Duke</a> than he is George Clinton. Meanwhile, his keyboard lines dovetail magnificently with drummer Graeme Pogson\u2019s relentless four-on-the-floor rhythms and Tamil Rogen\u2019s sky-caressing strings. Bravado could be a lost Isley Brothers B-side from the 70s, while Nexus sounds like the backing track to Patrice Rushen\u2019s 1982 postdisco classic <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amzp7W0RkPA\">Forget Me Nots</a>. Like a lot of disco music designed ostensibly for the dancefloor, Sutherland\u2019s compositions strike an unexpected wistful note, capturing \u2013 as New Order and Pet Shop Boys did with their best music \u2013 the ineffable sadness of this social ritual. New Paradise is full of moments \u2013 a dancing, playful synth pattern here, a wash of keyboards there \u2013 that seem to acknowledge the irony (or is that poignancy?) of such goodtime music being tinged with melancholy. </p> <p>Still, there\u2019s nothing sad about Australia\u2019s neo-disco-funk scene. We mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/20/harts\">Harts</a> and Flight Facilities to Katz, and he gets competitive: \u201cRaise you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keoPx6uOo_Q\">Krakatau</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMAs5guaaTU\">Sui Zhen </a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RZzm2q4w0\">Sampa the Great</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot happening out here.\u201d And now here\u2019s Katz as alter ego Harvey Sutherland, whose superhero power is generating heat on the dancefloor. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I play solo, it\u2019s a gamble,\u201d he says, assessing the effects of his lovely music on audiences. \u201cCrowd engagement is the difference between a good and a great show, so when they\u2019re connected with what you\u2019re doing, you can take improvisational risks and enjoy the experience a lot more. I can\u2019t usually see the couples from the front, but there were some beautifully sweaty, shirts-off dancefloor moments in Tokyo.\u201d When asked who his most famous fan/Twitter follower/celebrity stalker is, he replies, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/03/dam-funk-snoop-dogg-stones-throw-hudson-mohawke-ariel-pink\">Dam Funk</a>,\u201d adding: \u201cLike him, I\u2019m not interested in fame.

  "<p>A common misconception about my profession is that we spend a lot of our time devising fancy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/taxavoidance\" title=\"\">avoidance schemes</a> usually involving exotic offshore destinations. I\u2019m afraid that for firms like ours the reality is much more mundane \u2013 think <a href=\"http://www.canveyisland.org/\" title=\"\">Canvey Island</a> rather than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/caymanislands\" title=\"\">Cayman Islands</a>.</p> <p>The majority of what we do is quite routine compliance work such as tax returns. But this is interspersed with some more interesting stuff, including planning, company reorganisation and acquisitions. I love this advisory work, not just because it\u2019s the most profitable but also because it is intellectually challenging. Like most of us in tax, I\u2019m a bit of a nerd.</p> <p>There is a lot of nonsense talked about tax. Contrary to popular belief most rich people don\u2019t avoid tax: they pay lots of it. It is very difficult for a UK resident and domiciled individual to legally avoid tax \u2013 most of the \u201ctax gap\u201d is caused by multinational companies, and to tackle that needs international cooperation.</p> <p>I\u2019ve found most people take a realistic approach to paying tax \u2013 they may grumble about it but in the end they\u2019ll pay it. There are a few people who try to avoid paying any tax if they can, almost as a matter of principle. But they make nightmare clients, and I won\u2019t deal with them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/04/inheritance-tax-heirs-prudential\">Why fear inheritance tax? Your cash will all be gone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obviously a hot topic is where legitimate tax planning ends and unacceptable avoidance starts. My own view is that once you start introducing artificial transactions with no commercial purpose then you\u2019re in danger of crossing the line from planning to avoidance.</p> <p>I have never advocated \u201cpackaged\u201d avoidance schemes to my clients, and in fact have actively discouraged people from using them. This is on practical as well as moral grounds \u2013 most just don\u2019t work, as evidenced by HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC) current <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-tax-avoidance\" title=\"\">80% success rate</a> when challenging them at tribunals.</p> <p>Not many people appreciate that George Osborne probably did more to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion than any other chancellor. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/18/osborne-targets-multinationals-and-tax-evaders-in-budget-crackdown\" title=\"\">accelerated payment notice</a> regime has basically killed off promoted schemes. Anyone who uses one these days is either very brave or very stupid.</p> <p>There has been a lot of fuss recently over the fact that HMRC\u2019s high-net-worth unit has apparently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/01/hmrc-investigating-19bn-in-potential-tax-avoidance-by-super-rich\" title=\"\">prosecuted only one person</a> in the past five years. This doesn\u2019t surprise me at all. If HMRC\u2019s aim is to recover as much tax as possible in the shortest time, it makes sense to pursue a civil settlement \u2013 they get the tax plus interest and penalties (up to 100%) for comparatively little effort on their part. If they prosecute it can take years, costing millions, and there is no guarantee of a conviction at the end of it. The burden of proof in a criminal case is high and it can be difficult to prove intent.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do when I graduated at the end of the 70s and drifted into accountancy almost by accident. I qualified as a chartered accountant in the early 80s and spent the first few years in audit before moving to more general practice work. I found I was doing more and more tax work and enjoying it, so I took the exams and qualified as a chartered tax adviser.</p> <p>I\u2019m a partner in a small suburban practice. There are 20 of us in total and it\u2019s a really nice place to work. I think so anyway, and most of our staff seem to agree, as very few people leave. We pay well and offer flexible working, which is very popular as many of our employees have caring responsibilities.</p> <p>I do fairly normal office hours, although sometimes I\u2019ll work late or over the weekend if there is a particularly tight deadline. My hourly rate is \u00a3200 to \u00a3300, depending upon the complexity of the work, and I earn a decent, six-figure income. That\u2019s much less than partners in large firms earn, but I don\u2019t think I could cope with the pressure they are under.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5cc963ad201421786cb5ecef33388d3adf67b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5cc963ad201421786cb5ecef33388d3adf67b5f/0_0_5120_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HM Revenue Customs document surrounded by pound coins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dealing with HMRC can be a nightmare due to cutbacks and constant reorganisations.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of my time is spent making sure that our clients don\u2019t fall foul of what are sometimes very complex rules when carrying out normal commercial transactions. For instance, at the moment I\u2019m working on a demerger, splitting a family business between two warring factions. There are reliefs available to enable this to happen without a huge tax bill but there are strict conditions too, and my job is to make sure they are all met.</p> <p>Our client base is varied: mainly family businesses and their owners, plus some reasonably wealthy individuals but also quite a few high-net-worth individuals \u2013 people with a total wealth of at least \u00a310m and in most cases considerably more.</p> <p>Some people have very complex affairs, and to handle them properly you need to know a lot about them, including some very personal things. I think I know more about some of my clients\u2019 personal affairs than their own partners do. Confidentiality is absolutely critical. They have to trust me, and that\u2019s why a good rapport with the client is essential. I get on very well with most of them, and some have become personal friends. If you don\u2019t get on, then the relationship doesn\u2019t usually last very long.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/secret-life-gp-family-doctor-patients\">The secret life of a GP: a family doctor is there for everyone else\u2019s before their own | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The clients who really annoy me are those who take decisions, sometimes involving significant sums of money, based on what they read in the newspaper or what their pals at the golf club have told them, without taking heed of professional advice. Usually it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to pay for an hour of my time. A frequent mistake is to give an asset away to save on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/inheritancetax\" title=\"\">inheritance tax</a> without realising there\u2019s a possible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/capitalgainstax\" title=\"\">capital gains tax liability</a>.</p> <p>On the whole I like my job, but there are a number of frustrations. Dealing with HMRC can be a nightmare owing to cutbacks and constant reorganisations. A lot of their senior staff have left and been replaced with more junior people, sometimes barely above the level of call centre operatives. Then there\u2019s keeping up to date with the torrent of new legislation appearing every year. Despite being a tax geek, I struggle. How the average unrepresented taxpayer is supposed to cope, I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>All in all, I\u2019m pretty happy with my career choice. It\u2019s given me a decent living doing something I like. I\u2019m coming up to that age when thoughts turn to retirement but I\u2019ve no plans to cut back in the near future. I imagine I\u2019ll carry on doing something in this line, even if only for a couple of days a week, for as long as I\u2019m able.

They may have collapsed astonishingly on Day Two, but that now doesn\u2019t seem like an aberration.

Wherever you are, a huge hello and cheers for joining. I\u2019m Sam Perry, debuting on this storied live blog for the entire morning session \u2013 should it last that long, of course. </p> <p>Australia resumes this morning at 169-4 with 90 overs remaining, with six fragile wickets standing between South Africa and a thoroughly outstanding test victory. The Proteas have been utterly dominant for the entire contest, barring day one, growing into the contest as the match goes on. Temba Bavuma\u2019s runout and Kagiso Rabada\u2019s exhibition of swing bowling will not be forgotten swiftly \u2013 both already belong in the annals of Test highlights this decade.</p> <p>For Australia, consternation will reign throughout the day as it collectively tries to grasp just how far it may have fallen. Going down in the subcontinent is one thing, but to be so comprehensively outplayed at home? The nation needs to be held. Observing its collective reaction to the grief of losing brings its own entertainment though, because while there is an inevitability hanging over the remainder of the match, finality always triggers the wildest spectrum of approaches. I\u2019ll be hoping to document this today. Brace yourselves for sad resignation, irrational hope, and the age-old approach of \u2018bargaining\u2019 \u2013 a well-known stage in the grieving process. \u2018If they can just get through this hour\u2026\u2019</p> <p>Of course, memories of Faf Du Plessis\u2019 epic resistance for South Africa in Adelaide loom large. Channel Nine has already shown these scenes twice already in it\u2019s pre-day coverage. But the overriding feeling is that Australia, with its zealous philosophical commitment to aggressive cricket and quick scoring, feel ill-equipped to achieve something similar.</p> <p>Whatever the case, I\u2019m anticipating wickets, widening cracks and recriminations. It could all happen very quickly, but if not, Adam Collins will take the reigns for the second session. </p> <p>If you want to get in touch I\u2019m fairly sure my info is somewhere on the left of screen, but if it isn\u2019t, email me at <a href=\"mailto:sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk\">sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk</a> or heap public scorn on Twitter, where I\u2019m at @sjjperry.

For many there will be no choice: they cannot work or are unable to find it, and as a result face hunger, impoverishment and homelessness.</p> <p>The benefit cap was originally introduced by the coalition government as a device to supposedly \u201crestore fairness\u201d to the benefit system by limiting total household benefit income to no more than the average working family earnings of \u00a326,000 a year. Emboldened by the cap\u2019s apparent popularity with the public, the Conservatives changed the law earlier this year to lower it to \u00a320,000 (\u00a323,000 in London). The new cap will be rolled out across the UK between now and February, affecting about four times as many households as its predecessor.</p> <p>Formal evaluations of the cap suggest it has only the mildest of positive effects on employment. <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/\">The Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, in <a href=\" https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8717\">a study note</a> published on Sunday, estimates that only 5% of the 80,000 households hit by the first cap moved into employment as a result. A study <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/05/docking-welfare-payments-is-not-incentive-to-work-report-claims\">published in the summer by Oxford city council</a> in partnership, ironically, with the DWP, found that cutting people\u2019s benefits reduced their chances of moving into work, because dealing with the additional pressures of poverty eroded their capacity for job seeking. Other studies have suggested that most of those who have moved off the cap into a job were close to working anyway, leaving those further from the job market deeper in debt and despair.</p> <p>Many of those who have been unable to escape the cap have simply been unable to work \u2013 and have only managed to pay the rent by cutting back drastically on living costs or going into debt. Local authorities are increasingly worried that the cap, in its bigger and more punitive form, will trigger a surge in rent arrears, ill health and homelessness.</p> <p>The secretary of state for work and pensions, Damian Green, said: \u201cBy making sure that those people who are out of work are faced with the same choices as those who are in work, the benefit cap has been a real success. </p> <p>\u201cBy lowering the cap today, we are ensuring the values of this government continue to chime with those of ordinary working people and delivering on our commitment to make sure work pays more than welfare\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/nov/04/benefits-cap-reduction-families-christmas\">This callous benefit cap reduction will hit families hard this Christmas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Alana notes that her private landlord has just served a notice saying the family\u2019s rent is going up by \u00a325 a month. As she speculates on the increasingly limited ways in which she might cope with the cap, she recalls the offer made by her NHS health visitor on a recent visit: if she did find herself struggling to feed the baby, a voucher for the food bank could be made available.</p> <p>They now face an anxious wait: Mark has been promised a minimum wage job in the care sector. This would rescue them from the cap but no start date has been set. The longer the delay, the more debt, stress and rent arrears will build, and the prospect of eviction will be more likely. \u201cIf there\u2019s a choice between paying the rent and feeding myself and the kids, I\u2019ll feed my kids,\u201d said Alana.</p> <p>Alana and Mark are almost certainly not who ministers and tabloids have in mind when they hail the supposed bracingly motivational qualities of benefit cuts, or stir rancour against \u201cscroungers\u201d. They moved out to their comfortably middle-English market town in the east of the country two years ago to find cheaper rents and a nice place to bring up children. Then redundancy disaster struck. In a sense they are a classic example of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-brexit-conservatives-economy\">\u201cjust managing\u201d family</a> the prime minister, Theresa May, says she wants to help, though the benefit cap instead threatens to rapidly unpick the last fraying strands of the social security safety net keeping them from destitution.</p> <p>\u201cThey are out of touch with reality,\u201d said Alana. \u201cThey expect people to live on a tiny amount of money. It\u2019s not like benefits are generous. It\u2019s completely misleading, this idea that people live comfortably on benefits, a fallacy.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Names have been changed</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 November 2016. An earlier version said the benefit cap was introduced to limit total household benefit income to no more than the average working family income of \u00a326,000 a year. The cap was set at the average working family earnings, not total income (earnings plus benefits).</p>",

  "<p>Theresa May has dashed Indian hopes for a more liberal visa system for its nationals wanting to work in the UK by arguing that the current offer is generous enough. </p> <p>Speaking on the way to her first bilateral meeting in Delhi, the prime minister argued that Britain was already able to attract the \u201cbrightest and best\u201d from outside the EU. \u201cThe figures show that we issue more work visas to India than I think US, Australia and China put together. Nine out of 10 visa applications from India are already accepted. We have, I believe, a good system,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The comments will prove disappointing for some in the Indian government and business community who have argued for more of their highly skilled professional workers to be able to get six-month visas for the UK and other European countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/india-warns-uk-immigration-policy-wreck-post-brexit-trade-deal\">India warns UK immigration policy could wreck trade deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The demand for more freedoms for Indian workers moving abroad was a part of trade negotiations with the EU, which stalled because of failure to agree on it and other issues. </p> <p>Vince Cable, the former Lib Dem business secretary, said May\u2019s refusal to agree to any such liberalisation in the past was a key stumbling block to trade talks between the EU and India. Although he admitted they were complex negotiations, he claimed that her unwillingness to budge was down to an obsession over getting the net migration numbers down as home secretary.</p> <p>May said she hoped that her three-day visit to India would pave the way for a future trade arrangement after Brexit as she sought to break down barriers. However, she suggested she did not think a more generous visa system was necessary. </p> <p>\u201cTrade is an important part of our relationship with India. India is the third-biggest investor into the UK \u2013 second-biggest creator of private sector jobs in the UK. And the UK is the biggest G20 investor into India, but there is more we can do,\u201d she said.</p> <p>May was joined by a delegation of business representatives for a trip during which she attended the India-UK tech summit in Delhi with Prime Minister Narendra Modi before a bilateral meeting.</p> <p>Modi used a speech to heavily hint that he wanted young people to be more able to travel abroad to study, after stricter rules in Britain on how long graduates can stay contributed to a halving of the number of Indian students coming to the UK to study over five years. </p> <p>\u201cEducation is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future. We must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities,\u201d he said. </p> <p>May used her speech to the tech summit to insist she wanted an open relationship with India, laying out plans for India to become the first visa country to be put on a registered traveller scheme which helps speed up the experience of visitors in British airports.</p> <p>\u201cThat means for Indian nationals who frequently come to the UK \u2013 and who fuel growth in both our countries \u2013 the entry process will become significantly easier. Fewer forms to fill out, access to EU/EEA passport control, swifter passage through our airports,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Despite the reluctance to increase migration numbers from India to the UK, the prime minister delivered a passionate argument for free trade between the two countries arguing that it \u201ccreates a rising tide that lifts all boats\u201d. </p> <p>She said Britain was determined not to turn its back on the world, adding: \u201cBecause we know from history what happens when countries do not embrace the opportunities of the world; they stagnate, they get poorer, they don\u2019t protect their people, they make them worse off.\u201d</p> <p>Adding that while countries like India did not owe Britain a living, she said working together meant the greatest chance of success. </p> <p>May also said she did not need to wait to leave the EU to start discussions on how trade and investment could be boosted between the countries. </p> <p>However, she had earlier made clear she was aware of sentiment in the UK about immigration, and her promise to stick to an ambition of reducing the net migration figure to the tens of thousands would require cutting the numbers from all over the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/05/trade-uk-india-suffer-double-hit-theresa-may-visit-brexit-sterling\">Trade between UK and India to suffer double hit, says business chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The response could disappoint those of Indian origin in the UK and those with links to other Commonwealth countries, after Brexit campaigners suggested they would benefit from an immigration system that no longer discriminated in favour of Europeans. Out campaigner and president of the Bangladesh Caterers Association, Pasha Khandaker, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the government saying it is ruling out an Australian-style points-based system as promised by Vote Leave during the referendum campaign.</p> <p>May has attempted to deflect any row with an offer to make India the first visa country to be added to the Registered Traveller Scheme, under which business travellers can clear border control more quickly in British airports. It will allow passengers to come through the e-Passport gates, usually reserved for Britons and Europeans, and without a requirement to complete a landing card.</p> <p>Only nine other countries currently benefit from the scheme, including the US, but they are not places where travellers need visas. </p> <p>The government will also offer a group of high net-worth Indians access to a bespoke visa and immigration service called the Great Club. That doesn\u2019t offer any guarantees but means individuals \u2013 and their immediate family members \u2013 are provided with a personal account manager to help them secure visas more quickly and smoothly.</p> <p>However, the offer falls short of a pilot set up by the prime minister during a recent trip to China for a G20 meeting that cut the price of two-year tourist visas from \u00a3330 to \u00a387.</p> <p>Ahead of this trip, Chandrajit Banerjee, the director of the Confederation of Indian Industry, told the Financial Times that he was \u201cvery, very hopeful\u201d that the prime minister would offer a similar liberalisation to Indian visitors. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/theresa-may-obsessed-with-controlling-immigration-says-vince-cable\">Theresa May 'obsessed' with immigration control, says Vince Cable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It followed a letter from senior executives including the heads of Heathrow airport and Virgin Atlantic calling on the government to cut the cost of tourist visas for India \u2013 saying that 400,000 Indians visited Britain last year spending \u00a3433m. However, they warned that France had become a more popular destination. </p> <p>May is likely to address this issue during her talks but a source played down the issue, stressing that the Chinese price cut is a pilot scheme.</p> <p>The registered travellers scheme will initially be offered to Indians travelling on a work visa, with the possibility of rolling it out to other routes in the future. The government estimates that up to 10,000 Indians could benefit from it within the first two years.</p>",

  "<p>Britain\u2019s cybercrime tsar will formally ask the government to set up a programme based on the controversial Prevent strategy to stop children as young as 12 becoming involved in sophisticated computer offences, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Dr Jamie Saunders said training was needed to help spot teenagers at risk as many young internet users experiment with hacking or other cyber offences without realising that what they are doing is a crime.</p> <p>Saunders, the director of the national cyber crime unit at the National Crime Agency (NCA), said he was proposing the scheme, known internally as Cyber Prevent, to ministers. It is modelled in part on Prevent, the official counter-radicalisation programme that has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/uks-prevent-counter-radicalisation-policy-badly-flawed\">dogged by controversy</a>.</p> <p>But instead of trying to divert aspirant jihadis away from terrorism, Cyber Prevent would aim to deter computer-literate youngsters from carrying out <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/26/ddos-attack-dyn-mirai-botnet\">distributed denial of service attacks</a> (DDoS) and other cybercrimes, such as hacking private details.</p> <p>Saunders said the programme could also be used to recruit tech-savvy young adults. \u201cWe need education for schools on the [1990] Computer Misuse Act, on what it is and isn\u2019t [a cybercrime]. A lot of kids don\u2019t realise they are committing a crime,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want them to go to prison, we want them to come and work for us.\u201d</p> <p>Demand for computer skills is forecast to grow in coming years. One core message at the heart of Cyber Prevent is that young adults with computer skills can earn good amounts of money legitimately, as opposed to perpetrating cybercrimes and being pursued by law enforcement. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of kids are stumbling into this crime. This activity has consequences for them and others. There are legitimate opportunities for their skills,\u201d Saunders said. </p> <p>The target group would be those aged 12 to 25. One major cyber-attack, which is currently subject to legal restrictions, was carried out by a teenager.</p> <p>Analysis of investigations undertaken by the national cyber crime unit in 2015 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/08/average-age-of-cyber-attack-suspects-drops-to-17\">found the average age of suspects was 17</a>. The previous year, the average was 24. </p> <p>Saunders said some cyber-attacks had been carried out by children who did not realise the harm they could do. \u201cWe are not dealing with serious criminals. Some are sucked in and damage their careers and do a lot of harm,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/21/crime-rate-online-offences-cybercrime-ons-figures\">Cybercrime figures prompt police call for awareness campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Research shows that some who end up committing cybercrime start by learning how to outwit games programmers. \u201cOne of the entry points is cheating on online gaming \u2013 you have to be quite clever to do that,\u201d Saunders said.</p> <p>Cyber Prevent would be relatively low cost, especially compared with the harm it aims to thwart, Saunders said. The scheme would hire a network of regional specialists and companies could contribute to the cost.</p> <p>The programme would also target parents so they had a better chance of knowing what their children might be up to.</p> <p>The sheer volume of online offending means only a fraction of offenders are likely to be caught.</p> <p>Compared with other major types of crime, intelligence about cybercrime offenders is at a relatively early stage. \u201cWe keep finding clean skins, people we did not know about,\u201d Saunders said.</p> <p>The NCA said malicious software called remote access trojans (RATs) is popular among teenage computer users. It allows users to remotely take full control of another computer. An NCA-led operation targeting users of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/19/fbi-arrests-100-hackers-blackshades-rat-backdoor-malware\">the Blackshades RAT</a> found that the average age of the 22 people arrested was 18, with the youngest 12 years old.</p> <p>Saunders became director of the national cyber crime unit in 2014, joining from the Foreign Office, where he was director of international cyber policy. Before that, he worked at GCHQ.</p>",
  "<p>Two months ago, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that PhD students who are also teachers at private universities in the US count as employees under federal labour law. This means they are entitled to <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/08/24/nlrb-says-graduate-students-private-universities-may-unionize\">vote for a union</a>. A change in labour law may not seem very exciting \u2013 but the day of the ruling was one of the most thrilling of our lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/sep/28/academic-staff-we-graduate-teaching-assistants-need-you-to-fight-for-us\">Academic staff:  we graduate teaching assistants need you to fight for us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are graduate teachers at Yale University: Robin is a geologist, Aaron is a political theorist , and Josh is an English literature scholar. We have been campaigning for recognition for our work as graduate teachers for some time. </p> <p>In fact, graduate students at Yale have been organising for 26 years. Ours is the longest-standing union effort at a private university in the country. Generations of graduate employees before us have fought for and won improvements to our working conditions. </p> <p>But we still have a long way to go in order to improve our conditions \u2013 which is why this ruling, and our chance to unionise, is so crucial. We have colleagues who spend more than half of their teaching salary on childcare. Others have seen their teaching workload double without any increase in their pay. And last year some graduate teachers faced a cut in their pay of nearly 22% for doing the same type of teaching assignment that they did the year before.</p> <h2>Persistent protest</h2> <p>In the past few years, we\u2019ve demonstrated time and time again for our desire to be part of a union. We\u2019ve marched by the hundreds in the pouring rain, and we\u2019ve persistently presented statements on the teaching issues we want to address through the negotiations.

The ruling means that we finally have the right to elections to win official recognition of the union we\u2019ve chartered.</p> <p>It\u2019s an historic moment, and an exciting time to be teaching at Yale. It\u2019s also an extraordinary time for the academics who want better terms and conditions beyond New Haven. In the past few years we\u2019ve been joined by a surge of organising efforts at universities across the country. From Harvard, to the University of Chicago, to Columbia, graduate teachers are insisting that our work is crucial to the educational mission of our universities, and should be recognised as such.</p> <p>After we heard the decision, celebrations erupted. Messages of support and congratulations poured in from around the country: from our peers at public universities who have unions and know how they improve lives; from our colleagues at private universities who, like us, are thrilled to finally have the right to vote; and from former Yale graduate teachers who\u2019ve campaigned for this in the past. </p> <h2>The heart of universities</h2> <p>Graduate teachers teach the classes that are at the heart of college education at Yale. The three of us have taught Yale undergraduates to read fossil records, political arguments and poetry, and to see the world differently as a result. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/mar/08/university-graduate-teaching-assistants-pay-phd-academic\">Graduate teaching assistants deserve more than \u00a34.40 per student per week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We came to graduate school because learning about these things \u2013 the fossilised death spiral of horseshoe crabs, the evolution of democratic thought, the technique of verse composition in early 19th-century poetry \u2013 changed our lives.

We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. </strong></p> <p>I became disabled nearly five years ago, losing the use of my hands gradually over 12 months, with my general mobility becoming more impaired. I\u2019m now transitioning into a wheelchair. Prior to this, I had been employed for seven years in middle management with the same employer and was doing well in my career. I had never had any issues or performance concerns, and I was considered to be a high achiever.</p> <p>I was made redundant 14 months after becoming disabled, but with a good package I accepted it and moved on. I interview well and had a good CV. </p> <p>I was offered a new job quite quickly, but when I declared my disability the role disappeared. I decided after that not to declare my disabilities until I had my foot in the door, so to speak. I did just that, declaring my disability on day one of a new job and was made \u201credundant\u201d 11 months later. </p> <p>Evidence of discrimination was gathered along the way and I was offered a payout. Cue next job, same thing, and same outcome. Now I\u2019m 13 months into job four and in same position. I know the signs and am manoeuvring before what I now believe to be the inevitable happens.</p> <p>I know the law is on my side regarding discrimination, but taking a legal/official complaint route is both distressing and unpleasant and I would hate to go through that again. I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I have to keep on fighting.</p> <p>So how can I get off this merry-go-round? Now that I am a wheelchair user, at least I don\u2019t have the dilemma of whether or not to declare my disability. </p> <p>I don\u2019t think my support needs are great: lightweight equipment (laptop, phone etc.), dictation software (\u00a380) and now I need wheelchair-accessible premises. Above everything, I need a manager who will support me, but how can I assess that in the job interview process?</p> <p>What do I need to do differently to not just get a job but keep it? I don\u2019t know how to get my career back on track. </p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

Rule of law has become nonexistent in Hong Kong and there is no telling how that\u2019s going to affect the confidence of foreign investors.

Beijing is abusing its power.</p> <p>Beijing loyalists in Hong Kong\u2019s legislature will say, \u2018We need to protect the integrity of the motherland, you\u2019re not allowed to say things like \u2018Hong Kong is not China.\u2019\u2019 They worry these sentiments will spread to places like Tibet and Xinjiang, western Chinese provinces with large populations of ethnic minorities and a history of chafing under Beijing\u2019s yoke. </p> <p>The Chinese government never promised \u201cone country, two systems\u201d to Tibet or Xinjiang, but that promise was made to Hong Kong.

Anytime they feel parts of the Basic Law are not up to their current standards of political correctness, they will change it and tell Hong Kong courts to obey.</p> <p>This move is not only a blow to our legislature, but also local courts as well. What are our judges for if Beijing steps in whenever it wants?</p> <p>Today Beijing talks about anti-independence, tomorrow it talks about anti-self-determination and the day after it can talk about anti-democracy altogether.<br>While I have met some young people who have foreign passports who want to stay and fight for Hong Kong, they have a safety net and can leave whenever they want.

  "<p>India\u2019s prime minister has hinted to Theresa May that Britain needs to open up its universities to more of its students.</p> <p>At a conference only hours after the British PM arrived in Delhi on a trade mission aimed at boosting economic ties, Narendra Modi appeared to tackle one of India\u2019s biggest demands of the UK.</p> <p>Addressing a UK-India tech summit he said: \u201cEducation is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future. We must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities.\u201d<br></p> <p>The comments were seen as underlining the importance that Indians place on the ability of their students and highly skilled professionals to move across the world. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/india-warns-uk-immigration-policy-wreck-post-brexit-trade-deal\">India warns UK immigration policy could wreck trade deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/06/uk-will-not-offer-more-work-visas-to-indian-nationals-says-may\">Earlier May had reduced Indian hopes for a more liberal visa system</a>, under which more of its nationals wanting to work in the UK could do so, by arguing that the current offer was generous enough. </p> <p>Speaking on the way to Delhi for her first bilateral meeting outside Europe, the prime minister argued Britain was already able to attract the \u201cbrightest and best\u201d from outside the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe figures show that we issue more work visas to India than I think US, Australia and China put together. Nine out of 10 visa applications from India are already accepted. We have, I believe, a good system,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The comments could prove disappointing for some in the Indian government and business community who have argued for increased numbers, and the move could be key for any future trade deals. </p> <p>May used her speech to the tech summit to insist she wanted an open relationship with India, laying out plans for India to become the first visa country to be put on a registered traveller scheme which helps speed up the experience of visitors in British airports. </p> <p>\u201cThat means for Indian nationals who frequently come to the UK \u2013 and who fuel growth in both our countries \u2013 the entry process will become significantly easier. Fewer forms to fill out, access to EU/EEA passport control, swifter passage through our airports,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Despite the reluctance to increase migration numbers from India to the UK, the prime minister delivered a passionate argument for free trade between the two countries arguing that it \u201ccreates a rising tide that lifts all boats\u201d. </p> <p>She said Britain was determined not to turn its back on the world, adding: \u201cBecause we know from history what happens when countries do not embrace the opportunities of the world. They stagnate, they get poorer, they don\u2019t protect their people, they make them worse off.\u201d</p> <p>Adding that while countries like India did not owe Britain a living, she said working together meant the greatest chance of success. </p> <p>May also said she did not need to wait to leave the EU to start discussions on how trade and investment could be boosted between the countries. </p> <p>She began the speech by insisting that India and the UK had a special link, listening \u201cto each other\u2019s music\u201d and eating each other\u2019s food, as well as sharing a love of cricket. </p>",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/07/malcolm-turnbull-says-qut-case-hurt-human-rights-commissions-credibility-on-18c\">prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull</a>, appears to be gauging support for a parliamentary committee to examine the section as conservative forces rally to wind it back.</p> <p>Reams of column inches and television segments have been devoted to the topic. The sheer volume of content could make you think that people are being locked up left, right and centre by the Australian Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>There are plenty of legal experts who agree that the section could do with changes. But is it the threat some politicians and commentators are suggesting? These are civil, not criminal cases and complaints are rarely successfully invoked. Most cases do not get to the federal court. The Queensland federal circuit court\u2019s decision to summarily dismiss the academic\u2019s case shows that frivolous cases will not be taken up.</p> <p>So where does the real battleground lie for free speech in Australia? </p> <p><strong>1. Offensive language</strong></p> <p>Most states and territories have sweeping offences that allow police to summarily charge Australians with offensive language and behaviour. These powers are used so frequently in New South Wales alone that on average in 2015 four people were charged every day with offensive language. </p> <p>These charges can be applied capriciously. Indigenous Australians are disproportionately impacted; 567 out of the 1,600 charges brought by police were made against Indigenous Australians in 2015.</p> <p>And they can also target legitimate expressions of speech. Police frequently charge protesters with using offensive language. Last month <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-to-use-the-f-word-in-political-protest-67705\">a magistrate threw out a charge against a protester</a> who said the word \u201cfuck\u201d during a marriage equality protest against Fred Nile\u2019s supporters.</p> <p><strong>2. Defamation laws</strong></p> <p>Defamation laws remain one of the biggest threats to freedom of speech in Australia. Journalists face major impediments in their reporting owing to limited protections and defences under defamation laws, as well as the absence of any express constitutional protection for speech. The former treasurer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/30/joe-hockey-wins-200000-from-fairfax-in-treasurer-for-sale-defamation-case\">Joe Hockey\u2019s defamation case</a> against the Sydney Morning Herald would never have made it through the door in the US, but in Australia it led to a $200,000 payout by Fairfax Media. The laws are out of reach for most Australians owing to costs and so are often used by those with deep enough pockets to afford the legal fees.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just news organisations who bear the brunt. Australians who use social media are increasingly being prosecuted for defamatory posts. Without meaningful reform of the current uniform defamation laws, these cases will only increase in their frequency.</p> <p><strong>3. Gags on immigration detention staff</strong></p> <p>The Australian Border Force Act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/01/detention-centre-staff-speak-out-in-defiance-of-new-asylum-secrecy-laws\">bans staff within the detention system</a> from speaking out on matters of public interest. Under the act a former detention staff members could be prosecuted for disclosures to news organisations. Even the mere act of making a recording could see them in breach. In September the secretary of the immigration department issued a determination <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/doctors-freed-to-speak-about-australias-detention-regime-after-u-turn\">excluding doctors from this offence</a>. This was a positive move but many other workers remain within its scope.</p> <p><strong>4. Limited whistleblower protection</strong></p> <p>The Australian Border Force Act is dwarfed by the sweeping scale of a little-known section of the Crimes Act that criminalises \u201cunauthorised disclosures\u201d by all commonwealth officers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/04/qut-racial-discrimination-and-why-the-liberals-fight-over-18c-will-lead-to-a-sequel\">QUT, racial discrimination and why the Liberals' fight over 18C will lead to a sequel | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This offence is so broad that almost any government officer \u2013 and any disclosure they make \u2013 could be captured by it and face two years in jail. It has been used to prosecute whistleblowers. And a number of journalists\u2019 stories relating to the immigration detention regime have been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/22/journalists-reporting-on-asylum-seekers-referred-to-australian-police\">referred for prosecution to the Australian federal police</a> under this section. There\u2019s no public interest defence or requirement that the disclosure has actually caused harm.</p> <p>The Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended substantial changes to how it operates. These changes have been largely ignored by successive governments.</p> <p><strong>5. Restrictions on news organisations reporting on intelligence operations </strong></p> <p>There are heavy criminal penalties in place against news organisations reporting on special intelligence operations. It\u2019s an offence for anyone to disclose the details of such an operation by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, irrespective of the public interest or whether the disclosure exposed wrongdoing. </p> <p><strong>6. Suppression orders and secret hearings</strong></p> <p>Australian courts have a peculiar affinity for suppression orders. It\u2019s common for judges to issue sweeping orders that lock the public out of hearings or reporting on key details of cases. Victoria is particularly renowned for the aggressive use of non-publication orders. Studies have shown a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/court-suppression-orders-still-issued-in-their-hundreds-in-victoria-20151010-gk611a.html\">staggering rate</a> of orders being made.</p>",

  "<p>Most people I know think that I\u2019m crazy \u2013 but anybody who actually knew Billy Thorpe didn\u2019t think that.</p> <p>When I was a young kid growing up in Adelaide he was a big pop star \u2013 a well-dressed, nice young guy seen on television every week. Mums liked him. He was one of the biggest stars in the country and he moved to Australia from Britain just like I did. Sitting there watching him sing on the telly, I wondered what it would feel like to be that lucky. But back then it seemed luck was never on my side. I was just dreaming. </p> <p>The next time I saw him he had changed. In just a couple of years he had thrown away the nice suits, grown his hair and turned into the loudest and hardest rocking singer in the country.

Fuck luck, I was going to shape my own destiny just like Billy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/06/a-rare-privilege-artist-ben-quiltys-heartfelt-ode-to-cold-chisel\">'A rare privilege': artist Ben Quilty's heartfelt ode to Cold Chisel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I used to sneak into the Octagon, the local dance hall in Elizabeth, and watch Billy tear the paint off the walls. Girls would be screaming and fainting every time he moved his leg. Every bloke in the place almost put their necks out as they tried to copy the way he moved when he played guitar. Billy was The King.</p> <p>In 1972, I climbed out of my bedroom window and ran away from home with my older sister and her friends, to go to the infamous Sunbury rock festival. I lay for eight hours in the back of a station wagon on top of their camping gear, breathing in the smoke that billowed from each of them as they passed around joint after joint. They talked about Billy Thorpe and how great it was going to be to see him live at a fucking rock festival. I was high on life. They were just high. </p> <p>To cut a long story short, I got to the festival, was given a handful of pills and ended up in a hospital tent for two days. Eventually I woke up and walked back to the place where I had left my sister. She hadn\u2019t even noticed I was gone. I sat down and drew a deep breath just as Billy walked on stage and screamed out the opening line to Be-Bop-A-Lula. At that point, it was the best day of my life.</p> <p>When he finished we jumped in the car and drove all the way back to Adelaide. It was like a dream. But dreams must end and I had go back home. Back to my life as a garden variety juvenile delinquent. Billy was the ultimate delinquent and I had a lot to do if I was going to be like him.</p> <p>I tried to see every show that Billy did when he came through Adelaide. As a 16-year-old I even managed to get into a couple of his gigs at the wildest pub in Australia, the Largs Pier Hotel. There was a bouncer on the door they called \u201cThe Beast\u201d, who could tell I was a music fan, and he let me in. He was too busy throwing big ugly tattooed blokes through plate glass windows to bother about some kid. I would go right to the front of the stage and watch Billy\u2019s every move. Watching and learning. </p> <p>I noticed at one of these gigs that there seemed to be too many amplifiers for the room. If they were all working there would have been no back wall left on the pub, so I asked one of Billy\u2019s roadies about it. He told me that there were one or two amps that Billy needed and the rest were just there for show.

Eventually the guys from Cold Chisel and I floated down the stairs and rethought how we would take on the world.</p> <p>In the late 70s Billy moved to the States and, I presume, busted a few American eardrums and upset the local law enforcement community. In his absence, bands like Cold Chisel and the Oils and AC/DC came through the ranks, playing the now world famous pub rock scene he had helped to create. </p> <p>Eventually Billy moved back to Australia, started a studio and wrote a few top-selling books. I remember him sitting in my house around the time I started trying to write my book. He sat and scribbled on my papers, and ripped pieces out and told me how he thought I should be writing. I listened intently. By this time, no one told me what to do.

  "<p>Australia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/same-sex-marriage-australia\">debating extending marriage to same-sex couples.</a> A year and a half ago, Ireland was in the throes of a similar debate, gearing up for our own referendum on marriage equality.</p> <p>That referendum passed by a healthy majority, with 62% of those voting approving the extension of the right to marry to same-sex couples. The referendum marked the first time the citizens of a sovereign nation-state voted to entrench the right of two people to marry regardless of their sex within the state\u2019s constitution. </p> <p>Some politicians in Australia are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/24/liberal-mp-calls-for-referendum-on-same-sex-marriage-after-ireland-vote\">pointing to Ireland\u2019s referendum as a model for achieving reform</a>. In fact, enacting equal marriage by referendum is unusual. With the exception of Ireland, all European jurisdictions that have introduced equal marriage have done so through their parliaments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/08/same-sex-marriage-irish-campaign-had-negative-effect-on-most-lgbti-people\">Same-sex marriage: Irish campaign had negative effect on most LGBTI people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Irish government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2015/may/22/a-referendum-is-not-the-way-to-go-when-it-comes-to-gay-rights-or-minority-issues\">insisted that a constitutional referendum was legally necessary to achieve reform (though some dispute this)</a>. The Irish referendum result, moreover, was legally binding. Given that the Australian plebiscite, by contrast, is neither legally necessary nor binding, it seems positively sadistic to subject a vulnerable and historically marginalised minority community to such a vote.</p> <p>Much emphasis is placed on the glowing result of the Irish referendum process, and its effects. There is a serious risk, however, that in focusing on the <em>outcome </em>of the referendum we ignore the effect of the referendum <em>process</em> on the Irish LGBTI community.<br></p> <p>I was active in the campaign. I experienced first-hand the impact of the referendum process.</p> <p>For several months before the referendum, same-sex couples bore the brunt of a sustained media debate about the worth of our families, and about our ability to raise children. Despite robust and compelling evidence to the effect that children raised by same-sex couples fare as well as their counterparts in more mainstream families, a nationwide no side poster campaign declared that \u201cChildren deserve a mother and father\u201d and \u201cTwo men can\u2019t replace a mother\u2019s love\u201d. Although the referendum was actually about marriage rather than children, the debate was dominated by the issue of the suitability of gay couples as parents, and the impact on children being raised by gay couples. Red herrings regarding surrogacy, adoption and consummation abounded.</p> <p>Because of constitutional and legal requirements of balance in broadcast media, those in favour and those against the referendum had a right to equal airtime. Many no proponents were thoughtful, respectful and careful not to offend, though there were certainly others who used the opportunity to propound extreme anti-LGBTI views. </p> <p>For LGBTI people in Ireland, it was difficult to concentrate on anything else in the run-up to the referendum. There was the constant worry of events intervening to scupper the yes side\u2019s prospects, and of a \u201csilent majority\u201d waiting in the long grass to reject the amendment.</p> <p>A survey conducted by Dr Sharon Dane, Dr Liz Short and Dr Gr\u00e1inne Healy (Swimming with Sharks<em>,</em> 2016) bears ample testimony to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/08/same-sex-marriage-irish-campaign-had-negative-effect-on-most-lgbti-people\">the considerable stress and anxiety that the referendum debate visited upon LGBTI people in Ireland and their close family members</a>. The survey of just over 1,650 people reveals that, notwithstanding the positive result, the experience of the preceding national debate was overwhelmingly negative and often profoundly distressing for LGBTI people, particularly younger people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/lessons-from-ireland-is-it-possible-to-have-respectful-disagreement-on-marriage-equality\">Lessons from Ireland: is it possible to have respectful disagreement on marriage equality? | Gay Alcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was also difficult, I sensed, for some older LGBTI people, who remember all too well the oppressive qualities of the church-dominated Ireland of the past, and may have wondered whether things had really changed enough to get the referendum over the line.</p> <p>For those who had not yet come to terms with or were not open about their sexuality, the debate must have been especially painful. It is no coincidence that calls to the national LGBT helpline increased during the course of the referendum.</p> <p>In the afterglow of victory, it is easy to say it was all worth it. Yet the potential impact of a majority no vote is sobering to contemplate. Imagine the people of your homeland, the country you love, telling you that you were not in fact equal, that you were something lesser? However reasonable the populace, the outcome of such a referendum is never a given. Bear in mind that for every Ireland there is a Slovenia, where a referendum last December saw a significant defeat for proposals to introduce marriage equality.</p> <p>Putting the matter to a national vote meant that a minority had to mount an extensive, expensive, and daunting national campaign, with no guarantee of success. Indeed, there is a compelling case to the effect that it is inappropriate to decide matters of minority rights by popular vote. As Omar Encarnaci\u00f3n has argued in the Irish Times<em> </em>\u201cthere is something inherently unseemly about putting the civil rights of any group, especially a historically oppressed one, to a popular vote.\u201d </p> <p>Part of the majority\u2019s reasoning in the US supreme court\u2019s Obergefell decision (the case that opened up marriage to same-sex couples across the US) was that fundamental rights should not be contingent on public opinion or the will of the majority. As the same court stated in West Virginia Board of Education v Barnette: \u201cFundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\u201d</p> <p>The marriage referendum, moreover, diverted energy from other pressing issues for the LGBTI community. This is not to criticise the fantastic Yes Equality campaign, the members of which have been instrumental over several decades in making Ireland a much better place. The referendum result has greatly improved the environment for LGBTI people, but it is far from a universal panacea for all ills.</p> <p>The case for a plebiscite becomes weaker still when one considers that the outcome will not affect the average heterosexual person in any appreciable manner. In Ireland, we have had marriage equality for almost a year. No heterosexual has been harmed in the process.</p> <p>Given that a plebiscite is neither necessary nor binding, and given the likely impact it will have on the LGBTI community in Australia, the case for a plebiscite simply does not stack up. Surely the better, more humane, more effective option is to put the matter to parliament.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><em>Dr Fergus Ryan is a lecturer in law at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth</em></p>",
  "<p>Hong Kong\u2019s publishing industry is facing increasing pressure from China to censor books deemed sensitive by the ruling Communist party, <a href=\"https://pen.org/writing-on-the-wall\">PEN America said in a report</a>, with a raft of store closures and a shrinking pool of willing publishers.<br></p> <p>The report comes a year after five Hong Kong book publishers were detained by Chinese authorities, with some abducted and whisked across borders from Thailand and Hong Kong and held incommunicado for months. All of them specialised in books on the private lives of the top leaders and the intrigues among the Chinese elite.</p> <p>Of the five, Gui Minhai, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\">disappeared from a holiday home in Thailand</a>, remains in custody in mainland China while the other four could be rearrested if they return and are thought to still be under surveillance by Chinese authorities. Another one of the book sellers, Lee Po, is a British citizen.</p> <p>After the UK handed Hong Kong to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> in 1997, the city retained many freedoms, including freedom of speech, under a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, which has made the city a base for many critical of the Chinese government. But many, both within the city and overseas, fear those liberties have been eroded in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cAs Hong Kong residents grapple with continued encroachments by Beijing, the future of free expression on the island and its status as the regional publishing hub is in question,\u201d said Suzanne Nossel, Executive Director of PEN America. </p> <p>\u201cThe government of Hong Kong must act decisively, now, to buttress the rule of law and the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework that protects creative freedom and has allowed Hong Kong to serve as such a vibrant commercial center.\u201d</p> <p>Of the 16 bookstores that sold politically sensitive material at Hong Kong\u2019s airport, a key point for curious mainland Chinese to purchase titles critical of Communist leaders, 11 have shut in the past year. Book stores specialising in political material in downtown Hong Kong also saw a raft of closings.</p> <p>Yu Jie, an exiled writer and democracy activist, had one of his books shelved by a publisher that had previously released his work. He approached several other outlets, all of whom turned him down, alluding to the disappearances.</p> <p>\u201cOne publisher told me that his relatives told him they didn\u2019t want him to be a second Lee Bo,\u201d Yu said of his efforts.</p> <p>Earlier this year at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/25/hong-kong-book-fair-subdued-after-bookseller-disappearances\">Hong Kong book fair</a>, the premiere event in the city\u2019s literary calendar, there was a notable decline of stalls carrying political and \u2018banned\u201d works.</p> <p>While titles that cannot find a Hong Kong publisher are usually still released in nearby Taiwan, publishers there complained that very few in Hong Kong are willing to distribute the books, the report said. </p> <p>PEN America decried the weak response from the Hong Kong authorities and the British and Swedish governments for not doing enough to protect their citizens, accusing the international community of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/23/osborne-to-hail-chinese-regions-enormous-potential-amid-news-of-latest-deadly-unrest\">prioritising business ties over human rights</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere are other incentives for governments to downplay Chinese abuses, including, above all, the desire to maintain beneficial trade and economic relationships,\u201d the report said.</p>",

The pro-Najib red shirt movement also has plans to rally that day, leading to concerns about potential clashes.</p> <p>The Najib scandal emerged in July 2015 when media reports said investigators had found that nearly US$700m (\u00a3450m) from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) state fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/04/malaysia-corruption-watchdog-najib-razak-donations-1mdb\">was transferred into the prime minister\u2019s bank accounts</a>.</p> <p>The administration and its supporters have cracked down on the media and civil society groups, attempting to silence criticism of Najib\u2019s alleged involvement</p> <p>Najib, who founded 1MDB, has strongly denied any wrongdoing. In July, US prosecutors filed civil lawsuits alleging that 1MDB had been defrauded of more than $3.5bn. Najib was not mentioned as involved.<br></p> <p>Although protest leader Jamal is a prominent member of UMNO, there was no indication the government organised the attempt to close Malaysiakini.</p> <p>Malaysiakini editor Gan said Jamal had a right to hold a peaceful assembly. But he added: \u201cLet them have their say. But they should also respect the right of others to speak their minds, too.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, the New-York based advocacy group Human Rights Watch released a report saying the government actions have signalled an ever-broadening crackdown on freedom of expression and assembly in the country.<br></p> <p>The 40-page report, titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/12/deepening-culture-fear/criminalization-peaceful-expression-malaysia\">Deepening the Culture of Fear: the Criminalization of Peaceful Expression in Malaysia</a>\u201d, documented the government\u2019s recent use of vaguely worded laws to criminalise peaceful speech and assembly. </p> <p>\u201cAs Prime Minister Najib\u2019s political fortunes fall, Malaysia\u2019s intolerance of critical speech seems to rise,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cMalaysia\u2019s future as a rights-respecting nation shouldn\u2019t become hostage to defending the Najib government\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sub-zero temperatures are expected to sweep across Britain this week after the first cold snap of the year, prompting warnings that vulnerable people should prepare for a freezing winter.</p> <p>The chilly weather coincides with the launch of a major NHS campaign urging people with long-term health conditions and the over-65s to take action in an effort to reduce the 25,000 extra deaths that occur each winter.</p> <p>Prof Keith Willett, medical director for acute care at NHS England, said: \u201cIt is vital that the most vulnerable people take preventative steps to keep healthy and stay well.

But greater use of battery storage would allow renewable power firms to store their electricity to be released when conditions aren\u2019t right for them to produce. Experts say this would reduce the need to build large fossil-fuel-burning power plants, which are still needed to provide a more reliable source of power.</p> <p>Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: \u201cThis report is the latest in a long series of calls for the government to enable flexible technology to compete on equal footing with existing power stations. This will reduce the number of power stations that need to be built only to operate for a few hours per year, and increase the opportunity for UK businesses to take control of their energy bills, using electricity when it is at its cheapest and opening new streams of income, as well as helping Britain meet its climate change targets at the lowest possible cost.\u201d</p> <p>While industrial energy usage offers the biggest scope for reducing electricity demand, Policy Exchange also pointed to the potential benefits from fitting homes with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/smart-meter-energy-saving-revolution-cut-bills-gas-electricity\">smart meters</a>. The government has set a target of 2020 to fit every home in the UK with a smart meter, a box installed in the home that can monitor energy usage in real time. </p> <p>Howard said these could help ease the burden on the Grid and cut energy bills because suppliers could offer \u201ctime-in-use\u201d tariffs that charge customers based partly on when they use their energy.</p> <p>Power suppliers buy some of their electricity at short notice in the wholesale markets, where prices change depending on how much demand there is. If customers use energy at low-demand times, it limits the amount that suppliers need to buy when prices are high.</p> <p>\u201cAppliances are coming to the market that could be connected to the internet to run when energy is cheaper,\u201d said Howard. \u201cIt\u2019s all technically possible.\u201d</p> <p>Ofgem said it would be publishing a call for evidence on smart power networks that would look at electricity storage and demand response.</p> <p>\u201cProgress towards smarter grids is already being made,\u201d the regulator said, adding that it was looking into subsidies for diesel generators. \u201cSome diesel plants receive additional payments for generating during times of peak demand, in addition to the wholesale price of power. We have set out our concerns on this as we believe it is distorting the market. We are now considering the responses.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>British manufacturers have fanned fears that the economy is heading for a slowdown in 2017 after a survey showed a rise in factory bosses putting off plans to increase investment.</p> <p>Since the EU referendum there has been a sharp rise in the proportion of executives saying political uncertainty is putting them off raising spending, according to a poll by the manufacturers\u2019 organisation the EEF. It found a quarter of manufacturers cited this as a reason when asked in the wake of the vote, up sharply from 6% when the referendum campaign was getting under way in March.</p> <p>The report comes days after the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">Bank of England renewed warnings that the British economy would slow next year</a>, although it was forced to admit that its earlier fears of a severe near-term slowdown had proved unfounded. It also warned that slower corporate spending and a squeeze on household incomes would hit growth further out. </p> <p>The EEF\u2019s report found manufacturers would be likely to pare back their investment in plant and machinery over the next two years in response to growing worries about the prospects for demand as well as the spike in political uncertainty. According to the survey, 60% of manufacturers planned to spend the same or less over the next two years, up from 54% in 2015.</p> <p>The poll of 306 companies was conducted in August. Since then, the Conservative party signalled at its October conference that the government would go for a hard Brexit deal that leaves the UK shut out of Europe\u2019s single market.</p> <p>The EEF report, carried out with the bank group Santander, also echoed other surveys that have pointed to an export boost for some firms as the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum has made their goods more competitive in overseas markets. </p> <p>Manufacturers\u2019 views of export prospects improved between March and August on the back of better demand in Europe and the United States, the EEF said. But that was offset by firms becoming more pessimistic about the prospects for the domestic outlook. </p> <p>The EEF chief economist Lee Hopley said fears of an immediate collapse in business investment appeared to be unfounded for now and that UK manufacturers had been investing at a \u201chealthy pace\u201d in recent years.</p> <p>She added: \u201cBut the spike in political risk should not go unnoticed. There is caution amongst businesses, which will inevitably make it more difficult to get big decisions across the line.\u201d</p> <p>The threat to business investment and companies\u2019 hiring intentions increases the onus on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to use his autumn statement later this month, when he will set out the government\u2019s tax and spending plans, to shore up confidence. </p> <p>Hopley added: \u201cIt\u2019s over to the autumn statement now to press ahead with policies that further enhance the UK business environment for spending on modern machinery and increasingly important intangible investment.\u201d</p> <p>Economic indicators since the referendum have largely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-defies-brexit-slowdown-fears\">defied early predicions of a post-vote slowdown</a> as consumers have continued to spend, unemployment has remained low and the housing market has held steady, for now. The Bank of England followed City economists last week in revising away its forecasts for the economy to grind to a halt in the run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>But many experts warn that this is merely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/the-lull-before-the-tsunami-economists-on-the-brexit-watch-data\">the calm before the storm</a> and the real effects of the landmark vote to leave the EU will be felt after Brexit negotiations begin in earnest next year. The Bank is more optimistic on the near-term than it was in August and expects GDP growth of 2.2% this year but <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2016/nov.pdf#page=42\">still expects a stretch of relatively subdued growth of around 1.5% each year between 2017 and 2019</a> (pdf). </p> <p>A separate report on Monday underscores the scale of unease among businesses over the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects. Businesses are preparing for a slowdown in profit growth and domestic sales in the next 12 months, according to a regular check on corporate confidence from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).</p> <p>Confidence remained fragile in most sectors and business services and financial firms had seen the largest drop in sentiment on the back of growing fears of a hard Brexit, according the report, which used responses from 1,000 chartered accountants given from 26 July to 21 October.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/uk-inflation-rises-near-two-year-high-consumer-price-index\">With the weak pound pushing up inflation</a>, thanks to higher import costs in the UK, companies are wary about raising pay and taking on new staff, the poll found. The average total salary growth expected in the next 12 months was just 1.6%. That compares with the Bank\u2019s forecasts for inflation at a much higher 2.7% next year. If both forecasts prove correct, it would mean earnings fall in real terms.</p> <p>Michael Izza, the ICAEW chief executive, said that a likely squeeze on households put companies in a difficult position.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor should be under no illusion at the pressure UK businesses are experiencing. Inflationary burdens are pushing up costs but companies know that customers will not accept higher prices,\u201d he said.</p>"
