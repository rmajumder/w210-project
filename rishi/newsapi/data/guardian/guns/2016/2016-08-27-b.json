  "<p>In those far-flung outposts of Britain\u2019s influence where diplomats circle the Chesterfields of an evening and gossip over brandy, an old story is never far away. It is the story of a meeting \u2013 never recorded \u2013 that took place between officials of Britain and Norway to discuss the matter of how one might go about depopulating one\u2019s islands. It is whispered that the government of Norway, restored once more following the Nazi occupation of the second world war, approached the UK seeking advice on a robust strategy towards its islands.</p> <p>Happily for future generations of Norwegians, their postwar government ignored what Britain told them, which was to evacuate the islands on the grounds of cost and security and gradually cause them to run down. Norway\u2019s island communities thrived and became a powerhouse, while Britain\u2019s suffered from a policy that has since been described as one of \u201cbenign neglect\u201d. In Scotland, which has 99 populated islands \u2013 two-thirds of the UK\u2019s total \u2013 it wasn\u2019t until the creation of the Highlands and Islands Development Board in 1965 that its islands began to thrive once more.</p> <p>Still, the cost of public services in these areas, per head of population, is higher than anywhere else in the UK.</p> <p>Islands are an economic and administrative nightmare for those countries who were bequeathed them in the Earth\u2019s infant years. So much toil and trouble for so few people: why can\u2019t folk just be sensible and live on the mainland where they can be reached much more cheaply? Don\u2019t they realise how difficult it is to defend these places?</p> <p>Earlier this month, the tiny Hebridean island of Muck (population: 30) <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36956972\" title=\"\">sent out a global appeal </a>via social media for a primary teacher for its seven children. The school\u2019s popular teacher had quit and none of the initial six candidates followed up on their initial interest, as the reality of life on an island without a shop and cut off from the mainland for several months in the year began to dawn on them.</p> <p>Yet following the Facebook appeal, Highland Council has been swamped with applications from all over the globe for the \u00a335,000 a year post, which brings with it a three-bedroom flat and, in the opinion of the last teacher, Julie Baker, \u201ca short commute and stunning views over the sea to Ardnamurchan Point\u201d. These places might be remote and require small triumphs of human endurance, but people will always want to live in them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ebba1b8a0ea379e8985af023ef8b2166113c25a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ebba1b8a0ea379e8985af023ef8b2166113c25a/0_515_5744_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lesson in progress on Muck in 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lesson in progress on Muck in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hi-tech accoutrements of modern life and the instant gratification that they bestow might once have been considered a threat to an island existence, rendering it all but obsolete; instead it has brought a renaissance in remoteness. The internet and social media have made life on an island that little bit less remote and made the task of running a business on it a lot less costly. In the last census the overwhelming majority of Scotland\u2019s islands saw their populations increase.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/25/snp-veteran-michael-russell-appointed-scottish-brexit-minister\" title=\"\">Mike Russell</a>, Scotland\u2019s new Brexit minister, is the MSP representing Argyll and Bute in the Scottish parliament. He might also reasonably be called the UK\u2019s minister for islands, as 23 of them lie within the boundaries of his constituency.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy and business of the islands is not just important to the people who live and work there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are also of crucial importance to the economy of Scotland and the UK. Around two per cent of Scotland\u2019s population lives on our islands and we, as a government, have a moral duty to ensure that they are treated equally and that our public services, which the rest of us take for granted, are accessible to them too.\u201d</p> <p>Russell is married to an islander and lived in the Western Isles for several years. He is acutely aware of the lazy assumptions and mocking antipathy that sometimes characterises mainland attitudes towards islanders. \u201cIn all my years living among islanders and dealing with them I have found them not to be any different than anyone else. The myth of curious and strange island \u2018ways\u2019 is just that \u2013 a myth. Certainly, you need to be possessed of a degree of endurance to prevail in climatic extremes, but there are great rewards too.\u201d</p> <p>Mainland UK, it seems, has never been more attuned to the economic importance of the islands. Last week the Scottish government announced that legislation for its long-awaited islands bill would be brought forward within the next 12 months and that a wide-ranging public consultation would help shape it.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s island constituency numbers around 250,000 people and they are beginning to make their views known. Like many others during the referendum on Scottish independence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/30/shetland-independence-vote-scotland\" title=\"\">they were engaged and enfranchised by the debate</a>. A common theme running through the hundreds of responses to the legislation was that a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to legislation, policy and services does not pay heed to the unique requirements of life on Scotland\u2019s islands.</p> <p>Residents want government legislation affecting public services to be \u201cisland-proof\u201d, meaning that it must exhibit greater understanding of island issues. This, according to the Scottish government, would bring \u201cmore sustainability; greater accountability of authorities; empowerment of communities; consistency with European provision; more efficient use of resources; and wider benefits to the Scottish and UK economies\u201d.</p> <p>On Arran, the seventh-largest Scottish island, there is optimism that some recent depressing trends can be reversed. This gorgeous island is bounded by the Ayrshire coast on one side and the Argyll peninsula on the other. It has been described as \u201cScotland in miniature\u201d and a one-hour drive over its sinewy roads tells you why. Mountains, lochs, fields and oceans are gathered in and around an island of breathtaking beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a51843e2d5b908e2877a547c6b35984718d26f6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51843e2d5b908e2877a547c6b35984718d26f6f/561_663_4335_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists on the isle of Arran with a view to Goat Fell mountain across Brodick Bay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists on the isle of Arran with a view to Goat Fell mountain across Brodick Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Laura Helliwell, born and bred in Arran, had, like many others in her Arran High School class, moved away from the island, but recently returned to manage the Ormidale Hotel, which has been run by three generations of her family since the 1930s. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the hotel that brought me back, it was the opportunity to bring my children up in this environment. The schools on the island are great and there is a real community spirit conveying values that I want my children to be exposed to.</p> <p>\u201cEven if they move away from here I want their values to be shaped by having spent their childhoods here. The vast majority of my classmates growing up have all moved from here but, in recent years, some of them have begun to return, probably for the same reasons as I did.\u201d</p> <p>Like other islands around the UK, Arran has become a haven for retired people. When you add some very tasty house prices on the island into the mix, it doesn\u2019t look like the population will be getting any younger any time soon.</p> <p>The island\u2019s population stands at around 4,600 and the trend is pointing towards further depopulation as the elderly diminish in number and its young people leave. Yet local businessman Derek Shand, who is also a contractor for Business Gateway Services in Arran and Cumbrae, is optimistic about Arran\u2019s future.</p> <p>\u201cLast year we had 41 business startups and 39 are still with us and reporting good outlooks. We have 165 employers employing 1,645 employees. Their biggest challenge is sourcing staff and securing affordable accommodation. The island can also employ almost 500 seasonal staff, and recent tourism trends tell us that the season is growing and the shoulder months are reducing.\u201d</p> <p>In last week\u2019s <em>Arran Banner</em>, the weekly newspaper that has served the island since 1974 and which is bought by more than 90% of the island population, the latest excellent academic achievements of Arran High School are recorded and celebrated and there are signs that, though many will pursue careers on the mainland, some will return with children and try to build a life here.</p> <p>Shand says: \u201cThe current trend shows returning children of islanders buying or leasing their own businesses or taking over from their parents. For the first time in many years we have a very strong young farmers\u2019 club with sons and daughters returning from mainland colleges. There are still 63 registered farms or smallholdings on Arran.\u201d</p> <p>The introduction of the road equivalent tariff, which caps ferry fares at the same rate as bus travel, has been a boon to the Scottish islands. As the ferry fares have reduced, so the footfall has increased. Some businesses, such as the renowned Arran Aromatics and the Arran Brewery, have seen an increase in customers. An island development officer has been appointed and there is a recognition, at last, that a traditional island community can thrive and be fit to meet the challenges of the 21st&#xa0;century.</p> <p>Laura Helliwell is pleased with the bookings she has taken for the season so far. \u201cI think people are now beginning to recognise that new technology and the internet have the potential to be good for remote island communities. It has brought our places to the doorsteps of people living continents away.</p> <p>\u201cThey can see us on their laptop screens and then make a booking without worrying about the language barrier. Prestwick airport is nearby, bringing cheap Ryanair flights, so that helps too.\u201d</p> <p>On a pier surrounded by fields and mountains and where you first encounter Arran, a new ferry terminal is beginning to take shape. Further up the road, land for a new island helipad is being developed. There are four hotels for sale and three restaurants. There are \u201cfor sale\u201d signs on handsome dwellings perched on their own little Edens all over the island.</p> <p>There are opportunities in these places to detach yourself from the world, but to remain in touch all year round.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0768be0ba91bf17133cfcf9b39d40dfb78cd80e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0768be0ba91bf17133cfcf9b39d40dfb78cd80e/0_0_4242_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Approaching Lindisfarne castle by foot on the holy island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Approaching Lindisfarne castle by foot on the holy island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>OFFSHORE HAVENS</h2> <p><strong>Lindisfarne</strong><br><em>Population: 180</em><br>A tidal island off the north-east coast of England and one of the most famous of the UK\u2019s ancient places of pilgrimage.

  "<p>The life of a committed football supporter in the UK could never be mistaken for a bowl of cherries. Since that first day, long in the planning, when his mother or father decided finally to inaugurate him into the sacred mysteries he has been condemned to be viewed with suspicion, fear and loathing by the government, civic authorities and the men who actually run the game.</p> <p>Each of these estates has benefited greatly in the decades since the first rules of association football were drawn up. There is national prestige, free foreign travel with first-class accommodation and the opportunity to take a wee \u201cclip\u201d now and then when success causes its light to shine upon them all. None of them ever really experiences that peculiar numbness that comes with defeat for they only ever follow the money and the glory.</p> <p>In those spaces between the big matches where global fame and marketing opportunities are at stake these three estates seem to spend their time either giving football supporters a right good kicking or dreaming up new ways of doing so. In their fantasy world, football success and the prestige that comes with it can be achieved without having to share it with the scum punters.</p> <p>No one ought to be surprised by this. The state and its attendant offices have never been comfortable when large groups of mainly working-class men gather together in a common purpose. When you add alcohol and political fervour into the mix the result can sometimes be a little too saucy for the governors.</p> <p>Games, along with military adventures and royal fecundity, have remained the favoured way of keeping the minds and bodies of the punters occupied while they are being cheated and exploited. But this football malarkey and the sheer numbers of its adherents, well\u2026 we must always keep an eye on them.</p> <p>To civic Scotland and Holyrood, football supporters are regarded as occupying a position somewhere just above drug-pushers and just below crime lords: you can do business with organised crime but you can\u2019t do business with football supporters. They are unpredictable and are driven by strange currents and deep emotions that a politician will never understand. Even after decades of being overcharged and made to watch the game in gulags these football fans remain true to their club.</p> <p>That\u2019s why small armies of policemen are deployed to kettle them and frogmarch them to and from matches. It\u2019s also why the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act was drawn up. This is the act, unique in world law, where an innocent sentiment uttered at a rugby match in Edinburgh becomes a criminally offensive one when espoused in the vicinity of a football match in Glasgow.</p> <p>So it was surely a welcome development when a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/celtic-fans-raise-45000-for-palestinian-charities-after-flag-protest\" title=\"\">Celtic fans deployed crowd-funding</a> to raise money for two respected relief organisations operating in Palestine. When it was announced that Celtic would play the Israeli champions, Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva, in a Champions League play-off match, some of their fans wanted to use the game as an opportunity to make a small and peaceful protest about the Israeli government\u2019s treatment of Palestinian people living in the West Bank.</p> <p>So around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/23/celtic-fans-warned-not-to-fly-palestinian-flags-at-match-in-israel\" title=\"\">100 Celtic fans</a> in a crowd of 60,000 waved Palestinian flags at the game in a show of solidarity with the Palestinians. They knew the game would be beamed live around the world and they simply wanted to communicate to an oppressed people that, in a small corner of Glasgow, they were not forgotten. The Israeli players were treated respectfully throughout, as was Celtic\u2019s midfielder and Israeli international player Nir Bitton, who was given a standing ovation when he left the field.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/24/palestinian-refugees-chant-thank-you-to-celtic-fans-for-donations-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x5k3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2681076\"            data-video-name=\"Palestinian refugees chant thank you to Celtic fans for donations \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Lajee Center\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bd80f5e4b0fe30498a44be\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/24/160824refugees_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/24/160824refugees.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/24/160824refugees_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/24/palestinian-refugees-chant-thank-you-to-celtic-fans-for-donations-video\">Palestinian refugees chant thank you to Celtic fans for donations</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Uefa, the organisation that runs European football, has deemed the Palestinian flag to be an \u201cillicit banner\u201d when it is waved at a football match and has begun disciplinary proceedings against Celtic. This will probably end in a fine approaching six figures as there have been several previous instances of unwarranted political behaviour by Celtic fans.</p> <p>These supporters launched a #matchthefineforpalestine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/celtic-fans-palestinian-flags-fundraising\" title=\"\">campaign</a>to raise funds for two relief charities operating in the West Bank. Their reasons for doing so were eloquently expressed in a GoFundMe page. In this, they stated their aim of raising \u00a375k to match any Uefa fine and then distribute it to the two nominated charities. At the time of writing they are comfortably past the \u00a3200k mark and will be approaching \u00a3500k by the time of the Uefa hearing on 22 September.</p> <p>Uefa, hardly the most impressive organisation on Earth, doesn\u2019t want politics to contaminate the beautiful game. If it did, there might have been more scrutiny of the way in which it operated as a global mafia, helping itself to the fruits of ordinary supporters\u2019 love for football. Yet, often, football and its mass participation is an ideal place for angry young men and women to gather around and express solidarity.</p> <p>During the fascist regime of General Franco in Spain, to display the Catalan flag was to risk death or imprisonment. The only place where the Catalans could safely fly these fags was Barcelona\u2019s Nou Camp stadium. Barcelona FC now embodies Catalan identity and pride. Wherever there is oppression in the world, football, by its very nature, can provide a vehicle for expressing pride in a national cause. It was never only ever about football.</p> <p>Celtic supporters know this too. Their club was founded in 1887 and played its first game in 1888 to raise funds for the relief of the poor Irish who had gathered in the East End of Glasgow. When they arrived in the city they initially faced resentment, discrimination and squalor. Every time Celtic won a game their suffering was eased a little.</p> <p>In Scotland, those days are long departed. In Palestine, though, another oppressed people is suffering. Perhaps now because of a simple act of solidarity and generosity, they will know that they don\u2019t suffer alone.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Comments will be opened later today</em></p>",

They are \u2013 but things can be important without being interesting. Elections are important <em>and </em>interesting. They\u2019re interesting because they involve people \u2013 candidates, activists, voters, non-voters \u2013 and like most things involving people, explaining what they do and why they do it is not always straightforward. Sometimes it is depressing, sometimes it is uplifting, but it is always revealing.</p> <p>The ideal voter of democratic theory is a rational man or woman, someone who gathers all the evidence about the issues of the day and the plans of the parties, weighs it all up responsibly, cogitating at length, and then delivers a mature and informed judgment at the ballot box. Actual voters aren\u2019t much like that \u2013 which is why they are so interesting.</p> <p>In practice, voters\u2019 choices reflect the whole rich tapestry of human nature: swayed by emotions as well as reason, salesmen as well as products, by tribal attachment as well as cool calculation. Britain offers a particularly interesting case study for election researchers. We have more and more elections to study \u2013 with an electoral cycle that now coughs up an important set of contests on a yearly basis \u2013 which use an increasingly eclectic set of electoral procedures.</p> <p>There\u2019s the growing use of referendums \u2013 with two UK-wide contests in the last decade alone, plus separate ones in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. No one thinks those we have recently seen will be the last either. Then there are the voters, who are becoming ever more unpredictable, and continue to surprise even seasoned election watchers \u2013 both this June\u2019s referendum vote for Brexit and last May\u2019s Conservative Westminster majority confounded many.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The judgments rendered by the electorate are sometimes misinformed, and often harsh, but rarely irrational</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet those who think the decisions voters make are ignorant or even irrational do them a disservice. The judgments rendered by the electorate are sometimes misinformed, and often harsh, but they are rarely irrational.</p> <p>Take the vexed political issue of immigration. Many experts on the issue despair at the ignorance voters display: they seem hopelessly wrong about the numbers coming, the reasons they come and the impact they have on the economy. Yet although they are muddled on the details, voters are remarkably responsive on the big picture. Concern about the issue tracks numbers closely: when migrant numbers go up, more voters cite it as a concern. Voters noticed the pledges by successive governments to bring numbers down, they noticed when these pledges failed, and they noticed that one important reason for that failure was rising immigration from the EU. The growing number of voters who wanted immigration reduced drew the logical conclusions from all of this: the old parties had failed on the issue, so they turned to a new one (Ukip); controlling migration looked close to impossible within the EU, so they voted to leave.</p> <p>This pattern of behaviour \u2013 ignorant about the details, but responsive on the big picture \u2013 is one we see quite often. It has a lot to recommend it. When a room gets too cold, we respond by turning up the heating. When the room gets too hot, we turn it off. We usually manage to do this without knowing the precise temperature. Voters often display a similar thermostatic logic. Of course, voters aren\u2019t consistently rational even on the big picture stuff. But usually when they apparently go off the rails, there is an interesting logic underlying what they do, throwing light on the strengths and weaknesses of how we reason more generally.</p> <p>The approaching party conference season will provide plenty of examples of how politics is an expression of, and a reflection of, who we are and how we think. The parties will appeal to tribal loyalties and tribal enemies because all of us are swayed by tribal affinities, though we don\u2019t like to admit it. Politicians will appeal to our hearts over our heads because our decisions are often swayed more by our emotions than we like to believe. Politicians will promise contradictory things, because voters often demand contradictory things. And even those who never watch a minute of this will be forming judgments based on conversations at work, with friends or around the family dinner table \u2013 as well as longer-standing allegiances, identities and beliefs.</p> <p>This is why we love to study politics for a living \u2013 it reflects human nature in all its contradictory and capricious variety. The ballot box is not just the cornerstone of our democracy \u2013 it is a window into ourselves.</p> <p><em>Philip Cowley and Robert Ford\u2019s More Sex, Lies and the Ballot Box is published by Biteback on 1 September</em></p> <h2>WHAT VOTING PATTERNS TELL US ABOUT UK</h2> <h2>Love and politics: is it a good match?<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dfee62188a86d87101539084668fb4997013ea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dfee62188a86d87101539084668fb4997013ea1/90_75_5347_3669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cNever kissed a Tory\u201d T shirts in the London Pride Parade\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cNever kissed a Tory\u201d T shirts in the London Pride Parade.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>When meeting a new partner\u2019s parents, it may be best to steer the conversation away from politics - especially if they are Labour voters and you aren\u2019t. Just one in eight Conservative voters say they would be unhappy for their children to marry a Labour supporter, but more than a quarter of Labour voters would oppose a romantic match between their child and a Conservative or Ukip voter. We see politics, like everything, through the prism of social groups and social stereotypes - and usually it is those on the left who are the more reluctant to judge people based on their group membership. But when it comes to political tribes, the left are most judgmental. One plausible explanation is that the stereotypes Labour supporters hold about Conservatives are more powerful, and more negative, than those running in the other direction - so the risk of a frosty reception is higher for the young Conservative setting foot in a Labour household. </strong></p> <h2><strong>Does religion affect the way we vote?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Alastair Campbell once famously interrupted an interview with Tony Blair by saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t do God.\u201d Campbell\u2019s objection reflected a general belief that the English don\u2019t like their politics mixed up with their religion. But it\u2019s not true. Surveys stretching back to the 1980s show a remarkably consistent pattern: Catholic voters in England lean towards Labour, while Church of England voters lean towards the Conservatives. This isn\u2019t due to differences in the economic or social status of the different denominations, or to messages from the pulpit. It\u2019s a relic of an earlier era, when religion mattered for politics - and when the Church of England was called \u201cthe Tory party at prayer\u201d. Voters pass their political allegiances down from generation to generation, and so voters with a religious affiliation often retain the political affinities that once went with it, long after religion itself ceased to be a political matter.</strong></p> <h2>Why party ties no longer bind</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec245100524eb2ca7f0e7fa1ee18b4fdc3761bcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec245100524eb2ca7f0e7fa1ee18b4fdc3761bcc/0_0_3176_3304/961.jpg\" alt=\"Young Conservatives\u2019 conference in Eastbourne, 1975.\" width=\"961\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young Conservatives\u2019 conference in Eastbourne, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tribal political affiliations can powerfully influence how we see each other but, in Britain at least, they are in decline. We live in the golden age of the political swinger: more voters than ever before switch parties from one election to the next. A big driver of this is a steady rise in the share of the electorate who feel no great attachment to any of the parties. Such voters were once a rarity. Many voters growing up in the 1960s and 1970s ended up with a lasting political loyalty, usually to Labour or the Conservatives. Young voters today are less willing to enter into long-term political relationships - well over half of those born in the 1980s have made it into their 30s without developing a party loyalty. The result is more demanding voters, who cannot be bought off with appeals to traditional loyalty, and more volatile politics, as the disappointed have few qualms about switching sides - including to new political entrants. With demands rising, loyalty declining and new competitors emerging on multiple fronts, life has never been harder for the mainstream parties\u2019 politicians.</strong></p> <h2><strong>When losers still win</strong></h2> <p><strong>If mainstream politics is in crisis, nobody seems to have told the party members. Even as party loyalties in the broader electorate have ebbed away, formal party membership has enjoyed a remarkable renaissance, with huge surges recorded by the SNP and Labour, and big bumps for the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Ukip. Two qualities set this rebirth of political engagement apart. First, the speed and scale of the member surges is unprecedented: hundreds and in some cases thousands of new members were signing up every day recently. Second, the biggest surges have come after high-profile political defeats - the SNP\u2019s greatest surge came in the wake of the 2014 independence referendum, which it lost; Labour and the Lib Dems both signed up flocks of supporters in summer 2015, after a heavy election defeat. In the past we have assumed that success breeds success - this was true for Labour\u2019s membership renaissance under Blair in the late 1990s - but now, it seems, the loser takes it all.</strong></p> <h2>Are the young keen \u2013 or apathetic? </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51c8cdaf895725cfa154cf19379caf8a0384b4cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c8cdaf895725cfa154cf19379caf8a0384b4cd/0_0_4385_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon and a young woman voter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon and a young woman voter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Much ink has been spilled on the subject of declining youth turnout, and for good reason: the \u201cmillennial\u201d generation - those who came of age at the turn of the millennium - is by some margin the least electorally engaged we have ever seen. Many have argued that the young are, in fact, very politically engaged but are turned off by stuffy, traditional forms of politics (like voting) and much keener on new forms of engagement \u2013 social movements, social networks, direct action. Yet if we take a close look at the attitudes of the young, we find that young voters aren\u2019t fired up by the issues but turned off by politics as usual. The young have more confidence in the traditional political system than their elders, but are also much more likely to find politics boring. Today\u2019s young are not particularly angry or alienated - but they are the most politically apathetic generation in the history of British survey research.</strong></p> <h2>Weather matters \u2026</h2> <p><strong>We know the British love to discuss the weather. But does it affect their political behaviour? This is an easier question to pose than to answer - the British weather is famously variable and changeable, rain clouds come and go, sunshine rarely lasts. But one element of the climate does vary in a systematic and predictable way - the seasons. And it turns out political behaviour, like much else in nature, follows a seasonal cycle. When we look at turnout in local council byelections, which run almost every Thursday through the year, we find that turnout peaks in early summer, before falling away gradually as the nights draw in, to a low ebb in December, when the days are shortest. Some voters, it seems, are like bears - retreating from the ballot box as the cold of winter approaches, before returning with the flowers of spring.</strong></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <h2>\u2026 and so does geography</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10e4d1a0b32d602d133005f9c75bd8e6dbb43ef0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10e4d1a0b32d602d133005f9c75bd8e6dbb43ef0/0_0_4287_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ornate entrance door to the town hall in Lewes, East Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ornate entrance door to the town hall in Lewes, East Sussex.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The seasonal behaviour of voters is not the only unusual thing about local government elections. As we have noted, traditional loyalties to Labour and the Conservatives have steadily eroded, and more voters than ever are turning to new entrants as political competition fragments. Yet look at one of England\u2019s town halls and you will be in for a surprise. In local government, Labour and the Conservatives are more dominant than ever before - they provide more than 80% of the nation\u2019s councillors and control more than 80% of the nation\u2019s councils: among the highest figures recorded since local government was reorganised in the 1970s. The reason is geography, and more specifically how it drives the translation from votes to seats. The Liberal Democrats, once a powerful force in local government, have collapsed since 2010. They were masters of building up concentrated local support and turning it into council seat wins. The new entrants in English politics - Ukip and the Greens - are much less good at this. They field more candidates and win more votes than ever before, but hardly ever enough to win seats. Until these new parties learn the art of turning votes into seats, their presence in local elections just ends up splitting the opposition vote and helping the local political establishment.</strong></p> <h2>The catch with devolution </h2> <p><strong>Leaders of local and sub-national government (to adopt the formal term) perennially complain that they need more powers if they are to do their jobs properly. Voters often agree: surveys in many countries show strong support for devolving powers to local and sub-national governments, including Scotland and Wales, whose devolved governments have accumulated steadily more powers since their introduction. There\u2019s just one catch: voters want more powerful regional governments, but they don\u2019t want these governments to do anything that results in policy varying between sub-nations in the same state. Voters really dislike the idea of university fees, or access to medicines, or criminal sentences varying \u2013 even though such variation is an obvious consequence of devolution. Partly this reflects confusion about who is responsible for what: voters often blame the central government if they do poorly relative to others, even if the devolved government is responsible (something devolved governments themselves have little incentive to discourage). But there\u2019s also some good sense underlying the confusion: voters\u2019 views about policy variation are often driven by whether they think their area will win or lose from the process. Residents of richer places support variation in outcomes because they think they will gain from it; voters in poorer ones are more sceptical because they stand to lose. So voters want devolution, provided they are always the ones who win from the process - an unreasonable, but not illogical, demand. </strong></p>",

He said: \u201c[It\u2019s] a bit of cultural branding used to conceal what is basically a speculative property development aimed at elite consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Sharp, senior branch manager at Ward &amp; Partners estate agents in Folkestone, says there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/09/lets-move-to-folkestone-property-review\">growing influx of wealthy out-of-town buyers</a>, particularly from London, accounting for up to 40% of sales in the last 14 months. He expects the harbour development to bring local house prices more in line with Hythe, its more affluent neighbour, within five years. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing that with different people in the town,\u201d he said. \u201cNot so long ago I could walk down the street and bump into quite a few people I knew.

He added that only 8% would be affordable housing due to the costs of converting the existing harbour, claiming the development was \u201cutterly unattractive to a commercial developer\u201d.</p> <p>James Kennell said: \u201cI\u2019m quite positive about the harbour as a short-term intervention because of the jobs it will create in construction for local people.

Folkestone and Shepway have deeply entrenched social problems and the regeneration that takes place over the next 20 years has to bring those people in, otherwise what you\u2019ll end up with is a very polarised town.\u201d</p> <p>Jonathan Ward said many low-earning artists who had been instrumental in the town\u2019s cultural renaissance had been marginalised by the focus on attracting new consumers and investors.</p> <p>Local artist Matt Rowe said: \u201cFolkestone was on its knees before Roger\u2019s money came in.

  "<p>I don\u2019t know how you set light to a golf course, but in 1897 a riot of several thousand ordinary citizens did just that. The location was One Tree Hill in Honor Oak, a southeastern suburb of London, and they were objecting to the enclosure of common land so that men could hit balls around it with sticks. They were repulsed, which led <em>Golf</em> magazine to say: \u201cWe are not likely to hear anything more of the alleged right-of-way over One Tree Hill, which nature evidently intended for a golf course.\u201d</p> <p><em>Golf</em> was wrong. In 1905 One Tree Hill became what it is now, one of thousands of green spaces across Britain, each with its own idiosyncrasies and history, that are kept at public expense for the benefit of absolutely anyone for whatever legal or sometimes slightly illegal activity they choose, as long as it doesn\u2019t impede others\u2019 enjoyment of the same place. It is part of what is, collectively, one of the great achievements of democracy, two centuries in the making, which crosses both classes and the Atlantic. It is the work of Mancunian communists and Republican US presidents, as well as philosophers, woodcutters, poets, bankers, factory workers and politicians.</p> <p>This is the creation and preservation of parks and commons, both in cities and, in the form of National Parks, in the countryside, that run from the grandeur of Yosemite in California to the more genteel delights of Birkenhead Park in Merseyside, generally acknowledged to be the first publicly funded civic park in the world. They include the more obscure zones of grass and trees from which you are rarely far in British towns. Their different forms have a common principle, which is the availability of nature to all.</p> <p>These areas are remarkably good at fulfilling their intended purpose, as places for refreshment and recovery, for play, for exercise as gentle or strenuous as you would like, in peaceful coexistence with other people whom you may not know and may be different from you, but are attracted by the same pleasures and freedoms of the open air \u2013 elderly bowls players both Anglo-Saxon and Asian, yummy mummies doing exercise classes with their Bugaboo pushchairs, Lebanese picnickers with shisha pipes, Caribbean barbecues, sub-continental kite-flyers. In a recent <em>New York Times</em> article, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/opinion/sunday/this-land-is-my-land-and-yours-too.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Nicholas Kristof </a>wrote movingly of the American national park as \u201ca rare spot where doctors mingle with construction workers\u201d.</p> <p>They feed the creativity, imagination and even economy of the country. The view from Hampstead Heath inspired not only John Keats and John Constable, but was also the place where the piratical Chicagoan entrepreneur Charles Tyson Yerkes had the idea of building many of the Underground lines on which London now depends.</p> <p>The Danish architect and writer Steen Eiler Rasmussen called British parks \u201cwonderlands of the unrestrained imagination\u201d and saw them as part of the same national genius for escape and fantasy that gave us the literature of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear.</p> <p>These places are taken for granted, but they were not achieved without a long, slow struggle. Its origins go back at least to Wordsworth\u2019s statement that the Lake District should be a \u201csort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy\u201d. One of its main episodes was the campaign, which ran throughout the second half of the nineteenth century and beyond, to preserve common land threatened by development.</p> <p>Led by the remarkable MP George Shaw-Lefevre, the Commons Preservation Society wielded the not entirely trusty weapon of ancient rights of access to common land, originally conceived for grazing livestock and gathering firewood and roof-thatching materials.</p> <p>Landowners objected that these rights were now obsolete in urban areas and therefore they should be free to make money by building and quarrying, but Lefevre\u2019s persistence eventually rescued places such as Epping Forest, the Forest of Dean and the Malvern Hills from destruction and enclosure, without which Britain would feel like a very different country.</p> <p>Lefevre\u2019s allies included John Stuart Mill, the original bookselling WH Smith, and people who made their living from lopping trees and, if the campaign\u2019s methods were mostly legal, political force was sometimes wielded. There was the battle of the golf course, for instance. At Berkhamsted Common in Hertfordshire a radical MP and banker financed 120 navvies to tear down two miles of iron fence that had been erected to enclose common land. Separately from Lefevre\u2019s efforts, there was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/12/guardian190-hyde-park-riots\" title=\"\">Hyde Park Railings Affair of 1866</a> in which demonstrators forced down the park\u2019s fence, and helped make what was once an aristocratic playground into the open and available place it is now.</p> <p>There was an unsuccessful attempt, in 1884, at an act of parliament that would have created national parks, a concept which flourished better in the United States, where it was backed by Theodore Roosevelt. A hundred years ago this month the National Park Service was established. Back in Britain forcible action was again felt necessary, with the 1932 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/apr/17/kinder-scout-mass-trespass-anniversary\" title=\"\">mass trespass</a> by ramblers of Kinder Scout in the Peak District, led by the 21-year-old <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1382589/Benny-Rothman.html\" title=\"\">Benny Rothman</a> of the Young Communist League of Manchester. The Attlee government, in 1949, finally passed the legislation that brought national parks to Britain.</p> <p>A common quality of these campaigns is their bottom-up spontaneity. They came about less from the leadership of demagogues and visionaries than from a powerful sensation among disparate people in different places of the fundamental human importance of access to nature. They also continue into modern times. In the 1980s the London Wildlife Trust successfully fought to keep the wild places left by the retreat of industry. <a href=\"http://www.oss.org.uk\" title=\"\">The Open Spaces Society</a>, as the Commons Preservation Society is now called, celebrated its 150th anniversary last year.</p> <p>Like other things humane, civilised, inclusive and well-functioning, these concepts are under threat from vandals on the right. Republicans in Congress have for some time blocked adequate funding for the National Parks Service and the 2016 Republican platform includes the promise to remove the \u201ceconomic burden\u201d and \u201clost revenue\u201d that comes from their management by Federal government.</p> <p>This policy comes in the context of assaults on other allegedly business-killing environmental protections, such as limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The intent seems clear, to loosen controls on the parks to enhance their opportunities for profit. If so, the Republicans would unravel what has been called \u201cAmerica\u2019s best idea\u201d and one to which great figures in their own party have contributed.</p>",
  "<p>In a world where good news is often a rarity, the peace accord struck last week between Colombia\u2019s government and the leaders of the country\u2019s main Marxist rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), stands out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/colombia-government-farc-rebels-peace-deal-52-year-war\">The deal, four years in the making,</a> brings to an end an era of often violent confrontation whose origins may be traced back to the peasant revolts of the 1960s. The Farc insurgency was rooted in a quest for social justice and land reform, issues that had dogged the country \u2013 sparking multiple uprisings between peasants and a landed elite \u2013 since its independence from Spain in 1819.</p> <p>Stark though these inequalities were, successive governments in Bogot\u00e1 entirely failed to address the primary causes, and in response to the Farc insurgency they resorted instead to ruthless extirpation and repression; the insurgency, in turn, morphed into a terror campaign of killings, kidnappings and bombings.</p> <p>Farc\u2019s leadership became closely involved with the lucrative trade in cocaine, helping to supply the apparently insatiable North American market, to fund their insurrection. It sometimes became difficult to distinguish between the original guerrilla movement and opportunistic criminal gangs and drug lords who exploited chronic unrest to further their selfish, greedy aims.</p> <p>The insurgency and the brutal official response distorted and undermined Colombia\u2019s shaky democracy, exacerbating divisions linked to class, race and land. It brought to power hardline rightwing governments prepared to countenance extra-judicial methods, including covert, paramilitary death squads, in pursuit of vain and costly attempts to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-37180752\">\u201cwin\u201d the war\u201d</a>.</p> <p>There were no winners during this war. In the early 1990s, assailed by Farc on the one hand and Pablo Escobar-style narco-terrorism \u2013 whose money corrupted the judiciary, the police and the body politic \u2013 on the other, the country was close to being a failed state as the institutions buckled and very nearly broke.</p> <p>The insurgency, more than 50 years old, is estimated to have taken up to 260,000 lives and displaced about 8 million people. As Juan Manuel Santos, Colombia\u2019s president, said last week, few citizens escaped the dire effects, direct and indirect, of the resulting endemic instability. Nor were the ill effects confined to Colombia. Its weakness invited foreign meddling, whether by the regime of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, which gave refuge to Farc leaders, or by US presidents, such as George Bush Snr, who co-opted Colombia in Washington\u2019s ill-conceived \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. The involvement of the American military, special forces and CIA units in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SBmhVukXro\">government counter-insurgency and counter-narcotics campaigns</a> magnified the drama but failed to solve the problem.</p> <p>When set against this grim background, the peace deal reached in Havana must surely be viewed as a welcome development. It is a tribute to Santos, who has dedicated his presidency to its achievement. And it reflects well on Timole\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez, alias Timochenko, the Farc leader, who has finally traded violent resistance for a more peaceful future. The agreement is also a feather in the Che Guevara berets of Cuba\u2019s leaders, who provided a neutral talks venue for UN mediators and for European countries, notably Norway, which supported the process.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s role was not insignificant. The draft final agreement draws on shared experience gained in formulating the Good Friday accords in Northern Ireland, as Downing Street was quick to point out. <a href=\"http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/25426\">Irish Republicans</a> also did their bit, atoning, perhaps, for past, less-than-constructive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/aug/19/northernireland.ireland\">IRA links to the rebels</a>. So congratulations are certainly in order. The breakthrough is a universal positive, demonstrating that even the most protracted conflicts can be resolved peacefully. It strengthens hopes, for example, that the current Geneva negotiations will eventually deliver a lasting Syrian truce. But for Colombia, the key question now is whether this historic deal can be made to stick.</p> <p>The pact is much more than a mere ceasefire and downing of arms, as last week\u2019s joint communiqu\u00e9 made clear. \u201cThe end of the conflict will mean the opening of <a href=\"http://colombiapeace.org/\">a new chapter of our history</a>. It means beginning a transition phase that may contribute to a greater integration of our territories, a greater social inclusion \u2014 especially of those who have lived at the margins of our development and have suffered the conflict \u2014 and strengthening our democracy... with full security guarantees for those who participate in politics,\u201d its provisions stated.</p> <p>In other words, this ambitious agreement calls for a range of sweeping structural changes including, crucially, land ownership reforms, daunting in their scope and highly challenging in their implementation. By offering the rebels immediate, non-voting representation in Congress, to be followed by legitimate, party-based participation in subsequent national elections, it also envisages a degree of political inclusiveness that could revolutionise Colombia\u2019s democracy in ways Farc\u2019s ideologists once only dreamed about. This is a tall order for any country \u2013 particularly one as divided across sectarian right and left lines as Colombia.</p> <p>The debate preceding the national referendum on the deal, promised by Santos for 2 October, will expose these faultlines. Chief among them is the offer to most of Farc\u2019s 7,000 fighters of an amnesty and <em>de facto </em>immunity from prosecution as part of a new transitional justice system. This offer is deeply resented by many surviving victims and their families who want retribution, not reconciliation. So, too, is the plan to pay demobilised rebels 90% of the national minimum wage as an upfront incentive to bring them in from the jungle. \u00c1lvaro Uribe, the former conservative president and leader of the main Centre Democratic party opposition, has vowed to resist these terms. He is urging a \u201cno\u201d vote in October.</p> <p>The rebels, meanwhile, fear for their safety once they disarm. And with good reason. Their last experiment in politics was the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica, a party they co-founded in 1985 with a view to entering the political peace process. Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica quickly made electoral gains across the country before a vicious three-year campaign of violence by rightwing paramilitaries murdered 3,000 of their activists, union officials, congressmen and even a number of their presidential candidates.</p> <p>Colombia\u2019s military and police did little to offer protection to this putative new voice in politics, and it seemed the country was not ready to embrace a more pluralist form of democracy. The experiment ended, the peace process failed, and Farc returned to arms. The next phase of Farc\u2019s war would see increased kidnappings, urban bombings, allegations of narco-trafficking and the use of minors in combat. This left a bitter legacy for many Colombians, and critics say the accord should include jail terms for crimes against humanity, plus a ban on those so convicted from holding public office. There is also concern that the deal could be undermined by a smaller guerrilla group, the ELN, which has continued a campaign of violence. Organised criminal groups spawned by demobilised rightwing militias pose another potential threat.</p> <p>Recent opinion polls suggest the public\u2019s endorsement of the deal is by no means certain, with 88% of Colombians polled by Ipsos in early August saying Farc commanders should serve jail time, and 75% saying they should be banned from politics. Half of respondents said they would vote \u201cno\u201d in October, against 39% in favour.

  "<p>Venice, first of the big autumn film festivals, is the most glamorous, attracting big stars to Europe\u2019s most beguiling location. But this year, virtual reality technology could steal the limelight from all the talent posing on the Rialto.</p> <p>The film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/29/jesus-christ-virtual-reality\"><em>Jesus VR \u2013 The Story of Christ</em></a>, to be unveiled at the festival on Thursday, marks the biggest investment so far in bringing the immersive world of virtual reality to mainstream cinema. The US-backed film will be 90 minutes long when it is released this Christmas, but 40 minutes are to be previewed in Venice for anyone quick enough to grab a headset. Filmed in 360 degrees, it places its audience as spectators at the nativity, and takes them right through to the resurrection. The film is Venice festival\u2019s way of saying that the future has arrived.</p> <p>\u201cJust as 3D cinema offered a way to draw audiences that had been lost to television back to the cinema, in the 1950s, so VR provides a unique selling point in the battle against the ubiquity and accessibility of online content,\u201d said film and gaming expert Michael Pigott of Warwick University. \u201cVR certainly offers a form of entertainment experience that is new and striking, but perhaps of equal importance is the fact it is tied to technology. Entertainment companies can market a unique experience that audiences can only have if they go to a VR-capable cinema or purchase the requisite headset and hardware.\u201d</p> <p>Although Imax cinemas are billing their VR theatres as alternatives to the solitary headset experience, up until now consumers have had to shell out for a VR system like Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard or the HTC Vive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3895524444957785e71da93425e17c655ddb50b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3895524444957785e71da93425e17c655ddb50b3/79_30_551_331/500.jpg\" alt=\"Invasion!, according to Madagascar co-director Eric Darnell, is in a \u2018brand new language\u2019.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Invasion!, according to Madagascar co-director Eric Darnell, is in a \u2018brand new language\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baobab Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This spring, the Cannes film festival also gave more space than usual to VR, showing more than 35 new short films. But it is Venice that has really welcomed the format, setting up a special viewing salon. So, despite deciding to call off the festival\u2019s opening celebrations out of respect for the Umbrian earthquake victims, Venice will still be watched closely in the wider film world to see how sceptical critics react to VR.</p> <p>The big question remains: does anything yet bridge the divide between the worlds of gaming and cinema? At Cannes, Steven Spielberg was not convinced. He said he felt VR was even potentially \u201cdangerous\u201d because it let the viewer \u201cforget the story\u201d. Alongside naysayers like Spielberg is Pixar\u2019s co-founder, Ed Catmull: \u201cIt\u2019s not storytelling. People have been trying to do [VR] storytelling for 40 years. They haven\u2019t succeeded,\u201d he said last year.</p> <p>Videogaming, he believes, is the natural home for the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s its own art form, though, and it\u2019s not the same as a linear narrative.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Pigott points out there are two ways that VR is already providing new kinds of storytelling: experiments in a kind of \u201clight\u201d interactivity that allows the viewer limited control over their point of view within a film; and a stronger version, where the viewer can explore a fictional world \u2013 something that many video games, such as GTA 5 or The Last of Us, already permit, if only in an animated form, rather than a photographic world.</p> <p>Lucasfilm has played around with Google\u2019s Cardboard headset kit, making a short VR video called <em>Jakku Spy</em>, which it released before <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>, while newcomer Baobab Studios has made a six-minute film called <em>Invasion!</em> It was presented at Cannes by Eric Darnell, the co-director of animated hit <em>Madagascar</em>, who told reporters it was not an extension of cinema, but \u201ca brand new language\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb4a1f595ce2ed3e1eb41adec5fe4d34e30111fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb4a1f595ce2ed3e1eb41adec5fe4d34e30111fb/0_133_4428_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oculus owner Mark Zuckerberg emphasises VR\u2019s impact on health, education and the watching of sport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oculus owner Mark Zuckerberg emphasises VR\u2019s impact on health, education and watching sport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This month, a pop-up event in Los Angeles showcased <em>The Turning Forest</em>, an adventure made by Oscar Raby in which the viewer partners up with strange creatures to activate musical cues together.

It is less a question of technologies, than of different modes of storytelling and spectacle, and \u2026 one is unlikely to simply replace the other,\u201d he said.</p>",

It would be a dream because everyone is happy but unfortunately there are injuries, we have to compete every three days. In Germany, they have a winter break, here not.

Players [don\u2019t] understand: \u2018Why the coach love this guy and don\u2019t love me? Why?\u2019 It is true, you deserve to play. I said many times you deserve to play. All of them, 30 players, you deserve to play. Nineteen players don\u2019t play, so tell me how you handle that? It is impossible. Especially if you have many relationship minutes, training sessions with them to develop, to understand what you want to do.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to communicate so that they believe: \u2018I am going to play because I created a [good impression],\u2019 and that is the goal.\u201d</p> <p>Guardiola has asked Sergio Ag\u00fcero to start closing down opposition players and he is happy to do so. \u201cPep has changed the way we have been playing in previous years,\u201d the striker said. \u201cIn my case, he\u2019s very demanding of me.

The referee whistles and I move my hands but it is them [the players].

Or, as Mick McCarthy once put it, \u201ctwits who tweet\u201d.</p> <p>There is no point going through all the content but the most glaring example contains a level of hashtag hate \u2014 \u201cIs it me or are there gays everywhere? #Burn #Die #MakesMeSick\u201d \u2014 that clearly goes beyond the usual hurling of online abuse and, unfortunately for Gray, a lot of people might think it doesn\u2019t wash to offer a template apology, professing to be a changed man, and trotting out the standard lines that defence lawyers use in court when they are trying to get their clients a reduced sentence.</p> <p>Even ignoring for one moment the pitchfork homophobia, Gray comes across as a difficult man to embrace. \u201cFumin,\u201d he writes. \u201cStuck in traffic cause some sad weak fool decided to get themselves run over on the motorway. #NoSympathy.\u201d There are memories of school (\u201cMa teacher told me a was a piece of shit.. saw her the other day driving a piece of shit\u201d), a declaration of allegiance to Arsenal (\u201cI hate Theo Walcott\u201d) and various other 140-character missives that go against him before we get to the ones that have come to the attention of the FA\u2019s disciplinary department.</p> <p>It might get even worse for Gray now it also turns out the charge sheet, covering an eight-week period from 9 January 2012, has been extended to include another tweet \u2013 beginning with the declaration \u201cI hate lightys!\u201d\u2013from July 2014, shortly after he had signed for Brentford from Luton. A \u201clighty\u201d is slang, often regarded as offensive, to describe a light-skinned person of mixed race. If you think back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/17/rio-ferdinand-alex-ferguson-warned-twitter\">Rio Ferdinand\u2019s disciplinary case</a> for retweeting someone who had described Ashley Cole as a \u201cchoc-ice\u201d (meaning black on the outside, white on the inside) it is probably safe to assume Gray needs a good lawyer.</p> <p>Is it fair for Burnley to be punished for something that happened in the past and completely out of their control? Not in the slightest and it is easy to understand why the relevant people at Turf Moor are struggling to understand how the FA can punish tweets going back over four and a half years, starting when Gray was at Hinckley United, yet look the other way when it comes to the night Vardy took exception to the presence of a Japanese man at his local casino.</p> <p>In mitigation, there is also quite a bit of background to take into account in Gray\u2019s case and it is a shame, perhaps, that he did not offer more context in his statement asking for forgiveness and pointing out \u201cthankfully I am not the guy I was back then\u201d.</p> <p>That scar running diagonally from his left ear and all the way across his cheek is the legacy of being slashed with a knife in a street fight in Wolverhampton, around Christmas 2011. The most offensive tweets started a couple of weeks later and if Gray seemed angry with the world that was because he probably was. Gray\u2019s autobiography would certainly not be the average footballer\u2019s story. He grew up without a dad and, at 13, lost the grandfather, Terry, who had taken on the role of a father figure. After that, it was a story of gangs, violence and the kind of lifestyle most of us can barely contemplate. Some of the people he knocked around with have ended up dead and it was football, more than anything, that helped him come out the other side. So, yes, maybe he is a better human being at 25 than he was at 21. Maybe we can take it at face value and Gray, in 2016, is not the hate-filled individual he was in 2012.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the sport as a whole, it is more easy pickings for those armchair columnists who like to lament the elastic principles in Gray\u2019s profession compared to those of the people we saw competing in the Olympics. It actually works both ways \u2013 there are things football can learn from other sports, and vice versa \u2013 but Gray\u2019s tweets, historic or not, certainly go against the image the game likes to portray these days and it is not always easy knowing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/29/robbie-rogers-coming-out-gay\">Robbie Rogers</a>, formerly of Leeds United, coming out as gay in 2013 has changed everything as much as many people thought.</p> <p>It certainly did not feel that way, visiting one Premier League club recently, when the various community assignments were being shared out and seeing the horror of one of the squad \u2013 a high-profile player \u2013 when his name was put alongside an LGBT event. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, as if someone had just asked him to bungee-jump off the top of a cliff. There was an attempt to talk him round \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s anti\u2011discrimination, not pro-homosexuality\u201d \u2013 but he looked terrified. To say he froze would be an understatement and, despite one more go to persuade him it didn\u2019t mean dressing up as one of the Village People, it soon became obvious it might be better all round to designate somebody else.</p> <p>It says something that the number of complaints to Kick it Out about homophobic abuse has actually gone up, not down, over three-fold in the last three seasons and you might have heard what happened last weekend when Rogers, playing for LA Galaxy II against Orange County Blues, claimed an opposition player had repeatedly called him a queer.</p> <p>The player in question? Richard Chaplow, Accrington-born and previously of Burnley, West Brom, Preston North End, Southampton, Millwall and Doncaster Rovers. Chaplow denied the accusation but admitted swearing <a href=\"http://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/689979?referrer_id=2333971\">and was suspended for two matches</a> when a proven case would apparently have meant three. All of which makes an interesting comparison when on the same day Hope Solo, the USA women\u2019s team goalkeeper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/hope-solo-suspension-female-athletes-double-standards\">was banned for six months</a> and her contract was terminated because she had complained about Sweden\u2019s defensive tactics in the Olympics and described them as a \u201cbunch of cowards\u201d.</p> <p>For Gray, the damage will be twofold. In football, it has always been easier getting a bad name than losing one and, if he is indeed a changed man, it isn\u2019t going to be a pleasant experience being tarnished by something he had probably long forgotten about. First, though, there is the likelihood of a long ban \u2013 Gray must respond to the charge by Wednesday evening \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t hurt if he made efforts in that time to show the world he is sorry, stand up in front of the cameras and explain in detail how he has changed and why we should believe him. Much better that way than being a twit who tweets.</p> <h2>Wenger and Levy plans don\u2019t add up</h2> <p>For two clubs who would like us to believe they have high ambitions, it has not been easy understanding the transfer-market movements of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur<strong> </strong>over the last few days.</p> <p>That was certainly a curious move, first of all, from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, having made it clear all summer that he would not be pressured into spending, to go in for Lucas P\u00e9rez from Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a when this is a striker who has been on the market all summer without Arsenal thinking it warranted triggering his \u00a317m buyout clause.</p> <p>Leicester City<strong> </strong>were the first club to explore a potential move earlier in the summer on the say-so of Steve Walsh, their head of recruitment. Everton thought they had a transfer lined up when Walsh subsequently moved to Goodison and Wenger might have to understand the allegations of panic buying when, three weekends into the new season, Arsenal suddenly ambush the deal.</p> <p>Even more perplexing is why Tottenham left it so late to move for Wilfried Zaha if they were serious about trying to prise him away from Crystal Palace. After nothing all summer, was it sensible to wait until Yannick Bolasie had completed his move to Everton before putting in the call?</p> <p>Palace have just lost one of their better attacking players. They can hardly be blamed for not wanting another to go, especially with so little time to find a replacement before Wednesday\u2019s deadline.</p> <p>As for offering \u00a312m, did the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, seriously think that might clinch a deal in today\u2019s inflated market? Bolasie went for \u00a325m and Zaha, at 23, is four years younger and therefore a more valuable asset.</p> <p>Levy likes to think he operates by his own rules but it does make me wonder whether this is the best example yet of what he calls<strong> </strong>\u201cpragmatic player trading\u201d now the club have a new stadium to finance \u2013 or, to put it another way, trying to do everything on the cheap.</p> <h2>Sunderland are in Allardyce\u2019s debt</h2> <p>Ahead of the first international break of the season, I wonder if Sunderland\u2019s chairman, Ellis Short, and the club\u2019s media department might acknowledge now that it was all rather petty and unbecoming to announce Sam Allardyce had taken the England job in a clipped 49-word statement that did not wish him well or express any gratitude for the feat of escapology that kept them in the Premier League.</p> <p>When David Moyes subsequently took over at Sunderland, it was intriguing as well to see Short\u2019s eulogy for the new manager and the clear message that he would rather have had him than Allardyce in the first place. Moyes, he said, was \u201cmy No1 managerial target for the last five appointments, but his desire to honour existing contracts meant we were not able to bring him to Sunderland previously\u201d.</p> <p>One problem: Paolo Di Canio was sacked by Sunderland on 23 September 2013 and replaced a couple of weeks later by Gus Poyet. Do Sunderland really want us to believe their top target was a man three months into a six-year contract as Manchester United manager?</p>",
  "<p>In the debate about London\u2019s skyline there are certain points on which most of the protagonists \u2013 developers, architects, planners, mayors, campaigners \u2013 agree. There\u2019s nothing wrong with towers in principle, they say, but they should be well-designed and in the right place. The various policies regarding tall buildings say much the same thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/27/londoners-back-skyscraper-limit-skyline\">Londoners back limit on skyscrapers as fears for capital\u2019s skyline grow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now it seems that ordinary citizens agree, too. Ipsos Mori\u2019s poll finds large chunks of opinion on both sides of most of its questions, but in general it suggests that most Londoners are tolerant of tall buildings, or at least not outraged by them.</p> <p>But there is widespread concern about their impact on the city as a whole and on individual neighbourhoods. A clear six out of 10 respondents want some kind of limit on skyscrapers, and more than half (56%) want them limited to specific areas, which presumably means they should be \u201cin the right place\u201d.</p> <p>They also like towers more if they help meet housing need, which is often used as an argument for giving them planning permission. On the face of it, towers should do this: it seems common sense that a tall building should create more living units than a short one.</p> <p>The snag is that the terms \u201cwell-designed\u201d and \u201cin the right place\u201d have proved so vague as to be largely ignorable by the developers of towers, and by the planners who approve them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/29/what-is-lost-below-by-building-above\">What is lost below by building above | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The clusters that will dominate the Thames at Vauxhall and Blackfriars are not by any reasonable definition in the right place. The meretricious junk appearing in outer suburbs is not well-designed. Nor have towers so far done much to address the most pressing housing needs \u2013 rather, their planning applications come with ingenious arguments as to why they should be excused from requirements for providing affordable housing.</p> <p>There are some glimmers of hope that the skyscraper free-for-all promoted during the mayoralty of Boris Johnson might be calming down. The proposed Paddington Pole, a Shard-sized tower in west London, has been significantly reduced in height. And the palisade of towers planned for Bishopsgate Goodsyard in east London has been knocked back.</p> <p>It\u2019s also certain that many of the 400-plus plans for tall buildings will never be realised, especially if there is a Brexit-induced property slump. But it will only take a few ill-considered proposals to inflict severe damage on the city\u2019s fabric and views.</p> <p>The case is as strong as ever for a coherent and considered strategy for building tall in London, one that defines where towers are and are not acceptable and sets out basic principles \u2013 about their impact at street level, for example, and their relationships to each other and to existing buildings. Not only is it basic common sense \u2013 it\u2019s also what most of the public would like.</p>",

  "<p>After almost 20 years at Old Trafford as player, coach and, finally, Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s assistant, Mike Phelan knows all about Manchester United\u2019s knack of scoring last-gasp goals.</p> <p>Hull City\u2019s caretaker manager must have celebrated countless such winners but he could certainly have done without Marcus Rashford\u2019s clincher here. Perhaps determined to make Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Sam Allardyce sit up and take notice, the young England striker with an electric change of pace altered the game after stepping off the substitutes\u2019 bench and steering in Wayne Rooney centre from close range.</p> <p>With a single, decisive kick, a superbly defiant Hull \u2013 for whom Curtis Davies was imperious in central defence \u2013 were brought back to earth. Phelan had said expecting his 14 fit senior professionals to defeat United\u2019s \u00a3200m worth of talent might be \u201cdelusional\u201d but when David Meyler very nearly scored a shock 89th-minute effort of his own Hull almost did precisely that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/27/hull-city-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live\">Hull City v Manchester United: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was expecting a difficult match,\u201d said Mourinho whose side have yet to drop a point. \u201cAt half-time I told them we were playing against a very organised Hull with an amazing spirit and our play had to be intense. We needed a bit of luck to score but I think we deserved it completely. And Rashford is very good. He gave us diversity. He\u2019s going to play a lot of matches.\u201d</p> <p>Phelan was sanguine. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and I feel for my players but we lost a bit of concentration, maybe it was fatigue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe performed magnificently in all departments, we just ran out of steam. We need to add to the squad.\u201d</p> <p>But will he be able to when the club are in the process of being taken over by a Chinese consortium with another set of rival bidders hovering in the background? \u201cWe\u2019ve got offers in for players,\u201d Phelan said, \u201cbut getting them is touch and go.\u201d</p> <p>The midfield contest proved similarly, and unexpectedly, tight with Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba \u2013 collectively 12ft 7in \u2013 being frequently second guessed by Hull\u2019s rather more averagely built midfielder Sam Clucas.</p> <p>Admittedly there were moments when Clucas \u2013 ably supported by Tom Huddlestone and Meyler \u2013 was outmuscled by the more athletic Pogba but generally he proved a big reason why United rarely troubled Eldin Jakupovic during the first half. Apart from watching a header from Zlatan Ibrahimovic fly fractionally over his bar following the striker\u2019s connection with Anthony Martial\u2019s cross, the goalkeeper had relatively little to do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/leicester-city-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester survive late scare against Swansea to secure first win of season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Heavy rain was testing the waterproof powers of Mourinho\u2019s overcoat when Robert Snodgrass stepped forward to hit a free-kick from almost 30 yards. As it curled in, David de Gea remained motionless and must have been mighty relieved to see it brush the outside of a&#xa0;post.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Huddlestone\u2019s wonderful long pass sparked a Hull counterattack that concluded with Andrew Robertson crossing and Luke Shaw intercepting quite brilliantly as Snodgrass prepared to pounce at the far post. Unfortunately the winger, whose presence had restricted Shaw\u2019s ability to start attacks from left-back, ended up colliding with the upright and injuring a calf.</p> <p>With Snodgrass suddenly a passenger, United regrouped. When Jakupovic could only parry Juan Mata\u2019s cross, the hitherto anonymous Rooney looked set to score only for Davies to chest the ball off the line.</p> <p>Although United had plenty of possession and Hull\u2019s attacking game could not exactly be described as ambitious, Phelan must have been delighted by the way his team contained their guests with Davies\u2019s minding of Ibrahimovic emblematic of this collective smothering.</p> <p>With Snodgrass forced off by that earlier injury minutes into the second half and Fellaini arguably fortunate not to have received a second booking for what looked suspiciously like a clearcut case of dissent, United began to settle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/everton-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">Shay Given\u2019s own goal gives dominant Everton victory over Stoke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recognising that things were still not quite right, Mourinho replaced Martial with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the newcomer\u2019s intricate passing immediately helped bring the best out of Ibrahimovic. That said United\u2019s lone striker had already done more than most to raise the tone, one glorious volleyed backheel flick which found Mata offside lingering in the memory.</p> <p>A goal stubbornly refused to materialise and Rashford replaced Mata, although some United fans may rather have seen Rooney taken off. Shortly afterwards a wonderful save from Jakupovic denied Rashford, whose shot passed through Jake Livemore\u2019s legs.</p> <p>Despite being forced ever deeper by Rashford\u2019s skill and speed, Hull were still in it. Huddlestone\u2019s shot deflected off Eric Bailly and flew tantalisingly off target with De Gea wrong-footed before Meyler fired narrowly over.</p> <p>Then, just as dusk closed in on Mourinho\u2019s technical area, Rashford switched the lights back on for United.</p>",
  "<p>After threatening to sue the city\u2019s police department, the Chicago Tribune has obtained official data tracking every time an officer has opened fire in the city over the past six years.

It also found that about half of the officers involved were African American or Hispanic and most had years of experience. Of 520 officers who fired their weapons, the paper found, more than 60 did so in more than one incident.</p> <p>Most of the police shootings took place in south and west side neighborhoods beset by gang violence and poverty. At least one of every five shootings involved plainclothes tactical officers charged with taking on gangs, the newspaper found.</p> <p>Dean Angelo Sr, president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, told the Tribune: \u201cWhen you look at the map, 80% of narcotics arrests, gun arrests and gang arrests happen in these poor areas.

To be a Pakistan fan is, as so often, to be experiencing two extremes at once \u2013 top of the world in Tests, languishing at ninth in the 50-over game. And to be a neutral is to be hoping for a Pakistan win today, so the series doesn\u2019t become a procession. </p> <p>The central figure in the drama looks like being a man whose entrance has been delayed: Yasir Shah, Pakistan\u2019s big-grinning, leg-spinning record-breaker. In the Test series he was a superstar in London, a spear-carrier everywhere else. So there was a certain logic to his being left out at the Ageas Bowl and held back for Lord\u2019s, where he took ten wickets in the first Test, most of them with straight balls (four bowled, four LBW).

  "<p>When history repeats itself, it can accentuate the sense of frustration. As far as the officials are concerned, it demonstrates an inability to learn their lessons. For the second consecutive week, Stoke City were deemed guilty of failing to heed the new directives about grappling in the box. For a second successive Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/27/football-clockwatch-leicester-v-swansea-watford-v-arsenal-and-more-live\" title=\"\">they conceded a spot kick</a> that helped condemn them to defeat.</p> <p>Here, Leighton Baines\u2019s penalty went in via a combination of the goalkeeper Shay Given and the post. Last week, Ryan Shawcross was penalised for grabbing Manchester City\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. When the referee, Michael Oliver, ruled Phil Bardsley shoved Ashley Williams, Stoke\u2019s handiwork meant they slumped to the foot of the embryonic table.</p> <p>They are winless and, in their eyes, luckless. \u201cIt has happened to me in the past with previous teams. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/20/premier-league-threatens-red-cards-crackdown-indiscipline\" title=\"\">Whenever there is a purge</a>, teams like ourselves seem to get the thin end of the wedge,\u201d lamented their manager, Mark Hughes, betraying the hints of a persecution complex.</p> <p>\u201cWe are being punished. Ashley Williams has gone down, whether he clipped his own heels or he has stepped across Phil Bardsley but there was no pushing and no pulling. Phil is very disappointed. It wasn\u2019t instigated by him. I thought it was very harsh.\u201d</p> <p>The sympathetic Everton manager concurred. \u201cI can understand why Mark Hughes is angry,\u201d said Ronald Koeman after recording his first home league win. Both managers highlighted an incident earlier in the day at White Hart Lane, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/27/tottenham-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">when Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Jan Vertonghen was only warned for tugging Liverpool\u2019s Jo\u00ebl Matip</a>. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t given, maybe because it was two high-profile teams on the television and maybe they don\u2019t get those penalties given against them,\u201d Hughes lamented. A calmer Koeman stated: \u201cThat is not&#xa0;consistent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/27/tottenham-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">Tottenham 1-1 Liverpool: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stoke were left contemplating requesting another meeting with the referees\u2019 general manager, Mike Riley, or switching from man-marking, a staple of Hughes\u2019s management, to zonal marking, or merely hoping referees will be less officious. \u201cHopefully it will settle down and everyone will revert to a bit of sanity,\u201d Hughes said.</p> <p>Yet he weakened his case to be seen as the voice of reason by claiming little separated the teams. \u201cYou look at the productivity with 18 shots and nine on target,\u201d Koeman countered. \u201cThey had not one shot on target.\u201d</p> <p>That overlooked the moment, seven minutes after Baines\u2019s penalty, when he volleyed the ball off his line after Marko Arnautovic\u2019s effort was deflected on to the bar by Maarten Stekelenburg but it was a sign the Austrian posed the sole threat. Stoke seemed intent on a damage-limitation exercise. Hughes demoted Bojan Krkic to the bench in favour of a more physical attack. Its most conspicuous member was Peter Crouch, selected after an EFL Cup hat-trick at Stevenage but on a 15-month wait for a top-flight strike. Crouch has long demonstrated his agility in penalty boxes. Even at 35, he did so again to execute a spectacular clearance, hooking away Williams\u2019s header and denying the \u00a312m arrival a goal to mark his first league start.</p> <p>It was sandwiched by two other goal\u2011saving interventions, each from Ryan Shawcross to thwart Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian delayed too long before shooting in the first half; in the second, he slipped the ball past the otherwise excellent Given before Shawcross\u2019s rescue act. \u201cOffensively we can do better,\u201d Koeman said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/watford-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez turn on style against Watford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Shawcross\u2019s twin exercises in defiance indicated his powers of recovery, they also felt timely as Sam Allardyce watched on while he finalises his first England squad. Yet the Stoke captain\u2019s struggle to contain Lukaku underlined the concern that a defender whose sole taste of international football was notable for Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring four times can be found wanting against top-class strikers.</p> <p>Hughes feels that the centre\u2011back\u2019s reputation precedes him in other respects. Media coverage of grappling, he argued, is invariably illustrated by images of Shawcross. \u201cHe is not the only one but whenever it gets mentioned there is a picture of Ryan Shawcross,\u201d he argued.</p> <p>Koeman had a more appealing view as he contemplated a league table that shows Everton third. \u201cMaybe it is good to take a picture of that,\u201d he said with a smile. Progress is being reflected in results. Stekelenburg, one of his signings, is performing so well that he sees little need to borrow Joe Hart. \u201cHe is not a third or second[-choice] goalkeeper.\u201d He was defiant, too, in insisting that James McCarthy, who was omitted as Everton wait to discover if he needs groin surgery, is going nowhere. He said: \u201cPlayers like McCarthy need to stay and we like to keep everybody.\u201d</p>",

With Craig Cathcart injured and Miguel Britos given leave to attend the birth of his child, there were league debuts for Youn\u00e8s Kaboul and Christian Kabasele, who played either side of the mountainous Austrian Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl. \u201cToday, at the last minute, we lost two starters,\u201d said Walter Mazzarri. \u201cIn a squad that is being built and is growing game by game it is difficult to cope, and there were some mistakes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/chelsea-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea have menacing look as Victor Moses completes defeat of Burnley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arsenal swiftly worked out a way through the restructured backline, with the first hint of the trouble ahead coming in the sixth minute when S\u00e1nchez\u2019s chipped pass found \u00d6zil bursting into the area but offside. Two minutes later the pair repeated the trick in reverse, \u00d6zil this time lofting the ball into the box, but before the Chilean could bring it under control he was caught by Nordin Amrabat\u2019s elbow. Kevin Friend took so long to give the penalty Watford had assumed there would not be one, and on the touchline Mazzarri burst into furious gesticulations when the referee finally pointed to the spot. The Italian refused to directly address the award after the game but spoke about \u201ctwo episodes that nobody in the stadium really understood\u201d, presumably also referring to the bewildering decision to penalise Amrabat for taking the ball past Laurent Koscielny on the right wing in the 37th minute.</p> <p>Undeterred, Santi Cazorla stroked his penalty down the middle to kickstart a difficult first half for the home side. However it took another 25 minutes before \u00d6zil and S\u00e1nchez combined again with any real menace, as a smart one-two on the edge of the penalty area led to a low shot from S\u00e1nchez that was saved by Heurelho Gomes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/27/football-clockwatch-leicester-v-swansea-watford-v-arsenal-and-more-live\">Football clockwatch: Leicester 2-1 Swansea, Watford 1-3 Arsenal and more \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the intervening period Watford had occasionally threatened, with Amrabat particularly industrious on the right. It was from one of his crosses that Watford came closest to an equaliser though it was Koscielny who nearly scored it, his miscued clearance forcing Petr Cech into a smart save.</p> <p>Having fought their way to an approximation of parity on the run of play, the last five minutes of the first half turned out to be very long ones for Watford. First they were sliced open by an excellent, swift counterattack which ended with S\u00e1nchez mis-hitting Theo Walcott\u2019s fine cross goalwards, the ball bouncing just over the line before it was cleared. Then in the final moments of stoppage time S\u00e1nchez was given a preposterous amount of time and space on the left wing, and he was the only player on the pitch to spot \u00d6zil\u2019s late sprint into the penalty area. His centre was precise, and appropriately despatched.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1882f234bdddad3ccbdeac2ae977c296c7ff2ebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1882f234bdddad3ccbdeac2ae977c296c7ff2ebe/220_148_2583_1550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s mishit effort squeezes over the line to give Arsenal a two-goal cushion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s mishit effort squeezes over the line to give Arsenal a two-goal cushion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mazzarri brought on Roberto Pereyra, the recent arrival from Juventus, at half-time \u2013 he said he did this \u201cto try to surprise Arsenal\u201d though having him spend half-time warming up on the pitch rather gave the game away \u2013 while Daryl Janmaat and the deposed record signing Isaac Success also made their debuts from the bench. Their arrivals, and a switch to a back four, galvanised the side and they scored when Janmaat\u2019s cross was half-cleared to \u00c9tienne Capoue, whose blocked shot fell to Pereyra, who took a touch and found the corner from eight yards.</p> <p>Thereafter Odion Ighalo twice came close to bringing if not panic then at least a flicker of concern to Wenger\u2019s face, but with a lead to protect the Gunners were increasingly content to contain and occasionally break. Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain both sent attempted chips over the bar; for Arsenal, everything is looking up.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Andrea \u2018Andy\u2019 Lankford</strong></h2> <p>Andrea \u201cAndy\u201d Lankford often came close to death during her twelve years as a ranger for the National Park Service. But there was nothing quite as horrific as the time she ended up with parts of a human brain in her hand.</p> <p>Lankford, now 52 years old and retired from the park service, was in the Grand Canyon in the 1990s, responding to the calls of a woman who was \u201cvery precariously clinging for her life at the edge of the canyon\u201d. The young woman, who worked nearby, had been walking along a rock wall and slipped, launching a tense rescue mission and \u201creal-life cliffhanger\u201d, the former ranger recalled.</p> <p>Other rangers arrived before Lankford and risked their lives to save the woman \u2013 but they were too late. She wanted to make sure the staff who had the traumatizing experience of watching the woman fall did not have the grim task of recovering the body. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my career, it would get rather dark.

I would deal with tragic, violent things,\u201d she recalled.</p> <p>With gloves on, she helped put the woman into a body bag \u2013 and ended up carrying parts of her brain that had splattered during the fall. It was difficult, but she had learned to remain calm in crisis. \u201cWe were very gentle and professional.\u201d</p> <p>Being a park ranger wasn\u2019t always so harrowing. Lankford first fell in love with the job when she began rescuing baby sea turtles at Cape Hatteras in North Carolina from hazardous ATVs or hungry seagulls.</p> <p>Lankford also thrived on the adrenaline-inducing adventures the wilderness \u2013 and its human visitors \u2013 thrust upon her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"663174db3a812642d483436893f2c3494a042760\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/663174db3a812642d483436893f2c3494a042760/0_245_4019_2412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Lankford and coworker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Lankford, right, with a colleague in front of a rockslide in Yosemite Valley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Andrea Lankford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Zion national park in Utah, she had to confront a group of white supremacists who claimed they were going to take over the park, warning that they would shoot any law enforcement who tried to stop them.</p> <p>\u201cSkinheads waiting for war at Zion,\u201d blared one newspaper headline that Lankford keeps on file.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/25/national-parks-centennial-stories-photos-experiences\">'We need to preserve this beauty': your memories of US national parks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ranger wasn\u2019t scared.

One time, she had to rescue a cub without upsetting the nearby mother. A crowd of onlookers watched as Lankford tried to remove the cub from a dumpster, and the tourists ignored Lankford\u2019s repeated demands that they step back.</p> <p>During one failed attempt, the mama bear charged in her direction, prompting Lankford to deploy her pepper spray. Lankford did not, however, hit the intended target. The coughing visitors learned their lesson.</p> <p>By the end of her career, however, it was some of her male colleagues who caused her the most grief \u2013 forcing her to confront sexism, discrimination and harassment, she said.</p> <p>Whether supervisors were telling her jobs were too dangerous for women or colleagues were making sexual remarks, Lankford refused to be intimidated.</p> <p>\u201cI fought fire with fire. When one of the guys made a joke about showing me his penis, I said, \u2018Well, wait, let me get a microscope,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was so part of the culture. You knew if you complained you were going to be retaliated against.\u201d</p> <p>Lankford learned how to demonstrate she was more than capable of handling the duties that were once exclusively the domain of men \u2013 whether life-threatening rescues or arresting criminals.</p> <p>\u201cI survived \u2013 and I did a good job.\u201d </p> <h2>Mary Hinson </h2> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting rescued by a chick?\u201d</p> <p>Those were the first words park ranger Mary Hinson heard when, after waiting patiently for years, she was finally given the opportunity to do a rescue mission at El Capitan at Yosemite. </p> <p>A favorite destination for experienced rock climbers, El Cap rises more than 3,000ft above the floor of Yosemite Valley and regularly requires rangers to save visitors in near-death predicaments. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt like I was born to do this, and it\u2019s my chance, and I\u2019m going to prove myself.</p> <footer> <cite>Mary Hinson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hinson, now 51 years old and a police chief in Nevada, was an experienced rock climber and trained emergency medical technician when she was hired in 1993. But despite her qualifications, supervisors initially didn\u2019t give her a chance to do a high-stakes rescue mission. It took time for any new ranger to break into the rescue teams, but as a woman, Hinson felt particular pressure to prove herself. It was especially frustrating given her skill set. </p> <p>\u201cThere would be all these big technical rescues going on ... and I would get a great assignment to do administrative duties and clean up.\u201d</p> <p>During one particularly bad winter storm, however, two rescue teams had struggled to reach the stranded climbers, and Hinson was called in. </p> <p>\u201cIt was pretty dicey conditions,\u201d recalled Hinson, who put on a bright yellow suit and helmet headed out with as much confidence as she could muster. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03c1a97e7364a6b8e7764aa0a17aef13ead2cf88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03c1a97e7364a6b8e7764aa0a17aef13ead2cf88/0_17_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Hinson and her colleagues.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Hinson and her colleagues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Mary Hinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI felt like I was born to do this, and it\u2019s my chance, and I\u2019m going to prove myself.\u201d </p> <p>She was the first to reach the climbers, who had lost their sleeping bags and were screaming for help as it snowed and rained on them.

About four, including the one on Margate high street, are still empty seven years on.</p> <p>Soult points out things are likely to be more difficult for BHS, partly because of the large size of its branches but also as a result of a tougher business climate in which retailers are closing stores as shoppers switch to buying online.

Many retailers used that to plug the gaps in their portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>Will Thomas of retail property consultancy KLM believes 15% to 20% \u2013 or about 33 BHS stores \u2013 are likely to be very difficult to shift. \u201cIt is quite an obsolete portfolio. BHS hasn\u2019t really kept up with the fashions and retail pitches have moved away from its stores. In many locations, it is really the last store in town and not attractive to many,\u201d he says.</p> <p>More than a decade of underinvestment means that many branches will require major refurbishment, including the removal of asbestos, which could cost up to \u00a3500,000 per store.</p> <p>With little demand for the average 45,000sq ft stores BHS occupied, many branches are likely to be divided up in the same way that former C&amp;A outlets were split to house shops including Zara, Primark and New Look.</p> <p>Extensive upper floors, once used for stock rooms, staff canteens and managers\u2019 offices, are likely to be even trickier to deal with. Most retailers are now more efficient and don\u2019t need such large backroom areas, so upper floors may have to be redeveloped as gyms, homes or separate office space.</p> <p>That\u2019s not so attractive for local authorities, which receive much lower business rates from such uses, according to Thomas.

  "<p>If you\u2019ve ever visited an iconic national park like Yellowstone, Yosemite or Glacier, your first glimpses of arresting, postcard-perfect vistas were probably framed by a car window. That\u2019s how I first glimpsed Yosemite\u2019s Half Dome. After driving through the tunnels on Big Oak Flat Road, the road curved and the valley came into view. Angels sang. I was so overwhelmed by that monolith\u2019s grandeur and beauty that I had to pull over onto the shoulder and have a good cry.</p> <p>Years later, I stuffed my backpack with supplies and headed out my front door, Yosemite bound once again. I walked 10 minutes to the nearest San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (<a href=\"https://www.bart.gov/\">Bart</a>) station, which I rode east, to the Richmond station, and transferred to Amtrak. I used the train\u2019s free Wi-Fi to get some work done during the scenic two-hour and 40-minute ride to Merced, California, where I waited a half hour for a Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (Yarts) bus up to Yosemite, another two-hour trip.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/24/10-least-visited-us-national-parks\">10 of the least-visited US national parks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In total, my fares were double what I\u2019d have paid in gas, but bus riders are exempt from the park\u2019s entrance fee ($20 then, $30 now). The trip took more than an hour longer than driving would have, though slogging through Bay Area traffic could have evened that scale. One less car in the crowded, summer-packed Yosemite Valley that day made an imperceptible difference to the park\u2019s clogged roads and parking lots. But once I was inside the park, the free park shuttles and my own two feet took me everywhere I wanted to go. I experienced zero road rage and could have wept over Half Dome to my heart\u2019s content without worrying about swerving off the road.</p> <p>One hundred years ago, former US president Woodrow Wilson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/national-parks-at-100\">signed the legislation that created the National Park Service</a> (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">NPS</a>) to manage 35 parks and monuments. Since then, the number of national parks has swelled along with crowds. Back in 1916, a few hundred thousand people would visit those parks each year. But by the late 1990s, visitation to the hundreds of landmarks within the park system rose to around 280 million, and by last year it reached 307 million. The popularity of the country\u2019s national parks has risen along with the number of highways and privately-owned vehicles.</p> <p>Between the 1965 and 1985, visitation to the NPS grew 122%, and the crown jewels of our collectively-owned landscape started to suffer from congestion, which degraded air quality \u2013 not to mention the quality of the experience. </p> <p>Some parks, including Denali National Park in Alaska and Zion National Park in Utah, started to restrict vehicular access, requiring visitors to take shuttles through the park, due to safety issues or congestion problems, or to reduce impacts to wildlife. But many parks responded to increased traffic by building bigger parking lots. That has a smaller price tag, at least in the short term, than creating systems for alternative transportation, which national parks have struggled to pay for.</p> <p>The benefits of limiting cars to minimize environmental impact aren\u2019t straightforward, however, says Francesco Orsi, an assistant professor of geography at Kansas State University and the editor of<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=fQwtCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=nps+transportation+planning+guidebook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mDvRHHKqy4&amp;sig=KEQXdvn9zvP9nSOkYg_d5814oQo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAjIqbxcbOAhUIw2MKHUrcDYIQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=nps%20transpor\"> Sustainable Transportation in Natural and Protected Areas</a>. Cars may be a big source of air pollution and carbon emissions, but they also limit the number of people wearing out trails and trampling through areas with sensitive habitats.</p> <p>\u201cIn Rocky Mountain National Park, they introduced buses and realized they were bringing in more people,\u201d Orsi says. \u201cWith buses, there was more capacity and (that creates) more demand on the trail system. So they had to find a balance between buses and cars.\u201d</p> <p>During the next 100 years, Orsi says the biggest impact our cars will make to national parks won\u2019t come from the tailpipes. \u201cIn the future [thanks to electrification], cars won\u2019t emit carbon. The big issue is that cars occupy space.\u201d That means building parking lots on land that would otherwise remain wild and leave behind visual scars. Orsi has seen this in his native Italy. \u201cIn the Dolomites, when you climb a mountain, you look down and see an ocean of cars.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, the Federal Transit Administration launched Transit in Parks, a granting program that directed $80m to transit programs for the NPS. This seeded some promising projects, but funding was axed in the 2012 federal transportation bill. This, and its own addled budget, led the NPS to rely more on state and municipal authorities, as well as private businesses, to develop and support public transit projects.</p> <p>The NPS has had mixed success trying to ease congestion while still making public lands accessible. Here, we profile three of the service\u2019s most promising programs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06db2cdc09525d0fa3a0a4288f83b3e929ee3edf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06db2cdc09525d0fa3a0a4288f83b3e929ee3edf/0_120_3342_2006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Yosemite National Park YARTS bus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Yosemite National Park YARTS bus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Robinson/Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Golden State success story</h2> <p>Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (<a href=\"http://yarts.com/\">Yarts</a>) is a government agency funded mostly by the counties it serves and by Yosemite National Park \u2013 in fact, the park provides around 36% of Yarts\u2019 operating budget. Yarts, which passed its one-millionth rider mark in 2014, also has contracts with Amtrak and Greyhound, which many riders use to connect to the buses. Revenue from fares accounts for 18% of its budget. (A round trip between Merced and Yosemite is $25.)</p> <p>Businesses in the gateway communities near Yosemite also benefit from Yarts, says its manager Dick Whittington. \u201cWe have an excellent relationship with hotels. And the RV parks on Highway 120 are big Yarts promoters, because guests come in, hook up their RVs [to water, power and sewer lines] and then don\u2019t want to unhook them to drive up to Yosemite, so they take the bus. We also have folks who come on Amtrak, ride the bus to their hotel and then into the park the next day.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Yarts launched a new summer route to Fresno, California\u2019s fifth largest city. With its international airport, the Fresno link opens up a direct transit route for visitors flying into the state. Even though it was a new service, Yarts picked up almost 700 people at the Fresno airport last summer.</p> <h2>Lessons from Yellowstone</h2> <p>Driving and traffic congestion weren\u2019t always part of the national park experience, says Jan Brown, the former executive director of the Yellowstone Business Partnership (YBP), a now dissolved nonprofit that worked to introduce the principles of sustainable business practices to the communities around Yellowstone National Park.</p> <p>When Yellowstone was founded in 1872, public transit \u2013 provided by a horseman and a coach \u2013 was the only way to see that park. Later, guests arrived via rail. But once cars took over the roads, they came to define access to public lands.</p> <p>In 2011, the YBP, along with seven different public transportation providers in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, launched a co-operative, dubbed Linx, to provide bus services into the park from surrounding communities. The project, launched with a $500,000 federal grant, envisioned shuttles every 20 minutes linking regional airports in Idaho Falls, Salt Lake, Bozeman and Billings to Yellowstone.</p> <p>\u201cThe Transit in Parks programs were controlled by the park service and needed their approval, but our idea was to not start a new public transit system \u2013 that was very important,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was support [transportation] businesses all around the park.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/aug/24/yellowstone-tourism-animals-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vxdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2658301\"            data-video-name=\"Animal jams and selfies: Yellowstone deals with record number of tourists \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b205bbe4b0178756b5cf86\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/15/160810Yellowstonev2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/15/160810Yellowstonev2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/15/160810Yellowstonev2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/aug/24/yellowstone-tourism-animals-video\">Animal jams and selfies: Yellowstone deals with record number of tourists</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Linx provided rides from mid-June through September for three years. Single day tickets were $20, or $80 for a five-day pass. In 2012, Linx ran a pilot program, sponsored by New Belgium Brewing, in which bike racks were mounted on select buses. Many Linx users used the service as a shuttle, allowing them to undertake a long day hike or multi-day backpack trip and then return via bus.</p> <p>Steeped in debt and unable to find financial support, Linx, as well as the YBP, went under in 2014.</p> <p>Brown believes Linx may have been ahead of its time. She says mobile phone apps, which back in 2011 were more expensive and difficult to deploy, would have made scheduling and advertising the service far simpler. In the end, most Linx riders were park employees, not the tourists that the providers were targeting.</p> <p>\u201cWe had urged Yellowstone National Park to support our mobility plan,\u201d says Arthur Kull, who was president of Linx. \u201c[But former] Yellowstone Superintendent Dan Wenk refused to allocate any funds to our project.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2c2bfa91343f9ce6d6666abeb7b627f32ed7d20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2c2bfa91343f9ce6d6666abeb7b627f32ed7d20/0_0_1600_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Acadia National Park\u2019s Island Explorer bus service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Acadia National Park\u2019s Island Explorer bus service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregg TeHennepe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Maine\u2019s gold standard</h2> <p>For nearly two decades, the<a href=\"http://www.exploreacadia.com/\"> Island Explorer bus service </a>in Maine\u2019s Acadia National Park has provided some relief to the park\u2019s congestion problems while also linking tourists to hotels, restaurants and other businesses outside the park.</p> <p>Downeast Transportation, a private nonprofit, operates the Island Explorer. During its 1998 pilot year, the Island Explorer served park campgrounds and charged $2 fares. The next year, says general manager Paul Murphy, \u201cWe asked the Friends of Acadia [a park advocacy group] to do an experiment. We asked: what would happen if we removed fare?\u201d Padded with a $3,500 grant from the group, the bus trips became free and ridership grew by 600%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/22/climate-change-national-parks-threat\">Climate change will mean the end of national parks as we know them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the onset, the service aimed to transport 1,000 passengers per day. Now, with a far wider route map and more busses, the Island Explorer regularly moves 5,000-6,000 people each day during the park\u2019s peak season. That number has reached 8,000 on busy days. By providing an alternative to driving, Downeast Transportation estimates that the service has replaced 2.3m vehicle trips and reduced 21,504 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Acadia uses half of each park visitor\u2019s entry free to help the Island Explorer \u2013 the park provides more than 40% of the bus system\u2019s funding. The Federal Transit Authority\u2019s rural transit funds and the Maine Department of Transportation cover the second largest portion, followed by Maine-based outdoor gear seller LL Bean, which has sponsored the bus system with $4m over the years. Businesses outside the park that host bus stops also contribute. Plus, donation boxes inside the buses generate $50,000 each year.</p> <p>Tourists arriving via the airport at Bar Harbor, a quaint town just outside of Acadia, can jump on the Island Explorer right from the terminal, though the vast majority of out-of-towners drive to Acadia and then switch to the bus service, Murphy says.</p> <p>Tom Crikelair, a transportation planning consultant who helped develop the Island Explorer program, says there is no silver bullet to developing a sustainable transportation system.</p> <p>\u201cJust because it works here, you can\u2019t necessarily do the same thing elsewhere. It all depends on convenience: if you want someone to get out of their car, you\u2019ve got to give them something better than their car,\u201d Crikelair says.</p>",

Anyone here remember Tottenham Hotspur? Decent side, almost won the league last season, played the best football by a Spurs team since the 1980s. They were a breath of the fresh stuff. Yet nobody is talking about them this season, such is the slightly childish focus on all things new in the Premier League. </p> <p>That\u2019s probably a good thing for Spurs, who can go about their business quietly for the time being. Although the bar has been raised this season, there is every chance their superb young side - with a few carefully chosen additions like Victor Wanyama and Vincent Janssen - will challenge for the league again.</p> <p>This afternoon they meet Liverpool, who continue their August road trip: they will not play at Anfield until mid-September due of the expansion of the main stand. After high-scoring wins at Arsenal and Burton, and a high-possession defeat at Burnley, we don\u2019t really know what to expect from Liverpool. At their best they are perhaps the most scintillating team in the country; at their worst they are a gift to lovers of schadenfreude.</p> <p>They are nonetheless one of six potential title winners, seven if you count the actual champions, Leicester, which not many people have done. The upshot of that is there will be lots of Big Games (don\u2019t you dare call them six-pointers, don\u2019t you dare get me started on that) early in the season. This certainly falls into that category.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 12.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-27T11:54:30.343Z\">at 12.54pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

There\u2019s a process and that process is followed and whoever was running it has obviously seen all the angles and believes there\u2019s nothing to answer for.\u201d</p> <p>The incident was one of numerous occasions when both teams pushed the boundaries of the law, with the referee, Romain Poite, struggling at times to control tempers from boiling over.</p> <p>Cheika vented his anger in Poite\u2019s direction after the match which, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, was down to a meeting that took place between his counterpart, Steve Hansen, and the French referee in the build-up to the match.</p> <p>\u201cI was bitterly disappointed to be honest,\u201d said Cheika when asked about the refereeing. \u201cI\u2019m on record with the referees boss Alain Rolland about the treatment to our captain and our players by Romain Poite. There was a time there in the game where in a break in play, when the national captain of Australia was asking the referee when might be an opportunity for me to talk to you and he absolutely ignored him.</p> <p>\u201cThe attitude showed right through when David Pocock was being called off by the other referee for a HIA test, the ref wouldn\u2019t stop the game,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cThe players almost went straight through the doctor. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s subconscious or not but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s got to be dealt with because that can\u2019t be going on. No one is saying anything bad to him. If they\u2019ve got pre-determined position on our players \u2026 it\u2019s pretty blatant to anyone listening to the ref\u2019s ears I would say.\u201d</p> <p>The Wallabies had been hammered 42-8 last week in Sydney as the All Blacks moved the ball at high pace with near flawless execution and the Australian side had been pilloried by their media and fans.</p> <p>On Saturday, Cheika\u2019s side were more confrontational and got into the All Blacks\u2019 collective faces to ensure they did not suffer humiliation for a second successive week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cmail_sport/status/769475222139383808\">an approach mirrored in the Australian press</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cmail_sport/status/769475222139383808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sunday Mail Sport cover via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/couriermail\">@couriermail</a> : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllBlacks\">@AllBlacks</a> hand final <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BledisloeCup?src=hash\">#BledisloeCup</a> insult to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/qantaswallabies\">@qantaswallabies</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NZLvAUS?src=hash\">#NZLvAUS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7yPs3LnmF5\">pic.twitter.com/7yPs3LnmF5</a></p>&mdash; Courier Mail Sport (@cmail_sport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cmail_sport/status/769475222139383808\">August 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The visitors were physical, with the lock Adam Coleman at the centre of many of the scuffles, including several confrontations with Brodie Retallick and the hooker, Dane Coles.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps we let it get to us a little bit in the first half. There was quite a bit of niggle out there,\u201d the All Blacks captain, Kieran Read, said. \u201cI suppose you expect that in a high pressure game.\u201d</p> <p>While the scoreline was not as emphatic as last week, it was more than enough to send the Wallabies to a sixth successive loss. The All Blacks have held the Bledisloe Cup, the symbol of trans-Tasman supremacy, since 2003.</p> <p>The Wallabies, however, managed to slow the pace of the All Blacks\u2019 game with negative tactics. The ploy worked to an extent, the All Blacks leading only 15-9 at half-time courtesy of two tries by Israel Dagg and a conversion and penalty from Beauden Barrett. Bernard Foley (two) and Reece Hodge kicked penalties for the visitors.</p> <p>Coleman did earn the ire of Poite when he received a yellow card for a late charge, though the All Blacks did not take advantage of the extra man. Julian Savea gave the hosts breathing space just after Coleman returned early in the second half when Barrett\u2019s blistering pace exploited space in the Wallabies defence before Sam Cane grabbed New Zealand\u2019s fourth try.</p> <p>\u201cThey have copped a fair bit of criticism back home,\u201d Hansen said of Australia. \u201cSo they were going to come and bring whatever they had to bring and they did that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As Darren Clarke uses this weekend to ponder his wildcard picks for the European team, with the announcement to be made at Wentworth on Tuesday, the nuances of Ryder Cup captaincy will play a part in his thinking.</p> <p>Clarke has one opportunity to enhance his status by presiding over a successful European tilt. For all the Northern Irishman and others in his position, past or future, can speak of legacy, how they are portrayed \u2013 be it lauded or dismissed as outright disaster \u2013 revolves around three intense days.</p> <p>This is especially pertinent in Clarke\u2019s circumstances. Were he a long-term captain, or a manager in other sports, he would have scope to plan meaningfully. Instead the former Open champion has been dealt a batch of nine automatic qualifiers who include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/ryder-cup-european-team-five-rookies\" title=\"\">five who will be making their Ryder Cup debuts at Hazeltine</a>. Many have already looked on with a passing nod of \u201cgood luck\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps experience is overstated. In 2004, a Europe team including five rookies thumped the United States 18\u00bd to 9\u00bd at Oakland Hills. From that group, Ian Poulter was to emerge as a Ryder Cup talisman over a decade. \u201cRookies aren\u2019t what they used to be,\u201d Paul Casey, a Ryder Cup refusnik but educated onlooker, said this week. \u201cRookies aren\u2019t scared any more.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the received wisdom is Clarke is in tricky territory by taking so many players untested in this environment to an away match. There have inevitably been changes in European teams but a serious move away from the core who have delivered an outstanding recent run has glaring risk.</p> <p>With that in mind, Martin Kaymer and Lee Westwood are expected to receive the nod from Clarke. Westwood has impressively hauled himself into contention since the spring, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/lee-westwood-doubted-game-second-masters\" title=\"\">his tie for second at the Masters </a>sufficient to demonstrate he can still mix it with the best. Westwood\u2019s outstanding Ryder Cup record, added to popularity and compatibility with other players, means he should always have been worthy of selection if showing a modicum of form.</p> <p>Kaymer\u2019s run has been more of a slow burner. With the German playing so much in Europe this year there have been five top-10 finishes since mid-April but no scent of victory. Kaymer\u2019s intense focus on the Olympic Games probably was not appropriately rewarded by a share of 15th but the two-times major champion at least closed with a 66, continuing his fine form from the US PGA Championship. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/30/ryder-cup-2012-europe-comeback\" title=\"\">holing of that crucial, clinching putt at Medinah in 2012 </a>would never have been enough to secure Kaymer a 2016 place but that positive strand of history can only help.</p> <p>Beyond this, the fun starts. In a fair world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/russell-knox-ryder-cup-hazeltine-pga-tour-travelers\" title=\"\">Russell Knox\u2019s victory at the Travelers Championship</a> this month would equal a pick. Knox won a WGC event before he was eligible for European qualification \u2013 and, to be fair, before he thought it attainable \u2013 but pressed home his candidature with a wonderful winning putt in Connecticut. Knox is ranked world No20, above Rafa Cabrero-Bello, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Andy Sullivan and Chris Wood, who have qualified for Hazeltine, plus Westwood and Kaymer.</p> <p>Knox\u2019s character means he is unlikely to express any annoyance but were any other debutant named he would have legitimate cause to do so. Clarke\u2019s opening rounds pairing with the in-form Thomas Pieters at the Made in Denmark event means the captain has a Belgian in his thoughts, which applies, likewise to Paul Lawrie, one of the vice-captains, having Soren Kjeldsen and Shane Lowry for company.</p> <p>Knox stands apart as a regular PGA Tour player, surely beneficial for an away Ryder Cup, and while Lowry is arguably the most gifted player of that group, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/09/shane-lowry-wins-bridestone-invitational-akron-bubba-watson-justin-rose\" title=\"\">his WGC success at Akron is now more than a year old</a>.</p> <p>The danger to Knox lies in that supposedly crucial commodity of background. Luke Donald and Graeme McDowell, apparently from nowhere, have come into Clarke\u2019s view. Whatever else can be said of that duo\u2019s recent struggles, Clarke will know he can trust them in a Ryder Cup environment. Donald would have a particular point to prove after missing out two years ago.</p> <p>The under-appreciated name in this mix has been Francesco Molinari. The Italian, like Knox, has focused on the PGA Tour, and played for Europe in 2010 and 2012, although his own figures are hardly startling. For Molinari to feature, he surely had to fare better than a missed cut on Friday at the Barclays Championship in New York.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s mind is not yet set. When it is, the importance of 2016 over anything else is understandable. The captain\u2019s reputation is at stake.</p>",
  "<p>It happens just about weekly, said Dr G Sealy Massingill. A woman comes to the Fort Worth hospital where he works as an OB-GYN. She is pregnant, she has diabetes. He treats her for both. She delivers a healthy baby. </p> <p>And then, nothing. Perhaps the problem is the end of her pregnancy spells the end of her insurance coverage. Perhaps she has no means of childcare to slip away for an appointment. Whatever the reason, the outcome is too often the same, said Massingill. \u201cThey just vanish.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/texas-maternal-death-rate-mothers-reproductive-healthcare\">Politics is killing mothers in Texas | Jessica Valenti</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the past week, back-to-back reports have sounded piercing alarms about a crisis of maternal mortality in Texas. The first report, which appears in next month\u2019s issue of the academic journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, found that the rate of maternal mortality had crept up across the United States but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-maternal-mortality-rate-health-clinics-funding\">doubled in Texas</a> in a matter of just two years. The leap in death rates for new and expectant mothers, said the report\u2019s authors, was hard to explain \u201cin the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval\u201d.<br></p> <p>As Texas reeled from that report, the state\u2019s maternal mortality prevention task force released another confirming that the rate of maternal deaths was rising and a single group was suffering with wild disproportionality: black women, who accounted for 11.4% of births in Texas in 2011 and 2012, but 28.8% of deaths linked to pregnancy. The task force also found a worrisome rate of maternal morbidity, in which a woman nearly died from pregnancy-related causes and may be left with a major impairment.</p> <p>Now, public health advocates are straining for possible explanations. Massingill points to these women who fall through the cracks at an alarming rate due to lack of health care coverage or the basic struggles of poverty. </p> <p>\u201cWe see these patients\u201d \u2013 and then, suddenly, stop seeing these patients \u2013 \u201cevery day,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day.\u201d</p> <p>And there are other hypotheses. Was it dramatic cuts to the state\u2019s system of family planning clinic? The state\u2019s large population of undocumented women, who struggle to obtain health insurance? Or its state-of-the-art hospitals, which accept complicated maternal cases from all over the American southwest and South and Central America?<br></p> <p>Several have hypothesized that the surge in deaths is not a surge at all, but the true rate of maternal mortality in Texas, only now being exposed because the state has expanded the way it captures mortality data. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/anti-abortion-laws-legislation-clinics-dangerous-methods\">After wave of anti-abortion laws, US sees signs of women taking drastic measures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other experts are puzzled by the changing composition of factors that cause maternal deaths. Cardiac events and drug overdoses make up the biggest causes of deaths that can be linked to pregnancy in Texas, eclipsing more familiar causes such as eclampsia and hemorrhage. Women in the United States have grown far more likely to deliver by caesarian section compared to previous decades, and each successive C-section entails a greater risk of complication.</p> <p>But for the time being, most admit that no one knows what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>\u201cWe rarely actually see a patient die from maternal death in our practice,\u201d said Dr John Jennings, an OB-GYN in the Houston area. If one of his patients were to die from maternal causes, he continued, it might happen from a major cardiac event that takes place months after he has stopped treating her.</p> <p>One problem may be that in Texas, many poor women are only eligible for Medicaid coverage during their pregnancy and for a prescribed period of time after they give birth.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the baby is born, there\u2019s not a big commitment in our state to protecting the mother,\u201d Massingill said. Programs for new mothers lack enough providers because of poor reimbursement rates, and the biggest impact falls on poor women who are uninsured. \u201cThey have very excellent care during their pregnancy, but when they stop being pregnant, they lose that coverage.\u201d</p> <p>Doctors across the state say they care for these at-risk patients as best they can while they\u2019re still covered. </p> <p>Dr Raymond Moss Hampton, an OB-GYN at the<em> </em>Texas Tech University health sciences center and the Lubbock General Hospital, said doctors in his departments have begun to shift their protocols, screening more aggressively for high blood pressure and more tightly regimenting their care of women with heart disease. Still, many deteriorate after giving birth.</p> <p>\u201cWe recently had one lady who had pulmonary hypertension die about six months after delivery in our emergency room,\u201d said Hampton. \u201cIt\u2019s very traumatic for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time maternal mortality appears to be rising, the state\u2019s network of clinics that screen women for reproductive health problems and provide low-cost contraception is contracting. It is a crisis, said Jennings, of the state\u2019s own making. In 2011, the Texas legislature cut about two-thirds from the state\u2019s family planning budget of $111.5m, causing some 80 family planning clinics to shut down. The Republican-controlled statehouse also maneuvered to exclude Planned Parenthood, a major provider of STI and cancer screenings, well-woman exams, and contraception, from using state and federal funds to subsidize these services for poor women.</p> <p>Doctors and the two reports differ on whether the jump in maternal deaths can be directly linked to these cuts. But what is clear is that the state has yet to recover the capacity to provide reproductive health care with new programs.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had a destruction, in part, of our ability to take care of contraceptive issues,\u201d said Jennings. \u201cThose issues have got to be overcome, and those are issues that are Texas-specific, because we kind of led the way in passing those laws.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, Sealy says, those lost patients he hasn\u2019t seen since their pregnancy do reappear again \u2013 for their next pregnancy, or, in his emergency room.</p> <p>\u201cYou see them back again, in worse shape, and they have had a real disaster befall them since their last pregnancy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it gets worse and worse and worse.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>To Plan B or not to Plan B, that is the question. Science finally has the answer and, apparently, it\u2019s \u201cNo, absolutely not\u201d. If you want to be successful then you should ditch your backup plan says a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597816302096\">recent study</a>. Simply considering a Plan B acts as an \u201cemotional safety net\u201d that decreases your drive when it comes to achieving your real goal.</p> <p>Honestly, I have never related to a paper in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes so much. Throughout my life I\u2019ve put off pursuing Grand Plans by busying myself with putting robust Plan Bs in place, \u201cjust in case\u201d. If only I could throw caution to the wind, I\u2019ve told myself, maybe I\u2019d be the first female secretary-general of the United Nations, a bestselling author and a world-class hacker by now.</p> <p>But, you know what? Maybe I wouldn\u2019t be. Probably, in fact, I\u2019d just be broke. Here\u2019s the thing about studies like these: they end up as headlines telling you to \u201cDitch the Backup Plan\u201d which then turn into epigrams on Instagram (aka the modern career guidance office). Think: \u201cFollow your passion!\u201d; \u201cFail Again, Fail better!\u201d; \u201cFind what you love and let it kill you!\u201d</p> <p>But finding what you love and throwing yourself into it without a backup plan really <em>could</em> kill you. Sever Your Safety Net may look nice in cursive \u2013 with a background of clouds \u2013 but it ought to have a Do Not Try This at Home disclaimer on it too. It ignores the fact that much success does, in fact, stem from the presence of a financial safety net. When you delve into who actually does decide to go gung-ho for their Plan A you often find that their bravery isn\u2019t so much a case of a cool head and a brave heart as it is a case of having money. A 1998 study, <a href=\"http://www.andrewoswald.com/docs/entrepre.pdf\">What Makes an Entrepreneur?</a> found that personality traits weren\u2019t a predictor of entrepreneurship, access to capital was. \u201c[E]ntrepreneurship is more about cash than dash,\u201d University of Warwick professor Andrew Oswald, an author of the study, <a href=\"http://qz.com/455109/entrepreneurs-dont-have-a-special-gene-for-risk-they-come-from-families-with-money/\">told Quartz</a> last year. \u201cGenes probably matter, as in most things in life, but not much.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w19276.pdf\">2013 study</a> by Berkeley economists reinforces these findings. Entrepreneurs, the study shows, are more likely to be white, male, highly educated, and from come from higher-income families. \u201cIf one does not have money in the form of a family with money, the chances of becoming an entrepreneur drop quite a bit,\u201d <a href=\"http://qz.com/455109/entrepreneurs-dont-have-a-special-gene-for-risk-they-come-from-families-with-money/\">noted Ross Levine</a>, one of the economists.</p> <p>The same study also showed that entrepreneurs were more likely to have \u201cgreater self-esteem, and engaged in more disruptive, illicit activities\u201d as teenagers, such as taking drugs or skipping school. It\u2019s funny for how some people breaking the law is a \u201cdisruptive\u201d activity that set\u2019s them up for startup CEO-ship and for others it\u2019s a quick way to getting locked up and never employed again. An appetite for risk doesn\u2019t come so much from genetics, it seems, as it does from confidence: knowing you can get rich and you\u2019re not going to die trying.</p> <p>Blind luck also plays an under-acknowledged role in success. Recognising that your achievements come down to being in the right place at the right time or being from the right family isn\u2019t as enticing as imagining you forged your way to the top through passion and perseverance. Which is why most rich people rationalize their success as a matter of hard work and risk-taking over luck. (Exhibit A: Donald Trump.) This is particularly true in America, where individualism striving is held in high esteem. Figures from Pew Research Center show that 73% of Americans think hard work is the most important driver of success; only 18% think having a wealthy family is.</p> <p>All of this is not to say that if you don\u2019t have a financial safety net you should simply give up on your dreams right now.

  "<p>Even as the partisan divide on gun rights widens in the US, an overwhelming majority of both Clinton and Trump supporters say they support several of the gun control reform proposals that have failed to pass Congress over the past few years, according to a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/26/opinions-on-gun-policy-and-the-2016-campaign/?utm_source=adaptivemailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=16-08-26%20guns&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=229&amp;lea=26626&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=\">new national survey</a> from the Pew Research Center. </p> <p>Seventy-five percent of Trump supporters said they favor background checks on private gun sales and sales at gun shows, as did 90% of Clinton supporters.

But the findings also highlight how Democrats\u2019 anti-gun views are out of step with Americans\u2019 generally favorable opinion of gun ownership. </p> <p>Overall, 58% of the public believes that owning a gun does more to protect gun owners from crime than it might put them at risk, the Pew survey found. But only 32% of Clinton supporters agreed with the statement. Twice as many, 65%, said gun ownership does more to \u201cput people\u2019s safety at risk\u201d than it does to protect them, the survey found. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/pew-gun-by-party/\" data-alt=\"Compared with 2000 and 2012, the partisan gap in support for gun control is widening.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/pew-gun-by-party/\">Compared with 2000 and 2012, the partisan gap in support for gun control is widening.</a> </figure>  <p>Asked simply whether gun rights or gun control is more important to them, Americans showed a dramatic partisan split: 90% of registered voters who support Trump said protecting gun rights was more important than controlling gun ownership, and only 9% said they prioritized controlling gun ownership. <br></p> <p>Clinton supporters said the opposite: 79% of the Democratic nominee\u2019s supporters said that controlling gun ownership was more important, compared with 19% who said they put more value on protecting gun rights. </p> <p>The 70-point partisan gap in support for gun control over gun rights has nearly doubled since the 2012 presidential election, when only 62% of Barack Obama\u2019s supporters said they prioritized gun control, and a much larger 21% of Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s supporters agreed. </p> <p>But these dramatic partisan divides over gun rights disappeared when Americans were asked about some specific gun control policies, including whether they supported \u201cmaking private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks\u201d.</p> <p>In all, 83% of respondents said they supported this policy.

But 74% of Clinton supporters favored a ban on assault-style weapons, which the candidate has endorsed, compared to 34% of Trump supporters. </p> <p>The survey also found clear demographic differences in support and opposition to bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, with a majority of women supporting the bans and a majority of men opposing them. Respondents with a college degree were most likely to support a ban on assault-style weapons. The ban also has relatively strong support among people who said they had a gun in their household: 45% said they supported a ban, compared to 61% of people in non-gun-owning households. </p> <p>The Pew survey also found that Republican support for an assault weapon ban has continued to shrink in the wake of a series of high-profile mass shootings. Last year, 44% of respondents who were Republican or leaned Republican said they supported a ban on assault-style weapons. This year, only 35% of them said they supported a ban. </p> <p>The Pew report\u2019s findings are based on a telephone survey of a national sample of 2,010 adults conducted in early August. </p> <p>Gun control has become a fiercely contested campaign issue between Clinton, who labeled the NRA one of her top enemies, and Trump, who was endorsed early by the NRA, which continues to champion him. The next president will likely determine the partisan balance of the supreme court, a decision that could affect how the court interprets the limitations of Americans\u2019 constitutional right to own and carry guns.

Lai, who has met Pulis, does not speak English and the feeling within the club is he will lean heavily on the existing senior staff, in particular John Williams, who was brought in as chairman recently and will act as the conduit between the manager and owner.</p> <p>A well-respected figure during the 14 years he spent working for Blackburn Rovers as chief executive and chairman, Williams has stressed that the priority for Albion is bringing in players to strengthen a squad that has an all-too-familiar look.</p> <p>Pulis spoke after the victory over Crystal Palace in their opening match of the season about how the club has \u201calmost stagnated\u201d and, in fairness to the manager, he has a point. There is also an argument that Pulis deserves to be judged when a few more new faces have come through the door. As things stand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/west-brom-matt-phillips-qpr-signs\" title=\"\">Matt Phillips</a> is the only permanent signing West Brom have made this summer. Pulis wants five more players in before the window closes on Wednesday.</p> <p>Funds are in place and have been ever since the transfer budget was approved at a board meeting at the end of last season. Albion are willing to spend big \u2013 there is talk inside The Hawthorns that a couple of significant transfers are close \u2013 and, if the right player becomes available, prepared to break the club-record \u00a312m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/10/west-brom-salomon-rondon-zenit-st-petersburg\" title=\"\">they paid for Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n</a> last summer. Yet getting deals over the line has proved to be a major problem for a club that is a long way down the pecking order when it comes to where players choose to play Premier League football.</p> <p>West Brom cannot compete with Southampton or West Ham United for a player, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth are probably more attractive propositions right now and it is perhaps a sign of the times that the club are borrowing fringe players from teams who are unlikely to finish in the top six. Brendan Galloway has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/tony-pulis-west-brom-cutting-edge-northampton-town-efl-cup\" title=\"\">joined on a season-long loan from Everton</a> and Albion hope to tie up a similar arrangement with Southampton\u2019s Jay Rodriguez.</p> <p>All the while a question mark continues to hang over the future of Saido Berahino. Assuming Berahino is still an Albion player when the window closes \u2013 this time last year he told Jeremy Peace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/01/saido-berahino-spurs-west-bromwich-albion\" title=\"\">he would never play for the club\u2019s owner again</a> after he missed out on a deadline-day move to Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 nobody can be quite sure what to expect from a striker who is out of contract at the end of the season.</p> <p>As for Pulis, the doubts were there from day one about whether his relationship with West Brom would work in the long term. Yet in a season that promises to be far from straightforward for the club, it may be no bad thing to have a man in charge who has never been relegated.</p>",

He\u2019s normally as well received in New Zealand as lamb laced with anthrax.

He showed it to the Wallaby and All Blacks teams and between them they had the challenge of acting out the simile during the game. The crowd, of course, didn\u2019t know which simile they were tackling thus providing them a <em>tremendous</em> amount of fun as they tried to guess. </p> <p>Well, as we all discovered, last week\u2019s simile was \u201cLike a hot knife through butter\u201d with the All Blacks playing the role of the hot knife and, perhaps fittingly given their jerseys and soft centre, the Wallabies playing the role of the butter. I\u2019d be surprised if any spectator was unable to work that one out so good were the troupers on the field. So well done all concerned!</p> <p>Anyway, that was then and this is now. Today, in Wellington, the All Blacks will take their turn as hosts (Kia ora!) and welcome a Wallabies team that looks so ready to be devoured they may as well be glazed and have an apple in their mouth. Indeed, the All Blacks are the shortest-priced favourites in Bledisloe Cup history \u2013 even including the dark days of 2005 when Eddie Jones was at the helm of the then Wobblies. (Eddie Jones! There\u2019s a blast from the past. Wonder what\u2019s happened to him? Probably teaching high school maths out in the sticks somewhere.)</p> <p>Given what we saw last week it seems inconceivable that the Wallabies \u2013 who\u2019ve now lost their past five games, including last year\u2019s World Cup final \u2013 could upset the home team and set up a Bledisloe Cup decider at Eden Park in October. It seems inconceivable they\u2019ll even get close. And that\u2019s before you even take into account Australia\u2019s woeful track record across the ditch/dutch. They haven\u2019t beaten New Zealand in New Zealand since 2001, a time when petrol was 10c/litre, Bing Crosby was in his pomp, and young children found entertainment in rolling hoops down the street by whacking them with small sticks.</p> <p>But keep your chins up, Wallabies fans! In sport, anything can happen and it often does. And need I remind you that the Wallabies have a secret weapon, one brought in from the wilderness to play at No10 tonight?

The three-door Seat Mii feels cheap because it is cheap, and the cabin doesn\u2019t lack elegance but has a thin, clackety acoustic that goes with not spending much.</p> <p>And yet, with the sun out and the windows down, driving barefoot with the radio loud, via the six speakers and boot-mounted sub-woofer (optional, for an extra \u00a3185), you could be driving back from a beach in a hire car.

I don\u2019t care if I get sand in it. I like the stable, if noisy, ride, it makes me feel like burning a few clicks for a kebab.</p> <p>Ah. But that make-believe evaporates when you consider the three doors, the boot that has room for a bit more besides its sub-woofer, and a one-litre engine which is fine until you fill the car with extraneous stuff like other people. Now you can\u2019t be a holidaymaker, you\u2019d just get huffy. You have to be a person who lives on the beach and this means you have to be a surfer dude; otherwise you\u2019re in highly seasonal employ which generally entails not being able to afford any car.</p> <p>So now you have to be barefoot and bare-chested. You\u2019ll be needing a six-pack, although you have tinted windows so could get away with a four-pack.

Gaea\u2019s mum and sister welcomed me with open arms, Gaea, on the other hand, just looked me up and down and carried on watching TV. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fffbc1d8bbc4c59549d36043b741752207e1474e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fffbc1d8bbc4c59549d36043b741752207e1474e/0_7_604_362/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ekua McMorris with her friend Gaea Todd.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ekua McMorris with her friend Gaea Todd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ekua McMorris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took some weeks before the ice broke between us, but once it had, there was no stopping us.

We met when I was 15 and she 16 at a gay youth group called <a href=\"http://www.allsortsyouth.org.uk/\">Allsorts</a> in Brighton, England. The alternative look was \u201cin\u201d then, and I thought Louise was really cool with her baggy jeans, chains and beads. I\u2019m not sure what she thought about me \u2013 probably that I had a bad haircut but seemed quite funny. <br></p> <p>We started spending time together outside of the youth group \u2013 going to see bands, experimenting with underage drinking, and sneaking into clubs. Exploring Brighton\u2019s gay scene with Louise was the highlight of my teenage years. One summer we practically never spent a day apart and throughout our late teens I recall many days spent hungover at her parents house. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9cf3a5885f16516ab845ca6f3359d03abc0c576\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9cf3a5885f16516ab845ca6f3359d03abc0c576/0_0_960_960/500.jpg\" alt=\"Claire, on the left, who now lives in Vancouver, with her friend Louise.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire, on the left, who now lives in Vancouver, with her friend Louise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were both in London for University, albeit opposite ends of the city, and yet still found time to spend together among new friends, deadlines and exams. Post-graduation I moved back to Brighton and Louise stayed in the capital. We continued to see each other every few months and always looked for opportunities to relive our teenage years and go out clubbing or to see bands.<br></p> <p>Louise is incredibly patient and has guided me through some questionable relationships. Our bond is really strong because we share a similar sense of humour. I admire Louise\u2019s work ethic and passion for her craft. She\u2019s a successful freelance illustrator and every time I see her work in print or online I feel incredibly proud of what she\u2019s achieved.<br></p> <p>Eight months ago I made a huge life-changing decision to relocate to Vancouver, Canada. Louise came with me to the airport and was the last person I hugged goodbye before going through the gate. She\u2019ll be my first visitor later this year, too. <br></p> <p>Our friendship started because we both knew we were gay at a young age. However I believe that our sexuality doesn\u2019t define our friendship; it\u2019s merely a coincidence. I think finding someone who is into a lot of the same things you are, shares similar values and morals, and has a fantastic sense of humour is rare and should be cherished. <strong><br>Claire, 30, Vancouver \u2013 originally from Brighton</strong><br></p> <h2>\u2018Our friendship is older than our marriages and children\u2019</h2> <p>I have two oldest friends and would not want to choose. We have known each other for over 50 years: Jane for 54 years and Marjorie for 53.<br></p> <p>Marj is a qualified librarian and Jane a teacher. We grew up in 60s Manchester and took advantage of the cultural and social scene there. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"63b3d3b332323c804e20fa6536a050470574b119\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63b3d3b332323c804e20fa6536a050470574b119/25_128_502_301/500.jpg\" alt=\"Valerie with her two friends\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valerie with her two friends</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerie Stevens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We all worked for a trade and technical publishing company in Manchester, which must have been one of the most wacky places to work. We were all keen not to slot into the \u2018married at 21, get a mortgage and two children\u2019 sort of life that seemed like the only option for many women at the time. <br></p> <p>We have breaks in our friendship but always kept those links that have endured. We wanted something else in our lives and we have all achieved that in our different ways \u2013 we\u2019re all married now and have five children between us, two of us living in France and the other a frequent visitor.</p> <p>Our friendship is older than our marriages and children and I cannot imagine my life without either one. We are the witnesses to the narratives of our lives as others have disappeared along the way, and they\u2019ve supported me through life traumas including serious illness and bereavement. </p> <p>Three years ago we had a grand celebration in Manchester to mark our 50 years of friendship. Two of us travelled from France for the event. We had lunch at a top restaurant, then visited our old workplace and went to a feminist book launch before spending a fantastic night at the Dolly Parton musical. More recently I have had a health scare resulting in an operation in July and waiting for results to assess if more serious. One stayed with me the beginning and the other supported me after the operation. Friends for life. <br><strong>Val Stevens, France, 71</strong></p> <h2>\u2018He was top of the class, I was bottom\u2019</h2> <p>When I saw David at my wedding last year, we realised that this September would mark 25 years since we met. I thought that a quarter-century of friendship deserved a celebration, so I\u2019ve just been to visit David [Burn \u2013 a professor of early music at KU Leuven] in Belgium for five days \u2013 I\u2019m writing this on a train during the final leg of my journey home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907022eb7e0356791adfc42f75bf6ec517012589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907022eb7e0356791adfc42f75bf6ec517012589/0_169_1229_738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Allen, right, with his friend David and the latter\u2019s daughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Allen, right, with his friend David and the latter\u2019s daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Allen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We met having both just left school to go to college in Nottingham. We both enrolled on a music course but came from very different musical backgrounds \u2013 I\u2019d started as a club organist, playing the working men\u2019s club circuit, whilst David played harpsichord and studied ancient music. He was a shoe-in for the course, whereas I got in by the skin of my teeth. In the first term exams, he was top of the class, I was bottom. We formed a friendship based on a shared inquisitiveness, and we were firm friends throughout our time there. David got a scholarship to Oxford, and I went to university in Yorkshire. We saw each other as often as we could whilst undergraduates \u2013 we both found university life lonely, and neither of us found friends that shared the same close bond we\u2019d formed between us. When I graduated, I stayed in Yorkshire. David stayed in Oxford for his master\u2019s, and then his PhD. We saw each other as often as we could, but this became more and more difficult with the passing of time. It never seemed to matter though \u2013 we always picked up exactly as we\u2019d left off. </p> <p>We\u2019ve had an incredible time reminiscing over the last 25 years together, and even going back and playing through the piano duets and songs we learned at college \u2013 over 20 years have passed since we last played or sang together, and it came flooding back as though it was yesterday. <br><strong>Timothy Allen, 41, choir director from Barnsley</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Neither time nor distance has any corrosive effect on our friendship\u2019<br></h2> <p>Mike \u2018Oz\u2019 Owen is my oldest friend \u2013 I\u2019ve known him since we were 5 years old, 47 years ago and he is essentially the brother I never had. I live in Wiltshire but he lives in Brighton, working as a lighting designer for big-name acts such as Beyonce and Madonna. <br></p> <p>We don\u2019t need to see or speak or e-mail each other regularly \u2013 we just pick-up after six months or so; neither time nor distance has any corrosive effect.We just understand each other \u2013 have the same perspectives on life and the same values.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He spoke knowingly of me as only a friend could</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He, like me hails from a working class background and we both seemed unusual in our growing-up in not wanting to live locally and get a job in the local factory. We both made it to university in the 80s when few from backgrounds like ours even had that expectation. We both sought to \u2018escape\u2019 our roots and live independently and seek out experiences. <br></p> <p>I can share any problem I have without fear of judgement from Oz. He offers sane counsel and has helped me financially in times of need. I know that I can simply turn-up at his if I need refuge \u2013 which I have done in the past. He will sympathise, listen and share a possible solution. <br></p> <p>Having been a \u2018best man\u2019 at a wedding, I didn\u2019t want to burden him with that role, seeking to protect him from the labor of the speech. On the day, without my knowledge, Oz stood-up at our wedding reception and spoke beautifully from the heart, braving something that I know would have been uncomfortable to him. He spoke knowingly of me as only a friend could. I was deeply touched. We have travelled together, had minor adventures together, gone to gigs, played guitar together and tried to fathom what it\u2019s all about together for the last 47 years, swapping field-notes from life as we go on. It \u2018aint over yet but I know that one of us will be speaking at the other\u2019s funeral.<strong><br>John Randall, 52, Devizes, Wiltshire </strong><strong><br></strong></p>",
  "<p>One day, when he was 25 years old, Park Sang-hak was strolling around a huge square in the North Korean port of Wonsan. It is a drab place, with just a few flags and painted propaganda posters providing splashes of colour. But, as a trusted party worker and the son of a top spy, Park had been given rare dispensation to travel to the city along the bumpy roads from the capital, Pyongyang, and he had made plans to see a friend from university.</p> <p>The pair talked animatedly as they walked around on that autumnal day in 1993. This was a break from the usual repetitive routine of life in the world\u2019s most repressive nation: ceaseless work broken by Monday political classes and Saturday self-criticism sessions. The square was packed as they mingled with men in spartan clothes and women with regulation hairstyles. They passed an imposing statue of Kim Il-sung, the state\u2019s founder, who landed in the city after its postwar liberation from Japan. Suddenly, they saw hundreds of leaflets raining down from the sky.</p> <p>\u201cThere were about 800 people there and just five security men, so I grabbed one and put it quickly in my pocket,\u201d recalls Park, now 48, showing me how fast he stuffed away the piece of paper as we chat over fruit in a Seoul cafe. His friend was too scared to do the same; they could have faced party expulsion, exile to the countryside, even execution. Later, they read the story on the leaflet about a family of defectors who had fled to South Korea, and looked with wonder at pictures of escaped women in bikinis on a beach.</p> <p>The flyer was sent by the South as part of a propaganda war being waged on both sides of the divided nation. Once, Park would have been sceptical about its message: he was from a privileged family and had been told since birth that his great leaders were wise, their nation the world\u2019s finest, that jealous enemies such as South Korea and the US sought to overthrow their glorious system. When, as a teenager, he discovered a neighbouring family had disappeared in the night, he was disturbed, but he accepted they must have done wrong.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/03/pyongyang-holds-rally-in-honour-of-north-korean-leader-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4njmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2592937\"            data-video-name=\"Pyongyang holds rally in honour of North Korean leader \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5778ef95e4b0794b412fbf37\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/03/160793nkorea_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/03/pyongyang-holds-rally-in-honour-of-north-korean-leader-video\">Pyongyang holds rally in honour of North Korean leader</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But first Park\u2019s grandmother, on a rare visit from Japan, told him how much happier people seemed in other places, although he warned her against spreading rumours about the regime. Then fellow students, chosen to study in communist countries, whispered stories about life outside. \u201cOne had been to Berlin, where he had access to the west. I was shocked to learn some people had free access, since, if you travelled to South Korea and were caught, you went to a concentration camp. And I discovered in Europe people did not have weekly self-evaluation sessions [where citizens must confess to \u2018wrongdoings\u2019], which were a source of great stress for our people.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, as a young bureaucrat rising in the system, Park had no desire to leave; not until one day in the summer of 1999, when he received a message from a Chinese man. He had come on behalf of Park\u2019s father, who was working in Japan for the government. His father had realised the family were in danger; he wanted them to leave. \u201cThis was the moment my dreams crashed,\u201d Park says. \u201cI was sad and scared, but I knew I had no choice.\u201d As entire families are held culpable for offences, he says, \u201cIf I stayed, I would be sent to a prison camp, since my father was not coming back.\u201d</p> <p>His father had discovered the horrific scale of famine in North Korea and feared fresh purges. Huge numbers had starved to death due to the loss of financial aid after the collapse of the Soviet Union, followed by a series of natural disasters. But even to say the word \u201cfamine\u201d was a crime, because it implied state failure. Park, suspecting a trap, demanded proof that the message was genuine, asking for photographs of his father. This took two months to arrange, \u201cbut felt like 20 years\u201d. A week later, he bribed a border guard to defect across the Yalu river to China with his mother, brother and sister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b254e6e542f815d213fd3a0d5a6120515d17878\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b254e6e542f815d213fd3a0d5a6120515d17878/0_1672_4002_4328/925.jpg\" alt=\"Park Sang-hak portrait\" width=\"925\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was sad and scared, but I knew I had no choice\u2019: Park Sang-hak fled after his father defected to Japan and sent news home about the scale of famine in North Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first weeks of a new century, he arrived in Seoul, aged 32, to start his new life. He quickly found a job in a university\u2019s technology department, where he was able to use his engineering skills. But many defectors do not integrate so easily. Often, they struggle to settle in a world they find so strange, with its personal freedoms and paralysing choice. They are, after all, emerging from an Orwellian land where life is determined by a rigid hierarchy dependent upon family history, where the state controls everything under a despotic dynasty that has ruled though three generations since 1948.</p> <p>Today, this diminutive man dedicates his life to bringing down the brutal regime that brainwashed him and 25 million fellow citizens. Park quit his job in 2003 after learning his fiancee had been beaten so badly following his escape that she was left unrecognisable, that his two uncles had been tortured to death and that his teenage cousins were reduced to street begging. \u201cI had to do something,\u201d he says. \u201cI was mad that these innocent people had been tortured and killed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Park - dubbed 'enemy zero' - has survived an assassination attempt by an agent armed with a torch that fired bullets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Park does not fight with bombs and bullets, but with flyers such as the one that once floated down beside him. This year, he has dispatched 2m leaflets attacking the dictatorship in homemade balloons sent across the barbed-wire border. The leaflets are sent in packages alongside dollars, declarations of human rights, booklets about South Korea, sweets, soap operas and even comic films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/the-interview-review-stoned-anally-fixated-funny\">The Interview</a> that ridicule North Korea\u2019s leadership. Park believes that information can break down the walls of the world\u2019s toughest totalitarian state and that truth can free citizens from their cocoon of total censorship.</p> <p>\u201cAll defectors ask the same question: how could our country lie so completely to us?\u201d he says when we meet again two days later. It is a cloudy July night and we are driving to Gimpo, by the North Korean border, so he can send over 10 balloons, 150,000 leaflets, $2,000 (\u00a31,500) in cash and a cartoon banner mocking \u201csupreme leader\u201d Kim Jong-un. Park\u2019s team \u2013 comprising his wife, his brother and his sister-in-law \u2013 work silently but systematically as they fill agricultural tubes with hydrogen, then release them with dangling parcels attached. \u201cObviously, we have no idea how many get in,\u201d Park says, \u201cbut at least there is no risk to people smuggling the information in.\u201d</p> <p>Watching the balloons disappear into the night, it is hard not to think that these are flimsy weapons with which to fight the maverick nuclear power that lies a mile north. Yet Park\u2019s missions seem to have stung North Korea. He has been named \u201cEnemy Zero\u201d. Five years ago, he survived an assassination attempt by an agent armed with two poison-tipped pens and a torch that fired bullets. The would-be killer asked to meet, but the police went in his place; now Park has permanent bodyguards. Missiles have been fired back over the border in response to his balloon launches, and at times of tension South Korea has deployed the police to prevent his efforts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25ebded0e11760e944d3d26c92b15af4c747fb6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25ebded0e11760e944d3d26c92b15af4c747fb6c/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Korea banner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Park launches a banner across the border, which reads: \u2018Humanity condemns Kim Jung-un, who squeezes blood out of the people and fires Musudan ballistic missiles.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Park is far from alone. Dozens more defectors, dismayed by international inertia towards a dictatorship that enslaved an entire population for seven decades, are trying to topple tyranny with similar tactics. Aided by non-profit organisations such as the New York-based <a href=\"https://humanrightsfoundation.org\">Human Rights Foundation</a>, activists are using drones to send memory sticks from China loaded with books, encyclopedias and films. Others bribe border guards or use boats and fishermen to send banned data, documentaries and radios.</p> <p>The risks are high: three women were executed after being caught circulating a South Korean drama about a defector last November. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un\">Kim Jong\u2011un</a> has cracked down hard to consolidate his position since becoming leader five years ago, and only two of the other seven people who stood beside his father\u2019s coffin are still thought to be alive. He has toughened border controls, warning that people who aid illegal crossings face the death penalty and offering rewards for soldiers who stop them. Those with cash and luck can still get through, but in the past two years alone the cost has doubled to $14,000 (\u00a311,000).</p> <p>In such a closed culture, even the most banal items can seem revolutionary. One prominent defector told me how watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/05/titanic-review\">Titanic</a> made her realise the restrictive nature of North Korea and the real meaning of love. Another described being transfixed by Chinese television commercials for products she had never seen before, such as bottled water. A third man told me how he smuggled in DVDs of Desperate Housewives \u2013 its glossy view of life in the US runs counter to the official line. A fourth was fascinated by Jane Eyre, so different from the censored version shorn of any sexual frisson or societal critiques.</p> <p>For five years, Kim Heung-kwang was among the party cadres seeking to stem the flow of such seditious material. A computer-science professor at Hamhung University, he was recruited to join the state censorship team and study seized electronic devices. He went on searches, took bribes from terrified families and confiscated \u201ccapitalist\u201d materials. Afterwards, he would read captured books and watch banned films at his leisure, then lend them to friends \u2013 until the day he was denounced in 2003. He was tortured, stripped of his post and sent to work on a farm. Thanks to his wealth, however, he was able to flee the country a year later.</p> <p>Arriving in South Korea, Kim sought to subvert the system he had once followed so fervently by setting up a group of intellectual defectors. He made videos, such as one showing the inside of a bookshop that told viewers to look at the number of volumes on sale; another featured taps with hot and cold water, so rare north of the border. He loaded them on to \u201cstealth\u201d memory sticks, designed to seem empty if checked by officials, along with books and essays. Thousands were sent through secret smuggling pipelines that date back to the deadly famine two decades ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e48b49cdfb395c60ea4dc1640575460e4eae0f78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e48b49cdfb395c60ea4dc1640575460e4eae0f78/0_380_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Heung-kwang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former party cadre Kim Heung-kwang served in North Korea\u2019s cyber unit, but fled after being denounced.

We meet in a downtown cafe. She has cropped hair, several earrings and a ready smile. Her mother was a doctor and her father taught the accordion. Like many elite North Koreans, the family bought illegal items that gave glimpses into the wider world. \u201cWe would listen to music, although we didn\u2019t know it was from a couple of decades ago,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>She was arrested more than a decade ago as the result of investigations into the family of a close friend. \u201cThe police would interrogate me, asking again and again if I listened to foreign music and films. They would get friends to testify against me that I was the ringleader and smuggling videos, then beat me for days until I admitted it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When it comes to overthrowing the government, I don't think it's possible. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After confessing her \u201ccrimes\u201d, Jung was sentenced to eight years in prison, which, due to forced labour and poor food, can often be a death sentence. Her family were able to use their connections to get her out after a year, claiming that she suffered a severe illness. They smuggled her to China as soon as she was released, but the broker they paid to get her over the border sold her as a slave. The young woman was sent to the countryside, forced to work in fields and barely fed before escaping months later for South Korea.</p> <p>Now Jung has joined the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_People%27s_Liberation_Front\">North Korean People\u2019s Liberation Front</a>, a quasi-military group in the South, waging information war against the Kim regime and preparing for its collapse.

Few citizens own computers \u2013 which have their own operating system, \u201cRed Star\u201d, and control access to what one defector calls \u201cvery boring\u201d state-run websites \u2013 but most have access to television.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdc9413aff34171317ddc517a968f2c90b631ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdc9413aff34171317ddc517a968f2c90b631ab5/0_1440_4002_4560/878.jpg\" alt=\"Choi Jung-hoon\" width=\"878\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choi Jung-hoon, commander of the North Korean People\u2019s Liberation Front.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Choi was an army officer in North Korea\u2019s cyber-hacking unit for nearly 20 years, before leaving, almost by accident, in 2006. After hearing that a South Korean family was offering a $10,000 reward for contact with a kidnapped man, he searched the North to find him, successfully. But when he took the man to China to claim his reward, the family held a press conference and revealed publicly what Choi had done. \u201cThe regime ordered my execution,\u201d Choi says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d Two years ago, he survived an attempt on his life by a female agent posing as a defector.</p> <p>We speak in the group\u2019s Seoul headquarters, a nondescript office with its logo on the wall and so many pairs of army boots under the table I have to push back my chair to sit down. He admits that, when he was forced out of the country, he was filled with regret \u2013 his family was successful, his career was thriving and he had no reason to doubt the dominant ideology. \u201cI never realised how horrifying the regime was that I defended,\u201d he says intensely. \u201cBut the more you believe in something, the more you feel betrayed when you see through it. Finding out what the government had been doing changed my life. That\u2019s why I work so hard to get information in.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>More than two-thirds of the 28,000 defectors in South Korea are women, most of whom endured terrible traumas after fleeing. Many others are trapped in China, forced into marriage or slave labour, at risk of repatriation if caught. If they are sent back, they face abuse from prison guards or are sent to work in mines or political camps. Suicide rates are high among defectors, even in the South. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34710403\">Official figures indicate that one in seven defector deaths are suicides</a> \u2013 a legacy of abuse, the impact on family members left behind and the struggle to survive in a free society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if women in North Korea are sexually abused or raped, they do not know that these are violations of their rights</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This inspired <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2016/04/178_203015.html\">Lee So-yeon</a>, 40, to fight for fellow North Korean female defectors. A former soldier, Lee worked as a cleaner after escaping, before pursuing a degree with the aim of turning her personal pain into action against the men behind atrocities. Now she runs a human rights group making videos in which abuse victims tell their stories, accusing high-ranking assailants and detailing locations and dates of attacks. These are loaded on to USB sticks with information about women\u2019s rights, then smuggled into North Korea and scattered on the ground in public places.</p> <p>When we meet, Lee shows me a leopardskin makeup bag with a sly smile. Inside are several freshly smuggled North Korean mobile phones that contain pictures of people watching banned content. Already this year, her New Korea Women\u2019s Union, which also helps new arrivals settle, has sent more than 1,200 memory sticks north. \u201cWe accuse specific offenders of carrying out sexual offences,\u201d she says. \u201cThe videos tell them they will be subjected to punishment after reunification.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1168fb0a65c590f3bb2de52be3f879a8977539b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1168fb0a65c590f3bb2de52be3f879a8977539b3/0_1925_4002_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee So-yeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee So-yeon, head of the New Korea Women\u2019s Union, which helps female defectors settle in the South.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of her key challenges is to explain basic human rights. \u201cThe big problem with women in North Korea is that even when they are sexually abused [or] raped or their rights are violated, they do not know these are violations. They are really emotionally damaged. Then, when defecting, they are often put through more trauma \u2013 and because they do not know these things are wrong, they suffer badly from depression.\u201d</p> <p>Lee\u2019s own story is typical. She enlisted for the army after leaving school. Famine was starting to bite: corpses littered the streets and the government stopped supplying free food to citizens. Soldiers\u2019 rations were cut in half; some resorted to stealing from villagers.</p> <p>Lee served for a decade; discharge was not an option. There was widespread sexual abuse. \u201cOne company commander had 120 female soldiers under his command and he raped 30 of them,\u201d says Lee. Was it her unit? \u201cYes,\u201d she replies. \u201cIn North Korea, there is a form of social stigma, so if a woman were to step up and say: \u2018I was sexually abused,\u2019 she would be the one blamed. And, because power was so prized, lower ranks could not step up over such matters.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Lee never doubted the system. She had seen leaflets sent from the south, but she dismissed them as psychological warfare. \u201cWe were trained all our lives to worship the Kim regime. Even when people were dying all around me, I never thought the leaders were the problem. I just wondered if I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>After finally being discharged in 2001, she ended up selling black-market goods near the Chinese border. Buyers seeking items from abroad would ask for something \u201cfun\u201d. Listening to banned radio, watching foreign films and talking to people who had crossed the border, she began to learn about the outside world and slowly understand the scale of state duplicity. \u201cOne time I heard a radio broadcast with a defector woman talking about what her life was like in South Korea. That was when I got the desire to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Lee\u2019s first attempt at escape in 2006 ended in failure. She was caught, beaten and sent to prison for a year of re-education. Two years later, she tried again. After bribing a border guard with $500 (\u00a3380), she was successful. She spent six months in China, hiding until she could find a broker to take her to South Korea. She tells me she had bad experiences in China that she cannot bear to talk about.</p> <p>Many defectors are badly scarred by their experiences, especially the children. One teacher tells me they struggle to cope with simple things, such as seeing pupils talk back to teachers, or even seeing pizza for the first time. \u201cThe other day, we played a couple of North Korean songs and they reacted very badly. They still suffer such trauma,\u201d the teacher says.</p> <p>Yet young South Koreans show surprisingly little interest in their cause. One poll at a Seoul university found that eight out of 10 students had never met a defector, although many refugees hide their backgrounds. \u201cThe youth in South Korea today show total apathy towards their brothers and sisters in North Korea,\u201d says Cho Myung-chul, the first defector to become a South Korean MP. \u201cIf this lack of awareness and interest is not addressed, our society is doomed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw a public execution aged seven, the victim's brains exploding with machine-gun fire. For us that was normal life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His government has passed a human rights act, after more than a decade of fierce debate, that will log atrocities and fund local groups. But it is a polarising issue. Two years ago, one far-left group of five MPs was disbanded by a court after accusations of pro-North activities. For many years following the famine, liberal South Korean governments pursued a \u201csunshine policy\u201d of aid and engagement with the North (technically, the two nations remain at war: when conflict ended in 1953, they merely signed a truce). The past two South Korean presidents, both on the right, have taken a tougher line, demanding an end to the North\u2019s sabre-rattling and nuclear aggression.</p> <p>South Korea sees reunification as a core policy, with a special government ministry and programmes to assist defectors. But many are sceptical about the practicalities, especially given the growing economic disparity between Asia\u2019s fourth biggest economy and its poor, isolated neighbour. \u201cWe are not going to war,\u201d says Lee Jung-hoon, South Korea\u2019s ambassador for human rights, who supports defector activism. \u201cThe change has to come from within. So, they have to hear information. They need to understand the situation outside their walls.\u201d</p> <p>The efforts of defectors to subvert a state that once controlled them seem to be having an impact. A leaked North Korean security report from September 2014 revealed that \u201cinappropriate recordings and propaganda publications\u201d were on the rise, with mobile phones proving difficult to control. Citizens were ordered to disable Bluetooth on phones to stop data transfers, and searches have been increased in schools, factories and offices. One school was singled out for praise after insisting on daily reports from all students and staff to prevent suspicious activities such as \u201cwatching and circulating illegal content\u201d.</p> <p>But these attempts to empower citizens can do only so much: the key to the disintegration of the regime can come only from China, which supports Pyongyang as a buffer against the west.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Perhaps the most haunting story of escape and defection I hear is from Hyeonseo Lee, whose gripping biography <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/girl-with-seven-names.html\">The Girl With Seven Names</a> has become a global bestseller. \u201cI saw a public execution aged seven, the victim\u2019s brains exploding from machine-gun fire,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople cannot believe how these things happen, but for us that was normal life. It didn\u2019t seem strange. Because we were brainwashed, we thought these people deserved to die.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74669592fa0389904ff316cfd93428b9913789dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74669592fa0389904ff316cfd93428b9913789dd/0_867_4002_5133/780.jpg\" alt=\"Hyeonseo Lee\" width=\"780\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018These are the most brainwashed people in the world\u2019: former soldier Hyeonseo Lee escaped at the second attempt.

She began secretly to watch Chinese television at the age of 16, hanging a blanket over her bedroom window. When her family\u2019s home burned down following an accident, her father ran back to grab their most precious possessions: portraits of Kim Jong\u2011il and Kim Il-sung. Without them, even in such circumstances, the family might have been carted off to prison \u2013 all families must display them in their homes.</p> <p>She crossed an icy river the following year to reach China and her mother sent a message telling her not to return. Lee spent years underground, during which she was kidnapped, narrowly escaped being forced into a brothel and survived police interrogation by pretending to be Chinese. Eventually, she reached South Korea \u2013 then, 11 years after she last saw her family, returned to the border on a daring, successful mission to smuggle her mother and brother across the border. Her father had died several years earlier, after falling out of favour with the regime and facing interrogation and beatings.</p> <p>I first meet her at dinner with a dozen other people. She arrives late, laughs a lot and generally lights up the room. Yet, talking alone the next day in a cake shop, Lee confesses her struggles, that she keeps busy to avoid awful memories. \u201cWhen I meet people, I forget the pain. I want to keep positive and show that North Koreans can be positive people. But when I am on my own, I think about the past and it gives me more trauma.\u201d Sometimes she cries at her computer; even sympathetic messages on social media remind her that she is a victim. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to enjoy your life,\u201d she says. \u201cKeeping busy is my escape.\u201d</p> <p>She believes it is her duty to spread the word about \u201cthis alien life\u201d. She plans to send back videos of her success as an inspiration to others. \u201cMany female defectors are successful. It can be difficult to adjust, but this is still better than staying in hell.

  "<p>In a US election cycle of unprecedented absurdity, much of 2016\u2019s best political comedy has simply allowed the candidates to speak for themselves. Satirist Vic Berger regularly takes unedited comments by Donald Trump and amplifies their lunacy with the aid of hyperactive visual editing and the odd airhorn sound effect. Film-maker Mike Diva\u2019s recent viral video Hillary Clinton: Meme Queen satirised the former secretary of state\u2019s desperation to appeal to young voters by having a lookalike instruct them to \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go to the polls\u201d. Believe it or not, the line was a direct quote from a recent Clinton stump speech.</p> <p>Berger and Diva are among the bright sparks over at <strong>Super</strong> <strong>Deluxe</strong>, a \u201ccommunity of creative weirdos\u201d responsible for some of the strangest viral hits and video series on the web. Mini Last Meals parodies the current YouTube fad for cooking tiny versions of popular dishes, only with miniature reproductions of serial killers\u2019 final meals. Stoned Mode offers such strangely therapeutic sights as artisanal head shaving, neon sign bending and clowns shooting firearms in the desert. The History Of Butts is exactly what it sounds like.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl8NUwCeDrs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jl8NUwCeDrs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Central to Super Deluxe\u2019s success, however, is its political content. Since the brand\u2019s relaunch last December, at a time when the presidential primaries were only just beginning to descend into farce, Vic Berger has been on a one-man mission to refit political satire for the Snapchat era. In the vein of Britain\u2019s Cassetteboy, Berger\u2019s work often features no original material whatsoever, instead turning politicians\u2019 own speeches, debate performances and social media efforts against them. A pandering video of Jeb Bush answering a series of tech-themed either-or questions thereby becomes a dead-eyed recitation of Apple\u2019s product line, while one of Donald Trump\u2019s quotidian self-aggrandisements mutates into a boast about his ability to form a clenched fist.</p> <p>Of late, Berger has stepped in front of the camera to anchor the Vic Berger Election Special, in which he brings the Super Deluxe ethos direct to the Democratic and Republican national conventions. Across 45 glorious minutes, our host strives courageously to pick up his press credentials, has more than one encounter with right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and unsuccessfully schemes to get 60s chart-topper Chubby Checker inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Directed by Tim Heidecker of comedy duo Tim &amp; Eric, the two-part video is every bit as riotous and ridiculous as the election itself. If the most polarised presidential race in a generation isn\u2019t doing much for the state of contemporary political discourse, at least it\u2019s making satire great again.</p>",

I\u2019ll admit I was expecting some heady, ripe, buxom oriental power scent but what I got is a wearable floral-chypre that\u2019s so much more to my taste. Chypres (my personal favourites) are warm, dry perfumes, almost always built around an accord of oakmoss, patchouli, labdanum and bergamot, the most famous of which are Miss Dior Originale, Guerlain Mitsouko and Chanel No19 (created, funnily enough, by the great-uncle of Tilbury\u2019s perfumer, Fran\u00e7ois Robert). Like these, Scent Of A Dream is chic, pretty strong and long-lasting, but the fragrance itself is quite sharp and daytime \u2013 ideal for me, but possibly too low-key for some (pleasingly, it reminds me of the fragrances worn by my mum and stepfather in the 1970s). It\u2019s sexy but intimate; rather than demanding your attention, it invites you to sidle up next to it.

It\u2019s lighter, more refined, a little musky, but still very moreish. My 11-year-old also observed that it smells \u201ca bit like posh Play-Doh, in a good way\u201d, and I must say, he was absolutely right on both counts.</p>",

  "<p>Sometimes, Ian McEwan wonders if he will be shot. He pictures the scene at a public book signing. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to come up, especially in the States, shooting at my chest, you know. It would be quite easy. It has often crossed my mind, especially after there\u2019s been some kind of mass shooting.\u201d</p> <p>Has he ever had cause for alarm? \u201cOccasionally someone comes towards me and I think, uh-oh, where\u2019s the guard? Some glowering, frowning guy who\u2019s somewhat overweight shambles up to the table, and you think, yes, he\u2019s got something on his mind.\u201d And? He smiles. \u201cAnd he turns out to be utterly charming. Yes, so I always get those wrong.\u201d</p> <p>McEwan\u2019s other worry about doing a book tour is that he will end up repeating himself. \u201cI start out all right. But then you get a bit tired of your own voice. And then this feeling begins to creep in. You begin to feel a bit like a sort of brush salesman of old, selling encyclopedias or double glazing. It\u2019s a sort of feeling of repeating yourself, and disliking yourself for it. It\u2019s a certain kind of self-loathing.\u201d</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t imagined him prone to self-loathing. \u201cI\u2019m not generally,\u201d he agrees, and begins to chuckle. \u201cWe made up a medical syndrome, [my wife] Annalena and I, for people who are too bumptious and fond of themselves. It was called Self-loathing Deficiency Complex.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/429145/\">Nutshell</a> is McEwan\u2019s 17th book, in a career that is practically a publishing industry all of its own. He is the leading light today in a circle of friends (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/martinamis\">Martin Amis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie\">Salman Rushdie</a>, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/christopher-hitchens\">Christopher Hitchens</a>) whose early promise in the 1970s established their reputation as Britain\u2019s golden generation of writers. To many fans they remain, to this day, literary royalty. To their critics they became a smug, misogynistic clique with a bad case, you might say, of Self-loathing Deficiency Complex.</p> <p>I\u2019d wondered which version I would find. The fastidious figure I meet in a discreet London hotel is polite and rather formal at first, but soon relaxes into gentle self-deprecation, and is the only person I have ever known to interrupt one of his own anecdotes to ask, \u201cIs this interesting?\u201d There is no particular need for him to keep mentioning Annalena, but he does, and each time makes me like him more. At one point he observes, \u201cWithout women readers the novel would be dead,\u201d but it is perfectly obvious that economic self-interest is not why he has no problem with women. If McEwan has a prejudice against anyone, I think it may be against men \u2013 or, rather, a certain type of man. The first glimpse comes in an anecdote he tells with evident pleasure, about what happened when he once tried to give away unwanted books to strangers in a park.</p> <p>\u201cThe women were all, \u2018Oh lovely, thank you.\u2019 And the men were,\u201d he adopts a lumpen cockney accent, \u2018Nah, you\u2019re all right, mate. Nah, sorry mate, nah.\u2019\u201d He laughs in wonderment. \u201cNot one book.\u201d</p> <p>More than one of McEwan\u2019s earlier novels features an uneducated but dangerously virile man (Tarpin in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/14/solar-ian-mcewan\">Solar</a>, Jed Parry in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/sep/07/fiction.reviews\"> Enduring Love</a>)who imperils the comfortable middle-class world of an intellectually highbrow fellow. In his new book \u2013 a short, crisp work of 199 pages \u2013 we meet a sweet-natured, romantically minded but fatally passive poetry publisher called John, married to a beautiful young wife called Trudy, who is heavily pregnant with his child and having an affair with his boorishly unsophisticated but sexually irresistible brother Claude. The adulterous pair conspire to murder John and inherit the \u00a37m marital home, in a plot that borrows heavily from Hamlet and Macbeth \u2013 save for one radical innovation. The story is narrated by the foetus inside Trudy\u2019s womb.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He apologised for remarks about trans people. 'I might as well have said, \u2018Hitler was right\u2019, for the storm I got into'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To McEwan\u2019s knowledge, no story has ever been written from the perspective of a foetus before. \u201cAnd yet it seemed obvious once I started it.\u201d The idea came to him one day from nowhere, while he was daydreaming. \u201cSuddenly there appeared before me the opening sentence of the novel, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed, apart from adding \u2018So\u2019 in front of it: \u2018So, here I am upside down in a woman.\u2019 I thought, who on Earth would say such a thing? Then I immediately thought it would be a lovely rhetorical challenge to write a novel from the point of view of a foetus. The idea struck me as so silly that I just couldn\u2019t resist it.\u201d</p> <p>The only person he could think of who was more helpless than a foetus was Hamlet (\u201cable to think a lot, but trapped\u201d) which gave McEwan his plot. He solved the problem of how a foetus could know enough about the outside world to make sense of what he overheard by making Trudy an avid listener to Radio 4 and podcasts. \u201cBut really, once you start asking one question, you think, well how did he get all this grammar? Who\u2019s he talking to? Where\u2019s his computer?\u201d McEwan breaks off into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cI said to Annalena, \u2018I might have to go abroad when this is published, far away.\u2019 I just thought, I\u2019m going to get such a kicking for this. But, the more I thought that, the more I enjoyed it. I was committed from the first sentence. I just had so much fun. I\u2019ve written novel after novel rooted in a shared and plausible world. I have researched novels, and I\u2019m very committed to a form of social realism, so this was like a holiday of the senses. I didn\u2019t have to research a thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"954f07f34ad6157bb19139bc92a67d7a550a1f80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/954f07f34ad6157bb19139bc92a67d7a550a1f80/322_479_3028_3784/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ian McEwan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McEwan in Cambridge in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The research McEwan undertakes is legendary. He spent two years shadowing a neurosurgeon for the novel Saturday, and had the <a href=\"http://www.qi.damtp.cam.ac.uk/\">Centre for Quantum Computation at the University of Cambridge</a> check his physics in Solar. In fact, the novelist is so famous for his research that everyone always assumes he is gathering material, \u201ceven when I\u2019m just having dinner\u201d, and are \u201ccrushed and disappointed\u201d to be told he isn\u2019t, so these days he finds it easier just to say he is. Personally, I find the research distractingly clunky, and feel Nutshell is all the better for its absence. But I\u2019m charmed to learn that he keeps an archive of all the letters readers write, alerting him pedantically to some obscure error or other\u2026 \u201cOh yes, I love that.\u201d He always writes back and thanks them, and corrects the mistake in future editions. When I suggest he won\u2019t be getting any letters like that about Nutshell, he looks doubtful. \u201cOh yes, I may get a letter from someone saying, \u2018Excuse me, those foetuses can\u2019t say a word.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>McEwan\u2019s work is a staple fixture of the English A-level syllabus, but \u201cNutshell won\u2019t make it,\u201d he grins, \u201cbecause all those speculations from my narrator about what it means to have your father\u2019s rival\u2019s penis inches from your face.\u201d If students were asked for an explanation of what the novel is about, however, what would it be? \u201cYou mean is there a hidden message in there for us? Well, I hope it\u2019s about the communication of pleasure, which is not sufficiently discussed, I think, nor sufficiently central to the way we talk about books.\u201d I assume he is making some complicated subtextual reference, until he explains that the only real point of this book is to bring pleasure to its reader. \u201cMy best hope for it would be that. That\u2019s its key.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b5d508ea3247114823b6b148825fa4edb9889f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b5d508ea3247114823b6b148825fa4edb9889f1/674_156_3784_4730/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ian McEwan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I had flattered myself that I\u2019d found its purpose buried in a chapter towards the end, when Trudy rids herself of the disagreeable sensation of guilt by deciding that as she never really meant to do anything bad, that meant that she hadn\u2019t, and therefore everything must logically be Claude\u2019s fault. This leads into a dissertation on the contemporary trend for any dimension of identity \u2013 race, gender \u2013 to be reclassified as a matter of personal choice, determined not by objective facts but an individual\u2019s feelings. From there the chapter goes on to marvel at university campuses where \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d must be issued to protect students from any information they might conceivably find distressing, and any speaker wishing to express an opinion its audience might not share must be no-platformed. From all this, I infer that Nutshell is really an allegorical indictment of our post-factual age, in which feelings matter more than the truth.</p> <p>I\u2019m rather impressed by McEwan\u2019s nerve, given all the trouble he got into earlier this year when he told an audience, \u201cCall me old-fashioned, but most people with a penis are men.\u201d The transgender community erupted in fury, and McEwan had to issue a public apology. \u201cI might as well have said, \u2018Hitler was right\u2019, for the storm I got into,\u201d he remarks ruefully.</p> <p>This may or may not explain why, in Nutshell, \u201cI have my foetus say how very disappointing [that] there are only two options here, pink or blue as it were.\u201d But McEwan takes care to explain that he has no problem with gender reassignment. \u201cWhat does it matter to me if people\u2019s identity suddenly finds new routes to express itself? Where I get a little critical of it is where selfhood becomes all of your politics, in a world in which we are more troubled than at any point I can remember in my adult life.\u201d</p> <p>Do identity politics look like decadent narcissism to him? \u201cIt feels like that, coming to the university aspect of it. These children have grown up in an era of peace and plenty, and nothing much to worry about, so into that space comes this sort of resurgence that the campus politics is all about you, not about income inequality, nuclear weapons, climate change, all the other things you think students might address, the fate of your fellow humans, migrants drowning at sea. All of those things that might concern the young are lost to a wish for authority to bless them,\u201d he says, \u201crather than to challenge authority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d16f2d436a215ae3fb0560105a8b1d0c189640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40d16f2d436a215ae3fb0560105a8b1d0c189640/60_65_839_503/500.jpg\" alt=\"McEwan with his wife Annalena McAfee.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McEwan with his wife Annalena McAfee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Ian McEwan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is another possible interpretation of Nutshell, one I venture somewhat tentatively. In 2002 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/17/books.booksnews\">McEwan discovered that he had an older brother</a>, born out of wedlock when his parents had a wartime affair while his mother was married to someone else, and given up for adoption. Their mother\u2019s husband subsequently died in battle, McEwan\u2019s parents married, and by the time McEwan met his brother, a bricklayer, their father had died and their mother was in the late stages of dementia. Has McEwan anticipated, I ask, that some people may see parallels between McEwan and Nutshell\u2019s cultured poet, John, and wonder if there is anything of McEwan\u2019s brother, David, in Claude \u2013 who covets the woman and the wealth which is rightfully John\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d McEwan looks surprised, and considers it in silence. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t go anywhere with that. It never crossed my mind, and it would be quite a perverse reading, I think.\u201d Fearing he will take offence, I apologise for the impertinence of the question, before asking if his mother\u2019s estate was shared with David, but he doesn\u2019t appear to mind at all. \u201cYes, yes, but there was hardly any estate.\u201d</p> <p>Prior to David\u2019s appearance, McEwan\u2019s personal life had been broadly unexceptional. The apparently only child of a not very happily married Scottish sergeant major and English housewife, he spent his early childhood in east Asia and north Africa, and his adolescence at a state boarding grammar school. After studying English at Sussex University he became an early graduate of Malcolm Bradbury\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing\">creative writing course</a> at the University of East Anglia, where he met his first wife, Penny Allen. The couple lived in London and had two sons, but divorced in 1995; unusually for the time, the sons stayed with their father, and two years later he married <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalena_McAfee\">Annalena McAfee</a>, then a Financial Times arts journalist he met when she came to interview him. They split their time between a Bloomsbury flat and a country home in Gloucestershire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5833feb5056003dca7d1e94a7f3a955ed8b02534\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5833feb5056003dca7d1e94a7f3a955ed8b02534/162_13_2670_1602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian McEwan with his brother David\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McEwan with his brother David; Ian didn\u2019t know he existed until 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m curious to know if he feels a sense of fraternal connection with his unexpected brother.</p> <p>\u201cI do, but it\u2019s a bit abstract when you haven\u2019t grown up together.

The uneducated men of his novels often portray a caricature of menacing masculinity \u2013 not unlike, in fact, the \u201cfrowning, glowering, somewhat overweight\u201d gunman he dreads appearing in a book signing queue to shoot him. The contempt and fear with which he can seem to regard men less educated than himself \u2013 men who say \u201cNah, mate\u201d when offered a free book \u2013 makes me wonder how many he actually knows.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don't care about sales.

We seek our pleasures in accordance with our personalities and backgrounds. I came from a very unlettered home, which meant that my adolescence \u2013 fortunately, I think, as I look back on this now \u2013 was about all the things the friends I then got to know at university couldn\u2019t bear. Their mum played the harpsichord, or their dad was a well-known philosopher. I was running towards these harpsichords. They for me were the light, so I haven\u2019t really changed from that, so there are some advantages in not having a book-filled, classical music-filled home which you have to rebel against. So my rebellion was to go to all these new places where no one in my family ever trod, and I haven\u2019t really stopped.\u201d His parents had been working class, as are all of his aunts and uncles, \u201cBut I probably don\u2019t know them well enough to write novels about them. I could do it, but what it\u2019s like to be a manual labourer just doesn\u2019t interest me enough. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4119fdadd1323ddf6d6c3a278546ea15a40dc4dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4119fdadd1323ddf6d6c3a278546ea15a40dc4dc/85_117_3772_2264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atonement\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James McAvoy and Keira Knightley in Joe Wright\u2019s film adaptation of Atonement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He expects reviews of Nutshell to be \u201cwildly varied\u201d, but says he\u2019s so used to no critical consensus that he no longer reads reviews.

Solar, for example, enjoyed \u201cfairly good\u201d reviews in the UK, but \u201cIn the States it was disastrous. It was just unbelievable. I remember sitting on the edge of a hotel bed with Annalena, and she said, \u2018Well, I advise you not to read the Boston Globe, or the New York Times, or the Washington Post.

Modesto is a small city in central California.</p> <p>I\u2019m not entirely convinced by McEwan\u2019s tendency to declare any slight \u201chilarious\u201d. For example, \u201cI saw this phrase and had to turn my head away, but again it made me smile. Some troll-like person on The Spectator wrote that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/11/the-children-act-ian-mcewan-review-novel\">The Children Act</a> was \u2018unforgivably bad\u2019. When I told Julian Barnes, he fell about laughing. I mean, how bad can I get?\u201d</p> <p>Moments later he offers a more convincing response. \u201c<em>\u2018Unforgivably bad?\u2019</em> Well, fuck you.\u201d</p> <p>If not critical acclaim, for what then does he now write? \u201cAh, the dopamine moment is finishing them. It\u2019s, you know, when you\u2019re thinking you\u2019ve got it to where you wanted it to be.\u201d What about sales? \u201cNo. I don\u2019t care about sales. I mean, it\u2019s nice to have them. I wouldn\u2019t go looking for low sales, but no.\u201d His books still earn back their advance, but nowadays this can take five to 10 years, and he doesn\u2019t mind if they don\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t think The Innocent did, actually\u2026 ever.\u201d He always knows a chair of an event has consulted Wikipedia when he is introduced with \u201cthe same sentences I hear all the time, remarking on my colossal sales. And it\u2019s just not the case. That\u2019s not it.\u201d It only says so on Wikipedia, he assumes, because, \u201cI think they\u2019re talking about Atonement [which was adapted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/10/oscars2008.baftas2008\">Joe Wright</a> into an <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783233/\">Oscar-winning film</a> in 2007]. Which was a dreamy experience. But I\u2019ve never had it again since on anything like that scale.\u201d Does he think he may yet write his best novel? He gives a wan smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a really good question, because recognising the moment when you won\u2019t is really difficult, and sad. There\u2019s that often-used trope, \u2018His best work is behind him.\u2019\u201d He cites it with a sadness that makes me wonder if it haunts him.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Inevitably, you\u2019re going to get less word rich, less thought rich. You\u2019re not as clever as you were when you were 38.\u201d But he hopes the trope doesn\u2019t yet apply to him. \u201cI just don\u2019t know when I reach that point. I mean, at some point you\u2019re going to reach it. Even if your best novel was your last one, you don\u2019t know of course it\u2019s your last one.\u201d</p> <p>Would he stop writing if he did? \u201cThat\u2019s what I wonder about. It\u2019s a bit like politicians; it always ends in tears. They never know when to get out.\u201d Would he? \u201cWell if I was Federer now, I\u2019d stop.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer, but it\u2019s painful to contemplate that you reach that moment when it\u2019s just one long decline.\u201d How would he know when he had? \u201cExactly. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d know.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if, at 68, he feels his generation of writers fulfilled their golden promise. The predictions of dazzling genius were never, he points out, made by them, least of all by himself. \u201cBut I think that, if you were to stack up all the novels, I think it\u2019s a really substantial volume of work.

  "<p>What happens when political language fails? When the rage and incomprehension boil over, and we run out of a common vocabulary and sufficient trust in each other\u2019s words to be able to sit down and work through what unites and divides us? Don\u2019t expect much comfort from history. From the fall of Athens to the rise of totalitarianism, observers from Thucydides to George Orwell have associated a breakdown in public language \u2013 or rhetoric, to give it a more traditional name \u2013 with the failure of democracy, loss of freedom, civil strife and, ultimately, tyranny and murder.</p> <p>We are children of the Enlightenment, brought up to believe that we must always dig below the surface to get at the truth, and that nothing could be more of the surface than rhetoric, that slap of paint politicians use to cover who knows what. No wonder we usually want to work back from deficiencies in the way we hear political ideas expressed to what we take to be more fundamental causes \u2013 ideology, group values and affinities, the major economic and social challenges of the day. But there have been periods, in both ancient and modern history, when observers have come to believe that the causality can flow in the opposite direction, and that it is when public language fails that politics as whole starts to fall apart.</p> <p>So let\u2019s talk about 2016. In Britain, the ugly shambles that passed for a once-and-for-all national debate about our place in Europe. In the US, an official candidate for the presidency seemingly capable of any exaggeration or untruth \u2013 including wondering aloud if the US\u2019s gun owners couldn\u2019t do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">something to stop Hillary</a> Clinton \u2013 but still retaining the support of tens of millions of voters. In continental Europe, the extremists gaining ground in many countries, the ultra-rightist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/norbert-hofer-austria-presidential-hopeful-rightwing\">Norbert Hofer</a> within millimetres of the Austrian presidency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a> polling well in the run-up to next year\u2019s French presidential race. And almost everywhere \u2013 whether in the debating chamber, on prime time TV or the smartphone in your pocket \u2013 a sense of a public discourse that is losing its power to explain and reconcile, or indeed to express anything beyond hatred and division.</p> <p>These trends have many social, economic and political causes, but public language \u2013 the language we use when we discuss politics or policy, or make our case in court, or try to persuade anyone of anything else in a public context \u2013 seems to me to be at the heart of the matter. Indeed, I believe we are living through what amounts to a crisis in public language.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Let\u2019s not make the mistake of\u00a0confusing anti-rhetorical \u2018truth-telling\u2019 with actually telling the truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The crisis is playing out in many ways, but perhaps the most important is the failure of conventional political rhetoric in almost every western country. The gap between the claims and promises of political leaders and the facts on the ground \u2013 about inequality, globalisation and the crash of 2008, about immigration, about the west\u2019s unhappy wars in the Middle East, and much else besides \u2013 became insupportably wide. As opinion polls in the US, UK, France and elsewhere demonstrate, many voters have simply stopped believing a word of it.</p> <p>But the death of a political rhetoric is not like a royal succession, with the crown passing smoothly from one monarch to the next. We\u2019re living in a disputed interregnum, with many politicians refusing to accept that the old queen is dead and strange pretenders popping up everywhere \u2013 anti-politicians such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/beppe-grillo\">Beppe Grillo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, mavericks from within existing political structures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz\">Ted Cruz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a> \u2013 each with their own rhetorical recipe for fame and glory.</p> <p>Of course, the pretenders would deny that they were in the rhetoric business at all. If they mention the word, it is only in the context of the detested public language of the establishment. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t abide it\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d that Trump-before-the-fact <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\">Silvio Berlusconi</a> once remarked. \u201cI\u2019m only interested in what needs to get done.\u201d Trump\u2019s own appeal depends more than anything on the belief that he is a truth-teller untainted by the lying ways of conventional politicians: early in the primary campaign, one representative Fox News poll found that 44% of a sample of US voters, and 62% of Republicans, agreed with the statement: \u201cHe tells it like it is, and we need that now in a president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46a3e01d23e1f78ad34b2e862a131f813aa363e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46a3e01d23e1f78ad34b2e862a131f813aa363e7/0_71_3108_1865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedian, actor and political activist Beppe Grillo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speaking out \u2026 comedian, actor and political activist Beppe Grillo.

One of the advantages of noisily rejecting any notion of rhetoric is that, once listeners are convinced you\u2019re not trying to deceive them in the manner of regular politicians, they may switch off the critical faculties they usually apply to political speech and forgive you any amount of exaggeration, contradiction or offensiveness. And, if rivals or the establishment media then point this out, your supporters may dismiss it as spin. Here is Florida voter Yolanda Esquivel, quoted by the BBC in November 2015, rejecting criticism of Trump for his outspokenness: \u201cI\u2019m looking at what candidates can do, not the picky little things they say that people want to make a big deal of.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Gove\u2019s statement that \u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d was a more fine-grained attack on the conventional rhetoric of the establishment. At first blush, it sounds like \u2013 and was immediately and bitterly condemned as \u2013 an attack on expertise as such. I see it rather as an attack on the sound of modern technocratic government, a claim that the public are sick and tired of we-know-best lectures from economists and others, lectures that are couched in impenetrable jargon and that, despite their weighty tone at the time, frequently turn out to be wrong.</p> <p>The difficulty that ordinary voters have in making sense of the language of elite policymakers is a real issue. One Ipsos MORI survey identified what the researchers called a \u201cpresumption of complexity\u201d on the part of many respondents, which meant they thought it was hopeless to even try to understand the issue in question. But is Gove\u2019s proposed solution to the problem to fire the experts en masse? It seems unlikely: in the education department and elsewhere Gove was a notably technocratic minister, steeped in data and expert advice. Is it rather to hang on to the technocrats, but to hide them from public view so that their complicated ideas no longer irritate non-expert listeners? That\u2019s scarcely a recipe for restoring public confidence. Or should we see his statement as a piece of instrumental rhetoric itself, a cynical way of rubbishing the legions of pro\u2011Remain economists while simultaneously presenting the speaker himself not as a paid-up member of that hated elite, but as one of those simple souls who prefers honest ignorance to the slipperiness and insufferable superiority of the overeducated?</p> <p>Gove took care throughout the Brexit campaign to speak with more directness and less of qualification than is usual among senior British politicians. Asked on the same occasion whether he would stand to be Tory leader, he just said: \u201cCount me out.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine anything clearer or more straightforward \u2013 a refreshingly candid response from a post-rhetorical politician. Within days, that statement was no longer \u201coperative\u201d, to use the term coined by Nixon\u2019s press secretary Ron Ziegler. Clarity and straightforwardness are no guarantee that something is true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4b5390773bb49d1548148016a8561a775ad1155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4b5390773bb49d1548148016a8561a775ad1155/0_0_4016_2929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan for Review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan for Review</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: EDWARD CARVALHO-MONAGHAN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the west, anti-politicians from outside the mainstream, and those mainstream politicians who hope to use some of the anti-politicians\u2019 populist mojo to advance themselves and their causes within conventional political structures, are trying to strike this \u201clet\u2019s cut through the rhetoric\u201d pose. But, whether or not they and their supporters are aware of it, anti-rhetoric is itself a classic move in the rhetorical game \u2013 indeed, in the right circumstances, it can be the most persuasive move of all. And, like any other form of public language, we can unpack it to find out what makes it tick. Here\u2019s Trump addressing a stadium of supporters in Dallas in September last year:</p> <p>I made a beautiful speech. I thought it was wonderful. Everything was fine. A week and a half later, they attacked me. In other words they went through \u2013 and then they lied. They made it up. I\u2019m talking about illegal immigration \u2026 We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to do it. [Cheers and applause] We have to do it. Have to do it. [Audience: USA! USA! USA! USA!] And when I hear some of the people that I\u2019m running against, including the Democrats, we have to build a wall, folks. We have to build a wall. All you have to do is go to Israel and say, \u2018How is your wall working?\u2019 Walls work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All rhetoric is\u00a0designed for a particular time and place, and above all for a particular audience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those super-short sentences emphasise certainty and determination, but build up layer by layer towards a climax with a kind of emotional logic. It\u2019s a style that students of rhetoric call parataxis. This is the way generals and dictators have always spoken to distinguish themselves from the cavilling civilians they mean to sweep aside. Julius Caesar\u2019s famous summary, not of his invasion of Britain, but of his victory in the Battle of Zela \u2013 \u201cVeni vidi vici\u201d, \u2018I came, I saw, I conquered\u2019 \u2013 is a classical example of parataxis. Today listeners are more likely to associate it with the successful entrepreneur or chief executive.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s style of parataxis is almost infinitely compressible, as his intuitive mastery of the micro-rhetorical world of Twitter shows: \u201cLightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker, and once a choker, always a chokker [sic]! Mr Meltdown.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLightweight\u201d, \u201cchoker\u201d, \u201cMr Meltdown\u201d \u2013 this is personal in every sense of the word, and written personally on the spur of the moment or dictated in real time to a thick-fingered aide, if that last miskeyed \u201cchokker\u201d is anything to go by. But it contains no fewer than three different summaries of the Trump view of Senator Rubio, each of which is immediately and eminently retweetable. Twitter seems to have influenced Trump\u2019s set piece oratory as well; often he obsesses over a single word or a phrase, like someone feverishly circling something objectionable in a newspaper. Just a couple of weeks ago, he was accusing Barack Obama of creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>: \u201cHe\u2019s the founder of Isis. He\u2019s the founder of Isis. He\u2019s the founder. He founded Isis. I would say that the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5af5959f120f6dfc99e3bb7da44759a85d42f56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5af5959f120f6dfc99e3bb7da44759a85d42f56/31_0_2923_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump in Austin, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Telling it \u2018like it is\u2019 \u2026 Donald Trump in Austin, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does he actually mean it when he says things like this? Nodding to a concept in quantum mechanics, the Urban Dictionary defines a \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s douchebag\u201d as someone who makes an unacceptable remark and then waits to see the reaction before declaring retrospectively whether they meant it for real or were \u201cjust joking\u201d. But perhaps in Trump\u2019s case the indeterminacy is genuine, and the words just tumble out of his mouth without him even bothering to decide at the time whether they are to be taken at face value or as a sarcastic, fantastic throwaway.</p> <p>The fluidity, the way the words follow a still-emerging train of thought, adds to the sense of spontaneity and candour. Perhaps because of that (and to the despair of many of those around him), he has so far largely refused to abandon this style of speaking in favour of prepared texts and the Teleprompter. In that Dallas speech, he starts an idea \u2013 \u201cIn other words they went through \u2026 \u201d \u2013 presumably intending to say something like, \u201cThey went through my speech and twisted what I said and presented it out of context.\u201d But this is exactly the kind of whiny complaint which conventional politicians make, so halfway through he drops it in favour of the far punchier \u201cand then they lied\u201d. Isn\u2019t lying what these political and media enemies are all about? Cut to the chase. \u201cAnd when I hear some of the people that I\u2019m running against, including the Democrats\u201d, sounds as if we\u2019re about to get a paragraph attacking other would-be Republican nominees, or the Democratic contenders, or both. But Trump doesn\u2019t want to waste time pointing out the different ways in which Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton are defective candidates. In fact he doesn\u2019t sound very interested in other candidates at all. So he simply leaves it out and jumps, mid-sentence, to the main thing on his mind: \u201cwe have to build a wall, folks\u201d.</p> <p>The immoderation is calculated. Professional politicians have traditionally wanted to be viewed as wise counsellors; mastering the detail and carefully weighing up the options before making a policy proposal; at least seeming to listen to serious objections made to them by opponents. Trump speaks as if the truth and the right policies were blindingly obvious, and the so-called wise counsellors who claim that the world is a complex place, and that policymaking needs to take account of that complexity, are idiots or in somebody\u2019s pocket. Saying the \u201cunsayable\u201d is the clearest possible way of signalling this contrary stance. But for Trump, stamping on political correctness is not just effective positioning. He has found a wanton ecstasy in it, a joyous spasm of indignation in which supporters are only too happy to lose themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s douchebag makes an unacceptable remark and gauges the reaction before declaring whether they meant it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Trump style eschews any kind of rhetorical cleverness. The shocking statements are not couched in witty or allusive language. His campaign slogan \u2013 Make America Great Again! \u2013 could hardly be less original or artful. Everything is intended to emphasise the break with the despised language of the men and women of the Washington machine. There is a wall between them and you, Trump seems to say to his audience, but I am on this side of the wall alongside you. They treat you as stupid, but you understand things far better than they do. The guarantee that I see the world as you do is the fact that I speak in your language, not theirs.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">British EU referendum</a> campaign lacked the mad fireworks of the current US presidential cycle, but it too rapidly descended into wild exaggeration and insult, with the public looking on in palpable bewilderment. \u201cWhat we really need is an end to the arms race of ever more lurid claims and counter-claims made by both sides on this,\u201d was the weary verdict of Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie MP in the days before the vote. \u201cI think it\u2019s confusing the public, it\u2019s impoverishing political debate.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/25/donald-trump-news-hillary-clinton-campaign-live-coverage\">Trump's campaign CEO once charged with domestic violence, reports say \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet clear rhetorical winners and losers still emerged.

The Brexit messaging was both more chaotic and more irresponsible \u2013 Nigel Farage beaming in front of a poster depicting a sea of refugees worthy of Josef Goebbels himself, promises made during the campaign cheerfully revoked within hours of the votes coming in \u2013 yet the Leavers also found language with a power and cogency that eluded their adversaries. Take back control. Independence Day. Both these phrases offer the listener agency and at least the prospect of opportunity and hope. Dismissed as absurd, not just by the opposing politicians but by much of Britain, they nonetheless pushed Brexit over the top.</p> <p>Perhaps you find this kind of phrase-making glib and repellent and are amazed that anyone could be taken in by it. Perhaps you regard the success of Trump\u2019s novel style of oratory as nothing more than final confirmation that many Americans have lost their wits. Yet all rhetoric is designed for a particular time and place, and above all for a particular audience \u2013 it is a supremely tactical, contextual art \u2013 and these words probably weren\u2019t intended for you. And you must accept that by the same token the public language that most persuades you, whether it\u2019s the fierce rhetoric of rights and inclusion or the measured rationality of evidence-based policymaking, and whether delivered with the soaring inspiration of the young Obama, the dogged persistence of a Bernie Sanders or a Jeremy Corbyn, or the authoritative and affectless calm of an Angela Merkel or a Theresa May, can ring every bit as hollow in other ears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b876b6534b1b1daf900917a6d6c51cc34651bbd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b876b6534b1b1daf900917a6d6c51cc34651bbd4/0_0_2902_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukip leader Nigel Farage poses in front of a poster depicting refugees during the EU referendum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukip leader Nigel Farage poses in front of a poster depicting refugees during the EU referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So how did we get here \u2013 and what, if anything, can we do to begin to put things right? I\u2019m sceptical of any theory that is predicated on the wickedness or insanity of any one set of actors in this drama. It\u2019s easy to blame politicians and parties with whom you happen to disagree, but this doesn\u2019t account for the fact that similar changes are taking place in public discourse in radically different political cultures and across ideological polarities: the mainly leftwing critics of Andrew Lansley\u2019s attempt to reform the NHS under a Tory-led coalition in this country used some of the same rhetorical tactics as the conservative opponents of Obamacare in the US. For me, the loading of all blame on to the political other is not a diagnosis but a symptom of the disease. Nor do I believe, as Tony Blair suggested in his 2007 \u201cFeral Beast\u201d speech, that the principal culprits are the media. That is also too simplistic \u2013 not that I think that my profession is entirely blameless.</p> <p>I believe instead that the crisis in our public language springs from a set of interlocking political, cultural and technological forces \u2013 forces that go beyond any one ideology, or interest group, or national political situation. The first factor is the changing character of western politics, with previous affiliations based on class and other forms of traditional group identity giving way, especially after the end of the cold war, to a more complex and uncertain landscape in which political leaders struggle for definition and differentiation. With policy platforms more arguable and coalitions of interest more transient, it\u2019s hardly surprising that political rhetoric has become more fissiparous and \u2013 because, when tribal loyalties recede, the character of individual politicians becomes more salient \u2013 more personal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The internet has opened a Pandora\u2019s box of extremism and fury, and the vitriol spills back into real-world politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second factor is that widening gulf between the worldview and language of the experts who make modern policy and those of the public at large. Modern government is inescapably technocratic and \u2013 precisely because western societies have already made gigantic gains in many areas \u2013 the trade-offs involved in any new policy proposal are more finely balanced than they used to be: it was far easier to decide in the aftermath of the second world war that London needed a major new airport than it is to decide today whether that airport should have an additional runway. The ranks of economists, statisticians and planners assemble vast quantities of evidence to support the political decision-making process, but neither they nor ministers seem to believe it is feasible, or perhaps even desirable, to try to share much of this with the public. As a result, there are often two quite distinct discourses about a given policy question: a sophisticated, evidence-based conversation between the illuminati who sit behind the closed doors of Whitehall, the European Commission and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">IMF</a>; and an instinct-based and often emotional wrangle in the realm of retail politics. One way of thinking about the Brexit debate is as a clash between these two modes of political discourse, with that of the professional policymakers coming off a poor second.</p> <p>The next factor is digital technology and its impact both on pre-existing media and on the wider dissemination and discussion of political ideas. Over three decades or so, technology has driven an astonishing expansion of media choice and it has democratised the generation and dissemination of political opinion. It has also disrupted legacy business models, squeezed investment in newsrooms and in specialist journalistic expertise, and left most news publishers, whether venerable analogue-era institutions or digital startups, edging towards economic survival mode \u2013 chasing audiences, optimising headlines, courting shock and controversy. Apart from a handful of players, seriousness, restraint and a sense that journalists have a duty to make major public policy choices intelligible to the public have all been in retreat.</p> <p>The web and the major social platforms have also allowed anyone who wants to take part in a new 24/7 worldwide discussion of politics, culture and pretty much everything else. Alas, alongside much that is thoughtful and constructive, the new technologies have opened a Pandora\u2019s box of (often anonymous) abuse, extremism, intimidation and fury. And the vitriol spills back into conventional media and real-world politics \u2013 I saw it myself in July at the Republican convention in Cleveland (\u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d was the least of it). The internet has set a new dark standard for the expression of strong opinion, which some politicians, activists and commentators are only too happy to meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/death-of-neoliberalism-crisis-in-western-politics\">Neoliberalism has had its day. So what happens next? | Martin Jacques</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fourth force at work is related to our understanding of how persuasive language works. Over the course of the 20th century, empirical advances were made in the way words are used to sell to goods and services. They were then systematically applied to political messaging, and the impressionistic rhetoric of promotion increasingly came to replace the rhetoric of traditional step-by-step political argument. The effect has been to give political language some of the brevity, intensity and urgency we associate with the best marketing, but to strip it of explanatory and argumentative power.</p> <p>What can we do? The forces at work are formidable and tend to reinforce each other. We are adaptable creatures and we know that our life together depends on our being able to resolve our differences at least most of the time, so it\u2019s reasonable to hope that one day this difficult and disruptive period of political, social and technological transition will yield to a new equilibrium and a recovery of the public language on which the health of our democracies depends. We can\u2019t know for sure if or when that will happen, but there are some steps we could take right away.</p> <p>Politicians could treat the public like grownups and share some of their actual thinking about policy, including those painful trade-offs, with the people they want to vote for them. Reciprocal altruism might even lead them to shout less and allow their opponents to finish the sentence more often so that those same opponents extend the same courtesy to them. The media too could cut fewer corners and take more chances with the journalism that costs more \u2013 international reporting, investigations \u2013 but may ultimately make for a better business. Without in any way going soft, it could allow politicians more space to address the public in their own words. As for the public themselves? Let\u2019s teach our children rhetoric. Teach them how words and images are used, and abused, to sell packaged goods, political parties and wars, holy or otherwise.</p> <p>Of course, any programme of reform has to begin with an acknowledgement that there is a problem. If this weird and unsettling year has nothing else to teach us, we can still hope that 2016 will go down as the moment we took that crucial first step.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Thompson is CEO of the New York Times and former director general of the BBC.

  "<p>Just how defeatist are our police over online crime? The top fraud crime fighter in the country, City of London Police commissioner Ian Dyson, won\u2019t agree with that, but he certainly talks down the possibility of arrests and convictions. There\u2019s a bluntness to his assessment that won\u2019t, perhaps, go down too well with the Foreign Office. Crooks in Russia and Ukraine are behind much of it, he says, and law enforcement there won\u2019t cooperate with the British.</p> <p>It\u2019s a common saying that you can\u2019t put a policeman on every street corner, and we certainly can\u2019t put one on Kreschatik Street or Old Arbat. But arguably our problem is that we tried to put too many bobbies on the beat, with the vogue for neighbourhood policing skewing resources to threats, such as home burglary and car theft, that have actually been in steep decline.</p> <p>One sound that always greets me when I return to London from abroad is police sirens. New York and Paris are no match for the hyper-visibility and siren volumes of police here, but given the decline in traditional crime (even the terrorism death tolls are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/there-is-less-of-a-terrorism-threat-now-experts-put-europes-summer-of-violence-in-context\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/there-is-less-of-a-terrorism-threat-now-experts-put-europes-summer-of-violence-in-context\">lower than in the 1980s</a>) then it\u2019s time to assess whether we need to switch priorities.</p> <p>The volume of cybercrime now matches the number of traditional crimes, and its estimated \u00a3193bn cost is far in excess of the value of physical goods nicked from homes, cars and workplaces. Yet we devote relatively few resources to fighting it. The City of London police force\u2019s budget is around \u00a3120m a year, yet it is the country\u2019s lead force on fraud \u2013 and also has the not-insignificant duty to protect the likes of St Paul\u2019s, the Tower of London and other high-value targets from terrorism. The commissioner reckons that each \u00a31 spent on fighting fraud prevents around \u00a360 in online theft; even if the reality is that it\u2019s only half that, then it\u2019s still one hell of a return.</p> <p>More money could go into prevention and disruption, where Dyson thinks the returns are best. My guess is that the public would prefer to see many more arrests and convictions. If crooks think the worst that could happen is their website being prematurely shut down, then it\u2019s hardly much of a deterrent.</p> <p>Dyson was determinedly uncritical of the banks when I interviewed him. Yet the banks can\u2019t escape the fact that they are the getaway car when it comes to online crime. Without online banking, the money simply can\u2019t be stolen or lured out of your account and into the scammer\u2019s account.</p> <p>The banks save a colossal sum from shutting their branch networks (eventually they will nearly all go) and making us do the work the bank tellers used to do. We firmly believe that one reform \u2013 forcing sort codes and account numbers to be matched with individual names \u2013 will go some way to halting a number of frauds. But Dyson doesn\u2019t share our belief that this will change much.</p> <p>A second reform requires consent as much from the public as from the banks. The \u201cfaster payments\u201d system \u2013 transferring money instantly \u2013 opened up a gold mine for fraudsters. We all like the speed and convenience, but it means there is no time for second thoughts. So often here on Money we hear stories from fraud victims who say they were not quite sure what was going on, and it was a day (or even hours) later when they tried try to block the transaction. But too late, the money had been looted. There is a strong argument for three-day clearance on transfers to new payees, say for sums above \u00a3250. And would it be that onerous if all transfers above \u00a31,000 took a day or so to clear?</p>",
  "<p>Last Christmas Ian Dyson got a call from his bank. Was he really in a Travelodge, ordering takeaway pizzas? No, was his answer, he was at home with his family. Like millions of others, Dyson had fallen victim to card fraudsters stealing from his account. But Dyson is not like everyone else \u2013 he is the commissioner of the City of London police, with the job of protecting not just London but the whole country from fraud. And the depressing reality is, like so many other frauds, the criminals got away with it.</p> <p>Dyson is disarmingly honest about the explosion in online fraud and cybercrime, and what realistically the police can do about it. \u201cEvery month Action Fraud [the national fraud reporting service] receives 40,000 reports, half a million a year, and we know from the ONS stats that\u2019s only a small percentage of what is going on. There were 3.8 million frauds and two million cyber offences. You cannot enforce your way out of this. It\u2019s physically impossible.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s partly because the perpetrators are abroad, with around half of all cybercrimes reported to Action Fraud originating overseas, says Dyson, citing Indian call centres and Russian and Ukrainian websites. The City of London police have a specialist officer permanently stationed in Wall Street, and worked with the Spanish police to swoop on 110 conmen operating a \u201cboiler room\u201d fraud targeting elderly investors.</p> <p>But Russia? Do the London police receive any help from their counterparts in Moscow? \u201cNo, not at all. Ukraine is limited too. You\u2019ll be aware of the limitations of some foreign jurisdictions.\u201d</p> <p>Another limitation is budgets. \u201cPolicing has taken a 20% hit in its budget so I\u2019ve got to do what I can with what I\u2019ve got,\u201d he says, while noting that virtually everyone else in the public sector has faced similar cuts.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to be realistic with the volumes [of crimes] you\u2019ve got, [and] about the global nature of the crime issue. I cannot possibly sit here and say I am going to investigate every crime. You can\u2019t. But policing has never investigated every crime.\u201d</p> <p>The 40,000 reports to Action Fraud every month are whittled down to ones where the police think there are \u201cactionable leads\u201d. Some go up to the National Crime Agency or the Serious Fraud Office, some are pushed out to the other 43 police forces across the UK, while the City of London police tackle the rest.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 700 cases the City of London police are investigating at the moment. That\u2019s me rather than ones disseminated to other forces. In the top 10 there is about half a billion pounds worth of fraud being investigated.\u201d</p> <p>What he dubs \u201cCEO fraud\u201d is the latest online crime wave City of London police are facing. It\u2019s when a junior person in the finance department of a big company receives an email from the chief executive officer of the firm, asking him or her to move money from one account to another. The email is fake; somehow the fraudsters have hijacked the boss\u2019s email account, or created one that is near identical.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are 700 cases the City of London police are investigating at the moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne major company lost three lots of \u00a3250,000 this way,\u201d says Dyson, noting that the culture in some big businesses is such that junior staff are too nervous about confronting their bosses when they receive an email which appears to be from them.</p> <p>Dyson notes that the other worrying online crime wave is \u201cmandate fraud\u201d. You receive an email from your builder, who\u2019s doing your extension, politely telling you he has changed his bank account details, and could the next \u00a320,000 payment for the extension go into this account? Again, the email has been hijacked, and the householder hands over their life savings \u2013 never to be seen again, as banks do not take responsibility. Guardian Money has highlighted numerous sad tales of how people have been conned this way.</p> <p>Have online fraudsters caught the police napping? Did we put bobbies on the beat when we should have been investing in fighting online fraud? In a frank admission, Dyson says: \u201cTo be honest, who\u2019d hold up a bank these days? Who would rob a bank now when you can make it all online in seconds?\u201d His office is just yards from the Bank of England, yet about the only robberies he sees are of betting shops, one of the last major cash-handling businesses around.</p> <p>He acknowledges that the public think that when they report an online crime, nothing seems to happen. \u201cThere is a public perception that PC Plod is losing the war against these highly sophisticated cybercriminals. It\u2019s a perception I\u2019m trying to address.</p> <p>\u201cLast year 180,000 websites, phonelines and bank accounts involved in fraud were closed down following police intelligence. So disruption is a big thing\u2026 Your report, combined with hundreds of others could lead us to close down that website and prevent people from becoming victims of fraud. While you might not get your money back, it will go at least some way to stopping others [from being a victim].\u201d</p> <p>Disruption is a word Dyson uses a lot. He reckons the best approach for his force is to gain intelligence from the public and other government agencies, and use that to intervene before more victims are conned. It\u2019s why he\u2019s investing heavily in a new IBM project for Action Fraud that should turn it into the world\u2019s most sophisticated anti-fraud intelligence system in the world. The quicker the police can see the signs, the more rapidly they are able to respond, he says.</p> <p>But the public have to do more: \u201cThe public have to shift their mindset around crime. The public have to understand we cannot enforce our way out of this, [given] the volume of crime, the fact that it is global and happening so fast, and that money can be moved so quickly. It has to be about prevention and protection.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t use \u201cpassword\u201d as your password, he says. If that email arrives asking you to pay the money into another account, ring the builder, he adds. There are many, many more simple measures the public can take, he insists. In September, the government will begin a public information campaign, which Dyson says will evoke the message of the 1970s \u201cclunk-click, every trip\u201d campaign to get the public to use seatbelts in cars. We need the same thinking when it comes to transacting online, he says.</p> <p>But shouldn\u2019t the banks be doing more? Can the public really protect themselves from genius hackers determined to break into their accounts?</p> <p>Dyson is reluctant to criticise the big banks, though he says insurance companies have a much better record than high-street banks at cooperating in fighting fraud. The insurers have paid for 35 police officers in the City of London force alone to battle fake insurance claims and have had a string of prosecution successes.</p> <p>He would like the banks to be rather more intelligent when an elderly customer walks into a branch and demands to withdraw nearly all their savings when they have never taken out more than \u00a3100 before in one go. It\u2019s usually because they are being conned.</p> <p>Banks may often fail to report a fraud, in part because of the odd way in which crime is recorded. When Dyson\u2019s own card details were stolen, he was fully compensated by the bank. That means, according to Home Office rules, that the bank was the victim of the crime, not Dyson. \u201cIt\u2019s something we are talking to the Home Office about,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05ef38aafe153279c1860221bf1451a732739ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05ef38aafe153279c1860221bf1451a732739ba2/0_249_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Insurance companies have a much better record than high-street banks at cooperating in fighting fraud.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Insurance companies have a much better record than high-street banks at cooperating in fighting fraud.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics say that police fraud-busters are just not technically competent and resourced to catch cybercriminals. Dyson bridles: \u201cI\u2019d like to disabuse anyone of the view that they are all smart computer geeks, the archetypal spotted teenager hacking into US military computers. They are not. You have some people who are business people who before the internet would have been conning people out of investments. They are doing the same now but are doing it online. Then you have the people with a slightly smarter mate who have found a quick way to make money.\u201d</p> <p>The boiler room criminals in Spain are the type who were breaking into cars before the advent of the internet, he says. But in 33 years of policing, he says criminals are changing. They used to specialise in a line of business \u2013 armed robberies, drug dealing, etc. Now, Dyson says, everybody tries a bit of everything.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the police have their own geeks. Dyson says the City of London force have staff seconded to them from Google and Microsoft whose internet expertise is a match for any cybercriminal in Russia: \u201cMy guys will understand the forensic footprint of these crimes in the same way detectives are aware of forensic opportunities at the scene of a burglary.\u201d</p> <p>He is proud of his force\u2019s work to fend off pension fraud, which was widely expected to balloon in the wake of the new pension freedoms, but has so far been suppressed by the police working with the pension providers. The force was also instrumental in stopping BT from keeping lines open after a phone is put down, a frequent tactic used by fraudsters to convince people who called back that they were speaking to their bank.</p> <p>More money would help, Dyson says. For every pound invested in fighting fraud \u201cwe are preventing about \u00a360 worth of fraud\u201d. Meanwhile he\u2019s behind a pilot project in which private law firms will be hired by police to help seize the proceeds of crime and repay victims earlier.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re an innovative police force,\u201d he says. \u201cThe investment in the last 10 years was in neighbourhood policing and the visibility of police officers. We are shifting, in fairness, policing is shifting to deal with online.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, as he looks out of his offices over the towers of London, while fighting fraud fills much of his time, there is another more serious threat. \u201cMy number one priority at the moment is counter-terrorism. We are quite a target-rich environment.\u201d</p> <h2>How to protect yourself <br></h2> <p>There were more than 5.8m incidents of cybercrime in the past year, enough to nearly double the headline crime rate in England and Wales, <em>writes Patrick Collinson.</em></p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said last month that one in 10 adults have been victims of cybercrime and online fraud over the previous year in the first official estimate of the scale of scams, virus attacks, thefts of bank details and other offences. An initial ONS estimate in October last year put the annual figure at 3.8m, or 40% of all crimes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/fraud_breakdown-zip/giv-31075ozknd7eRwW63/\" data-alt=\"fraud incidents\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/fraud_breakdown-zip/giv-31075ozknd7eRwW63/\">fraud incidents</a> </figure>  <p>Costing an estimated \u00a3193bn a year, cybercrime is nearly as big as all other crime, such as home burglary, car thefts and violence against the person. The ONS added that the chance of being a victim is the same regardless of social class or whether you live in a deprived or affluent, urban or rural area.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the figures for crime excluding online offences dropped in the year, falling by 6%. The long-term trends in traditional crimes such as burglary, car thefts and criminal damage showed that the fall in crime since its 1995 peak had slowed down since 2005. The survey found there had been no change in the overall level of violent crime compared with the previous year.</p> <p>So what are the easy steps to protect yourself from online crime that Commissioner Ian Dyson recommends?</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Never disclose security details, such as your pin or full banking password</strong><br>Banks and other trusted organisations will never ask you for these in an email, on the phone, by text or in writing. Before you share anything with anyone, pause to consider what you\u2019re being asked for and question why they need it. Unless you\u2019re 100% sure who you\u2019re talking to, don\u2019t disclose any personal or financial details.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don\u2019t assume an email or phone call is authentic</strong><br>Just because someone knows your basic details (name and address, even your mother\u2019s maiden name), it doesn\u2019t mean they are genuine. Fraudsters may try to trick you and gain your confidence by telling you that you\u2019ve been a victim of fraud. Fraudsters can also make any telephone number appear on your handset, so even if you recognise the number or it seems authentic, do not assume they are genuine.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don\u2019t be pressured into a decision</strong><br>Under no circumstances would a bank or organisation force you to make a financial transaction on the spot; they would never ask you to transfer money into another account for fraud reasons.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Listen to your instincts</strong><br>If something feels wrong, it is usually right to question it. Fraudsters may lull you into a false sense of security when you are out and about or rely on your defences being down when you\u2019re in the comfort of your own home. They may appear trustworthy, but they may not be who they claim to be.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Stay in control</strong><br>Have the confidence to refuse unusual requests for personal or financial information. It\u2019s easy to feel embarrassed when faced with complex conversations, but it\u2019s OK to stop the discussion if you do not feel in control of it.</p>",

This is Italy in the raw.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eb44c232a4a5eed58dfe10231c0f1e418647d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb44c232a4a5eed58dfe10231c0f1e418647d3d/0_222_5964_3578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the courtyard gardens of Duomo di Monreale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the courtyard gardens of Duomo di Monreale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And among all this, the traditional evening promenade, the <em>passeggiata,</em> is still very much alive here. There are aristocrats struggling to maintain historic palaces, and vibrant street life on every rococo corner. So this is a very old Italy, too. The closest parallel is probably Havana, another decaying former Spanish colony filled with ghosts and stories and heroes. Catch this one before it changes \u2013 and with being warm long into autumn, it\u2019s not too late to visit this year.</p> <h2><strong>WHAT TO DO AND SEE</strong></h2> <h2><strong>The Norman conquest</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"46d5cfe671fd2d1722e2cd965e5a0222d55cc506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46d5cfe671fd2d1722e2cd965e5a0222d55cc506/0_0_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Palatine Chapel, Palermo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman bling \u2026 the Palatine Chapel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The unmissable sites in this city are the astonishing buildings of the Norman kings who conquered Sicily in 1072.

They left behind a fabulous blend of Romanesque architecture, Byzantine mosaics and Arabic domes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f6a0767d3ac1200aea4b5dd5e80718962ddbcb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6a0767d3ac1200aea4b5dd5e80718962ddbcb0/0_80_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior court of the Palazzo dei Normanni in Palermo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interior court of the Palazzo dei Normanni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First stop is the royal palace, the <a href=\"https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.cappellapalatinapalermo.it/&amp;prev=search\">Palazzo dei Normanni</a> on Piazza Indipendenza, whose highlight is the Palatine Chapel, covered in golden mosaics of scenes from the Bible. If it sounds dull, it feels bling. More intimate is the church of La Martorana in Piazza Bellini, with mosaic figures across its Romanesque arches. But the top sightseeing spot is out of town: the cathedral at Monreale, five miles south of Palermo, has gorgeous ceilings and walls decorated by master mosaicists who were brought here all the way from Byzantium. They offer a real sense of the power and mystery of medieval faith.</p> <h2><strong>Street life</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38628ce2435a0eb6982b6c01c07fd5cb22f82b07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38628ce2435a0eb6982b6c01c07fd5cb22f82b07/0_429_5440_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palermo street scene\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The centre of Palermo feels like a stage set \u2013 its streets all baroque facades run to ruin, its people open to communal living.

Her palace was owned by the real-life central character of the novel, Fabrizio, and is where the author died.

Born out of resistance to centuries of oppression by foreign overlords, this secret network of alliances has dominated the economy of the island and, to a lesser extent, the entire nation for at least a century. Since the shocking assassination of crusading anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992 (after whom Palermo airport is named), a grassroots movement against paying mafia protection money, or <em>pizzo,</em> has emerged \u2013 and now there is a No Mafia tour of the town.

Sadness that you felt so alone, so isolated, so desperate that you could think of nothing than to take your life. And the emptiness that you have gone from your family\u2019s life for ever.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help imagining your final moments. All of them are haunting. All&#xa0;these images come to my mind during the day and night. Was it at least quick? Were you crying or were you cool and collected? I keep asking why. What were you thinking? Why didn\u2019t you call?</p> <p>Your mother died when you were 14. You said to me that at that time you had never felt so alone, so vulnerable, sitting in your kitchen at home. You said that you resolved never to feel like&#xa0;that again and that making money was your way of protecting yourself.</p> <p>Then, 59 years later, you must have felt yourself alone and vulnerable again. Only you had money, but money&#xa0;isn\u2019t the most important thing in life; it\u2019s family, friends, a connection to the world and money wasn\u2019t enough to keep you safe in the end. You weren\u2019t alone, Dad, and you not realising that makes me feel cross. Now you\u2019ve left us vulnerable and confused. I don\u2019t want you to go like this. I don\u2019t think you do either. I\u2019m sure this was an impulsive act in the heat of the moment and you would have regretted it straight away. I expect you will be telling me when you call that yes, it was a bit silly, sorry about that. Won\u2019t happen again.</p> <p>It\u2019s 5pm now. The phone hasn\u2019t rung. It\u2019s the first time in 13 years. It really is true then, you\u2019ve gone. I can\u2019t talk to you about Brexit, footie, your hols. I can\u2019t ask you why and give you a big old ear-bashing for being so bloody stupid. You can\u2019t tell me it won\u2019t happen again. Because I realise now that it already has and there is no going back. I guess I knew the phone wouldn\u2019t ring. So today, at 5pm, we have lit a candle and drunk a bottle of fizz in your memory. I have no doubt you would have approved.</p> <p>I really hope, Dad, that out of the trauma of your passing you have found peace. I expect we will eventually come to terms with this and learn to live with it. I\u2019m not sure I forgive you yet but I\u2019ll work on it. Five o\u2019clock on a Sunday will never be the same again. I guess wherever I am on that day and at that time I\u2019ll be thinking of you. My greatest wish is that wherever you may be now, you understand that we loved you very much and we really, really didn\u2019t want you to go just yet.</p> <p>Much love,</p> <p><em>Mark</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 from any phone.

  "<p>Sara Davison loved her husband. They had been married for three years, shared a life in Ascot, built a business together and started a family. Then one morning, in the time it takes to open and shut a drawer, or maybe slam it depending on what you find, everything changed. \u201cI opened it for the second time and there it was,\u201d recalls Davison in her book, Uncoupling \u2013 How to Survive and Thrive After Separation and Divorce. \u201cThe contact lens box was sitting there, staring out at me. I didn\u2019t wear lenses and neither did my husband. I didn\u2019t know anyone who did. When I opened it up there was a large false eyelash sitting there winking up at me.\u201d</p> <p>A lifecoach, she couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. \u201cIt made no sense. I\u2019m going insane,\u201d she thought. Rather than scream and make a fuss, she simply closed the drawer and left it undisturbed. She carried on for a while and did what so many of her female clients are prone to do. Blame themselves. \u201cI assumed it was my fault. I spent a lot of time trying to be \u2018better\u2019. I was a terrible cook and I got someone to come over and teach me. I got a trainer and started working out. I really tried.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/23/divorce-new-rules-splitting-up-amicable-marriage-breakup\">Modern divorce: the new rules of splitting up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The deal breaker for Davison came a few months later, less dramatic but somehow more devastating and conclusive. \u201cOne day I looked at him and that connection in his eyes had gone. I\u2019ll never forget that. You just see that it isn\u2019t returned and that\u2019s it. I never got that back. In my head it changed everything.\u201d</p> <p>After three years of marriage, they divorced and that could have been the end of the story. But for Davison, 42, it was the start of something bigger.</p> <p>When she discovered how little practical help was available for the emotional fallout during a divorce, she saw a gap in the market. \u201cI thought, how do I get help on how to cope with being on my own at weekends, for the heartbreak and betrayal?\u201d</p> <p>She tried psychotherapy but with her background Davison preferred a more proactive approach. \u201cI process stuff by getting a plan together.\u201d</p> <p>So she began to create her own strategies based on coaching and tested out different techniques to help make the experience of \u201cuncoupling\u201d easier. Now she\u2019s a successful <a href=\"http://saradavison.com/\">divorce coach</a>, counselling clients through every aspect of the divorce process from building self-esteem to navigating the school gates.</p> <p>Uncoupling, explains Davison, is simply the end of any relationship and comes in many forms, from the aspirational <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/26/gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin-goop-conscious-uncoupling-template\">\u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d</a> of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin to the grim reality of what Davison calls \u201caggressive severing\u201d. Davison admits she was on the latter end of the spectrum when she and her husband separated six years ago, but they are on good terms now.</p> <p>It was a long process, but tiny shifts in behaviour, she found, were the most helpful way forward. \u201cI had to stay in the marital home when my partner moved out but I found it difficult \u2013 something big was missing. I decided to rearrange the furniture and move everything round. I created a sanctuary for myself, taking my control back.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/22/divorced-men-women-wedding-rings\">'I took it off and threw it at him': what divorced people do with their wedding rings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She shows me a sparkling band on one impeccably manicured finger. \u201cIt\u2019s my freedom ring,\u201d she says, taking it off to show me. \u201cI went and got something that meant something nice. No one tells you about the dent on your wedding finger that doesn\u2019t go. It was a constant reminder so my freedom ring represented all the exciting things that may happen in the future. It\u2019s doing things that make an instant difference.\u201d</p> <p>Davison\u2019s conversation, and her book too, is peppered with the self-improvement soundbites loved by life coaches \u2013 \u201cTake control and move forward\u201d, \u201cOne step at a time\u201d, \u201cHow to let go of the past\u201d. Yet there is wisdom in the sound, practical advice that she offers and you can see why, overwhelmed by the emotional fallout of divorce proceedings, a weekly checklist you can accomplish might feel more reassuring than painful naval gazing. \u201cAt the end of each session, I do an action plan of what we\u2019re going to do next. One guy was really shut down after his divorce and I said you need to do something that will really wake you up. I asked him to go trampolining and really fling himself around. It made such a difference. I always give them a list to tick things off so they can think, \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve found a financial adviser. I\u2019ve booked in with a bike club. OK, I can see there\u2019s a life. I\u2019m still hurting but I\u2019m forcing myself to do something that will tip the scales.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us30ZXINKmg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Us30ZXINKmg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>However, even she admits that some aspects of divorce can\u2019t be glossed over with a trip to a trampoline park. Along with splitting the finances, battle lines are most likely to be drawn around co-parenting. \u201cIt was the hardest point for me because I never signed up not to be with my son \u2026 I thought my husband was having an affair and he was very soon in another relationship, and that\u2019s difficult to cope with when you hand your baby over.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Davison devised a strategy. \u201cIf your children aren\u2019t with you for the weekend rather than think, as I did, \u2018I don\u2019t want to lie on the sofa and watch movies, I want to be with my son\u2019, re-focus your thoughts. Don\u2019t dwell on what will make you miss them more. Do something that will make you proud, achieve something. Go out with girlfriends, go on a date, something that helps you to see that there is life after divorce.\u201d</p> <p>The crux of uncoupling successfully, says Davison, is realising that your happiness doesn\u2019t depend on anyone else. \u201cYou can\u2019t control the other person. You have to find a way to let go of their hold over you.\u201d</p> <p>If anything, divorce can be a catalyst for change, she says, rather than a negative experience that defines you. \u201cDivorce has a very bad name and I want to revolutionise what it can mean,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can bring you the opportunity to redesign your life as you really want it.\u201d Not that she positively encourages it \u2013 in her book she outlines her \u201cno regrets\u201d exercise, committing to three months of \u201ctrying everything you can to save your relationship\u201d. The decision to divorce shouldn\u2019t, she says, be taken lightly, which is why she\u2019s so full of admiration for those who do. \u201cIt takes a very strong person to leave. People should be given a medal, not seen as a failure.\u201d</p> <p>Davison didn\u2019t get a medal so she rewarded herself, throwing a divorce party to coincide with her 40th birthday. \u201cIt was a public sharing of where I was going and thanking everyone for standing by me \u2013 family, friends \u2013 and giving them recognition.\u201d</p> <p>Although she witnesses the breakdown of so many relationships and the misery that entails, she still believes in marriage. \u201cI\u2019d marry again. I do believe it can work. My parents just celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary. They\u2019re still very much in love, so it\u2019s definitely possible.\u201d She maintains that the happiest time of her life, along with the birth of her son, was her wedding day, despite the sense of betrayal that followed. \u201cYou can\u2019t rewind time and say, \u2018That was an awful day because of what happened afterwards.\u2019 I\u2019ve got lots of good memories. OK, it didn\u2019t have the ending I dreamed of but the ending I\u2019ve got now is something really exciting.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Uncoupling: How to Survive and Thrive after Breakup &amp; Divorce by Sara Davison is published on 1 September by Piatkus, \u00a314.99.

The challenge to my fixed views started with a call from my husband\u2019s boss. \u201cCan you come and collect a box of your husband\u2019s stuff from the office?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019re swapping desks, you see.\u201d</p> <p>We were recently married and my new husband was away on business. This was a strange request not least because we lived in Guildford, Surrey and his office in Twickenham in south-west London wasn\u2019t exactly around the&#xa0;corner. I responded with the sensible suggestion that the stuff be left under his new desk and that on return from his business trip, he could bring it home himself. \u201cBut,\u201d said my husband\u2019s boss, \u201cthere are confidential things like&#xa0;cheque books. We don\u2019t really want to leave it here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said and set off by car to collect the box. Back at home, I placed&#xa0;it in the hall thinking nothing of&#xa0;it until later in the day. In the evening, I lifted off the lid and at the top was a cheque book, just as I had been told. It&#xa0;was what lay underneath that would change my life irreversibly in ways I could never have foreseen.</p> <p>Although we had met at university, there was nothing else predictable about us. He was German and had been brought up in Australia. His commitment to the idea of us was such&#xa0;that not only did he choose to live&#xa0;in the UK, but he converted to Islam to marry me. And what a wedding. We celebrated in a French chateau high on a hill among chequered fields lined with grapevines. Every detail was perfect. The dress, the speeches, even the wedding meal, which went on for hours and included an assortment of delicious hand-selected vegetables picked that morning from the chateau gardens. Afterwards, we flew to the Maldives for an idyllic honeymoon on an island no bigger than the chateau in which we were married.</p> <p>So what had I to fear? In the box, underneath the cheque book was a letter. It was handwritten, addressed to my husband care of his office and revealed that he was involved with another woman.</p> <p>After this discovery, there was, I confess, nearly a bunny boiler episode during which I confronted my husband over the phone, cross examining him on every detail. I structured it as a form of entrapment during which at first I didn\u2019t reveal the fact I knew everything. Great practice for a trainee&#xa0;lawyer. (Tip for soon-to-be-divorcees \u2013 don\u2019t do this!) And then there was the call to the woman to let her know her boyfriend is married. She didn\u2019t know. (Tip for soon-to-be-divorcees \u2013 do this!)</p> <p>By the time the divorce was final, I had lost all faith in romantic love. It was, in my estimation, an illusion arising from indoctrination by endless romantic movies and children\u2019s fairytales. I threw myself into my legal&#xa0;career.</p> <p>I wonder if it possible to want something and not want it with equal and opposite force? I didn\u2019t want to live my life alone and had always wanted children. And the idea of remaining unmarried was also virtually unacceptable for girls from my cultural and religious background. We were taught from early childhood the sacred importance of creating and maintaining family bonds, and that the breaking of a family bond is to cut yourself off from the mercy of God.</p> <p>After some years, I landed a great new job and decided to take a break before starting. I had always wanted to learn more about my heritage and family and a trip with my mother to visit my grandmother in Pakistan seemed like the perfect way to do this. I decided to interview her. I took recording equipment and prepared my questions carefully. As I had a limited grasp of the language, I also knew that recording the interviews would enable me to get help translating the answers I didn\u2019t fully understand.</p> <p>The trip was amazing and my grandmother was an inspiration. She took to the idea of being recorded with relish. She even read out poems she had written in between my questions. The interviews took place each morning for about an hour. Afterwards, my mother and I would visit relatives, shop in the amazing marketplaces of Lahore and enjoy delicious freshly made curries with chapattis and rice. On street corners, for pennies, we bought paw paws the size of watermelons, thought nothing of eating 50 satsumas between us in one sitting and enjoyed endless hours of chatting and togetherness with friends and family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I understood my mother and grandmother meant well, so I went along with these strange, uncomfortable meetings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>About a week into our visit, when relatives arrived to see us, I noticed a strange man in the corner of the living room. He was wearing a shirt that was about two sizes too small for him and a fixed grin he directed towards the coffee table between us. He was introduced by my uncle by name, but nothing more. More such men started appearing randomly at restaurants and gatherings. They would come and join us at the table or hover near a wall, like the tall man who was directed to sit next to me at a takatak restaurant (the name is onomatopoeic from the sound of the cooking process. Curries are chopped rhythmically as they are cooking on giant circular hotplates by men wielding what look like wallpaper strippers in each hand). I attempted a conversation with that particular man, but he didn\u2019t reply. He smiled and looked away with every question I asked, like a shy child.</p> <p>And then there was the man who was the spitting image of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjkkKO5Gsno\" title=\"\">subway ghost in the movie Ghost</a>. I discovered these meetings were my grandmother\u2019s attempt at arranging a marriage for me. I wasn\u2019t fazed. I was a strong, independent woman. I could handle this. I explained politely that I wasn\u2019t interested in an arranged marriage. I had so little in common with someone brought up in Pakistan and, anyway, the minimum requirement for me, if I were to be fussy, was the ability to thread words together to form a sentence. However, I understood my mother and grandmother meant well, so I went along with these strange, uncomfortable meetings.</p> <p>Both my grandmother and mother had had arranged marriages, which is hardly surprising. They were born and brought up in India and Pakistan and that was they way things were done. My grandmother had never even set eyes on her husband before their wedding day. She told me she was so keen to get a glimpse of her husband-to-be that she climbed on to an upside-down bucket in the bathroom and peered out of a small window as he left. I, on the other hand,&#xa0;considered myself to be modern British Asian and there was no need for&#xa0;that archaic practice any more. I would meet Mr Right myself and things would be wonderful.</p> <p>Except they weren\u2019t. Mr Right had been anything but.</p> <p>The day before we were due to leave Lahore, a friend of the family came to visit the relative with whom we were staying. He and his son \u2013 a young, handsome, intelligent man \u2013 were unaware that my mother and I were visiting from London so were thrilled to be meeting us. His son walked over from the other side of the living room and introduced himself. He sat beside me and we spoke about my time in Lahore, my life in London, the business he had started and much more. I noticed my grandmother\u2019s eyes&#xa0;on us from the corner of the room. When his father indicated it was time to leave, he asked if I would mind if he emailed me. Without hesitating, I noted down my email address and we&#xa0;exchanged telephone numbers. As&#xa0;he left, he smiled at me. A smile that&#xa0;held nothing back (my sister would later refer to it as his \u201cwinning smile\u201d).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The rigid views we hold can limit our lives. It isn\u2019t easy to recognise them and harder still to change them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Almost as soon as we landed back in London, my grandmother had already discussed the possibility of marriage with the family friend and a proposal was made. A few months later, Kamran and I were married.</p> <p>Before getting married, I felt conflicted. I wasn\u2019t sure I was doing the right thing, but I decided to challenge my fears and reservations and dive in.</p> <p>The wedding took place over several days. It was colourful and loud with bhangra dancing and great urns of the most delicious food. Afterwards, we travelled several hours to Murree for our honeymoon, a stunning town in the foothills of the Himalayas. From the balcony of the hotel, we could see clouds below us in the valley.</p> <p>Marrying in this way was the best decision I have ever made. Now I see an arranged marriage as more of an introduction service, like online dating.</p> <p>We now have two sons and are very much soulmates. I cannot imagine my life with anyone else and it is amazing to think this all came about from a willingness to open my mind to an alternative possibility.</p> <p>I realise now that the rigid views we hold can limit our lives. It isn\u2019t easy to recognise them and harder still to change them. I had always understood this from my work as a discrimination lawyer, but it took these extremes of life experiences to finally break down my beliefs about how to find a life partner and, hopefully, a match made in heaven.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Set Me Free by Hina Belitz is published by Headline Review, \u00a37.99.

  "<p>The Northern Territory is expected to see a dramatic change in government on Saturday as voters head to the polls.</p> <p>Polls opened on Saturday morning but more than a third of eligible voters had already cast their ballot.

  "<p>Australian children who were not white and middle class were all but invisible in children\u2019s books, the author Maxine Beneba Clarke said in her keynote address at the opening of the Melbourne writers festival on Friday night.</p> <p>Clarke, 36, is from an Afro-Caribbean background. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-books-blog/2016/aug/10/the-accumulative-effects-of-racism-it-eats-away-at-the-essence-of-your-being\">Her writing, including her recent memoir, The Hate Race</a>, has been praised for its passion and originality about issues of casual racism in Australia.</p> <p>She told the audience that children in wheelchairs, or those who wore headscarves, or who were being raised by single or same-sex parents, or who lived in public housing or had brown skin, rarely saw themselves in books.
