  "<p>Three siblings were removed from a plane and questioned on the tarmac by armed police officers after passengers falsely accused them of being Islamic State supporters.</p> <p>Maryam Dharas, 19, Sakina Dharas, 24, and Ali Dharas, 21, had boarded the easyJet flight from Stansted to Naples when they were approached by a cabin crew member and asked to accompany her off the aircraft without explanation.</p> <p>In full view of the passengers on the plane, the trio from north-west London were grilled for an hour by officers, who first asked them: \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d</p> <p>Maryam, who will begin an English degree at King\u2019s College London later this year, immediately said she, her brother and sister were born and raised in London, as was their mother, and they only spoke English.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Maryam said it was clear that she and her sister, a clinical pharmacist at University College London, had been subjected to racial profiling. They were both wearing headscarves at the time.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Before being allowed back on to the flight, Sakina was told that further background checks would be conducted and officers would be waiting when the plane landed if any evidence were found.</p> <p>Maryam said: \u201cI would like an apology. What happened was wrong. This kind of profiling shouldn\u2019t take place. I don\u2019t want this to happen again to anyone else.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>EasyJet has apologised for any inconvenience caused, but insisted that security concerns had to be investigated, while Essex police offered no apology and said the report from a couple on the plane that led to the incident was of \u201cgood intent\u201d.</p> <p>The family had chosen the Naples area, where they visited Pompeii, for a holiday as they had an interest in classical civilisations. They had taken their seats on the flight at about 6am on 18 August when they were approached by a cabin crew member, who demanded that they follow her off the plane.</p> <p>\u201cI asked her \u2018where are we going, can you explain where you\u2019re taking us?\u2019 She doesn\u2019t reply, she completely ignores me. We\u2019re told to walk down the stairs \u2013 at the bottom we can see there\u2019s armed policemen,\u201d Maryam said.</p> <p>The Dharas siblings, who are of Indian ethnic origin, were asked if they had Arabic text on their phones or copies of the Qur\u2019an. They cannot speak, read or write Arabic.</p> <p>\u201cI was shocked, my sister was close to tears,\u201d Maryam said. \u201cThe first thing the policeman asks us is if we speak English, which I personally find quite patronising. Just because we look ethnic. I don\u2019t speak any other language but English.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re told a couple had reported us having been reading Isis materials. [They said] the pair of us, meaning me and my sister, had been reading Isis material. My sister and I wear headscarves. We thought, there\u2019s clearly profiling going on here.</p> <p>\u201cWe were just in shock. What is going on? None of us have been doing that. We\u2019re absolutely flummoxed.</p> <p>\u201cWe were asked \u2018have you had any Arabic on your phone? Have you been reading the Qur\u2019an?\u2019 We don\u2019t even speak Arabic, we don\u2019t know Arabic, we\u2019re not even Arabs.\u201d</p> <p>The passengers who complained had incorrectly claimed that the women had a reference to the phrase praise be to God on one of their phones.</p> <p>Maryam had been using her phone on the plane to send messages via WhatsApp to her father, a pharmacist born in Uganda, and had been having a conversation about the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Once off the plane, Sakina was separated from Maryam and Ali, and they were questioned by men in suits said to be from special branch. </p> <p>Sakina had a passport stamp from a visit to Iraq, when she and Ali had taken part in a sponsored walk to raise funds for Isis victims.</p> <p>The officers asked to see Maryam\u2019s Twitter posts. \u201cThere was no evidence here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were being treated like criminals. The couple had lied and got away with it. It was offensive and hurtful. They tarnished our names in front of everyone on the flight, it was really humiliating.\u201d</p> <p>The siblings were allowed to return to the plane and offered an apology for the inconvenience. \u201cIt was a humiliating walk back on to the flight, it was awful,\u201d Maryam said.<br></p> <p>However, before they were allowed back on the flight, Sakina was warned by her interrogator that further background checks would be conducted while she was in Italy.</p> <p>\u201cThis was bizarre because, if we\u2019re not a threat and we\u2019re allowed on the plane, we\u2019ve all agreed this has been a lie, then what\u2019s the need?\u201d Maryam said. \u201cThey said \u2018if we find anything, we\u2019ll be waiting for you when your plane lands\u2019. What kind of threat was that to make?\u201d</p> <p>The family returned on 20 August and no one was waiting for them.</p> <p>Sakina said: \u201cWhat are my rights? We would only have been allowed back on the plane if there wasn\u2019t a shred of doubt on their part, so someone must be the liar here; in which case, why were those passengers not removed for wasting police time, lying, making false allegations and racial profiling?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, a British man was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/03/man-removed-easyjet-flight-luton-prayer-message-phone\">removed from an easyJet plane</a> by armed police at Luton airport after a fellow passenger read a message on his mobile phone about prayer and reported him as a security threat.</p> <p>Laolu Opebiyi, 40, from London, said he was forced to hand over his phone and reveal his password in order to establish his innocence, after he tried to arrange a conference call prayer with friends using WhatsApp.</p> <p>A detective subsequently questioned and cleared Opebiyi, but the pilot refused to allow him back on to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/easyjet\">easyJet</a> flight to Amsterdam.</p> <p>A statement from Essex police concerning the incident at Stansted said: \u201cEssex police were contacted with reports of concern regarding the behaviour of three people who were looking at their mobile phones. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOfficers at the airport spoke to them and examined their phones with their consent. They were quickly able to establish that no offences had been committed and the women boarded their flight. We are satisfied the call was of good intent.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for easyJet said: \u201cEasyJet can confirm that, following concerns raised by a passenger during the boarding, a member of ground staff requested the assistance of the police, who took the decision to talk to three passengers at the bottom of the aircraft steps, before departure. </p> <p>\u201cThe police then confirmed to the captain that the passengers were cleared to complete their journey and they reboarded the aircraft and the flight departed to Naples. </p> <p>\u201cThe safety and security of its passengers and crew is our highest priority, which means that if a security concern is raised, we will always investigate it as a precautionary measure. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to the passengers.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The federal government is proposing a ban on swimming with dolphins in Hawaii \u2013 a move that may crush the dreams of many tourists, but will allow the marine mammals to finally get a good day\u2019s sleep. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-20324.pdf\">proposed rule</a> would bar people from swimming or approaching within 50 yards of the Hawaiian spinner dolphin.

That\u2019s their resting period,\u201d said Pultz. </p> <p>\u201cAs we all know, if you don\u2019t rest day after day after day, it does affect your fitness.\u201d </p> <p>Spinner dolphins <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-20324.pdf\">continue swimming while they are sleeping</a>, so people may not be aware they are waking the cetaceans up. </p> <p>The predictable habits of spinner dolphins have been taken advantage of by commercial tour operators, who know exactly where and when to find the resting creatures. </p> <p>\u201cAt some locations, up to 13 tour boats have been observed jockeying for position on a single dolphin group, with up to 60 snorkelers in the water,\u201d the rule reads. \u201cIn addition, organized retreats centered on dolphin encounters, dolphin-assisted therapy, and dolphin-associated spiritual practices have flourished in certain areas.\u201d</p> <p>Pultz said her agency has observed changes in dolphin behavior due to the increase in human interaction, including dolphins avoiding people, increasing their aerial behavior, and leaving bays when too many boats were present, all of which require them to expend extra energy.</p> <p>\u201cWe see all the time boats going right through the pods, separating the moms and the calves,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good situation at all.\u201d </p> <p>Victor Lozano, the owner of Dolphin Excursions in Oahu, said he welcomed the new regulations. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue. We\u2019re ready for it,\u201d Lozano said, emphasizing that he wanted to see the regulations enforced against boats and swimmers alike. </p> <p>Lozano has been providing boat tours for 23 years and said that the behavior of people toward the dolphins had gotten out of control, which he blamed on the desire for \u201cself-gratifying selfies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople chase the dolphins with the selfie sticks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go on safari \u2013 you don\u2019t go out to the lion and try to pet it.\u201d </p> <p>Harassing spinner dolphins \u2013 or any marine mammal \u2013 is already illegal under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The proposed rules would clarify that getting within 50 yards of a spinner dolphin is considered illegal harassment. </p> <p>The government has previously passed specific regulations barring people from approaching within 100 yards of humpback whales in Hawaii and Alaska and killer whales in the Puget Sound. This would be the first rule addressing swimming with spinner dolphins.</p> <p>The proposed rule now enters a 60-day public comment period, and Pultz said it would probably not be finalized for a year. </p> <p>Katie Paki, who works on a boat offering dolphin and whale-watching tours on Maui, said her company did not allow its customers to swim with dolphins anyway. </p> <p>\u201cThey get to see them and take pictures form the boat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dolphin experience. You\u2019re just not swimming with them.\u201d </p>",

The impact of the serious car accident that followed ended Way\u2019s playing career and almost his life.</p> <p>\u201cI feel very fortunate to be alive,\u201d Way says. \u201cAt one stage I did ask the passerby that came up to the window to help me just to tell the kids that I love them and that one day I would see them again. If it was not for her asking me my children\u2019s names, then I do not think I would be here to tell the story today. It was a critical moment in me staying alive because it gave me something to fight for.\u201d</p> <p>He broke three limbs but what was left undamaged, though, was an incredible relationship between Way and Yeovil Town. Following the crash, he joined the club\u2019s backroom staff, working as a scout and honing his skills in sports science, later assuming duties as the first-team coach and assistant manager before taking interim charge following Paul Sturrock\u2019s exit in December.</p> <p>Yeovil went on to lose seven league matches during the rest of the season as Way steered the club away from a League Two relegation that was virtually inevitable when he took over on a permanent basis last New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cWhen it came to me having the opportunity to becoming manager, I didn\u2019t want to let the club down knowing what they had done for me.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/yeovil-town-manager-darren-way-fortunate-to-be-alive-everton-efl-cup\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced two forward steps on his long and testing quest to improve the supply of new homes for low and middle income households. One is the release for development of a piece of Transport for London (TfL) land in Kidbrooke. The other is the start of assembling his expert Homes for Londoners unit at City Hall. </p> <p>The Kidbrooke site is the first brought forward by TfL under Khan\u2019s manifesto pledge to supply \u201cpart-buy, part-rent\u201d shared ownership homes on publicly-owned land for first-time buyers, giving \u201cfirst dibs\u201d to Londoners who\u2019ve been renting for five years, especially in Outer London. It demonstrates both continuity of policy from what TfL did under Boris Johnson and significant adjustments of it.</p> <p>The transport body\u2019s approach to making money from its developable land assets has been be to enter into joint ventures with developers to build housing and other things - schools, shops, medical facilities - on it, enabling TfL to take a share of the profits. The first example of this new departure for the transport body was the vast and controversial Earls Court Project - find seven years\u2019 worth of mildly obsessive coverage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/earls-court-project\">here</a> - which has so far seen the TfL land on which the Earls Court exhibition centre stood levelled and precisely no affordable homes, however defined, planned for it.</p> <p>Here is where Khan differs from his predecessor. TfL\u2019s first priority under Johnson was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/oct/20/transport-for-london-picks-first-300-acres-for-property-development-drive\">make as much money</a> as fast as possible from its property deals: hence the zero \u201caffordable\u201d portion in the Earls Court redevelopment so far and a concentration on sites in expensive areas. Khan, by contrast, is to insist that an overall 50% of all homes built on TfL land must meet his definition of \u201caffordable\u201d - to be a more stringent one than the government uses - and has asked TfL to move more sites in Outer London up its priority list. Kidbrooke fits the bill.</p> <p>The land, which lies next to Kidbrooke railway station, is big enough for around 400 homes plus retail, commercial and open space. During the <a href=\"https://www.politicos.co.uk/books/zac-versus-sadiq\">mayoral election campaign</a>, Khan spoke of TfL retaining ownership of its land, which is usually advisable in any case since it tends to contain useful public transport stuff like stations. In this case, however, the land isn\u2019t needed for TfL transport purposes which means it could be sold rather than retained. </p> <p>Such a sale could be to the highest bidder on the open market but, that high price would make it unlikely that 50% of any homes built on it were affordable, especially by Khan\u2019s definition. However, the land can also be sold to a company that TfL is part of, logically at a price low enough to make 50% affordable financially feasible. According to paragraph 2.4 <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/decisions/md2022-direction-tfl-concerning-disposal-land-kidbrooke\">here</a> it is \u201ccontemplated that TfL will dispose of the land to such a company.\u201d</p> <p>An issue raised by a 50% affordable requirement, the minimum set out by Khan for the Kidbrooke site, is that TfL will get less from the development of the land in this way than they would have were the \u201caffordable\u201d proportion lower. City Hall officers\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/decisions/md2022-direction-tfl-concerning-disposal-land-kidbrooke\">advice to Khan</a> is that were TfL itself or a subsidiary of it developing the land for less than the maximum possible return, it would be breaking the law in the form of the GLA Act, but that those provisions don\u2019t apply to a non-subsidiary, such as a joint venture company. Khan has therefore formally directed TfL to sell or develop the Kidbrooke land by means of such a company, which will likely be formed with one of the 13 developers named in TfL\u2019s <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2016/february/tfl-selects-13-property-partners-to-help-it-deliver-thousands-of-homes-for-lond#_blank\">property partnership framework</a> in February. </p> <p>All this has brought criticism from Conservative London Assembly member Keith Prince, who speaks for the Tory group on transport. He has accused Khan of financial irresponsibility, saying his approach threatens TfL\u2019s finances at a time when Khan is also freezing its fares income and the government is phasing out its grant. Planning applications for the development of TfL land and made by TfL itself under Mayor Johnson have contained proposals for affordable housing - at <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/tfl-s-property-development-programme-advances\">Nine Elms, Northwood and Parsons Green</a>. The proportions in each case have been for substantially less than 50%, but still implied a smaller return for the transport body. </p> <p>Khan has said that Johnson hadn\u2019t pushed TfL to move on the Kidbrooke site (although it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/jan/28/transport-for-london-to-scale-up-its-property-development-wing\">long been a contender</a> for attention), the implication being that the transport body is already in line to be better off than it would have been under the previous mayor and that 200 more affordable homes will soon enter the supply pipeline too. Ensuring speedier housing delivery on is one way in which Khan can address the tension between TfL\u2019s need for additional income and his commitment to building affordable homes on its land portfolio, </p> <p>And so to the second of Khan\u2019s housing announcements. The Homes for Londoners line-up includes a \u201cgovernance board\u201d comprising Khan\u2019s housing deputy James Murray, four borough leaders to be nominated by London Councils, TfL commissioner Mike Brown, the Greater London Authority\u2019s executive director housing and land <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/governance-and-spending/good-governance/our-corporate-management-team/david-lunts\">David Lunts</a>, chair of the G15 group of leading housing associations <a href=\"http://g15london.org.uk/about-us/who-we-are/\">David Montague</a> and two \u201cmembers of the residential property sector\u201d who have yet to be named. Khan himself will chair the board, which will meet quarterly. The clear objective, in keeping with Khan\u2019s manifesto, is to form an alliance of all those with an interest in building London homes.</p> <p>Khan has also announced that he\u2019s assembling an in-house \u201cviability expert team\u201d to look closely at the often contested financial costings compiled by developers to justify the amount of \u201caffordable\u201d housing and other social infrastructure they supply as part of development schemes. The thinking is that cash-strapped boroughs are often bamboozled by property giants and end up getting less affordable housing out of deals than there could have been. </p> <p>Having a stronger viability scrutiny operation at the service of the mayor, who can block, shape or even take over the determination of planning applications, should help the boroughs and also promote greater consistency in viability negotiations - something it is hoped developers themselves might welcome, as the process can be costly and time-consuming for them too. The same experts will also help Khan develop his new London Plan and shape major parts of mayoral planning policy, such as opportunity areas and housing zones.</p> <p>The initiative has been welcomed by London Councils, business body London First and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, reflecting broad agreement that London\u2019s housing problems need to be tackled with greater interventionist vigour. Khan is hoping that Theresa May will join the chorus of agreement. Her chancellor\u2019s autumn statement is awaited with interest.</p>",
  "<p>Antonio Conte was made to feel a little sticky under his starched collar on this sweltering summer night as his makeshift Chelsea side were given a real game by the League One new boys Bristol Rovers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/everton-yeovil-efl-cup-match-report\">Arouna Kon\u00e9 scores two late goals as Everton cruise past Yeovil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A Michy Batshuayi double and a simple finish from Victor Moses looked to have been enough for Chelsea to win the game in the first half. But a towering header from Peter Hartley brought the deficit back to two at half\u2011time and, when Rovers converted a penalty early in the second half, the pressure was thrown back on Chelsea. While his side held on to the win, Conte will now be asking questions about which of his irregulars will be up to the task of meeting the club\u2019s ambitions this season.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity,\u201d the Italian said after the match, \u201cbecause we were dominating this game and then we suffer. We created a lot of chances in this first half to score many goals but I don\u2019t like when you concede two goals in this situation with a free-kick and with a penalty. We need to understand that when you have the opportunity to kill the game you must take it.\u201d</p> <p>Conte made six changes from the team that started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/watford-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the victory against Watford</a> last weekend with Cesc F\u00e0bregas returning to the starting line-up after his weekend assist and the summer signing Batshuayi earning his first start since his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/03/chelsea-announce-signing-michy-batshuayi\" title=\"\">summer move from Marseille</a>. There were also call-ups for the academy graduates Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ola Aina, with the left\u2011back making his full senior debut. The Rovers manager, Darrell Clarke, meanwhile, made only one change from the draw at Southend, with the winger Billy Bodin replacing James Clarke.</p> <p>Conte, as is his wont, was permanently agitated from the first whistle, constantly gesticulating and bellowing instructions even though the noise from a lively Stamford Bridge crowd, attracted by reduced tickets prices for this match, made it unlikely anyone would hear him.</p> <p>Batshuayi had already missed one good chance by the time he opened the scoring in the 29th minute. With Rovers regularly camped in their own box it had seemed only a matter of time before Chelsea pushed enough numbers on to make a difference. In the end it was Nemanja Matic who cut through, running past the right-back Daniel Leadbitter and cutting the ball straight back on to Batshuayi\u2019s left foot for the Belgian to drive the ball into the roof of the net.</p> <p>One became two only two minutes later. This time it was Pedro toasting Leadbitter and, though his cross missed everyone in the six-yard box, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta was able to stretch and get a toe on it at the far post to turn it back across. This time Moses was ready and waiting and able to apply the finish.</p> <p>Just when it seemed as if Conte would have nothing more to point about, Rovers got themselves back in the game. A foul on the Chelsea left gave Chris Lines a decent free-kick opportunity. Rovers\u2019 own youth team product swung in a beautiful delivery and the left-back Hartley rose John Terry-like to power home. Three minutes later Lines was at it again but the promising young forward Ellis Harrison could only head off target.</p> <p>Chelsea restored their two-goal lead soon enough. F\u00e0bregas started this move, his through-ball finding Loftus-Cheek in the box. The 20-year-old spun beautifully to elude his marker and cut the ball back once again, and Batshuayi was ready to score his second of the game from six yards.</p> <p>Despite being in the ascendant as the whistle blew, Clarke opted to shake things up at half-time. His double substitution brought last season\u2019s top scorer Matty Taylor off the bench and the switch immediately paid dividends. Trapping a long pass on his chest in the 48th minute, he pivoted and released the midfielder Stuart Sinclair past Chelsea\u2019s high defensive line. Pedro was the man tracking back and a clumsy shove in the box drew a penalty from Keith Stroud. Harrison stepped up and coolly tucked the ball away.</p> <p>Suddenly it was all Rovers. Harrison saw a piledriver go narrowly over from 18 yards and, shortly afterwards, Jermaine Easter forced a sprawling save from Asmir Begovic. Chelsea all of a sudden began to look shaky, with the energy and control visibly dropping from the home side. However, with Conte on the touchline, this situation was never going to be left to drag. First he brought on Eden Hazard, then Terry and alongside the more experienced heads such as the dominant Branislav Ivanovic, they kept a lid on any pressure. Batshuayi even had a chance to seal a hat-trick in added time but his rebound finish was adjudged to have been offside.</p> <p>Clarke, who has brought Rovers from non-league to League One in two seasons was pleased with his side\u2019s efforts. \u201cIt was a compliment that Chelsea played a strong side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe rode our luck a lot but the character of the lads showed, they had a right good go. No bones about it, though, Chelsea deserved to win the game.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When memories of Ronald Koeman\u2019s first win at Goodison Park have faded in others\u2019 minds they will linger long with one Evertonian. Ross Barkley captained his home-town club for the first time and marked a poignant occasion with a goal and the game\u2019s outstanding performance as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/27/manchester-city-everton-capital-one-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">last season\u2019s semi-finalists</a> ensured smooth progress.

A gulf of 79 league places proved too wide to bridge for Yeovil, a club who could name only five substitutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/burton-albion-liverpool-efl-cup-match-report\">Liverpool rout Burton with Daniel Sturridge double icing on the cake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It illustrated the differing worlds they occupy that Everton could give maiden starts to two newcomers acquired for a combined fee of \u00a339m before bringing Arouna Kon\u00e9 off the bench. The Ivorian struck twice in nine minutes to give the scoreline an unflattering sheen for Yeovil. \u201cI was proud of the players,\u201d said their manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/yeovil-town-manager-darren-way-fortunate-to-be-alive-everton-efl-cup\" title=\"\">Darren Way</a>. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too critical.\u201d</p> <p>Nor did Koeman get carried away. The night\u2019s tribute came instead from Barkley and was dedicated to the scout who discovered him, who passed away last week. The 22-year-old celebrated his goal with by unveiling a T-shirt reading \u201cRIP Sid Benson\u201d.</p> <p>Barkley owed his elevation from the ranks to the absence of the rested trio of Phil Jagielka, Gareth Barry and Leighton Baines.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it was an indication of a newly conferred seniority at a club that parted company with four long-serving players in the summer. \u201cIf you look around the team, maybe the best option was Ross to be captain,\u201d Koeman explained. \u201cIt means a lot to him. He is a big Evertonian who started in the academy.\u201d</p> <p>Barkley was emblematic of Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s Everton, a player whose attacking verve was immediately evident but who lost his way in the traumatic end to the Spaniard\u2019s reign. A troubled summer followed, with Barkley the only midfielder or forward in England\u2019s Euro 2016 squad who was not granted a minute of action but he is already looking a beneficiary of Koeman\u2019s appointment. He has scored with a free-kick in both games at Goodison Park.</p> <p>This time, unlike against Tottenham Hotspur, there was no doubt he was shooting. He spotted the Yeovil goalkeeper Artur Krysiak had strayed too far towards his far post and capitalised. That goal, Everton\u2019s second, was overdue, Koeman felt.</p> <p>Their opener pleased him. \u201cA great team goal,\u201d the Dutchman said. Aaron Lennon was left with a tap-in when James McCarthy showed vision and incision with a sharp cutback following a defence-splitting pass from Romelu Lukaku. It proved the highlight of the Belgian\u2019s night. He had an effort cleared off the line by Alex Lawless but was profligate in the extreme, betraying signs of rustiness as his longest drought in Everton colours extended to a 12th game. \u201cNormally, when he is on his best level he will score at least one goal tonight but I am not worried,\u201d Koeman said.</p> <p>There have not been many occasions over the past three years when Kon\u00e9 has appeared the assured finisher and Lukaku has looked erratic in front of goal. This was one such night. The substitute emerged with a sense of purpose and drilled in Everton\u2019s emphatic third goal before darting between defenders to poke in an injury-time fourth.</p> <p>Four goals were accompanied by four new signings. All of Koeman\u2019s recruits began, offering evidence of his rebuilding, as Ashley Williams and Yannick Bolasie made full debuts. The winger roamed with typical pace without exerting a decisive impact. The midfielder Idrissa Gueye added to the impression that his energetic style and combative approach will render him a crowd favourite. Williams could coast through his first start since Wales\u2019 Euro 2016 semi-final and the goalkeeper, Maarten Stekelenburg, did not have a shot to save. After the talk of borrowing Joe Hart, he was not required. Instead Everton\u2019s inspiration was one who has been at the club since he was 11.</p>",
  "<p>The go-to moral panic of our apparently technology-obsessed younger generation is the tagline \u201cwe\u2019re more switched on than ever but just as disconnected.\u201d Yet my experience with online communities tells a significantly different, more nuanced story.

Who was to say whether genuine connection \u2013 or representation \u2013 was waiting on the other side? Instead, I would spend hours lying on my bed, letting the evening light wash over me, quietly listening to music and scrolling through social media attempting to replicate what I could not access. It almost sounds too insufferable to put to words. But for young queer people, especially those in regional and suburban locations, it\u2019s a shared reality.</p> <p> I thought university would solve this. I pictured it in an idealistic, almost utopian way where the trappings of high school and its accompanying social hierarchies would easily fall away. But I was instead met with new hierarchies, isolating social environments, and irregular timetables where lasting bonds with other students who shared similar hobbies, emotional landscapes and life interests seemed to be fleeting. The semester was over before I established lasting relationships with students and I was left with a feeling of missed opportunity and a resounding melancholy. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tumblr ... offers users the ability to reveal all their emotional ugliness, all their shame, and have that be accepted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was when I discovered websites like Tumblr. Having first registered it at the age of 17, I began using it more predominantly in 2010-2013 when I was 18 and 19, feeling disillusioned with university. Many other users recall this as Tumblr\u2019s \u201cgolden years.\u201d It had yet to cross over to the mainstream and the sub-cultures, languages, colloquialisms and memes that circulated then had not been co-opted by outside institutions and companies that wanted to appeal to certain demographics. </p> <p>When I was uncertain about my latent queerness and gender identity, witnessing other young people navigate those same issues in an open, honest way was incredibly validating for me. They proved that there could be more layers to those things than the stereotypes I saw portrayed in the culture at large. And these weren\u2019t forced appeals to the youth like in LGBTQI-targeted youth services and mental health services (which clearly weren\u2019t made by young queer people) \u2013 they felt accessible, kaleidoscopic even, and I began sharing my own stories, feelings and experiences in response.</p> <p>Tumblr\u2019s sub-cultures were created by young people, for young people, bereft of any kind of ulterior motive. Surely therein lies its success. Theories about queerness, or even race and class, could be discussed in ways that veered away from the overly political and academic and instead be communicated in a human way, honouring real experiences in ways that still felt intelligent and real. </p> <p>Certainly there is a kind of facade building involved there just like there is with all social media, but more so than other platforms, it offers users the ability to reveal all their emotional ugliness, all their shame, and have that be accepted \u2013 to hear a quiet chorus of \u201cme too\u2019s\u201d directed back at them. </p> <p>It\u2019s not uncommon for young Tumblr users to send questions to each other in the \u201cask boxes\u201d of various other users and publish those answers publicly so that other people who may need affirmation can see them. Unlike certain parts of the media that focus on youth culture, that tap into it, commodify it and sell it back to us, its very own creators, we find instead a raw kind of expression that feels earnest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/13/wholesome-memes-could-they-mean-more-good-times-online\">'Wholesome memes': could they mean more good times, online?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is not to say Tumblr is some pure haven where mythical beings exist, manically typing away behind a screen and that trolling is non-existent.

But Tumblr has a unique web structure and can generally only be understood by other Tumblr users \u2013 a far cry from the comments section on any given Instagram post. Tumblr hands total creative control over to the user. It doesn\u2019t feel condescending or restricted. It gives individuals the power to recognise what shapes them and use it as armour in an uncertain world. </p> <p>The overarching narratives in our culture that exist in regards to social media and young people aren\u2019t often positive. A lot of the time, they centre on the experiences of young people who have been bullied into oblivion, who have been pushed to the edge of suicide. But it\u2019s important to remember that these websites aren\u2019t just happening of their own accord \u2013 there\u2019s real people behind them. So if smart young people with positive intentions are using social media, and aren\u2019t shamed just for desiring connection, it has the potential to lead to constructive change. </p> <p>Being open to the possibilities of social media may usher in a new age of understanding and of how marginalised or displaced people respond to it. And while it may seem simple or silly, social media allowed me to express elements of myself I felt like I couldn\u2019t in my day to day life.

He has shown that all they need is a little persistence. And in a media landscape that is increasingly dominated by the rich and powerful, that should give even Gawker\u2019s most ardent critics pause.</p> <p>We know Donald Trump and others have gone down this path before. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/trump-lies/\">openly bragged about</a> the fact that he sued a former New York Times reporter in the early aughts for the purpose of trying to hit the reporter involved financially. Trump did lose that lawsuit, but not until after litigation that undoubtedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for the winning party. </p> <p>And if you think the Trumps are litigious now, just wait until after November. Peter Scheer, director of the First Amendment coalition, <a href=\"https://psmag.com/with-the-gawker-sale-whats-next-for-the-first-amendment-9a8feb0da215#.bh4zctt1v\">explained the consequences</a> of the Gawker case succinctly: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Say five years from now, if Trump loses and people are writing critical postmortems, will they have to worry that Trump will turn around and sue them? Because of the Gawker trial, I fear that many journalists will wonder, \u201cCould that happen to me, even in writing about Trump?\u201d They will be censoring themselves. That is the worst outcome here, and it\u2019s quite likely.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Trump is not the only culprit. In yet another ominous example, Mother Jones, the liberal nonprofit magazine known for its investigative journalism, spent millions of dollars in legal fees when another billionaire, Frank VanderSloot, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2015/10/mother-jones-vandersloot-melaleuca-lawsuit\">sued the company and its reporters</a> over a critical story and some tweets from its editors. Mother Jones won the case last year, relatively early in the process, but still faced an existential financial crisis because of the enormous legal costs associated with the lawsuit. VanderSloot then announced a million-dollar fund to be used for suing Mother Jones and additional members of the \u201cliberal press\u201d in other cases.</p> <p>Even in the Hulk Hogan case, though many people rightly found the story and sex tape offensive and argued it shouldn\u2019t have been published to begin with, a federal judge and an appeals court panel <a href=\"http://gawker.com/how-things-work-1785604699\">both ruled</a> Gawker was protected by the first amendment before the trial, and they were prevented from having an appeals court rule on the judgment before they filed for bankruptcy. </p> <p>But we shouldn\u2019t forget that Gawker was not just getting sued over the Hulk Hogan sex tape case. They were the recipient of a half-dozen other lawsuits or legal threats involving many stories of an investigative or critical nature that virtually any first-year law student could tell you are clearly protected by the first amendment. </p> <p>In the end, even if you think Gawker deserved punishment, media organizations should not face the financial death penalty for a mistake, even a deplorable and egregious one. After all, there is probably one billionaire or another who hates pretty much every news organization in the world worth their salt. If they all decide to go down the path Thiel took, how many publications will be left when they\u2019re done? </p>",

In their challenge, they <a href=\"http://www.becketfund.org/franciscanalliance/\">argue</a> that the administration\u2019s rule \u201cforces doctors to perform gender transition procedures on children\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOn pain of significant financial liability, the regulation forces doctors to perform controversial and sometimes harmful medical procedures ostensibly designed to permanently change an individual\u2019s sex \u2013 including the sex of children,\u201d the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Franciscan-Alliance-et-al-v.-Burwell-et-al-Complaint-FINAL.pdf\">lawsuit</a> claims.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Proponents of the rule called these claims \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cfull of inaccuracies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re simply trying to invent the worst imaginable scenario in order to scare people,\u201d said Jillian Weiss, the director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund (TLDEF). </p> <p>In reality, said Weiss, the rule does not require physicians to provide transition-related services that she does not believe are medically necessary. \u201cIt is simply a rule to establish parity,\u201d she said.</p> <p>An insurance company that typically covers mammograms, for example, cannot refuse to cover the test for a patient who has a female anatomy but identifies as a man. Similarly, a family doctor cannot refuse to treat a trans person for the flu because he is opposed to transgender people. Hospitals could be in violation for placing a trans woman with a male roommate if rooms are segregated by gender.</p> <p>\u201cNothing in the regulations mandates that a doctor disregard her medical judgment in treating a trans child or adult,\u201d Ezra Young, a staff attorney with TLDEF, added in a statement. \u201cThe only thing a doctor is obliged to do is treat all patients, including trans patients, with dignity and respect and to make treatment decisions free from bias. If a doctor has a sound, evidence-based, medical reason to delay transition care for a specific patient, that would be respected under the regulations.\u201d<br></p> <p>Weiss also took issue with the plaintiff\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.becketfund.org/doctors-states-challenge-new-transgender-regulation/\">claim</a> that large numbers of children diagnosed with gender dysphoria \u2013 the condition of identifying as a gender other than the one assigned at birth \u2013 \u201cgrow out of their dysphoria naturally\u201d.</p> <p>Amid extensive research, most mainstream medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Non-Conforming-Transgender-Children.aspx\">agree</a> that children who consistently express a transgender identity are transgender all their lives.</p> <p>Surveys of transgender individuals consistently find that large numbers have experienced discrimination at their doctor\u2019s office. A 2011 survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found that one in three transgender people had been harassed by a health care provider, and one in five had been refused healthcare outright. </p> <p>Just under one third of trans people have delayed seeking healthcare because they fear this kind of discrimination. Others have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/transgender-healthcare-doctor-oneonta-new-york-carolyn-wolf-gould\">travelled long distances</a> for straightforward services such as mammograms and well-woman appointments. On Tuesday, Weiss said the rules were particularly important to rural patients, whose local doctor might be \u201cthe only doctor for miles\u201d.</p> <p>For the Obama administration, addressing these realities has been a multi-year challenge. The Affordable Care Act contains language that bars any insurer or healthcare provider receiving health department assistance \u2013 such as Medicaid reimbursement \u2013 from discriminating against patients based on their gender identity. Still, reports have abounded of insurers and healthcare refusing service to trans people. Amid these complaints, the health department in September 2015 proposed a new rule stating explicitly that transgender people were protected from bias. The rule was finalized this May.</p> <p>More than a dozen other states have taken similar actions, advising insurance companies that state anti-discrimination laws protect trans people in healthcare settings. California prohibits discrimination by law. </p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit is spearheaded by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a conservative legal action group that successfully argued Hobby Lobby v Burwell before the supreme court. In that case, the group targeted a different Affordable Care Act provision, one which required private sector employers to offer contraceptive coverage in their employees\u2019 healthcare plans. The supreme court ruled 5-4 that some employers could refuse the coverage if it violated their religious beliefs.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cNo doctor should be forced to perform a procedure that he or she believes will harm a child,\u201d Lori Windham, senior counsel for the Becket Fund, said Tuesday. \u201cDecisions on a child\u2019s medical treatment should be between families and their doctors, not dictated by politicians and government bureaucrats.\u201d</p>",

From the outset, residents raised concerns that the new water source was causing a spate of rashes and hair loss.</p> <p>\u201cThe rashes Flint residents have reported are of great concern to the community and to all of us who are working to improve health in the city,\u201d said Dr Nicole Lurie, the federal department of health and human services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, in a statement on Tuesday.</p> <p>The results could inflame tensions among residents who have been rankled by the city\u2019s two-year water crisis. The decision to switch to the Flint river, made when the city was operated by a state-appointed emergency manager, led to significant public health issues, after officials confirmed last fall that state environmental regulators failed to require the city to treat the river water with corrosion-control chemicals.</p> <p>The oversight has been linked to widespread lead contamination in the city, and, potentially, an outbreak of legionnaires\u2019 disease, which led to 12 deaths in and around Flint.</p> <p>For months, state health officials told Flint residents that it was safe to bathe in the city\u2019s water and that <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/01/27/bathing-flint-water-rash-uptick/79422326/\">\u201cno scientific link\u201d</a> existed to connect the Flint river to rashes.

Dr Walter Barkey, a local dermatologist who volunteered to assist with the investigation, said those residents had a \u201cvery heightened level of concern\u201d about the city\u2019s current water quality. </p> <p>More than 77% of respondents reported that symptoms began when they noticed changes in water quality from their faucet. Half of the respondents reported rash aggravation from the water or through bathing.</p> <p>Researchers cautioned in a presentation that water samples from homes of the 390 participants in the investigation were not available for the period in which Flint\u2019s river was the city\u2019s main water source. Still, the study reviewed data from Flint\u2019s water treatment plant when the local river was used and found fluctuations in the river water\u2019s pH, chlorine and hardness were, at times, \u201chigher during that period and might have led to rashes\u201d, a news release about the study stated.</p> <p>Since Flint returned to its previous water source in October 2015, 44% of participants experienced an onset of rashes. But the water supply from Lake Huron doesn\u2019t contain metals and minerals at levels known to be associated with skin problems, according to the study, and nothing has been identified that could be associated with hair loss.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/04/obama-drinks-flint-water-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4tpqb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2498996\"            data-video-name=\"Obama drinks Flint water to show residents that it's safe \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572a7198e4b00455bdea3c1d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/04/160504obamawater_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/04/160504obamawater.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/04/160504obamawater_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477854&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/04/160504obamawater_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/04/obama-drinks-flint-water-video\">Obama drinks Flint water to show residents that it\u2019s safe</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The combination of stress from the water crisis and changes in personal care routines \u2013 80% of respondents reported changing their bathing habits \u2013 could have led to, or exacerbated, the rashes, according to the study.</p> <p>Health officials advised residents still dealing with rashes or hair loss to visit a doctor for possible referral to a dermatologist.</p> <p>\u201cWe concur that the water quality testing performed on current water was quite comprehensive and did not find any abnormality that could cause or worsen rashes or hair loss,\u201d Barkey said in a statement. \u201cWe also concur that the marked fluctuations in pH, hardness, and chlorine while the Flint river was the water source could really explain the most common type of rash found in the study which was eczema.\u201d</p> <p>The interview respondents ranged from one to 93 years old, with a median age of 51.

He appears to like them.</p> <p>Now, having pledged the impossible \u2013 ending crime and corruption nationwide within six months \u2013 Mr Duterte is in a hurry.

One father and son were shot dead after grabbing an officer\u2019s gun, officials said.

They included <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2793419.stm\" title=\"\">a nine-year-old boy shot dead as police chased his mother</a>. Thailand\u2019s drug trade has proved resilient.</p> <p>Such drives inevitably claim innocent lives and kill users as well as dealers. But the core objection is simply that no one should die like&#xa0;this. Extrajudicial executions undermine the rule of law. They make a country less safe, not more.</p> <p>Senators are investigating the killings, but&#xa0;so far Mr Duterte\u2019s stance appears highly popular \u2013 reflecting the toll that crime and violence has taken on Philippine society and the failure of the political class to get to grips with them. The US and others have expressed&#xa0;deep concern, but rights campaigners warn that it is hard to see an end&#xa0;in sight unless the US and EU nations make it clear that continuing will result in economic and diplomatic penalties.

The punishment was significantly less severe than the minimum prison time of two years prescribed by state law for his felony offenses, and advocates across the US said the decision did not reflect the seriousness of college sexual assault.</p> <p>After Turner\u2019s case sparked a national <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/07/stanford-sexual-assault-victims-few-options-recourse\">debate about sexual violence</a>, Persky has faced a high-profile recall campaign and intense scrutiny of past and ongoing cases.</p> <p>Critics have argued that Persky, a Stanford alumnus and former college athlete, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/stanford-sexual-assault-judge-aaron-persky-de-anza-college\">repeatedly failed</a> to hold sex offenders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/01/sexual-assault-case-brock-turner-judge-aaron-persky\">domestic abusers</a> accountable.

Records of more than a dozen similar cases in the same county showed that other judges routinely ordered six months behind bars for defendants convicted of the same felony of possessing child abuse images.</p> <p>Eleven other judges all gave six-month sentences for similar cases since 2012, according to research by the recall campaign. </p> <p>Chain had also requested that the judge reduce the felony to a misdemeanor charge, and records show that when he finalized a plea deal, Persky said he \u201cwould be receptive\u201d to this downgrade after one year of Chain successfully complying with probation rules.</p> <p>The local district attorney\u2019s office, which prosecuted the Stanford sexual assault case, said it opposed that reduction, and a hearing on the matter was scheduled for 25 August.</p> <p>But on Thursday, one week after the Chain case made <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a211d47546d34f9480a8ade0ba680f75/stanford-sex-assault-judge-make-another-sex-crime-ruling\">headlines</a>, Persky \u201cabruptly\u201d notified lawyers in both cases that he would be stepping aside with the brief ruling citing publicity and a \u201cpersonal family situation\u201d, according to the East Bay Times. The newspaper said that local judge Kenneth Barnum will take over the case with a new hearing on 6 October.</p> <p>Stanford law professor Michele Landis Dauber, who is leading the recall campaign, applauded Persky\u2019s recusal, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a relief that he won\u2019t be hearing this case, because his sentence in the first place was dramatically out of step \u2026 with the sentences any other judge in the county would\u2019ve given.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe think that he is clearly biased in the area of sex crimes and domestic violence,\u201d she added. <strong> <br></strong></p> <p>Terry Harman, assistant district attorney, said prosecutors are moving forward with the case under the new judge. </p> <p>\u201cIt is a judge\u2019s responsibility to recuse him or herself if there are issues of impartiality.

Like your contributor, I was a poor advertisement for my school at level 2. I failed physics O-level with (for my excellent school) a record low score that astounded my teacher; wisely, I was asked to give up chemistry a year before the exam; two years ahead of the test I was told biology was not for me (my dissecting skills were deficient); I was overwhelmed with joy at my grade D in what was then called elementary maths, albeit taking a year longer than most of my contemporaries who did it a year early and then passed advanced maths. I managed Latin at the second attempt. English, geography and history were successes, French a rather poor showing, and art was frankly dire.</p> <p>There were no A* grades then, so I ended up with something well below a half-decent Ebacc by virtue of too few passes in not enough subjects to go into the right \u201cbuckets\u201d to score as more than a very mediocre prospect. Then came three A-levels which set me free; I went to university, and from there into an academic career on the strength of my only degree. I think I did alright in 40 years of teaching, making it to department head and faculty dean, but at 16 I was pretty well a write-off by today\u2019s standard, despite having none of the disadvantages so many of the pupils in the school described are contending with.</p> <p>As your headteacher says, \u201csometimes kids need more than one go at a test\u201d.

Second attempts should of course count (they show determination), and more than that the right to request second marking should not be decided by the exam board on the basis of whether it thinks there is a case.</p> <p>Perhaps the most depressing feature of the \u201cSecret headteacher\u201d article is its anonymity.

I too went to a grammar school, in 1953. The alternative was a secondary modern school with a decidedly rough reputation, and therefore my school career certainly enhanced my life chances. However, it could not disguise the facts that most of the 150 intake at my grammar school then was predominantly composed of middle-class boys and that, because many of the intake had been coached to pass the 11-plus, if you were not in the A, B or the top half of the C stream then you would come out with few or no GCEs. The one concession was to offer woodwork and metalwork given by staff who did not wear the ermine gowns a on speech day: a true badge of rank.</p> <p>Since 2010 in particular, children have been let down by a regime of tinkering with the education system, spending vast sums on academies and free schools and now looking backwards, whether it be selection or a sterile grammar-ridden curriculum redolent of the last century.

Despite high levels of deprivation, London\u2019s children now consistently outperform their peers at key stage 2 and GCSE, and London has the highest percentage of schools in the country that are good or outstanding.</p> <p>This hasn\u2019t always been the case. Schemes like the London Challenge, established by the last Labour government, played a key role in the transformation by focusing on the quality of leadership, teaching and learning, and providing much needed new funding.</p> <p>Thanks to the huge progress that has been made in education across London, children growing up here from poorer backgrounds are much more likely to achieve good results than anywhere else. It is essential that the funding that has made this possible is protected.</p> <p>If Theresa May meant anything on the steps of No 10 when she spoke of standing up for the many, not just the privileged few, she should look to London rather than selective areas where the opposite is the case.<br><strong>Catherine West MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Hornsey &amp; Wood Green; secretary, all-party parliamentary group on London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Setting aside the ethical arguments against grammar schools for a moment, there are at least three critical issues that argue against their reintroduction and in favour of their abolition. First is the lack of an evidence base for the frequent claims that clever children from deprived backgrounds, or indeed any socioeconomic background, benefit from attendance at a grammar school as against a comprehensive. Certainly the parents in Solihull a few years ago took a different view when the controlling Tory group on the council proposed reintroduction, with disastrous electoral consequences for the Tories. Second, there is the issue of the fluctuating size and ability of year groups which means that, with fixed grammar school places, able children in a large year group will be denied a place whereas less able children from a smaller year group will gain a place. Similarly, less able children in a \u201cclever\u201d year group will be denied a place which they may well have won in a less able year group. This fundamental unfairness undermines all pro-grammar arguments. Thirdly, the number and proportion of places at grammar schools varies widely as between local authorities, which is likely to remain the case if they are reintroduced and which creates yet more inescapable systemic unfairness. <br><strong>Roy Boffy</strong><br><em>Sutton Coldfield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Once can sense the the exasperation felt by Fiona Millar in having to face yet again the same old arguments for grammar schools. Even where there is \u201csomeone whose life was apparently transformed by a grammar school\u201d, that still does not prevent the discrimination against pupils at grammar schools from working class homes who are less likely to go on to Oxbridge and therefore detract from the school\u2019s performance image, as I know from my personal experience.</p> <p>Fiona Millar hits the nail on the head when she reminds us that \u201cno one is campaigning to bring back\u201d the secondary modern schools. Frankly, I will only be impressed by the pressures for grammar schools when there are also petitions to bring back these schools. Dividing children at the school gate through an unreliable examination at 11-plus is simply divisive educationally, socially and between siblings.<br><strong>Michael Meadowcroft</strong><br><em>Leeds </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Liz Truss, the secretary of state for justice, appears set on confrontation with Muslim prisoners (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/jails-imprisoned-islamist-extremists-ghost-liz-truss\" title=\"\">Prison \u2018ghost train\u2019 plan to foil terror plotting</a>, 23 August). What is overlooked is that most prison conversions result not from \u201cextremist\u201d influence but from the fact that Islam provides a clear concept of brotherhood and solidarity in an otherwise gang-ridden environment. You\u2019d think the prospect of a coherent alternative to jail drug culture would be welcome.</p> <p>Ghosting has long been known to cause psychological damage. It\u2019s also been used as a way of keeping vocal prisoners away from prison inspectors. Ghosting disrupts the maintenance of family ties. In 2002 Paul Day killed himself after being moved for the 35th&#xa0;time.</p> <p>Ghosting as a practice was condemned by Human Rights Watch as far back as 1992. Yet the government intends to specifically target a group of prisoners with ghosting as a strategy. Ghosting used to be something that happened but senior prison and Home Office staff would pretend to be appalled&#xa0;by. Now we have a minister embracing it as policy.<br><strong>Nick Moss</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It was disappointing this week to hear&#xa0;the justice secretary say she still intends to scrap the Human Rights Act because doing so was a manifesto pledge (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/22/uk-bill-of-rights-will-not-be-scrapped-says-liz-truss\" title=\"\">UK bill of rights will not be scrapped, says Liz Truss</a>, 23 August). That despite the fact that the prime minister has ruled out withdrawal from the European convention on human rights, making any interference with legislation here at best little more than a rebrand, and at worst legally illiterate.</p> <p>At the end of last year Amnesty commissioned YouGov polling which found that scrapping the Human Rights Act was not something the British public wanted to see as a government priority, with 89% of adults omitting it from what they thought should be the top three government priorities. In addition, the vast majority of people (67%) felt that it shouldn\u2019t be up to politicians to pick and choose which rights we get, and who gets them. There is every reason to think that public scepticism remains unchanged under the current government.</p> <p>Surely Liz Truss and her colleagues have enough on their plates without this stubborn determination to plough on with ripping up the Human Rights Act regardless of the myriad difficulties it entails, especially just months after it helped bring the Hillsborough families closer to the justice they were so long denied and when scrapping it poses the very real danger of threatening the fragile peace in Northern Ireland.<br><strong>Rachel Logan</strong><br><em>Legal programme director, Amnesty UK </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

A friend of mine rang me in the late 1990s to ask if I knew of an excuse that might exempt him from such a task. We were drinking buddies and so I guessed that if he claimed he was an alcoholic it might do the trick. Surprisingly, it did and he was never troubled again. At around the same time I received a jury summons and, being a retired member of an organisation that had publicly been deemed institutionally racist, I thought it unfair for my alleged tendencies to be tested on defendants, and asked to be excused. The reply ordered me to attend the court and appear before a judge in chambers. Wigless, and with only the clerk for company, the judge asked why I thought I was racist. I told him of my antecedents and confirmed that I found some racist jokes funny, particularly one involving a plane crash in Dublin. I was directed to recount it. He seemed mildly amused&#xa0;and said: \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot funnier than that.

  "<p>His dark hair was neat, his moustache and beard impeccably trimmed. His shirt was high-collared and spotlessly white. He sat at the head of the table with a calm, composed mien.</p> <p>It was the first time that the world has seen Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Husayn, also known as Abu Zubaydah, since his capture in Pakistan 14 years ago. He is one of three men that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/oct/16/cia-torture-water-dousing-waterboard-like-technique\">CIA admits it waterboarded</a> at an unknown prison in Thailand.</p> <p>But during the publicly open portion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/cia-torture-9-11-abu-zubaydah-guantanamo-bay\">a quasi-parole hearing</a> to consider his release from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/15/guantanamo-bay-tour-detainees-obama-administration\">the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay</a>, there was no mention of the torture endured by the 45-year-old Palestinian, who has never been charged with a crime.</p> <p>There was, however, a black eyepatch hanging around his neck. Abu Zubaydah lost sight in one eye some time after he was taken into custody in disputed circumstances. On Tuesday, he could be seen occasionally swapping one pair of spectacles for another as he read documents about his case.</p> <p>Such hearings have become increasingly frequent as Barack Obama, frustrated by Congress, wages a war of attrition to shut down Guant\u00e1namo through prisoner transfers. From a peak population of 684 inmates in 2003, the total is now down to 61, 20 of whom have been approved for transfer.</p> <p>But Abu Zubaydah, with his deep knowledge of CIA torture, poses potentially the biggest hurdle yet on that particular route. <a href=\"http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/faculty/bio_joe_margulies.cfm\">Joe Margulies</a>, one of his lawyers, described the multi-agency <a href=\"http://www.prs.mil/Review-Information/Initial-Review/\">periodic review board</a> hearing as \u201cjust a formality, a ritual\u201d, adding: \u201cAbu Zubaydah will not be released.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0a45ef8b65b6f89bb8e257071044a7d3f28e455\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0a45ef8b65b6f89bb8e257071044a7d3f28e455/0_71_2136_2669/800.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Zubaydah\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, a Palestinian known as Abu Zubaydah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MCT via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first 10 minutes of proceedings were transmitted live from Guant\u00e1namo to journalists and representatives of legal and human rights watchdogs in a sealed room at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. After a brief technical hitch, a TV screen showed a room with a plain white wall and black shiny table.</p> <p>Anyone walking in cold might have assumed that Abu Zubaydah, with the appearance of a doctor or lawyer, was chairing the meeting. To his left sat an interpreter, dressed casually in shirtsleeves, and to his right were two personal representatives in military uniform with papers before them. A counsel was unable to attend due to a family medical emergency. </p> <p>Abu Zubaydah sat impassive, expressionless and silent throughout, sometimes resting his head on his hand or putting a finger to his mouth or chin, and studying his detainee profile intently as it was read aloud by an unseen woman. He played a \u201ckey role\u201d in al-Qaida\u2019s communications with supporters and operatives abroad in the 1990s, it said, and closely interacted with its second-in-command at the time, Abu Hafs al-Masri.</p> <p>Abu Zubaydah \u201cpossibly\u201d had some advanced knowledge of the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and the USS Cole bombing in 2000, the profile continued. He was also \u201cgenerally aware\u201d of the impending 9/11 attacks and \u201cpossibly coordinated\u201d the training at Khaldan camp of two of the hijackers.</p> <p>He \u201cmost actively plotted attacks against Israel, enlisting operatives from various militant groups, including al-Qaida, to conduct operations in Israel and against Israeli interests abroad. He was convicted in absentia by the Jordanian government for his role in planning attacks against Israeli, Jordanian and western targets during the millennium time frame in Jordan.\u201d</p> <p>The document also said that, following 9/11, Abu Zubaydah sent operatives to al-Qaida senior member Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to discuss the feasibility of exploding a radiological device in the United States, and supporting remote-controlled bomb attacks against US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.</p> <p>But since his arrival at Guant\u00e1namo in 2006, it continued, Abu Zubaydah has shown \u201ca high level of cooperation\u201d with staff and served as a cell block leader, assuming responsibility for communicating detainees\u2019 messages and grievances to the staff and maintaining order among them.</p> <p>He \u201cprobably retains an extremist mindset\u201d, it argued, but \u201chas not made such statements recently, probably to improve his chances for repatriation\u201d. He has condemned atrocities perpetrated by Islamic State and the killing of innocent people. </p> <p>One of the personal representatives then read out an opening statement on behalf of Abu Zubaydah, saying he \u201chas expressed a desire to be reunited with his family and begin the process of recovering from injuries he sustained during his capture. He has some seed money that could be used to start a business after he is reintegrated into society and is living a peaceful life.\u201d</p> <p>He \u201chas stated that he has no desire or intent to harm the United States or any other country, and he has repeatedly said that the Islamic State is out of control and has gone too far,\u201d it added.<br></p> <p>With that, and no reference to waterboarding or torture, the cameras were switched off ahead of a classified section of the hearing likely to last some hours. A decision from the board on whether Abu Zubaydah is eligible for transfer is expected in about 30 days. The CIA has said he ought to be held incommunicado until he dies.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/faculty/bio_joe_margulies.cfm\">Margulies</a>, a professor at Cornell Law School, who was not present, expressed pessimism. \u201cIt\u2019s all show, it\u2019s all theatre,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line. Since Barack Obama took office, there is no one more different \u2013 who they thought he was and who he is \u2013 than Abu Zubaydah. He has done nothing that authorises his continued detention. It is morally and legally unjustified.\u201d</p> <p>Abu Zubaydah was a human guinea pig for the CIA torture regimen drawn up by contractor psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, now facing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/cia-torture-survivors-sue-psychologists-aclu\">federal lawsuit</a> brought by later victims. Initially thought to possess vital information on al-Qaida and its plots, Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times, kept awake, held naked and forced into a wooden box little bigger than a coffin.</p> <p>He now describes himself as a \u201cbroken man\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/faculty/bio_joe_margulies.cfm\">Margulies</a> added. \u201cI once had hopes that the US would have a thoughtful, fair examination of Abu Zubaydah\u2019s torture but no longer because of the lengths this administration has gone to protect the CIA.\u201d</p> <p>Kat Cosgrove, a national security team associate at Human Rights First, was present at Tuesday\u2019s Pentagon viewing. \u201cI personally think they should have made mention of the torture he suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cIt played such a part in his detention and why we know his name. To not discuss it is an intentional oversight on the part of the government and I think it should have at least been noted.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cBeing held for as long as he\u2019s been held without charge is a problem. It\u2019s a problem with a number of detainees at Guant\u00e1namo. That\u2019s why this process is so important.\u201d</p> <p>The number of periodic review board hearings has \u201cincreased dramatically\u201d from one or two a month to two per week, Cosgrove noted. \u201cWe have been advocating for such an increase. It\u2019s part of the plan to ultimately close the detention facility.\u201d<br></p> <p>That the goal can be achieved before Obama leaves office in January remains highly doubtful. But his press secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Monday: \u201cThe president is still aiming to close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay by the end of his term.\u201d</p>",

Cold-heartedness is harder to make a case for. Many of them are qualities that businessmen and women are admired for \u2013 ruthlessness, charisma, dishonesty, a lack of concern about the future. It has been a commonplace for years to note that psychopaths and highly successful people in business share a lot of characteristics. It is only relatively recently that this has become a field of academic inquiry \u2013 Joel Bakan, law professor at the University of British Columbia, and Jonathan Aldred, an economics fellow at Cambridge, have started to delve into the social effects of a corporate world that doesn\u2019t just accept amorality but positively valorises it.

(Only psychiatrists sign up to this; psychologists don\u2019t, possibly with the defence that their diagnoses have less consequence \u2013 they couldn\u2019t have you sectioned without a doctor, for instance.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-campaign-news-polls-kellyanne-conway\">Trump manager says 'undercover voters' will deliver win in US election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, if we can turn a blind eye to that and pile in, with Trump I have always found the narcissism diagnosis more convincing. Simon Baron-Cohen, who developed the empathy quotient test, makes the distinction between cognitive empathy (you find it easy to intuit what other people are feeling) and affective empathy (you can\u2019t guess what other people are feeling, but when you know, you feel it too). People with autism score very high on affective empathy and low on cognitive empathy, and people with psychopathy are the opposite; put simply, they can read people easily but don\u2019t care about them. Donald Trump seems to lack any qualities of perceptiveness or insight that would allow him to read other people, even for nefarious purposes, and in that has the classic stamp of the high narcissist.

  "<p>Most of today\u2019s social media platforms allow users to project glossy, well-lit and edited versions of themselves to an extended group of acquaintances. Perfect selfies, latte art and <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fitspo\">#fitspo</a> crowd out the more mundane nuts and bolts of life.</p> <p>Real-time formats, such as Facebook Live, Periscope and Meerkat, peel away a layer of artifice.

(Fortunately not <em tabindex=\"-1\">too</em> intimate.)</p> <p>A key challenge for Facebook Live and the rest of the live-streaming services, however, is that not everyone wants to broadcast their activities to hundreds of friends and acquaintances. It\u2019s something Vadim Lavrusik, the former product manager of Facebook Live, is all too aware of. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s raw and unfiltered, so it\u2019s really intimidating for a lot of people who associate it with live TV; they think they have to perform,\u201d explained the 30-year-old over a cup of Blue Bottle Coffee in San Francisco. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t actually want to broadcast, but they would want to narrowcast with their closest social circle.\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s that insight, gleaned from his time launching Facebook Live, that led Lavrusik to co-found Alively, a one-to-few video sharing platform, which debuts in the App Store today.</p> <p>Alively is a smartphone app that makes it easy to share live and recorded video with a small group of family members or friends. It\u2019s super simple to use. You open up the app, give your video a title and invite people from your contacts to watch (provided they have the app too). Those invited to watch receive a notification to join the stream and can add comments in real time. The person filming can also add and remove people while the recording is taking place.</p> <p>For those not wanting to stream live, Alively also makes it easy to share pre-recorded clips of any length. The videos are stored to the cloud, so they don\u2019t clog up the user\u2019s phone memory, and users can also upload any other clips they have stored on their device.</p> <p>Lavrusik, a former Mashable and New York Times journalist, says that if Instagram is the digital equivalent of the traditional family photo album, then he wants Alively to be your camcorder. \u201cPeople have traditionally kept home video for a very long time on cassette tapes. There\u2019s nothing out there that\u2019s like home video,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lavrusik realized there was a need for a product like Alively when he shared a Facebook Live video of his two young sons playing in a paddling pool in his back yard naked. By that time he had a large Facebook audience of friends, acquaintances and followers (he currently has more than 200,000 followers of his profile), so a lot of people saw the broadcast.</p> <p>\u201cThere were three comments from different friends telling me \u2018they\u2019re going to be so mad when they\u2019re older\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with sharing with lots of people.\u201d</p> <p>The other problem Alively wants to address is how to send large video files to friends from your smartphone. Email typically has an upper limit on file size, while text messaging typically compresses files so they appear in lower resolution. It\u2019s a hurdle Lavrusik came up against when he wanted to share a five-minute video of his son\u2019s birthday party with his family. He ended up using Dropbox, but says that the \u201clittle flicker of frustration\u201d was enough to show there was a gap in the market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/17/live-streaming-violent-events-crisis-facebook\">The unpredictable course of live streaming has caught us unprepared</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The quality of the live video is noticeably good, thanks to Alively\u2019s patent-pending streaming technology which avoids lowering bitrate when there\u2019s a poor internet connection. Most other live video platforms, including Facebook Live, use the RTMP streaming protocol, which requires a continuous and strong connection to the internet otherwise the bitrate is lowered and the image becomes grainy.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re optimizing for quality of video because people are using this as a way to capture memories and moments. And when they look back on those memories and watch them, they want the quality to be good,\u201d Lavrusik said.</p> <p>Lavrusik says that In beta testing the app has been popular among high schoolers and young mothers. The former because they are typically more private than millennials, prefer to share video than text and typically have phones with a lower storage capacity. The latter tend to capture a lot of videos of their little darlings they want to share with their families.</p> <p>Alively is co-founded by Ray Lee and Vincent Tuscano, who had previously launched and sold a fan community engagement startup with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/21/shaun-king-black-lives-matter-activist-race-allegations\">Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King</a>. The company is funded to the tune of $800,000 in seed investment from Greylock (through the Discovery Fund, which makes seed investments), SV Angel and Alex Ok, the founder of fashion brand Forever 21.</p> <p>SV Angel general partner Kevin Carter was drawn to the live sharing aspect of Alively. \u201cThis could be the pixie dust that gets people interested and using the app, but there could be a lot more utility beneath that in some of the asynchronous use cases, such as storage,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Storage is an area where Alively could generate revenue, along the lines of a Dropbox or iCloud service. However, for now Lavrusik is focusing on making a product people want to use.</p> <p>The challenge for Alively, as with all sharing apps, will be changing people\u2019s behaviour. \u201cWe live in a world now where if I want to send you a video or a picture we have 17 different ways \u2013 Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, iPhoto. We have so many ways and yet you get stuck,\u201d said Greylock\u2019s Josh Elman.</p> <p>\u201cIt has to be five or ten times better to send video through here than any other format to really get people to switch and do it the whole time. It needs to create a behavior and a network.\u201d</p> <p>Elman believes that the rise of private messaging is a strong indicator that there\u2019s an appetite for sharing intimate moments with smaller groups of people. \u201cGetting feedback from five people who matter is better than feedback from 50 strangers.\u201d</p> <p>Lavrusik agrees. \u201cWe want people to share everyday moments, not just the highlights. A lot of the time there will only be a few people who care about them.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The latest salvo in the national debate about transgender rights was fired yesterday by US district judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Texas, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/22/obama-transgender-students-public-schools-rules-blocked\">granted an injunction</a> against the federal government\u2019s guidance on allowing transgender students access to the bathroom based on their gender identity. What has been lost in the lawsuits and injunctions is the impact on real students. </p> <p>These students are not some abstract threat. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/science/transgender-children.html?_r=0\">hundreds of thousands</a> of transgender children in our nation\u2019s schools simply want to learn and be respected. But these young people were barely mentioned in O\u2019Connor\u2019s 38-page ruling \u2013 a ruling that ordered the Obama administration not to lift a finger to investigate discrimination against transgender students.</p> <p>It\u2019s a shame that O\u2019Connor probably hasn\u2019t met a transgender student like Skye Thomson. Skye is a high school sophomore from Eastern North Carolina. He told <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/the-view/news/view-news/clay-aiken-and-raven-symone-share-north-carolina-residents-perspectives-on-hb2-bill-on-the-view\">The View</a> in June that he has been afraid to use public bathrooms since his home state\u2019s anti-transgender bathroom law passed. His birth certificate still lists him as female, but he has lived as a boy for years. Skye\u2019s mom was heartbroken, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating. This is my kid.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from ignoring the impact on students, the ruling also failed to mention that it was actually educators, including the National Association of Secondary School Principals, who asked the administration to issue its recent guidance on how to best accommodate transgender students. There was also no hint that the federal guidance, or any of the hundreds of existing state and local policies it was based on, had caused any harm to anyone. That\u2019s why 13 states filed an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-leads-multi-state-effort-supporting-transgender-protections\">amicus brief</a> telling the court that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 predicted safety harm has never materialized\u201d, and that all privacy concerns were easily addressed.</p> <p>While the politicians who filed this case claim the education department is making up law, it\u2019s in fact O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling that lacks legal precedent, not to mention human compassion. Students like Skye are being scapegoated by fearmongering politicians simply because of who they are. More than a dozen federal courts have ruled that federal anti-sex-discrimination laws, such as the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/overview-title-ix-education-amendments-1972-20-usc-1681-et-seq\">Title IX education law</a>, protect transgender people. And just because O\u2019Connor wrote in his decision that \u201cit cannot be disputed that the plain meaning of the term sex\u201d is limited to \u201canatomical differences\u201d, that doesn\u2019t make it true. In fact, the supreme court disputed that meaning in 1989, when it ruled that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on gender stereotypes.</p> <p>The issue of how to best treat transgender students is new to many people. But it\u2019s not new to schools around the country that have been supporting students like Skye for years. They know that there is nothing to be afraid of here. Anyone who has used a public restroom has shared one with a transgender person, and likely never knew it. But when transgender students are discriminated against and forced to use a separate bathroom, there are real harms. Their classmates see them walking past the communal bathrooms down the hall to the lone single-user toilet. To them, the school itself is saying something is wrong with this child.</p> <p>When transgender people, young or old, fear that they won\u2019t be able to do something as simple as use a restroom that reflects who they are, the consequences are serious. Our organization surveyed nearly 28,000 transgender people last year. Well over half reported they had avoided using a public restroom out of fear of harassment. Nearly a third had limited their food and water intake because of this fear. And thousands reported medical issues such as bladder or kidney infections from \u201cholding it\u201d \u2013 all because they could not access an appropriate restroom.</p> <p>Most schools are already getting this right, and more are learning every day about the importance of supporting transgender students. One soon-to-be-appealed ruling from a single judge won\u2019t change that much needed progress towards acceptance and respect. </p> <ul> <li>This article was changed on 24 August 2016.

  "<p>Just two days after Frank Ocean\u2019s Blonde, one of the biggest releases of the year, was released on Apple\u2019s iTunes, Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group and widely regarded as the most powerful executive in the music industry, has reportedly ordered the company\u2019s labels to stop the practice of making \u201cexclusive\u201d distribution deals with streaming services.<br></p> <p>According to Bob Lefsetz, author of an influential music industry <a href=\"http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/\">newsletter</a>, Grainge sent out a company-wide email on Monday. <a href=\"http://www.universalmusic.com/company/\">UMG</a>, which boasted seven of 2015\u2019s 10 best-selling albums and 38.5% of the year\u2019s recorded-music sales, will be the first major label to ban the practice, which many feel has begun to diminish rather than enhance the way music is distributed and consumed. </p> <p>The directive will affect dozens of bands under the UMG umbrella, including all five of this year\u2019s album of the year Grammy nominees: Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, the Weeknd, Chris Stapleton and Alabama Shakes. </p> <p>The practice of artists offering exclusives to competing streaming and download services, including Apple and Tidal, has been gaining traction this year. Both Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna launched their recent albums through Tidal, the streaming service part-owned by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s husband, Jay Z. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/19/frank-ocean-endless-review-brilliantly-confounding\">Frank Ocean: Endless first-listen review \u2013 brilliantly confounding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ultra-hyped Frank Ocean release coming exclusively through Apple, coupled with a <a href=\"http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-signs-game-changing-label-deal-cash-money-records/\">deal announced earlier this month</a> between Apple and Cash Money Records, whose artists include Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Young Money and Birdman, appears to have been sufficient to provoke label executives to action. </p> <p>Lefsetz, like many others in the business, believes making exclusive distribution deals is anti-competitive and ultimately harms the consumer and the artist.</p> <p>He says the Cupertino hardware giant whose music arm, Apple Music, is steered by former Universal head Jimmy Iovine, should be investigated by the government over anti-trust concerns \u201cbecause there\u2019s a conspiracy between Apple Music and the industry to change the game, to get everybody to pay for a subscription by putting hit content behind a paywall\u201d.<br></p> <p>But, he continues, the truth is few care. \u201cMost people don\u2019t give a crap about the new Frank Ocean album. We\u2019ve got an industry that promotes marginal products that appeal to few and makes them unavailable to most people? That\u2019s hysterical!\u201d</p> <p>Unhappiness over Apple\u2019s exclusive control of the Frank Ocean release comes a year after Taylor Swift wrote an open letter to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, finding it to be \u201cshocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company\u201d that the firm was refusing to pay artists streaming revenue during its free, three-month trial period. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/apple-royalties-u-turn-is-taylor-swift-the-most-powerful-woman-in-music\">Apple ultimately backed down</a>.</p> <p>Previously, Apple had been forced into an embarrassing apology after loading half a billion Apple iTunes users with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/09/u2-songs-of-innocence-itunes-customers-free-album\">latest U2 album</a> during an iPhone launch.

For some artists, the war for subscribers has proved highly profitable even if, as many argue, the services ultimately serve to restrict rather than enhance broader consumer appeal. </p> <p>Last year, Apple paid the Canadian rapper Drake a reported $19m for an exclusive deal \u2013 a figure Apple has since disputed \u2013 to steal him away from signing with Jay Z\u2019s Tidal. \u201cI think that\u2019s just his competitive nature, and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s looking at the bigger picture: that it\u2019s not about me and it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about the future of the music business,\u201d Jay Z later said of Iovine. </p> <p>But as the battle for artists, especially those from the hip-hop/R&amp;B world, heats up, can Grainge \u2013 recently named the music business\u2019s most powerful executive \u2013 or any other label rival hope to compete? </p> <p>\u201cUpfront money talks,\u201d points out one former record company head, cautioning that the deals work for the streaming services but not necessarily for artists and labels. </p> <p>But with industry leader Spotify competing against the deep-pocketed tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon, hungry for market share, the stage is set for a new showdown over control as streaming becomes the dominant means of distribution.</p> <p>To Lefsetz, exclusives represent a misreading of the market that will ultimately alienate consumers. \u201cApple Music is a me-too product that works badly that\u2019s locked behind a paywall and the music industry wants it to be the dominant platform so the fan is squeezed and indie acts are pushed down to the bottom where they belong.\u201d</p> <p>But as the music industry awaits confirmation that UMG is pulling out of streaming exclusives, Lefsetz is also taking artists who sign exclusive distribution deals to task. </p> <p>\u201cShame on you Frank, and shame on everybody else who takes money from Apple and screws fans. There\u2019s enough money in music without taking every last buck, and the joke is on you, for thinking so short term, you want your music available to everybody, because in these days of information overload we need nobody, everybody is superfluous, you don\u2019t want to enter the marketplace with one hand tied behind your back,\u201d he wrote.</p>",
  "<p>What do gay women do in the bedroom? It is a conundrum, I have found, that seems to weigh heavily on many an inquiring heterosexual mind. Who makes the bed, for example? Who folds the laundry? Who pulls out the drill to hang a picture? </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/pr_am_2016_quadlin_news_release_final.pdf\">new study</a>, presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association, found that when it comes to same-sex couples, most Americans believe the \u201cmore masculine\u201d partner and the \u201cmore feminine\u201d partner should be responsible for stereotypically male and female chores. The study also found that people were more likely to consider there to be a distinct \u201cman\u201d and a \u201cwoman\u201d in lesbian relationships than they were when it came to gay male couples. Probably, you know, because the idea of there being no male presence at all in a relationship is utterly unfathomable. </p> <p>I\u2019ve spent most of my relationship years in same-sex relationships. During this time many a moron has asked me \u201cwho is the man?\u201d Normally I have ignored these people. However, this study made me rethink my views. If there\u2019s a way to get out of doing the cooking and cleaning, I\u2019m interested. And if that means having to proclaim yourself \u201cthe man\u201d in a relationship, then so be it. </p> <p>But how does one even figure out who the more feminine or masculine person in a relationship is? Physical appearance is obviously a major factor in how people initially pigeonhole you. Interestingly, however, the ASA study didn\u2019t touch on physical appearance at all. Rather it asked people to look at vignettes describing fictional couples. The study introduced stereotypically gendered traits via interests (for example, a preference for action movies versus romcoms) and then asked participants to assign household chores to each couple. (It should be noted that the survey responses came from a nationally representative. These people were 92% heterosexual, so responses don\u2019t necessarily reflect how LGB people think.)</p> <p>For example, one of the vignettes concerned a couple called Amy and Jennifer. Respondents were told that Amy (a reporter) and Jennifer (a physical therapist) worked the same hours, but Jennifer makes more than double Amy\u2019s salary. On the weekend \u201cAmy usually wants to play basketball if they are going out, or watch an action movie if they are staying in. Instead, Jennifer would rather go shopping or watch a romantic comedy.\u201d Because she liked romcom and shopping, most people decided Jennifer was the woman in the relationship, which meant she did the stereotypically woman\u2019s work. </p> <p>So was I an Amy or a Jennifer? After considered analysis I decided my enthusiasm for the Fast and the Furious franchise made me more of an Amy. But what about my girlfriend? Could she be an Amy too? How would sociology deal with that? I promptly texted my girlfriend with the Amy/Jennifer preferred-activity quiz. \u201cI just really feel like I can\u2019t be defined in a multiple-choice format,\u201d she replied. This is typical of the way in which women can never give you a straight answer and a very Jennifer thing to say. Ergo, according to the court of heterosexual opinion, she should be doing more grocery shopping. Phew!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Research suggests that gay couples have more equal relationships  and share more childcare responsibilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The ASA isn\u2019t the first organisation to conduct a studly like this. Research suggests that same-sex couples have more <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/12/29/373835114/same-sex-couples-may-have-more-egalitarian-relationships\">equal relationships</a> than their heterosexual counterparts and share more childcare responsibilities. Nevertheless one person still tends to end up doing more of the chores. Indeed, a <a href=\"http://www.familiesandwork.org/downloads/modern-families.pdf\">2015 study</a> by the Families and Work Institute (FWI) found that there were only two household tasks in which same-sex couples were more likely to share responsibility than heterosexual couples: laundry (44% versus 31%) and household repair (33% versus 15%). However, there was no evidence to suggest gendered household responsibilities in same-sex couples had anything to do with one person choosing to roleplay \u201cthe man\u201d and one \u201cthe woman\u201d.</p> <p>When I quizzed a number of my gay friends about their allocation of household tasks in a highly scientific WhatsApp focus group, some noted that they\u2019ve sometimes found themselves slipping into stereotypically Amy/Jennifer situations. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve dated girly girls I find myself feeling more masculine, inclined to hold the door, pick up the check more, etc,\u201d noted H. \u201cI think gender roles are similar to sexuality,\u201d said M. \u201cIt\u2019s fluid and can change based on the person you are dating at the time.\u201d <br></p> <p>Sometimes your gender role can also change based on the task at hand. My friend V notes that she often jokingly plays up being the femme one in her relationship in order to avoid taking the garbage out.</p> <p>Ultimately I think Judith Butler had the last sensible word on all of this. \u201cGay is to straight not as copy is to original, but, rather, as copy is to copy,\u201d she famously wrote. In other words it doesn\u2019t matter where you are on the sexuality spectrum \u2013 all gender is performance. While some feminists have seen butch/femme dynamics as regressive \u2013 a misguided reflection of heterosexual norms \u2013 Butler views this performance as effectively unveiling just how constructed heterosexuals norms are in the first place. After all, once you start unpacking the mental process of figuring out who is best suited to take out the trash based on who\u2019d rather watch Fast 7 or Love Actually, it\u2019s hard not to realize that maybe the idea of \u201cfeminine\u201d chores and \u201cmasculine\u201d chores is really a lot of nonsense.</p> <p>There is still a huge <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/10/29/gender-chore-gap-where-housework-is-most-unfair/\">chore gap</a> in heterosexual America; one that has barely closed in the last 10 years. If housework is finally going to become more equally allocated among straight couples then perhaps the best thing for everyone to do would be to sit down with their partners and have a long discussion about whether they\u2019re an \u201cAmy\u201d or a \u201cJennifer\u201d. By the end even the most hardened essentialist might be convinced that gender isn\u2019t just a performance \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s a farce.</p>",

But the BBC sitcom is hugely popular, so it is no surprise that it topped a people\u2019s choice vote. The victory for Mulholland Drive among critics is more bemusing for this non-film critic.</p> <p>Polls such as these always deliver results that get people arguing. And that is about the only thing these latest chart-toppers have in common. The least I could do is re-assess David Lynch\u2019s 2001 movie from the perspective of an avid sitcom consumer.</p> <p>Mulholland Drive is a good film but it\u2019s no No 1. It is a visceral look at fame given a typically Lynchian non-linear twist. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/naomi-watts\">Naomi Watts</a> plays innocent Hollywood wannabe Betty Elms, <a href=\"http://gb.imdb.com/name/nm0005009/\">Laura Harring</a> plays the mysterious older woman, Rita, who befriends her. Their lives intertwine with other noirish storylines and characters and the result just about makes sense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5064f556ed5901b53a485841e9a6c35c7f67d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5064f556ed5901b53a485841e9a6c35c7f67d1/0_0_2785_1671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Watts and Laura Herring as Character(s): Betty Elms and Rita Film in Mulholland Drive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Watts and Laura Herring as Betty and Rita in Mulholland Drive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJust about\u201d is the key here. I have seen this movie described as a \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d, which is PR-speak for a film where nothing really happens and, if it does, it only confuses things. At one point, both Watts and Harring assume the identities of two different women. Why? Who knows. Apparently, scenes were originally shot for a television pilot but it was not broadcast, partly because of its non-narrative construction. For once some TV executives got it right.</p> <p>I can think of three Lynch films that are far superior, but were made before the millennium cut-off point \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/\">Eraserhead</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080678/\">The Elephant Man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090756/\">Blue Velvet</a> \u2013 and only one that is unquestionably inferior \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/\">Dune</a>. Even if this is the best film of the past 16 years, it isn\u2019t Lynch\u2019s best film.</p> <p>The main problem, though, is the nature of the poll. First, the timing seems arbitrary. Unless we really are heading for end of days \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=mrs%20brown%20boys&amp;src=tyah\">as Twitter users suggested</a> when they saw the Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys news \u2013 why vote now?</p> <p>As for the critics choosing this film, I suspect Mulholland Drive triumphed because the BBC Culture vote only polled film critics and film critics have loved films about Hollywood since <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043014/\">Sunset Boulevard</a> and beyond.</p> <p>I like my films like I like my sitcoms \u2013 I prefer them to make sense. With its non-sequiturs and dreamlike scenes, Mulholland Drive is frustratingly open to interpretation.

  "<p>A number of Celtic fans displayed Palestinian flags during their Champions League qualifier against Israeli club Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva last week. As a result Uefa began disciplinary proceedings against the club, a decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/celtic-fans-raise-45000-for-palestinian-charities-after-flag-protest\">sparked a fundraising appeal</a> set up by the Green Brigade supporters group to match the anticipated fine. </p> <p>Celtic fans around the world have now raised more than \u00a3100,000 for Palestinian charities. Supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/celtic-fans-have-you-donated-money-to-palestinian-charities\">who responded to our callout</a> are divided about whether the flag waving and fundraising has been a positive thing, or whether these are the actions of a self-serving minority who care little about the consequences their actions might have for the club. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/23/celtic-fans-warned-not-to-fly-palestinian-flags-at-match-in-israel\">Celtic fans warned not to fly Palestinian flags at match in Israel</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018This is a kick in the teeth for Uefa\u2019</h2> <p>I was at the game last week. Uefa were always going to sanction Celtic for this. We all knew that and a section of the support was unhappy that the club would be held responsible for actions out of their control. Uefa have no moral authority over any football fan and have zero credibility to anyone who loves the game.</p> <p>I believe that politics should not be left at the door, and am proud of the Green Brigade\u2019s stance on this and indeed most of their previous displays and protests. The great work they do at home specifically via Glasgow Food Banks should also be mentioned. Celtic IS more than a football club. This is a kick in the teeth for Uefa, who had hoped a fine would send us running for cover. Instead their stance has generated days and weeks of extra coverage, scrutiny and more importantly support and funds to help an oppressed people. <strong><em>Brian Glen</em></strong></p> <h2>\u2018I have seen the charitable ethos of our club and fans on numerous occasions\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s a disgrace to fine a club for its fans displaying a flag of what is supposed to be a member of Uefa. Whether you feel strongly or have no interest in the ongoing conflict, surely you can see this decision beggars belief.</p> <p>I have followed Celtic for nearly 30 years and have seen the charitable ethos of our club and fans on numerous occasions. In the past we\u2019ve had a collection for the Galician fisherman before a match against Celta Vigo after an oil spil in 2003, have displayed our support with a huge jersey to the fans and family of Benfica player Marcos Fehrer after he passed away on the pitch in 2006 and been proud of the way we have continually supported the Good Child Foundation in Thailand. But nothing has made me prouder than this show of solidarity with the Palestinian people. <strong><em>David Brown</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a330dadb1e14d339cb5820f539206dccc04eed72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a330dadb1e14d339cb5820f539206dccc04eed72/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celtic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers with Tomas Rogic after the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>The club should not be used as the Green Brigade\u2019s political football\u2019</h2> <p>The club is being held hostage by an ultra-political group of fans who have no regard for the consequences to the club. They have cost us \u00a3190,000 in fines in the last few years. By all means try raising money for charitable causes, but they should have thought about having a bucket collection at the game rather than causing the club even more grief. The club should not be used as the Green Brigade\u2019s political football. I\u2019ve no real problem with the cause, but they do not represent the views of all the fans at the club. <strong><em>Dan D</em></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/celtic-fans-raise-45000-for-palestinian-charities-after-flag-protest\">Celtic fans raise more than \u00a3100,000 for Palestinian charities after flag protest</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Celtic is about standing up for the rights of those who don\u2019t have a voice\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m not surprised about the sanction. We\u2019ve been fined several times and rightly so for letting off flares but, like in Reykjavik, this is different. This is highlighting the plight of an oppressed people. Celtic is all about standing up for the rights of those who don\u2019t have a voice and therefore I\u2019m now delighted by a Uefa fine that\u2019s only helped draw more attention to the human tragedy and showing how solidarity can force change.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to remember that this protest is not anti-Israel but pro-Palestine. A Uefa fine won\u2019t stop the momentum. I\u2019m immensly proud of the Green Brigade and Celtic fans across the globe.

The fact they were pre-warned and turned up in numbers anyway annoys me. Protesting before the game in a peaceful manner is okay, but keep it out of the stadium. I feel Uefa are justified in their disciplinary procedure. It shouldn\u2019t have taken a fine for a group so supportive of the cause to create a gofundme campaign. Why weren\u2019t they doing this in the first place? <strong><em>Anonymous</em></strong></p> <h2>\u2018The Green Brigade are not perfect but, let\u2019s be honest, who is?\u2019</h2> <p>Uefa pick and choose when they want to bring politics into football. A high-profile football match is the perfect place to highlight the wrongs in the world. Last week\u2019s game has just highlighted that with the amount of publicity that it had generated. Uefa fined Manchester City for booing their anthem which is ridiculous. I think they would like everyone to sit in their seats and be quiet for 90 minutes. The Green Brigade do a lot of charitable work, not just for Palestinian causes, but for a lot of other causes that go unnoticed and unpublished. They are not perfect but let\u2019s be honest, who is? <strong><em>John </em></strong></p> <h2>\u2018Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva are an excellent example of Jews and Arabs coexisting in Israel\u2019<br></h2> <p>Why should Israeli football players be subjected to this? They are not the government. Sport should be above politics. Celtic\u2019s opponents, Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva, are an excellent example of Jews and Arabs coexisting in Israel. The fans knew the consequences of their actions. They can raise money for what they like, but I don\u2019t understand why they needed the Champions League draw to inspire them. <strong><em>Lorenzo Porini</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb955c46d41f87a2390416ffd688cbf5a6766e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb955c46d41f87a2390416ffd688cbf5a6766e5/0_0_5472_3630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hapoel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hapoel fans before the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Welsh/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018They defeat what they claim to stand for\u2019</h2> <p>The Uefa sanction is fair. Rules are rules. We have a small group of fans who can be a great support with their constant drumming and singing, but who continually embarrass our club by adopting very left wing dogma and imposing it through the voice they have. Celtic FC is an inclusive club and the irony is that these people have actually made it less so through these constant political acts, hence they defeat what they claim to stand for. <strong><em>Celtic fan</em></strong><br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>Showing solidarity far outweighed disciplinary proceedings\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that Uefa is opening disciplinary proceedings. It was always expected. But showing solidarity to the people of Palestine far outweighed this in many people\u2019s eyes. Some things are more important in life. Celtic supporters have always stood up for the oppressed in all aspects of life, and Palestine is just one of the issues that fans over the years have consistently supported. The incredible response to the fundraising campaign only serves to prove the strength of feeling among Celtic fans and beyond. <strong><em>Chris </em></strong></p>",

It\u2019s also why some were so miffed by Dennis Kelly\u2019s very clever 2007 show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/may/16/theatre3\">Taking Care of Baby</a>, about what we accept as truth. There\u2019s a similar slipperiness to Australian Mish Grigor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/aug/16/forest-fringe-edinburgh-festival-theatre\">The Talk</a> at Forest Fringe, a wonderfully entertaining hour in which Grigor gets the audience to play members of her family talking about sex. The script is apparently based on interviews with her family and on her re-creation of family events. It includes her own personal sex tape and her mother talking about the size of her former husband\u2019s penis. It is funny, toe-curlingly frank, immensely insightful about family dynamics, and it makes you think about your own family and what you do and don\u2019t talk about.</p> <p>During the show, Grigor tells us that she assured her family that she would give them script approval and change their names, but in fact has done neither. Of course, she may be lying. She may have made up every word. Part of the pleasure of The Talk is that we will never know what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not, and that it\u2019s up to us to decide whether it matters. </p>",
  "<p>Ramen noodles are replacing tobacco as the most popular form of alternative currency within US prisons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/ramen-prison-currency-study\">according to a new study</a>. The news is proof that the barter system remains alive and well behind bars.</p> <p>In British prisons, the currency market shifts according to changes in legislation. Phone credit used to be an extremely popular form, but prisons now issue inmates with codes that can only be used to call pre-authorised numbers. Naturally, our prisoners have found new alternatives ...</p> <h2><strong>Spices</strong></h2> <p>Not to be confused with the cannabis substitute that has become a currency in its own right, spices are worth their weight in gold. One of the reasons inmates complain about the quality of prison food is that condiments such as black pepper and chilli powder are not generally available, to prevent them being thrown into the eyes of inmates or prison staff during fights. Prisoners assigned to kitchen detail corner the market in flavour enhancers and are some of the richest cons around.</p> <h2><strong>Tuna fish</strong></h2> <p>The stereotype of prisoners as gym junkies is very much grounded in reality, although access is generally restricted to twice a week rather than the open-door policy often depicted on film or television. For those wishing to gain muscle and lose fat, tinned tuna is an ideal source of nutrition that has the benefit of coming straight from a can rather than going through the mystical process that turns regular food into prison slop.</p> <h2><strong>Tobacco</strong></h2> <p>A smoking ban that was due to come into force earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/08/prison-smoking-ban-overturned-by-court-of-appeal\">was overturned by the court of appeal</a> amid fears that depriving prisoners of their tobacco would exacerbate discipline problems. Although smoking in communal areas has been banned for some time, inmates are allowed to smoke in the privacy of their cells. Around four out of every five prisoners is a smoker and the fact that tobacco can be legally owned makes it a clear favourite as an alternative form of currency.</p> <h2><strong>Money</strong></h2> <p>Inmates might not have direct access to hard cash, but they usually know someone who does. In order to pay for high-value items such as mobile phones \u2013 which routinely change hands for hundreds of pounds each \u2013 or large quantities of drugs, inmates phone home and arrange for money to be transferred directly into a nominated bank account. The goods are handed over once the seller makes a call to confirm that the transaction has taken place.</p>",
  "<p>Every time it rains in San Juan, Dr Brenda Rivera-Garc\u00eda walks around her home emptying containers of standing water, probably wearing long sleeves, and almost certainly wearing mosquito repellent. Rivera-Garc\u00eda is the state epidemiologist in Puerto Rico, a woman tasked with tracking every single Zika-infected pregnant woman in the US territory. </p> <p>Less than two weeks after the US health and human services administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/zika-virus-epidemic-puerto-rico-state-of-emergency-mosquito\">declared the spread of Zika on the island an epidemic</a>, Rivera-Garc\u00eda said it\u2019s not frustration or anger that overtakes her when she adds a new woman\u2019s name to a list of roughly 700 confirmed to be infected with the disease. </p> <p>It\u2019s sadness. </p> <p>\u201cEvery time I have to add a pregnant woman to that list, I just think of what\u2019s going to be of this pregnancy,\u201d she said, her eyes visibly wet. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be of this child later on, and, it\u2019s, it\u2019s \u2013 it breaks my heart.\u201d</p> <p>As much as <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/17/zika-virus-spreading-rapidly-across-puerto-rico/\">25% of the island\u2019s population</a> could have the disease by the end of mosquito season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, and up to 50 pregnant women each day are infected on the island.</p> <p>A recent study projected as many as <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2545827\">270 babies</a> could be born with the debilitating birth defect microcephaly, between now and mid-2017. In a normal year, doctors expect 16.</p> <p>The defect causes infants of mothers infected with the virus to be born with abnormally small heads, and suffer lifelong developmental disorders. Some will have trouble walking. Others may have hearing or vision loss, trouble swallowing or seizures. Many are likely to have <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/t0414-zika-update.html\">shortened life expectancy</a>.</p> <p>But health officials have had difficulty translating those projections into urgency among many Puerto Rico residents, who have been dogged in the past by tropical diseases with more apparent symptoms, such as dengue and chikungunya. Indeed, the government\u2019s efforts to control the virus seem hampered at every turn, thwarted by apathy, lack of trust, misinformation, insecticide resistance and even architecture. </p> <p>\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t work so of course people are going to be skeptical,\u201d said Joe Torra, 40, a professional driver in San Juan. </p> <p>Referencing colonialism, Torra said: \u201cThe best way to control minds is to control bodies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cf0b52a386138671cd79cced63972a908e5ab08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cf0b52a386138671cd79cced63972a908e5ab08/0_123_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A health worker prepares insecticide before fumigating a neighborhood in San Juan on 27 January 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A health worker prepares insecticide before fumigating a neighborhood in San Juan in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alvin Baez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018False alarms\u2019</h2> <p>Denisse Vel\u00e1zquez, 36, stood under the shade of a tree in Old San Juan, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0729-zika-infections-puerto-rico.html\">one of the hardest-hit municipalities</a>, as she said that the government \u201ccreated false alarms\u201d.</p> <p>Juan Mart\u00ednez, 43, said that with \u201call these diseases we have seen, it\u2019s something normal\u201d, referring to periodic outbreaks of dengue the island has struggled with since the 1980s, and the recent chikungunya outbreak. \u201cIn the Caribbean there has always been mosquitoes.\u201d</p> <p>Even tourism officials have reinforced the view that the Zika risk has been overblown. </p> <p>\u201cFrom the very beginning the numbers that were given were based on projections. The reality is that as of today, less than half of 1% of the population has the virus,\u201d Clarisa Jim\u00e9nez, CEO of the Puerto Rico Hotel and Tourism Association, told <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/18/puerto-rico-tourism-chief-pushes-back-on-zika-virus-warnings.html\">CNBC\u2019s Squawkbox</a>. \u201cThe only issue here is if you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jim\u00e9nez focused on the roughly 10,600 Puerto Ricans who had, at the time, been diagnosed with Zika by the CDC. The figure is an underestimate, because four out five infected people have no symptoms and probably do not know they have the virus.</p> <p>Now, near the end of August, the health department of Puerto Rico and the CDC have diagnosed 12,800 Zika infections, including more than 670 in pregnant women, believed to represent only a fraction of actual cases. </p> <p>So far, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/health/puerto-rico-reports-first-microcephaly-case-linked-to-zika.html\">only one child</a> has been born with microcephaly. But experts expect that number to increase dramatically in coming months, particularly from September to December.</p> <p>Health professionals believe the most dangerous time for a pregnant woman to be infected is in her first trimester, though more research is needed. Those pregnancies are expected to begin coming to term this fall.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, most of the births we have seen are among second and third trimester infections,\u201d said Rivera-Garc\u00eda. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s not just a number. There\u2019s a family behind that number.\u201d Doctors suspect that even these cases, which are less dramatic in appearance, could result in problems that won\u2019t manifest until much later. </p> <p>The island\u2019s timetable of epidemic infection is about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/25/zika-virus-mosquitoes-countries-affected-pregnant-women-children-microcephaly\">one year behind Brazil\u2019s</a>.

He is stationed at the Dengue Branch, an outpost in San Juan established to combat another virus spread by the same mosquito as Zika, the aggressive <em>Aedes aegypti</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThe moment that I go to sleep to the moment that I wake up, my mind seems to be around Zika all the time, trying to think if there\u2019s any other thing we can do,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWhen something goes wrong, it\u2019s also a very fast way down, downstairs in terms of your emotional wellbeing.

Many residents were outraged that the federal government would, in their view without permission, spray chemicals over the island. </p> <p>\u201cWhen they said that I was very upset,\u201d said Miguel Pellot, 48, the owner of a smoothie stand called Fruta Fruit in San Juan. \u201c<em>\u00bfC\u00f3mo se dice, una falta de respeto?</em>\u201d he said, asking how to express lack of respect in English. </p> <p>\u201cFor people here, this is nothing new. We\u2019ve had mosquitoes here since we were born,\u201d Deseda said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel threatened by the mosquito, because it\u2019s been always with them.\u201d</p> <p>Deseda said government fumigation encourages apathy among the population. \u201cThe government is doing something so they don\u2019t have to anything.\u201d </p> <p>Ceda V\u00e9lez, a 36-year-old woman working a juice stand near San Juan\u2019s cruise ship ports said she was in favor of government fumigation. </p> <p>\u201cWe use repellent, but at least it would help with where the mosquitoes breed, to kill the mosquitoes,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI worry.\u201d</p> <p>Puerto Rico won\u2019t fumigate with Naled from planes, as Florida does. And even if Puerto Rican authorities decided to fumigate street-side from trucks, only <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-mosquitoes-idUSKCN0WY47T\">about 12</a> vehicles on the island are outfitted to spray for mosquitoes. Regional resistance to insecticides has also confounded eradication efforts. </p> <p>Some residents believe the island was a guinea pig for <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775139/\">past federal government experiments</a>, that Zika was mild and posed no risk, that they weren\u2019t going to stop \u201cliving\u201d, or were simply misinformed about how to prevent exposure.</p> <p>\u201cI had, yes, but I drink Tylenol, <em>y ya</em>,\u201d said Naara Nieves, 39, who stood outside at noon in San Juan proselytizing, a gregarious evangelist for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \u201cI think the women who are pregnant, is bad, but for me, no.\u201d</p> <p>Marylin Vigo, who was visiting her sister on the island from Brooklyn, New York, said her relatives called her \u201cparanoid\u201d for even slathering on mosquito repellent.</p> <p>\u201cShe goes, \u2018Ugh! That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get Zika, because of mosquito bites,\u2019\u201d Vigo said, describing her sister\u2019s reaction.

It\u2019s also stunningly beautiful, with great schools, great healthcare, good weather and great food. The negatives are our prime minister and his conservative government.

Be prepared for things to cost a fair bit more than the UK, especially travel and beer.</p> <p>The \u201cshort hop\u201d to Australia is nearly a four-hour flight, too, and there isn\u2019t the choice of going via Easyjet or Ryanair to keep the cost down. Beer in the city (I live in Wellington) is NZ$10 a glass (\u00a35.50), which is often annoyingly called a pint yet is more likely to be 350-425ml. Similarly, at the local nationwide chain supermarket nearby I recently paid NZ$28/kg (\u00a316/kg) for green beans and NZ$6.50 (\u00a33.60) for a cucumber.</p> <p>The weather, house prices, salaries and traffic vary massively up and down New Zealand, so your experience will depend on where you choose to live. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08b1b8939278a3d366157eaac458b5844bc72777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b1b8939278a3d366157eaac458b5844bc72777/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Ruapehu\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The picture I\u2019ve shared above is one of Mount Ruapehu, which you\u2019ll see when flying between Wellington and Auckland.

For the locals, the society is not perfect. Poverty and hungry kids are a problem. The rate of immigration is causing some trouble \u2013 such as crazy house prices and pressure on jobs and services \u2013 and it\u2019s not inconceivable that immigrants will be blamed, as they have been in the UK. <br></p> <p>Make sure you understand what the job market is like before you move. Even Auckland \u2013 the biggest city \u2013 is relatively small, and the jobs that are in demand here are quite different from back home. There simply aren\u2019t a large number of well-paid office jobs, because the local market is so small and the country is very focused on the export of commodities rather than the local consumer. </p> <p>If you want to enjoy nature, sports, or simply a slower pace of life than the UK, then this is definitely the place for you. </p> <p>People here get up early, go to work around 8am, and leave work early compared to the UK. This makes it a really good place to have a more family-focused life as they tend to be heading home from work at 4-5pm. </p> <p>The worst thing by far is of course the isolation from friends and family. New Zealand really is as far away as you can possibly get! I\u2019ve heard of people starting a family and having to move back home because they needed to be closer to their support network. <br></p> <h2>Bob George, from Maungautoroto: \u2018Consider New Zealand if you want to add adventure to your life\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"926a6966d2963be4620dad7fb02c979e5db677eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/926a6966d2963be4620dad7fb02c979e5db677eb/0_0_2663_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am British.

Consider New Zealand if you want to add adventure to your life, if you get thrilled by stunning vistas, like an outdoor life, enjoy people and activities and want to develop as a person. <br></p> <p>New Zealand, like Britain, has a very mixed culture: I run a tennis group and get people from 20 different countries coming along (Auckland has a bigger mix of nationalities than most UK cities). Maori represent about 10% of the population and have impressive spiritual and social values. <br></p> <p>The worst parts of living here include the poor infrastructure. Earthquakes and volcanoes might be a challenge too. It\u2019s also very cut off \u2013 there are advantages in being 2,000km from the next nearest countries, but also a sense of isolation from the world.</p> <h2>Andy, from Auckland: \u2018House prices have spiralled out of control\u2019<br></h2> <p>I moved to New Zealand from the UK almost 20 years ago. In that time I\u2019ve seen house prices spiral out of reach for almost anyone but cash-rich investors. If you are serious about putting down roots here you will need to come to terms with house prices in the urban centres of around NZ$1m (\u00a3555,600). If you have children, a house in a desirable catchment area will set you back a fair bit more.</p> <p>There are undoubtedly benefits to relocating, however. For example, the weather is generally much more reliable in summer. Auckland in particular is an ethnically diverse and exciting city with many beautiful parks and beaches, which are never packed in the way an English beach such as Bournemouth is.</p> <p>There is crime here, and terrible congestion at times. The health service is also under the same strain as the NHS, although it is still largely free at point of use. As a tip for anyone thinking to make the move, remember that if someone says \u201cbring a plate\u201d on an invitation, be sure to put some food on it too. I got caught out by that one a couple of times early on. </p> <h2>Steve, 68, from Puhoi: \u2018Respect the local environment\u2019<br></h2> <p>I\u2019m not keen on New Zealand becoming overpopulated. I know that may sound very nimbyish but the fragile environment can only take so much. I worry about people coming here with little regard for how they might damage the surrounding area, so if you do come please find out about our original ecosystems and how some are in danger of total extinction. Learn to love what is unique to the country. <br></p> <h2>Hayley Ray, 27, from Auckland: \u2018I was shocked at the culture difference\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b293208df1501f0802a38aef3948328b6d2643d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b293208df1501f0802a38aef3948328b6d2643d/0_259_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hayley Ray\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As a Brit working and living in New Zealand, I think it\u2019s amazing news that more British people are deciding to move here. New Zealand is still growing and developing. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for people who want to contribute to the growth of this wonderful country. You won\u2019t regret making the move. </p> <p>Raglan, a small seaside town 50km west of Hamilton, is so stunning when summer kicks in. However, I have fallen in love with Auckland. There is so much to do and see. Every suburb has its own unique personality, which makes Auckland a fantastic city to live in. </p> <p>When I first moved to New Zealand I was shocked at the culture difference. However, when you look for it the country has much to offer. Sure, you may not have the same music scene and high-street fashion shops, or the same access to watching the Olympics without having to pay for Sky. But you have amazing companies that manufacture goods by hand. In Britain this is becoming very rare. <br></p> <h2>Mick, 32, from Wellington: \u2018Leave bigotry behind\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ba2bbae820629be3b5f10e6cf9e48d34dc39be3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ba2bbae820629be3b5f10e6cf9e48d34dc39be3/0_0_1659_996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"view in New Zealand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our country is populated by immigrants, so naturally they are most welcome here. My father\u2019s family immigrated here in the 1970s from Scotland, and they never looked back. When he\u2019s travelled overseas since he\u2019s told anyone who will listen to follow suit. Immigrants fit right in here, and there are many different ethnic community centres, newspapers and other assorted organisations.</p> <p>New Zealanders are prepared for all seasons. The further south you go, the colder it gets. In Auckland you can expect humidity and the occasional tornado; in Dunedin there are very cold winters, including snow. Everywhere has beautiful summers, though, and as the local saying goes: \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Wellington on a good day.\u201d</p> <p>Leave bigotry behind. Displays of racism, sexism, misogyny or any other forms of abuse are met swiftly with social justice, and even prosecution. We are a progressive nation: we have had openly gay and transsexual MPs, prostitution is legal here, and we legalised gay marriage long ago. </p> <p>We are a nation that proudly welcomes refugees, and often protests occur to increase the number we annually allow. Many different religions and ethnicities are represented by peaceful communities, and any harassment of them is quickly met with prosecution by an unforgiving justice system. </p> <h2>Kim, 56, from Wellington: \u2018Be prepared to slow down and say hi in the street\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"579d978dd99803aeb07e33a1418ccf7ddc35fba3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/579d978dd99803aeb07e33a1418ccf7ddc35fba3/0_0_2816_2112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"leaves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Aotearoa, the north part of New Zealand, is full of migrants. A few more won\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s not where you come from; it\u2019s how you live that counts. This isn\u2019t Britain, which has a lot of advantages \u2013 concentrate on these. <br></p> <p>People should come with an open mind to bi- and multi-cultural living. They should be prepared to slow down, smile, watch Division 4 football in the Australian A-League, say hi to people on the street, and learn enough <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language\">te reo Maori</a> to be comfortable in Maori settings. </p>",
  "<p>Are the days of the globalised economy numbered? It\u2019s a question more widely pondered of late, particularly in the light of the UK\u2019s recent vote to leave the European Union.

  "<p>When it comes to women\u2019s progress, the United States doesn\u2019t exactly bring home the gold. We rank <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm\">72nd</a> in women\u2019s political participation, with women holding less than <a href=\"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2015\">20% of congressional seats</a>. Paid maternity leave? The <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/05/15/america-comes-in-last-place-on-paid-maternity-leave/\">United States comes in last.</a> But at long last, we\u2019re number one at something: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-maternal-mortality-rate-health-clinics-funding\">Texas has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world</a>.</p> <p>This dubious honor is a recent one, with a study showing that the rate of women dying from pregnancy complications doubled from 2010-2014. It\u2019s not a coincidence, of course, that there was another major happening around women\u2019s health in Texas during those years: the deliberate closure of clinics that provide abortion and a drastic funding cut to the state\u2019s family planning budget.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-maternal-mortality-rate-health-clinics-funding\">As my colleague Molly Redden points out</a>, Texas gutted the state\u2019s family planning budget by more than $73m in 2011, forcing clinics to shut down and dramatically reducing the number of women they could provide services to. By 2014, 600 women had died from pregnancy-related complications.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost as if what feminists have been saying for years is true: limiting reproductive rights hurts women across the board. Access to reproductive care is necessary not just to prevent or end pregnancies, but to ensure healthy outcomes for those who choose to carry their pregnancies to term.</p> <p>Sarah Wheat of the Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas told <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20160817-texas-rate-of-pregnancy-related-deaths-nearly-doubles-and-neither-researchers-nor-the-state-knows-why.ece\">the Dallas Morning News</a> that these clinics were \u201can entry point into the health care system\u201d for many women, especially those with fewer resources.</p> <p>\u201cChances are they\u2019re going to have a harder time finding somewhere to go to get that first appointment.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an ironic but telling turn of events for the activists and legislators in Texas who insisted that laws shuttering abortion clinics were about protecting women\u2019s health \u2013 a claim that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/27/us-supreme-court-texas-abortion-ruling\">supreme court thoroughly debunked.</a></p> <p>In the decision to overturn Texas\u2019 extreme anti-choice law, the opinion read: \u201cWhen directly asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of a single instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of helping women, the law hurt women. But for the politicians and activists who want to stop them from accessing their right to abortion at all costs, women\u2019s health was never really the point.</p> <p>If Texas wants to turn this horror show around, officials need to start supporting women\u2019s choices, give up their transparent and cruel war on reproductive rights, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/29/texas-pays-a-big-price-for-saying-no-to-medicaid-expansion.html\">stop rejecting the expansion of Medicaid</a>, which could provide much-needed help and care to the state\u2019s vulnerable communities. And with Zika becoming more of a risk for Americans, these steps cannot come soon enough.</p> <p>Women\u2019s health is not a political chip to be played; it\u2019s not an afterthought. Our health and lives \u2013 whether we choose to have children or not - are central to the health of our country and communities. Women in Texas, women in America, deserve better than this.</p>",
  "<p>Records are made to be broken, but stereotypes can prove a bit more stubborn. The women of the United States\u2019 Olympic team managed to make a mockery of both at the Rio Games.</p> <p>Female athletes were responsible for 61 of the 121 medals stockpiled by Team USA in Brazil, marking the second straight Summer Olympics where they finished with more silverware than their male counterparts. If the women of Team USA broke away and formed a sovereign nation, their 27 gold medals would have matched Great Britain for the most of any country \u2013 and they would have placed fourth in the overall medal count.</p> <p>The medal tally is staggering, but it\u2019s the preconceptions these women have shattered that matter even more. This is what happens when we open doors and give opportunities to all backgrounds and cultures.</p> <p>The most ethnically and racially diverse team in the history of women\u2019s gymnastics finished with a team-record nine medals behind Simone Biles, the most by any country since the Soviet Union in 1972. If Gabby Douglas\u2019s all-around gold in London four years ago challenged the popular perception of gymnastics as a lilywhite sport, then this year\u2019s dream team \u2013 two black women, one Latina, one Jewish and one white \u2013 have shattered it for good.</p> <p>Simone Manuel became the first African American to win a gold medal in an individual swim event. When you consider the recent USA Swimming study revealing that nearly 70% of black children have \u201clow or no swim ability\u201d \u2013 a historic trend with roots in how African Americans have been systematically denied access to pools \u2013 the weight of Manuel\u2019s breakthrough is evident.</p> <p>That Brianna Rollins, Nia Ali and Kristi Castlin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/brianna-rollins-100m-hurdles-usa-sweep-rio-2016\">finished 1-2-3 in the 100m hurdles</a> \u2013 the first sweep by American women in any event and only the seventh ever in athletics overall \u2013 was impressive enough. Then consider how Ali, who has persisted through <a href=\"http://www.ocregister.com/articles/angeles-298625-hurdler-learning.html\">devastating personal tragedy</a>, gave birth to a son only 15 months ago \u2013 dispelling notions of maternity that are still widely held.</p> <p>\u201cI knew it was just going to be a difficult road back,\u201d Ali said. \u201cI see a lot of mothers out here daily, and they just struggle to just get their body back or appreciate themselves again just because they feel so different and they look so different. So I\u2019m happy that I was able to come back so quickly and show people that not only can I get fit but I can get back to world class performances.\u201d</p> <p>Added Castlin: \u201cI think that it\u2019s just very good to be a part of this whole black girl magic moment,\u201d said Castlin, who dedicated her medal to victims of gun violence. \u201cWe actually came into this not as individuals but as a team. We work together, we pray together and that is how we got this job done. The first US sweep in women\u2019s American history. </p> <p>\u201cIt feels good to be history-makers, trendsetters, moms, daughters, really just overcoming and just doing a great job and representing our country well.\u201d</p> <p>A 30-year-old from New Jersey named Ibtihaj Muhammad became the first American to compete at the Olympics in a hijab, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/ibtihaj-muhammad-fencing-olympics-2016-bronze\">winning a bronze medal in the team sabre</a> and offering a poignant riposte to the politics of hate. Claressa Shields, who became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/claressa-shields-boxing-gold-medal-rio-2016-olympics\">first ever American boxer to win two gold medals</a>, extended a four-year run of dominance in a male-dominated sport. The lone American of either gender to win gold in boxing since Andre Ward in 2004, she\u2019s almost single-handedly kept a flagging program afloat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a great boxer, but I\u2019m also a person who loves to uplift people and make them feel great,\u201d Shields said. \u201cThere has been times that I wish that my hair wasn\u2019t so poofy, I wish my hair wasn\u2019t so thick and and strong as it is. But at the same time, I love everything about me.</p> <p>\u201cI think that people need to embrace that. I\u2019m glad I make people feel that way. Black women doing great things is magic.\u201d</p> <p>The #BlackGirlMagic that bewitched a nation was only a part of the story. Gwen Jorgensen and Helen Maroulis became the first Americans to win gold in triathlon and women\u2019s wrestling, while shooter Kim Rhode became the first woman from any nation to win a medal at six straight Olympics, using her unlikely platform to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio2016-top-american-olympic-shooter-kim-rhode-attacks-gun-control-laws\">stand for her beliefs</a>.</p> <p>Signs that American women\u2019s fight for equality in society is ongoing can be seen everywhere from the gender pay gap to Katie Ledecky\u2019s record-shattering gold being <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nancyleong/status/764968748298100736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">relegated to a subhead</a> below Michael Phelps\u2019s silver in the 100m fly. By the end of the swimming competitions, Phelps was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YahooSports/status/765224107831095297\">asking for her autograph</a>.</p> <p>But while the fight is far from finished, the Olympics showed it\u2019s never been a better time to play like a girl.

  "<p>Senior members of Ukip have accused the party\u2019s only MP of helping the Conservatives defeat Nigel Farage in South Thanet in the general election last year, according to Ukip\u2019s main donor, Arron Banks.</p> <p>Farage, then the leader of Ukip, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/ukip-frustrated-share-vote-fails-translate-seats\">beaten by the Tory candidate, Craig Mackinlay</a>, after a controversial campaign in the Kent constituency. </p> <p>Banks\u2019s company has written to Kent police with the allegation that Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP for Clacton, helped the Tory campaign retain the seat. It details allegations that Carswell downloaded Ukip data for South Thanet and passed it to the Conservatives, enabling them to do \u201cpush polling\u201d of key voters.</p> <p>Push polling is when an apparently unbiased telephone survey spreads negative rumours about a candidate. </p> <p>Carswell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/28/douglas-carswell-ukip-defects-tory-mp-byelection\">defected to Ukip</a> from the Tories in 2014 but has had a fraught relationship with both Banks and Farage. </p> <p>According to the letter, Carswell was granted access to the Ukip database but then only accessed the South Thanet data. </p> <p>A letter sent to the police by Precision Risk &amp; Intelligence, where Banks is chief executive, claims that \u201cwe have evidence of excessive spending by the Conservatives and secretive dealings between them and a senior Ukip representative to collude against Mr Farage\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Arron_banks/status/768003939333656577\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Letter sent Kent police - the same call centre push polled Rochester.

We should just be relieved that those responsible for the disastrous campaign in South Thanet were not responsible for the successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">referendum campaign</a>.\u201d</p> <p>It may be that any unauthorised use of the Ukip database would be a breach of data protection laws. </p> <p>The letter also claims that the information was passed to a call centre in New Malden, Surrey, and was then used to target voters in South Thanet. The call centre in Surrey has close links to the Conservative party. </p> <p>Kent police are investigating allegations of improper election spending by the Tories in South Thanet, a highly marginal seat at last year\u2019s election. They were recently granted a further 12 months to investigate electoral spending in the constituency after a judge concluded that the inquiry could lead to the result \u201cbeing declared void\u201d.</p> <p>It is one of several seats under scrutiny following claims of illegal overspending. There are strict spending limits on both national and local campaigns, and police are investigating whether limits were breached.</p> <p>Electoral law allows candidates to spend between \u00a310,000 and \u00a316,000 depending on the size of the electorate. In South Thanet, Mackinlay said his campaign spent just below the limit, which was \u00a315,016. </p> <p>However, questions have been raised about the total spending in the seat, with claims that money spent in South Thanet was listed under national spending. The Conservatives have defended their election spending, saying it was within the law.</p> <p>As part of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\"> Panama Papers </a>investigation earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that Banks was a shareholder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/tory-donors-links-to-offshore-firms-revealed-in-leaked-panama-papers\">holding company of Precision Risk &amp; Intelligence</a>.

  "<p>\u201cSocial cohesion is not a destination,\u201d says Andrew Markus. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to the destination and say we\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s something we need to work at.\u201d</p> <p>Markus is a Monash University professor who oversees the <a href=\"http://scanlonfoundation.org.au/who-we-are/purpose-history/\">Scanlon</a> reports, a now regular and widespread exercise to measure social cohesion in Australia. Its latest survey was completed by more than 10,000 Australian-born and immigrant respondents, which makes it the largest parallel survey of its kind. It was a mix of survey and focus groups, where a small group is interviewed.<br></p> <p>The report \u2013 titled Australia Today \u2013 illuminates a people who are both hopeful and sometimes hurtful, largely cohesive but segmenting in a way that is becoming increasingly common in the midst of a communication revolution. It is fair to say we are mostly happy with our lives and what our country offers, though our background often determines our values. While Australian-born and overseas-born people value the freedom and democracy and the \u201cAustralian way of life\u201d, those born overseas place a much higher value on education, climate and diversity. Those taken in under humanitarian visas treasure our freedom and democracy more than the rest of us.</p> <p>We are not angels. There is discrimination, particularly towards the dark-skinned among us, Africans and Indigenous people. Muslims, particularly Muslim women, report high levels of discrimination. There is also a measure of reverse racism from migrants towards Australian-born people. As borders become more porous, the majority of us see ourselves as world citizens.</p> <p>As a whole, we trust doctors, hospitals and the Medicare system, as well as schools, police, the courts and government departments. Not so much employers or for that matter, trade unions. Let\u2019s not mention real estate agents. In their first five years on Australian soil, immigrants trust politicians and the parliament at much higher rates than the rest of the population. Then the things start to slide and they catch up with the attitudes of the mob.<br></p> <p>Coincidentally, the survey was conducted during Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s first five months in office \u2013 peak honeymoon. In the focus group studies, there is a recorded measure of relief within the Muslim community at the end of the \u201cdeath cult\u201d rhetoric of his predecessor Tony Abbott.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When NZ citizens were asked what they least like about Australia, 28% nominate racism and discrimination</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was a feeling that Abbott was not acknowledging diversity in the Muslim community and was alienating people because of that,\u201d Markus says.<br></p> <p>There is also an intense frustration about the media\u2019s portrayal of Islam for similar reasons. Indeed for Muslim respondents, their treatment by the media as an amorphous mass was a big issue. This is in spite of Muslim respondents having a high level of identification with Australia (72% identifying to a great or moderate extent and 75% indicating they were satisfied with life in Australia).<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:37:02/embed.html\" data-alt=\"experience of discrimination,\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:37:02/embed.html\">experience of discrimination,</a> </figure>  <p>Less predictable is the struggle of New Zealand citizens residing in Australia to fit in. Markus says the NZ special category visa holders report relatively high levels of negativity, trust and racism. They have high levels of workforce participation and just 13% are \u201cstruggling to pay the bills\u201d. But asked what they least like about Australia, 28% nominate racism and discrimination compared with 12% who nominate cost of living. Of the eight birthplaces considered in the survey, New Zealanders had the lowest levels of trust (10%) in Australian political parties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74cd903c303ebfa014e79667abec3b946e7c4d18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74cd903c303ebfa014e79667abec3b946e7c4d18/397_341_4531_2720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-immigration protesters clash with police in Coburg, Melbourne, in May 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-immigration protesters clash with police in Coburg, Melbourne, in May 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the big shock for Markus was the discrimination experienced by people from sub-Saharan Africa, particularly South Sudan. They arrived during the Howard era and 77% reported some form of discrimination. Focus group participants reported unwitting discrimination from children shocked at their skin colour, employment discrimination and general \u201cdistancing\u201d by people on the street as well as police harassment. Views included \u201cthe cops are racist\u201d, \u201ctaxi drivers are racist\u201d, \u201ceverybody\u2019s racist\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In shops \u2018they follow you around ... they think you are going to steal ... even though you are about to pay.</p> <p>We go down the shopping centre to get some food, we get harassed, like telling us to move on.</p> </blockquote> <p>One told a story of a Sudanese man sent to work in an aged care facility. He was very tall and his face had tribal scars. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As soon as they get into the aged care facility, all the older people start standing up, running to their rooms. And some of them start falling down ... \u2018get away from him, get away from him, he\u2019ll kill you too, he\u2019ll kill you too\u2019, they were saying that to my sister ... And my sister is like, she didn\u2019t even know what to say, she was shocked and they couldn\u2019t take that guy on, they had to send him back.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Recent arrivals feel a sense of belonging</strong></h2> <p>We are a multicultural nation, where nearly half of us are born overseas or have a parent born overseas. We welcome 190,000 people a year under the immigration program, with 68% in the skilled stream, 32% in the family stream. Add on top another 13,750 humanitarian places.</p> <p>Markus found the strength of identification with Australia remains at a high level among immigrants; 64% of recent arrivals (who came between 2001\u201015) indicated a sense of belonging to a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cmoderate extent\u201d, compared to 63% of respondents two years earlier.</p> <p>They are optimistic, with only 6% of recent arrivals disagreeing with the statement that \u201cAustralia is a land of economic opportunity where in the long run, hard work brings a better life\u201d. (Though that does widen to 18% for those who arrived further back \u2013 between 1991 and 1995.)</p> <p>As you would expect, business (457) visa holders and independent skills reported better economic times, though the latter reported difficulty getting work. Online applications were difficult and for some, anglicising their name helped. One respondent said Australia was similar to a third world country where employment was based not on what you know but who you know.<br></p> <p>Harder though is economic freedom for humanitarian entrants. Of respondents, 36% were employed, while 20% were looking for work with a relatively high proportion reporting they were \u201cjust getting by\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d. Yet they remained positive about life in Australia with 81% satisfied with their life.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4d92f50ef6b043fcb440f1c5596ed23f232e1ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4d92f50ef6b043fcb440f1c5596ed23f232e1ed/0_54_4463_2677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mother and a young girl attend a pro-refugee rally outside the Immigration Office in Brisbane in February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother and a young girl attend a pro-refugee rally outside the Immigration Office in Brisbane in February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Discrimination the eye opener</strong></h2> <p>Every time Markus goes into the field, his team is refining the data, watching the trends, thinking about new movements. This time, he was keen to tap into the African immigrant experience. In their last 2013 recent arrival survey, they got only 25 respondents born in sub-Saharan countries other than South Africa.<br></p> <p>With effort, Scanlon received 166 South Sudanese respondents out of nearly 500 from Sub-Saharan countries. South Sudanese arrivals peaked in Australia from 1996 to 2005 in the Howard years under the humanitarian visa program. Of the respondents, 76% were satisfied with their life and 58% said life was more positive than they had expected.<br></p> <p>Balanced against that outlook was high unemployment rates among respondents (23%), low levels of personal trust (4%) compared with the average for recent arrivals (37%) and low levels of trust in police (26%).</p> <p>But it was experience of discrimination which was the real eye opener for Markus. In the previous 12 months, experience of reported discrimination was at 60% for Ethiopians, 67% for Kenyans, 75% for Zimbabweans and 77% for South Sudanese.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t think we would get 77% experience of discrimination.</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Markus, Monash University professor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Markus says the numbers show the issues may be worse than he first thought. Almost as shocking is the realisation that the numbers may be underestimated.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think we would get 77% experience of discrimination and it\u2019s the way people talk about it that is surprising,\u201d he said.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:34:39/embed.html\" data-alt=\"discrimination selected african countries\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:34:39/embed.html\">discrimination selected african countries</a> </figure>  <p>Is this the most recent migrant group again reflecting back? The same survey found 59% of Indigenous Australians reporting experiences of discrimination.<br></p> <p>Markus, who has long been watching these trends, says the levels of culturally intolerant people in Australia are probably more like 20% of the population, instead of the 10% he was inclined to think.</p> <h2><strong>Technology brings homeland closer</strong></h2> <p>In the postwar years, migrant communities were almost completely cut off from their home towns and villages. Letters had to suffice and perhaps a phone call twice a year with the family gathered around. The communication revolution has changed that. Of arrivals between 2011 and 2015, 71% keep in contact with family or friends by SMS or social media daily or several times a week. Close to one in three arrivals between 2001 and 2015 watch televisions shows from their former home country at least several times a week. <br></p> <p>Markus says while there is still more data required, such a change could have a fundamental impact on the immigrant experience in Australia.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8117e017ab4a07de36830a67bf337b1ac872431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8117e017ab4a07de36830a67bf337b1ac872431/321_0_2679_1608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"view of skype logo and microphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many recent arrivals keep in touch with relatives or friends every week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cInexpensive technology means people in villages in India can buy a really cheap phone with cheap rates,\u201d Markus says.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat could fundamentally change Australia. The next generation choose their boundaries and choose their contacts so the centre is weakened because you can be just as well connected to an interest group across the world.\u201d<br></p> <p>Asked if it could change nation states, Markus says: \u201cIt brings it into question, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Pockets of diversity</strong></h2> <p>Markus found a prominent theme in focus group discussion related to the cleaving of diverse multicultural areas and monocultural areas \u2013 with participants talking about the visual difference on the street.</p> <p>There are comments such as these:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who come from the affluent side of Melbourne and they come from old Australian money and to them, I am like this foreign being because I\u2019m half Asian, I\u2019m half European but born here. When I\u2019m in Broadmeadows I\u2019m just normal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Or this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Coming from my white workplace ... like extremely white ... walking from the station to Bankstown library ... I saw Asians and I saw a woman in hijab and I saw someone that was an Islander and I just thought \u2018friggin hell, why is this not reflected in my workplace ... Like this is actually Australia, that\u2019s not Australia, that\u2019s white Australia\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>So diversity continues but is contained. And Scanlon national surveys in the past four years show 56% either support the current intake or feel that it should be increased.<br></p> <p>But this year, 40% of Australian-born respondents considered the intake too high and that grew to 44% for Australian-born with both parents Australian born, known as third generation Australians.<br></p> <p>At the same time, when asked what they least liked about Australia, the first choice of 18% of third generation respondents was racism and discrimination. Another 19% of third generation Australians said too much immigration. There is Australia\u2019s race debate. They really need to get together. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Men (35%) were more likely to reject cultural diversity than women (17%)</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once Markus and his team started breaking it down according to the ethnic and cultural tolerance scale (where a low score rejects cultural diversity), 26% Australian-born respondents and 29% of third generation Australians had low scores. This split showed men (35%) were more likely to reject diversity than women (17%). Once the scores were split on address, city respondents (18% rejection of diversity) had lower rates than inner regional (25%) and outer regional (39%).<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:28:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"ethnic and diversity tolerance\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:28:56/embed.html\">ethnic and diversity tolerance</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis highlights polarisation, what it shows is Pauline Hanson is not a surprise.

Examples from respondents include women being told to cover up by Muslim Australians.<br></p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s not like we\u2019re doing nothing ...</strong></h2> <p>For someone who has been studying the issues for so long, Markus is highly aware of the complexity \u2013 refusing to drop into stereotypes on migration, culture, race and religion. <br></p> <p>Asked how Australia compares globally, or with a comparable country such as Canada, Markus shrugs. \u201cAh [Canadian prime minister Justin] Trudeau. Different leadership \u2013 and the way he speaks is important\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cAustralians tend to react to spectacular injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cWe react to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/26/abu-ghraib-images-children-detention-australia-public-inquiry\">Don Dale [juvenile detention centre</a>] but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">what about the asylum seekers?</a> What is going to happen to them? We have a capacity to put it aside.<br></p> <p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s not like Australia is doing nothing. It\u2019s actually managing a large resettlement program, given its population and on top of that it has the 12,000 Syrians to take in.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an inconsiderable contribution in terms of cost to government, given we are taking in people in the first generation who are going to have big difficulties, and maybe second generation as well.\u201d<br></p> <p>If there is a difficulty with the Scanlon report Australia Today, it is the sheer volume of information which portrays the complexity of Australia\u2019s culture. Conclusions are difficult to draw \u2013 the glass could be half full or half empty. But the exercise continues to be worthwhile.</p>",

  "<p>A Russian journalist who reports on female genital mutilation says introducing prison sentences for perpetrators will not bring about an end to the practice, after a report released last week said that FGM was taking place in remote villages in the republic of Dagestan.</p> <p>Marina Akhmedova, based in Moscow, has recently returned from the North Caucasus region, where she interviewed survivors of FGM. She is calling for a programme of on-the-ground advocacy.<br></p> <p>Responding to a draft bill introduced by MP Maria Maksakova-Igenbergs last week that called for the criminalisation of FGM, with sentences of up to 10 years, Akhmedova said such strict measures would only be seen as religious persecution and could drive the practice underground.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, she said: \u201cIt is really difficult to help these women as they don\u2019t consider themselves victims. First you need to persuade them that they are victims. Targeting them will only drive them to do this in secret. If religious leaders say it is right for a girl to undergo circumcision, people will do it.\u201d</p> <p>She suggested that Russia needed to adopt an \u201caccurate and moderate\u201d approach and work with religious leaders as well as doctors and teachers to persuade them to abandon FGM. </p> <p>A report published by the human rights group Russian Justice Initiative (RJI) said there was evidence that FGM of girls under the age of three was happening in remote, mainly-Muslim villages in Dagestan. It came to wider attention when two religious leaders responded with comments in support of the practice.</p> <p>Ismail Berdiyev, the mufti and chairman of the North Caucasus Muslim Coordination Centre, said FGM does not contradict Islam and is a \u201cpurely Dagestani ritual\u201d that is necessary \u201cto limit the unnecessary energy\u201d of women. He also suggested in a radio interview that all women should undergo FGM to curb their sexual feelings, later retracting some of his comments. </p> <p>Vsevolod Chaplin, an Orthodox Christian leader, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/prot.v.chaplin/posts/286377295072116\">posted on Facebook</a> in support of Berdiyev, saying that traditional practices should be allowed to continue without interference.</p> <p>Maria Baronova, an opposition activist, responded to the report by standing outside Moscow\u2019s main mosque with a sign saying \u201ccut sheep not women\u201d.<br></p> <p> </p> <p>Akhmedova said Baronova\u2019s protest amounted to an \u201cincitement of ethnic hatred\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe mosque she stood outside belongs to Moscow Muftiyat, which has officially rejected FGM,\u201d Akhmedova said. \u201cNot all Muslims practise circumcision, and there was nothing in her actions that showed a desire to help the women of Dagestan. </p> <p>\u201cThe opinion of religious leaders on the case in Dagestan is divided. The media made it out that this is a wholly Islamic problem, but this is not the case. Some of the women I spoke to themselves felt ashamed for not having a clitoris, but others suggested that it is a practice that they have done for years and will continue to do.\u201d </p> <p>RJI found that FGM is carried out predominantly in five mountainous areas, where the procedure is usually performed on girls under the age of three, but also on some up to the age of 12. <br></p> <p>Vanessa Kogan, the group\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThe report would not have received nearly as much coverage if it hadn\u2019t been for the outrageous statements made by Berdiyev and Chaplin. Their statements did not really contribute anything concrete to the questions surrounding the practice of FGM, but they spoke volumes about both Islamic and Christian religious leaders\u2019 intentions to control women\u2019s bodies and their sexuality.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give the impression that FGM is a religious practice, and we want to keep the focus on the fact that the procedure is a gross violation of women and children\u2019s rights. These communities are among the last to have converted to Islam in the region, and many experts interviewed expressed the view that the practice is rooted in pre-Islamic tradition <em>adat</em> or customary law.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time, we acknowledge that the support of religious leaders may be a key component in working to eradicate the problem.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/feb/05/facts-you-should-know-about-fgm-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4genx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2451520\"            data-video-name=\"The facts you should know about female genital mutilation \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/5/1454687602596/KP_1735363_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56b4c582e4b00a8a9e2a8c3e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/5/1454687602596/KP_1735363_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/feb/05/facts-you-should-know-about-fgm-video\">It can kill: the facts you should know about female genital mutilation</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Kogan added no further research was planned, saying: \u201cThere is no evidence that FGM is being practised anywhere else in Russia on a systematic scale.

We need further investigation.<br></p> <p> \u201cFGM can no longer be seen as a supposedly \u2018African\u2019 issue. It is a human rights violation which affects hundreds of millions of women and girls around the world. Recently, we have had better data from countries such as Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Colombia, Yemen and others, which shows that FGM is a global issue and needs to be urgently addressed.\u201d</p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">The United Nations warns that more than 200 million girls and women alive today have been cut, mostly before they reached puberty, and has recently classified it as child abuse.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/feb/05/facts-you-should-know-about-fgm-video\">FGM</a> is defined by the World Health Organisation as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.

  "<p>Michael Grade, the former BBC chairman and Tory peer, has defended the corporation\u2019s expanded role for James Purnell, the former Labour cabinet minister who is tipped to be appointed the next radio chief.</p> <p>Purnell, the BBC\u2019s director of strategy, who recently had education and children\u2019s programming added to his brief, is seen as favourite to take over from Helen Boaden, director of BBC radio, who steps down this year.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s intentions have come under fire from Tories including John Whittingdale, the former culture secretary, and Damian Collins, a member of the culture select committee, who argue that Purnell\u2019s appointment could jeopardise the BBC\u2019s impartiality.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cJames is a very serious and smart guy and he understands as much as anybody that impartiality and independence are at the heart of the BBC,\u201d said Lord Grade. \u201cI would have 100% faith in him to carry out the job in accordance with the royal charter.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Grade pointed out that there had been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/jun/25/bbc\">similar backlash against Greg Dyke</a>, a former Labour party donor, when he was named as BBC director general. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe question is: does the person have the ability to understand their role and what the imperatives of the BBC are?\u201d said Grade. \u201cI have no fear he would in any way allow his political history to interfere with his obligations to uphold the BBC\u2019s impartiality and independence. And I speak as a Tory backbench peer. It makes me very uncomfortable politicians making party politics out of people\u2019s careers in this way.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Purnell, who is paid \u00a3295,000 a year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/14/james-purnell-to-rejoin-bbc\">joined the BBC as director of strategy in 2013</a>. He was part of the senior team that led negotiations with the government over the BBC\u2019s new 11-year charter.</p> <p>He was given the broader remit after an interview with the BBC non-executive directors Dame Fiona Reynolds and Alice Perkins, the wife of former Labour home secretary Jack Straw, a former cabinet colleague of Purnell.<br></p> <p>If Purnell does take the top radio role, he would not have direct control over content such as Radio 4\u2019s Today programme and World at One, which are run by James Harding, the director of news, a former editor of the Times.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Diane Coyle, the former vice-chair of the corporation\u2019s governing body, the BBC Trust, said there was a fundamental misunderstanding of the extent of influence Purnell would have in that role.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe idea that one individual in a senior role can bias the whole organisation is ludicrous,\u201d she said. \u201cThe head of radio doesn\u2019t set editorial policy.

The idea [he] would be picking over the editorial agenda of the Today programme or PM can only be a charge of people who don\u2019t understand how these structures work.\u201d<br></p> <p>Purnell is widely considered to be a strong candidate ultimately to take over from Tony Hall when he steps down as director general.<br></p> <p>Coyle said: \u201cIt is a managerial job \u2026 giving someone a range of experience as a credible contender for the DG role when that next comes up. </p> <p>\u201cIt is great relevant experience for if that job comes up. You want a wide range of candidates for that role.

  "<p>Sometimes two weeks away with someone, without the blessed relief of the working day and a bit of overtime, can really clarify why you might not want to spend another day with them. A new study suggests that the number of people filing for divorce spikes after the summer holidays. Two sociologists at the University of Washington analysed 15 years of divorce filings and found that the period just after winter, and again after the summer holidays, were peak times for deciding on divorce.</p> <p>And if nobody has really been to blame for the end of the marriage, what happens next often comes as a nasty surprise to couples. \u201cWe\u2019re still working [in] a divorce system we\u2019ve had for decades, which is why we\u2019ve been pressing for many years for the introduction of a \u2018no fault\u2019 divorce system,\u201d says Nigel Shepherd, chair of <a href=\"http://www.resolution.org.uk/\">Resolution</a>, the campaigning organisation of family lawyers, and head of family law at Mills &amp; Reeve.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f40dd193fc38576a551bc3c43bf1c4aff07849ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f40dd193fc38576a551bc3c43bf1c4aff07849ed/1263_597_2531_2596/975.jpg\" alt=\"divorce\" width=\"975\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drawn-out divorces can lead to couples playing the blame game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dazeley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In England and Wales, there are still only five ways to get a divorce and three of those involve living separately for at least two years. If you want to get divorced quickly, you have to do it on the basis of adultery or unreasonable behaviour. \u201cYou end up in what we call the blame game,\u201d says Shepherd. \u201cParticularly with unreasonable behaviour, when neither of you really wants to blame the other \u2013 you try to get allegations that are as mild as possible, and least upsetting as possible, but still strong enough to get over the unreasonable behaviour hurdle. People are having to kick off [divorce proceedings] with a discussion about blame. Even if you say to them, \u2018This is just the system unfortunately, we have to go through this game,\u2019 it still upsets people.\u201d</p> <p>Darren Lilly, a social media manager from Manchester, says neither he nor his former wife were at fault for the end of their marriage. They had been married for seven years and together for 17, and, \u201cWe\u2019d just reached the end of the path. It was an amicable split but a horrendous divorce.\u201d They did the two years\u2019 separation, and then the divorce involved three court dates, during which Lilly represented himself. \u201cYour life is dissected. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t quite work out as fairly as I\u2019d like.\u201d Does he think the process made it worse? \u201cI think it did. I think the system should be made quicker. Not all marriages end because someone has been unfaithful or abusive or in any way unreasonable. You can be married pretty quickly and divorce slowly. It needs looking at to reflect modern society.\u201d</p> <p>Bev, a nurse manager from the West Midlands, would also like the process to be quicker. She and her ex-husband were married for 15 years. Their divorce was finalised in March last year, but only after her husband, who had been unfaithful, slowed it down. \u201cI think the divorce process would be fine and easy if there was a way that the other party could be made to do things far quicker,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just prolonged the agony. Considering I felt the wronged party, I had to pay for all the times he dragged his feet.\u201d She spent about \u00a31,400 in solicitors\u2019 fees chasing him up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61cc407e7278e36e873dfee959fa8068dc8d69c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61cc407e7278e36e873dfee959fa8068dc8d69c8/0_32_2892_1735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baroness Hale of Richmond called for a \u2018no fault\u2019 divorce to be introduced.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baroness Hale of Richmond called for a \u2018no fault\u2019 divorce to be introduced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a private members\u2019 bill to introduce a \u201cno fault\u201d divorce, and Baroness Hale, deputy president of the supreme court, called for it to be introduced (a previous act, 20 years ago, which would have allowed for a more amicable process, was never implemented and was eventually scrapped). \u201cWhat we really want is for the government to pick it up and introduce a piece of legislation. But it\u2019s always been a bit of a political hot potato,\u201d says Shepherd. Past objections have been on religious grounds, or from people who say it will make divorce too easy and undermine marriage.</p> <p>Divorce law is yet to be modernised, but there have still been other changes in recent years to the way we approach the end of a marriage.</p> <h2><strong>Do it yourself</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this year, football presenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-lineker\">Gary Lineker</a>, whose marriage to his second wife had recently ended, took issue with divorce lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to get married and very difficult to get divorced,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article4738802.ece\">he said</a>. \u201cAnd we know that lawyers try to manipulate it to make you spend more money and basically end up hating each other.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45125a249f0630c3d540494d3e7161b9ed32da66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45125a249f0630c3d540494d3e7161b9ed32da66/0_65_2283_1370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Lineker with his ex-wife Danielle Bux.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Lineker with his ex-wife Danielle Bux.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More and more people are choosing to represent themselves. According to <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/diy-divorce-freezes-out-the-lawyers-jwvm5x2ht\">a recent survey</a>, around 40% of people no longer use lawyers in their divorces. For all Lineker\u2019s talk of greedy lawyers, this isn\u2019t to be considered a positive development, as it mostly comes on the back of legal aid cuts.</p> <p>People who represent themselves in divorce cases may not \u201cget the outcomes they might expect or deserve,\u201d says Emma Pearmaine, director of family services at Simpson Millar. It can also slow proceedings down. \u201c[Divorce] is a horrid thing to be experiencing and we need to come to a conclusion as quickly as we can to the benefit of the whole family,\u201d she says. It also forces the other person, acting with a solicitor, to shoulder more of the costs. The consequence of legal aid cuts and people representing themselves is, she says, \u201caffecting a whole generation of children. Previously a parent on a low income might have been eligible to go to court so they can see their child. Now if they\u2019re not eligible, they might have to make an application themselves, or they don\u2019t make an application at all. That suggests to me that we have a whole generation of children who are not having the right relationship with both parents.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/22/divorced-men-women-wedding-rings\">'I took it off and threw it at him': what divorced people do with their wedding rings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If a divorce is relatively straightforward, many people have found that representing yourself can work.

She and her ex-husband had been separated for two years, and at that point she got a solicitor to arrange their financial situation. \u201cThe divorce itself was very simple, it was just form-filling,\u201d she says. \u201cI think people are fazed by it and assume they have to get legal advice and pay out a huge amount of money to go through the process itself.

Often the impetus to divorce, for at least one of the couple, is coming from a healthy place and that is not celebrated or validated in mainstream culture. Often it\u2019s a rebirth of yourself, new relationships, new discoveries and a new way to be in the world.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2152615ee35460129b65167cdd6081ec86fb458\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2152615ee35460129b65167cdd6081ec86fb458/0_0_3191_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The divorce app: a place for people who \u2018wanted a safe, non-judgmental space\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"241\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The divorce app: a place for people who \u2018wanted a safe, non-judgmental space\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s nicely designed (\u201cYou go on a wedding website, and it\u2019s stunning, it\u2019s filled with beautiful imagery, so why do we get no good design for another very valuable and extremely common life transition?\u201d) but still a small operation \u2013 thousands of visitors come to the site to read the content on relationships and divorce, which Averill aggregates from around the web, but it has just 1,500 registered members.</p> <p>On the site, people can form networks with others going through a relationship breakdown and post in the forum, and it is proving popular with the party that wants a divorce, seeking advice and support. \u201cWe all pity the person who was left, we all honour that broken heart but we don\u2019t honour the broken heart of the individual who wants to leave and the courage to call it,\u201d says Averill. \u201cAnd so I thought, to balance things out, it would be helpful to have a space for people who wanted to end their relationships and wanted a safe, non-judgmental space to talk about why it was not working.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Celebrate it</strong></h2> <p>In Los Angeles, Christine Gallagher, a psychotherapist, runs a couple of divorce parties a month. She saw how throwing a party to mark the end of a divorce was helpful to a friend, and started planning parties for others (she has also written a few books on the subject). Some are themed \u2013 one of the favourites is based on the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239195/\">Survivor</a> reality TV show, where the venue is decorated like a desert island and lobster is served. \u201cWe do custom parties where we take something from the break-up and build a theme around it,\u201d she says. One had a golf theme \u2013 a woman\u2019s husband told her he was taking up golf, but eventually she realised his clubs had never been used. \u201cWe did a whole golf themed divorce party where people wore golf clothes, we had a pro come in and teach the ladies how to swing the clubs,\u201d she says. It\u2019s \u201can occasion to get emotion out,\u201d says Gallagher. \u201cDivorce is the one landmark event in life that we don\u2019t have an organised event for, where your family and friends come in and help you, and I think a divorce party fills that space. I think it can be very healthy.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Get it over with in a weekend</strong></h2> <p>In 2011, Jim Halfens, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands, set up <a href=\"http://www.divorcehotel.com/en/team.htm\">Divorce Hotel</a>, a kind of breakup minibreak. He had seen a friend go through a divorce and thought it seemed much more complicated than it needed to be, so came up with the idea of getting everything done in one weekend: \u201cYou know when it starts, when it ends and what it costs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe divorce industry benefits from making divorce procedures too complicated.\u201d<br></p> <p>At the moment, Divorce Hotel is only running in the Netherlands <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/business/the-divorce-hotel-a-true-weekend-getaway.html\">and New York state in the US</a>, but he is planning to bring it to the UK. The soon-to-be-former couple go to a hotel, away from partisan in-laws or friends, and on Saturday morning sit down with a lawyer who is specially trained in mediation. Talks continue all weekend \u2013 sometimes involving accountants, estate agents and counsellors \u2013 before papers are signed on Sunday evening.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When papers are signed, sometimes it\u2019s really emotional and people choose to play their favourite song for the last time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The process is not for everyone, says Halfens, and nearly a third of couples who approach him are turned away. For a start, a couple need to be able to talk to each respectfully, in person, over a whole weekend. Custody of children is not discussed, so a parenting plan has to already be in place. \u201cIf you\u2019re not able to wish the other person a positive future, you\u2019re not suitable to come to us,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to be dedicated. You have a deadline and you know that if you don\u2019t make it before Sunday evening, everything is for nothing. It\u2019s a very important goal to realise. It\u2019s for the couple to make a positive, bright new start, not irritate each other and delay the procedure for months.\u201dIs a weekend enough time to uncover hidden assets? \u201cWe don\u2019t have weeks to find out about bank accounts,\u201d says Halfens. \u201cPeople need to be 100% transparent about possessions. We have had situations where the couples were not honest with each other, for example the mediator finds out there is a house in Switzerland or a bank account. Then it all stops, because divorce hotel principles are fundamentally based on mediation.\u201d</p> <p>When the papers are signed, some couples say a chilly goodbye and leave, but most of the time, it\u2019s quite special, says Halfens. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a moment of joy, sometimes it\u2019s really emotional and people choose to play their favourite song for the last time.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Bird\u2019s nest parenting</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5a9a14d6ab85f54db02b94b7ce035bc56e5a5fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5a9a14d6ab85f54db02b94b7ce035bc56e5a5fd/0_372_4753_2852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A new idea is that parents rather than the children move between homes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new idea is that parents rather than the children move between homes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Grill/Getty Images/Tetra images RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Typically, if you have children and shared custody, once you are divorced the kids shuttle between your homes, but a relatively <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/birds-nest-custody-the-smart-new-way-to-divorce/\">new idea</a>, imported from the US, is that the parents should be the ones to do all the moving \u2013 and it\u2019s catching on. The family home (the \u201cnest\u201d) is maintained \u2013 either the existing one, or a new one \u2013 and the children stay there, while each parent takes it in turn to move in for a few days every week, while the other one stays at a flat. The idea is that the children get continuity during a time of disruption \u2013 their own bedroom, toys, school stuff in the same place \u2013 and it can work out better, financially, for the family because only one property needs to be big enough for the children, and costs can be shared. It would be up to the family to decide if this was right for them, not a judge. \u201cI can\u2019t envisage a situation where a court would [impose it],\u201d says John Bolch, a former lawyer. It may come with challenges in future, such as what happens if both or either parents meet a new partner. \u201cIt relies pretty heavily on the parties remaining on good terms.\u201d</p>",

She said that as a result, she could reach these undercover voters \u201cin many different ways\u201d. She said: \u201cWe go to them where they live, literally.\u201d</p> <p>Conway\u2019s statement echoes what in American politics is known as<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/trailhead/2008/01/08/did_n_h_voters_lie_about_supporting_obama.html\"> the Bradley effect</a>, a phenomenon that describes the willingness of some white voters to tell pollsters that they are voting for an African American candidate while preferring the white candidate in the voting booth.</p> <p>It is named for former Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, who was favored in polls in California\u2019s 1982 gubernatorial election over his white Republican opponent, George Deukmejian, before suffering a narrow shock loss on election day. However, while its existence is disputed, anecdotal evidence for the phenomenon is mostly concentrated in the 1980s and 1990s. Conway\u2019s argument is that something fundamentally similar is happening in the US in 2016. </p> <p>Speaking to Channel 4 earlier this month, Conway buoyed her claims by citing the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">UK\u2019s experience of the EU referendum vote</a>.</p> <p>Polling suggested the UK would remain in the European Union, but it became clear on election night that the vote was going the other way.</p> <p>Conway said: \u201cVoices are silenced in polls that really should be included because people are too reliant on lists, and they\u2019re excluding people who maybe feel so passionately about that issue, Brexit, or so passionately about this candidate, Donald Trump, that they\u2019re going to vote for the first time ever in many, many, many cycles.\u201d<br></p> <p>In the past week, Trump has begun to ditch his previous unscripted style, using teleprompters on stage at every rally. That is despite repeatedly bashing the technology in the past, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-teleprompter-224039\">saying in August 2015</a>: \u201cI say we should outlaw teleprompters \u2026 for anybody running for president.\u201d </p> <p>The shift toward making Trump a more predictable candidate came as Conway took control of the campaign. The top aide outlined the message she thought Trump should continue to emphasize: \u201cThe best Donald Trump is the Donald Trump who is talking about national and homeland security, economic growth and prosperity, ethics and why so many Americans dislike and distrust Washington and all its adjuncts, its consultants, its donors, its lobbyists, its politicians, its way of doing business.\u201d </p> <p>However, despite his adoption of teleprompters, Trump still <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-democrat-run-inner-cities-more-dangerous-than-war-zones-video\">veered badly off script</a> in a rally in Akron, Ohio, on Monday night. The Republican nominee said: \u201cYou can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to claim that if he were elected, \u201cwe\u2019ll get rid of the crime. You\u2019ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.\u201d</p> <p>Just as there may be a cohort of undercover Trump voters waiting to emerge in November, it seems that despite Conway\u2019s best efforts, there is an undercover candidate who won\u2019t let a teleprompter keep his penchant for controversial statements hidden. </p> <ul> <li>President Trump: Can He Really Win? airs on Channel 4 in the UK at 9pm on Tuesday 23 August<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In 2008, his last year of military high school in the western city of Bursa, Mehmet Ko\u00e7 noticed that things were changing in the Turkish army. The school had just been handed over from the army to the air force, and a new group of commanders took over the education of the cadets.<br></p> <p>What Ko\u00e7 was seeing was the arrival of the G\u00fclenists, the movement around US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen, who the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, a former ally, accuses of being behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-coup-attempt\">last month\u2019s coup attempt</a>. G\u00fclen and his followers have denied all involvement. </p> <p>Western governments and human rights groups have expressed grave concern over the tens of thousands with alleged ties to the network who have since been detained or dismissed from their jobs, arguing that the investigation has already turned into a witch-hunt. But many in Turkey are frustrated by the perceived reluctance in the west to take the G\u00fclen network seriously \u2013 for Turks such as Ko\u00e7, the movement\u2019s rise meant physical abuse, debt and a thwarted military career.</p> <p>\u201cI had been a good student and got along well with the teachers,\u201d Ko\u00e7 said. \u201cBut I soon noticed that these new commanders had their own way of doing things, a different hierarchy.

We were deprived of sleep, of food, of water. We had to crawl everywhere, even on asphalt. My skin was raw and bleeding constantly. They humiliated us.

For much of the period, Erdo\u011fan and G\u00fclen were still allies and journalists went to jail for reporting on the issue.</p> <p>The alliance between Erdo\u011fan and G\u00fclen started to sour in 2012, but the president finally declared war on the cleric following the eruption of a corruption scandal in 2013 that implicated the AKP government, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s closest associates and his family.

Chard is a tasty vegetable, the stems fleshy (sweet though slightly bitter), which then thread like veins through the leaf. It tastes a bit like the love child of spinach and sorrel. If the leaves and stem are the weave of this dish, the chickpeas are the substance, so they need to be tender. Soak them for at least 12 hours, then boil until soft enough to squash easily between your finger and thumb. Alternatively, use tinned. The tomatoes are optional, but they add a pleasing sweetness. The lemon is another bright light, sharpening and lifting. What to drink with it? Roman white wine, Sicilian red, Dorset cider?

Cut the stems into short lengths, then roll the leaves into cigars and chop roughly. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt. Add the stems for a 1-2 minutes, then add the leaves for a few minutes more or until tender. Drain.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Warm the olive oil over a medium-low heat. Peel and crush the garlic for a milder flavour, or slice for a stronger hit. Add the cherry tomatoes. Fry, squashing the tomatoes gently with the back of a spoon, until they are soft and the oil is tinted red. Add the chard and stir until it glistens with oil, add the chickpeas and cook for a few minutes more. Remove from the heat, add the parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper, then let it sit for a while.

There is virtually nowhere in the park in which its 600,000 annual visitors cannot see a drilling rig, an oil pump, a highway or a cellphone tower in what was once a sleepy rural area. </p> <p>Ross said she is bombarded by letters and messages on Facebook from tourists over these eyesores. She frets that the park\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nature.nps.gov/air/maps/docs/nps_class_i.pdf\">special status for clean air</a> will be ruined by pollution and that a new oil refinery, planned for an area just two miles east of the protected area, will heighten this clash between nature and mining.</p> <p>\u201cThe visitor experience is impacted by this type of structure,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThese proposals all add up, they have a cumulative impact. There\u2019s a perception that we are trying to shut down the energy industry but we just want responsible placement of these things.\u201d</p> <p>The challenges facing Theodore Roosevelt national park are emblematic of a fresh struggle for the soul of national parks. The parks, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/americasbestidea/\">America\u2019s best idea</a>\u201d, have to define what they are for and whom they serve. Once-simmering tensions are starting to pop. </p> <p>\u201cThe attacks on public land have become more visible and increasingly agitated, it\u2019s got more muscle in recent years,\u201d said Lynn Scarlett, chief operating officer of the Department of the Interior through George W Bush\u2019s presidency. </p> <p>\u201cMy discussions with Congress used to be about practical things, whether funding was enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this. I didn\u2019t find this general tenor of discussion that was anti-federal land and certainly not sentiments that were anti-national parks.\u201d</p> <p>There is a new crusade by some lawmakers, dubbed the \u201canti-parks caucus\u201d, to unlock more public land to drilling and other development. This is a sharp divergence from the broad consensus forged since Roosevelt, a Republican, spurred the expansion of America\u2019s network of national parks almost 110 years ago. This network now spans 412 federally protected places, including 59 national parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite as well as hundreds of battlefields, monuments and historical trails.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"248aa205b6eed11481468545bd712e4652f83349\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/248aa205b6eed11481468545bd712e4652f83349/30_0_2497_3122/800.jpg\" alt=\"Theodore Roosevelt stands with naturalist John Muir on Glacier Point, above Yosemite Valley in California.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theodore Roosevelt stands with naturalist John Muir on Glacier Point, above Yosemite Valley in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt enthused over the \u201cmajestic beauty\u201d of nature, created five national parks and signed the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm\">Antiquities Act</a>, which allows a president to unilaterally declare a national monument.

It\u2019s almost impossible to find an issue that 95% Americans agree on, but polling suggests <a href=\"https://www.npca.org/articles/693-new-poll-of-likely-voters-finds-unity-in-public-support-for-national-parks\">this is the level of support</a> for federal government protection of national parks. </p> <p>Separate polls show a hefty majority of voters would be unhappy if their representatives stripped protections from public land. A record number of visitors \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/release.htm?id=1775\">almost 305 million</a> \u2013 gazed at the vistas of Yosemite, Yellowstone, Gettysburg and other NPS properties last year.</p> <p>While the NPS could be enjoying a triumphant centennial in 2016, it has to cajole funds from a recalcitrant Congress to deal with crumbling visitor centres, trails, campgrounds and education programs. </p> <p>An overdue maintenance backlog has grown from a headache under George W Bush to a weeping sore under Obama. It will cost nearly $12bn to patch up all of the creaking infrastructure in national parks, at a time when <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/americans-think-national-parks-are-worth-us-92-billion-but-we-dont-fund-them-accordingly-57617\">a recent study</a> found Congress has trimmed the budget of the NPS about 15% over the past 15 years.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not placing a high enough priority on conservation,\u201d said Linda Bilmes, a co-author of the research who sits on the NPS advisory board. \u201cWe have been underinvesting in the long-term work that supports the mission statement of national parks.\u201d </p> <p>The value the American public places on national parks dwarfs the NPS\u2019s $3bn budget, the study found. Eight in 10 voters would be prepared to pay more in taxes to preserve national parks. That could equate to an enormous $92bn annual value of national parks, monuments and historic areas. </p> <p>An unhappy confluence of events has squeezed national parks. Since 2001, a major focus has been put upon national security, overseas wars and economic crisis. The rise of the Tea Party has placed major scrutiny upon new government spending. And while the public has an ongoing love affair with national parks, outdoor spaces aren\u2019t in enough visible distress for an outcry. </p> <p>The result is a feeling of gloom among many who work to protect America\u2019s natural treasures. \u201cPeople who work for NPS have a sense of mission, they are some of the most professional, best-trained civil servants in the US,\u201d said Bilmes. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you speak to the rangers, they\u2019ll say \u2018I used to have six people and now I have one.\u2019 They are feeling overworked and concerned about the challenges they face.\u201d</p> <p>The funding impasse could be alleviated by private philanthropy. Tin-shaking by the NPS has raised $23m in the past year, with Congress matching $10m. </p> <p>Wealthy individuals usually want their name attached to something more grandiose than a repaired walkway. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to attract private funds for repair work,\u201d acknowledged NPS spokesman Jeff Olson. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have people out beating the bushes for deferred maintenance.\u201d</p> <p>What is needed is a high-profile, modern appraisal of the majesty of national parks and the risks of gradual decline.</p> <p> The economic benefit is a key part of the case. Income from pristine parks is far more resilient than the cyclical revenues from mining. There is also a broader, more complex argument about how to maintain a network of protected spaces to nurture threatened species and cleanse the air and water we rely on. Parks surrounded by oil drilling, in North Dakota or elsewhere, risk creating the isolated fragments Sally Jewell fears.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that healthy, intact ecosystems are fundamental to the health of our wildlife \u2013 and our nation,\u201d Jewell said.</p> <p>\u201cBut if their integrity is undermined by a haphazard web of transmission lines, pipelines and roads, where does that leave us 50 years from now? Or 500?</p> <p>\u201cWhat we need is smart planning, on a landscape-level, irrespective of manmade lines on a map. We need to take a holistic look at an ecosystem \u2013 on land or in the ocean \u2013 to determine where it makes sense to develop, where it makes sense to protect the natural resources, and where we can accomplish both.\u201d</p> <p>Long-term planning to save species and tackle climate change seems counter-intuitive to the short-termism gripping American politics. In its 101st year, the NPS will again be in the trenches, deflecting threats, making each dollar stretch, slowly trying to inch its way back to spirit of Roosevelt and his Yosemite camping buddy <a href=\"http://vault.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/life/muir_biography.aspx\">John Muir</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a strong 100 years-plus reason why we have national parks,\u201d said Scarlett. \u201cThey reflect who we are as Americans. They are places of incredible historical, natural and geological renown.</p> <p>\u201cPlaces like Yellowstone attract people from around the world because it is mind-boggling. It isn\u2019t just valuable to Wyoming and Montana, but to the nation and to the world. National parks inspire us and give us identity. If you see them just as states versus the federal government, you are missing the point.</p> <p>\u201cI remain reasonably confident that when push comes to shove, efforts to intrude upon national parks for energy development will be precluded. The strong support of the public will prevail. I just don\u2019t think they will allow it.\u201d</p> <h2>Big Cypress national preserve </h2> <p>There are 12 parks in the NPS system allowing for minerals to be dug up within the park boundaries. Big Cypress national preserve in southern Florida is to be the subject of seismic testing for oil and gas, a scenario worrying some conservationists.</p> <p>\u201cDriving big trucks though the park will disrupt the ecosystem,\u201d said Mark Wenzler, of the National Parks Conservation Association. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t have an absolute right to destroy everything. The last thing you want in a vulnerable ecosystem in Florida is this sort of thing.\u201d</p> <h2>Mojave national preserve</h2> <p>Earlier this year, the federal government gave its blessing to the Ivanpah project, the world\u2019s largest solar development. Situated in the Mojave national preserve, deep in the California desert, the project will provide power for 140,000 homes throughout the west. But there are concerns it will disturb a fragile desert ecosystem, which includes ancient mesquite trees and the endangered desert tortoise.</p> <h2>Theodore Roosevelt national park</h2> <p>During the day, visitors to Theodore Roosevelt national park can see drilling and flaring from sites on all sides of the park. At night, the light from these constructions can hinder stargazing. While fracking has brought new economic activity to North Dakota, some worry development has gone too far, too fast.<br></p> <p>\u201cDestroying the areas directly around national parks is probably not the best idea,\u201d said Winthrop Roosevelt, Teddy\u2019s great-great-grandson. \u201cJust like people don\u2019t want to live right next to chemical plants, national parks next to industrial sites might cause ecological damage.\u201d</p> <h2>National historic trails</h2> <p>The Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring oil from Alberta in Canada to refineries in Illinois and Texas, was seemingly killed off by Barack Obama following vociferous opposition from climate campaigners.</p> <p>But Donald Trump has said he would allow the pipeline to go ahead should he win the presidency. The pipeline would cut across a number of valued hiking routes, including the Pony Express trail and the Lewis and Clark national historic trail.</p>",

But the state was the sort of parent who exposed me to abuse, the kind of parent who never thought about a future for me beyond 18. It\u2019s no wonder I still think about what they could have done to us during that era, when kids were warehoused on an industrial scale. There were 120,000 kids in the care system then \u2013 it\u2019s now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/15/how-do-i-become-a-foster-carer\">down to 70,000</a> after falling to 60,000 a decade ago \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of kids to experiment on.</p> <p>I remember tablets being given out on a daily basis to kids with epilepsy, temper tantrums and a host of other physical and emotional ailments. Most of the teenage girls, some as young as 13, were made to take contraceptive pills. One girl\u2019s experience has stuck in my mind throughout all these passing years. She was forced to have a coil fitted as social workers were worried about sexual abuse in her family. Yet no one seemed to care what she herself felt about this. After it was fitted she was often doubled over in pain and attempted to remove it more than once.</p> <p>Things have changed now, of course. Back then, most kids in care were in homes whereas now many are fostered.

When being assessed she was told by social workers that she was unable to be a carer until she had resolved her childhood issues, which were then 40 years old. So it seems one part of social work knows how important it is to treat emotional issues, but the part that cares for damaged children does not.</p> <p>There is much research into how witnessing violence in childhood has an impact on emotional wellbeing and long-term mental health.

  "<p>Protesters against the badger cull in England have said they plan to change tactics by undertaking direct action to drive up policing costs, after reports of an expansion of culling to new areas. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-37158418\">The BBC has reported</a> that the cull will be extended to five new areas in south-west England \u2013 south Devon, north Devon, north Cornwall, west Dorset and south Herefordshire \u2013 where badger shooting will begin in early September as part of government efforts to eradicate bovine TB.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said no decision had yet been made on where culls might take place, but confirmed that officials were considering new applications. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The shooting of badgers would continue in the areas where it was already taking place, she added. The cull is in its fourth year in Gloucestershire and Somerset and in its second year in Dorset. </p> <p>Jay Tiernan of the protest group Stop the Cull said: \u201cWe have spent the last three years just in the fields ... We haven\u2019t ever once stood outside a farm with a banner or blockaded a road or put locks on to a business\u2019s gates to stop their business from working.\u201d</p> <p>To date, the campaign has focused on disrupting the killing of badgers by discovering where the shooting would take place and by breaking traps. Tiernan said: \u201cWe are going to change that to specifically look at policing costs ... We are going to start looking at making the culls expensive.\u201d</p> <p>The group has previously been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/23/badger-cull-animal-rights-group-names-farmers\">publishing a list of farmers involved in the cull</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35121632\">Almost 1,500 badgers were killed</a> during last year\u2019s badger cull, according to Defra. The government described the effort as a success.</p> <p>The continuation of the cull under Theresa May\u2019s government will disappoint campaigners and scientific experts who had hoped that the policy would be dropped under the new prime minister.</p> <p>Within days of May entering No 10, a group of scientists, including some of those behind a \u00a350m trial conducted in 2007 that showed culling was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\">not effective at reducing TB</a> in cattle, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/badger-cull-expansion-flies-in-face-of-scientific-evidence\">called on her to end the \u201cfailed\u201d policy</a>.</p> <p>At the time Defra was reported to be considering up to 29 applications across nine counties including Cheshire, Cornwall and Herefordshire. </p> <p>Bovine TB reportedly led to the slaughter of <a href=\"https://www.fginsight.com/news/tb-toll-on-the-rise-as-36000-cattle-slaughtered-in-2015-10767\">36,000 infected cattle in 2015</a>, an increase of about 10% on the year before and costing taxpayers about \u00a3100m. But the scientists say the cull has had little effect on the spread of the disease and may even have increased infections. </p> <p>Professors John Bourne, Rosie Woodroffe and Ranald Munro wrote to May: \u201cWe urge you to review the considerable evidence that culling badgers is a risky, costly, and inhumane tool in the fight against bovine TB. We submit to you that expanding this unpromising programme would fly in the face of scientific evidence. We publicly call on you at this time to halt \u2013 not expand \u2013 the failed badger cull.\u201d<br></p> <p>The cull has received the backing of some farmers\u2019 groups. Ross Murray, president of the CLA, which represents farmers and landowners, said: \u201cThe badger cull is one important part of a comprehensive strategy which also includes pre- and post-movement testing of cattle, the removal and slaughter of infected animals and vaccination.</p> <p>\u201cBovine TB is a devastating disease that is causing misery for dairy and livestock farmers across the countryside. It is vital that all those involved in the cull have the support of local people and law enforcement as they carry out this important task.\u201d </p> <p>An RSPCA spokesman described the prospect of an extended cull as \u201calarming\u201d. David Bowles, head of public affairs, said the charity had concerns about the humaneness of shooting badgers, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe an extension of the badger cull will solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle. It ignores all the scientific evidence that indicates a cull will not achieve this.\u201d</p> <p>A Defra spokeswoman said: \u201cNatural England is currently considering applications for further badger control licences as part of the usual licensing process. England has the highest incidence of TB in Europe and that is why we are taking strong action to deliver our 25-year strategy to eradicate the disease and protect the future of our dairy and beef industries.</p> <p>\u201cBadger control in areas where TB is rife is one part of our long-term plan, which also includes strengthening cattle testing and movement controls and improving biosecurity on farms and when trading.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: \u201cAfter four years of badger culling, no one can now doubt that the policy has been a disastrous failure on scientific, cost and humaneness grounds. </p> <p>\u201cFor the new Defra secretary of state, Andrea Leadsom, to ignore the facts and extend this policy into five new areas of the country defies belief.\u201d</p> <p>Defra has not said when its decision on new applications will be announced.</p>",

A strip of activated carbon on the inside takes care of chemicals and smells.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The theory behind the filtration is really quite simple. The Pure Cool Link pulls air through a fine mesh filter and fires it out through one of the company\u2019s air multiplier fan designs.</p> <p>The 360-degree glass HEPA filter can capture up to 99.95% of pollutants - anything over 0.1microns. In the air trapped in the filter there is pollen, spokes, smoke, dust and other irritants. The filter also has activated carbon, similar to that used in cooker hoods, to trap any chemicals in the air, thus removing smells and pollutants.</p> <p>The cleaned air is then piped through to the paperclip-like loop, directing the air forward with force and sucking air through the back of the loop as it does so, amplifying the airflow.</p> <h2>Controls + App</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e54e742b3b68f55024610523be7ff5934a8a5f63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e54e742b3b68f55024610523be7ff5934a8a5f63/514_622_3943_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson Pure Cool Link review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The small remote is easy to use and convenient, but all of its functions are also replicated by the Dyson Link app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are two ways to control the Pure Link Cool. As with every other Dyson fan, there\u2019s a small infrared remote for turning on the fan, increasing or decreasing its power, setting it to oscillate or operate on a timer. There\u2019s also a button for putting it into night mode, which limits the fan strength to four or less and dims the LED display on the front.</p> <p>Pressing the \u201cauto\u201d button allows the fan to control itself in response to the quality of the air in the room at the time, turning on and cleaning the air when required.</p> <p>If you choose to the connect the fan to Wi-Fi \u2013 you do not have to \u2013 you can also control it using the Dyson Link app for Android or iOS. The app provides information on filter life, telling you when you need to change it \u2013 which is roughly once a year depending the quality of air in your house \u2013 and set schedules for it to run on a daily or weekly basis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83b9ae2d0d036f88abfea7f532d2a140e44b5d1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83b9ae2d0d036f88abfea7f532d2a140e44b5d1a/0_0_4320_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson Pure Cool Link review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"593\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dyson Link app provides all the information you might need about your purifier and allows remote operation from anywhere with an internet connection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Users can also get an instant reading of the air quality around the fan and the air quality outdoors, and a chart showing air quality throughout the day or week and how often the purifier was active.

It\u2019s quite robust, so moving it from place to place \u2013say in the living room in the during the day and bedroom at night \u2013 isn\u2019t a problem. Appreciatively clearing a small living room of pollen for a hay fever suffer took only around 20 minutes or so and with the purifier set to automatic, it maintained a pollen-free haven even at the heights of suffering.</p> <p>It also removed smells quite effectively and while kept under level four out of 10 fan speed, was quiet enough to not disrupt TV watching or similar. There were occasions where the fan would kick up to level six or so, if not put into night mode, which made hearing dialogue difficult without high volumes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ae1e0536d2e3e6cdc48042ec7149599a340675e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ae1e0536d2e3e6cdc48042ec7149599a340675e/0_119_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson Pure Cool Link review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The small screen on the base shows the fan speed, timer duration, whether the Pure Cool Link is in automatic or connected to Wi-Fi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a fan the Pure Cool Link isn\u2019t as effective as the Dyson\u2019s other models. At the same fan speed it seems to push a smaller volume of air, meaning that to cool you from across the room requires it to be turned up pretty high. On level 10, the airflow is relatively strong, but it makes a lot of noise doing it, making it hard to do anything else in the room at the same time. It cannot compete with the airflow of an old Panasonic 60cm, high-quality bladed fan for air flow.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7106f55eb0dc6917b56d7bb8211146c42c3d57e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7106f55eb0dc6917b56d7bb8211146c42c3d57e8/0_0_4682_2810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson Pure Cool Link review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two small buttons, one either side of the fan, depress to unclip the top loop from the base for cleaning and changing the filter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Changing the filter is a two-second job.

The merits of air purification and the need for it in British homes can be debated, but there\u2019s no doubt the purifier works. It rapidly cleans the air in any room you put it in, keeps it clean and provides much needed respite for allergy suffers, particularly in the summer months.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t the best fan in the world, though, making a significant amount of noise when pushed to the limit, but is pretty quiet at low levels and easily quiet enough to not disrupt my sleep.</p> <p>The connected app is really interesting, and gives you a visual readout of what it\u2019s been doing all day when left in automatic, while the small hand remote makes controlling it from bed or the sofa easy.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly a standout statement in any room, but whether that ease of use and design is worth the price depends on how much you value air quality or whether you suffer from allergies. Other purifiers will probably do as good a job for significantly less money, but its likely none do it while looking as good.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> easy to use, easy to clean and change the filter, excellent data read-out, simple remote, automatic monitoring and operation, scheduling, rapid cleaning, doubles as a fan</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive, can be quite loud when pushed, may not complement your decor</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13dad9f55b27fe937096a85384fe5d9d5afc4bb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13dad9f55b27fe937096a85384fe5d9d5afc4bb5/0_181_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson Pure Cool Link review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The turbine-like fan that sucks air in through the filter and fires it up through the loop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/15/dyson-hot-cool-am09-review-worlds-best-heater-fan\">Dyson Hot + Cool AM09 review: the world\u2019s best heater fan?</a><br></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/18/dyson-cool-am06-review-desk-fan\">Dyson Cool AM06 review: is this the world\u2019s most luxurious desk fan?</a></strong><br></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>To find <a href=\"https://discountcode.theguardian.com/uk/dyson\">discount codes for Dyson</a> and other large retailers, visit <a href=\"https://discountcode.theguardian.com/uk/dyson\">discountcode.theguardian.com</a></strong></p>",

In June last year the Syrian regime, supported by Hezbollah militias, attacked the nearby town of Zabadani, causing a huge wave of people to flee to Madaya. We now have 35,000 displaced people living here, which is around three times the usual number of residents.</p> <p>People have been trying to grow vegetables to feed the expanded population, but these attempts have been doomed to fail because of an acute water crisis in the region. The fresh water network is completely disrupted because of shelling. This means the only way to obtain fresh water has been to buy very expensive tanks of it or to transport it in plastic containers or gallon-tanks fed by plastic pipes laid from springs in the town. There are three freshwater springs nearby, including the Bukain spring, which the regime and the Hezbollah militias are trying to gain control of \u2013 sniper fire is aimed at anyone trying to approach.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our town has become a pawn; used by the regime to put pressure on opposition fighters the Free Syrian Army</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of those victims was my niece. According to the doctor\u2019s report, the bullet that hit Ghina shattered her thigh bone. For eight days, our family listened to Ghina\u2019s screams as she suffered without painkillers. She was crying and begging someone to relieve the pain: \u201cI cannot bear the pain \u2026 it was not my fault, I was only going to drink water. I want to run and play like other children do and I want to be able to walk again. I don\u2019t want them to cut my leg off. I promise you I will come back to Madaya after the operation. I just want you to get me out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Our town has become a pawn; used by the regime to put pressure on opposition fighters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/01/whos-who-syrian-conflict-russian-airstrikes\">the Free Syrian Army </a>in Zabadani. The roads leading to us have been blocked with barriers and barbed wire. Mines were laid in the surrounding agricultural land, preventing food and medical supplies. This has led to a serious food and health crisis. More than 180 people have died from hunger, a shortage of drugs and medical supplies, or have been killed by mines or sniper fire while attempting to flee. The siege has lasted 500 days so far, despite a truce that began in September which has slowed the bombing and allowed some humanitarian aid to get through. However, the blockade is still in place and the aid which has reached us is not nearly enough.</p> <p>Madaya today has not received any aid for more than 100 days. Everyone, without exception, is suffering from a shortage of calcium and many are malnourished and anaemic. Recently, more than 45 cases of typhoid were recorded, most of them among women and children, and there are no drugs or antibiotics available.</p> <p>We are lucky enough to have family members in the UK and through their help we managed to launch an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-37118770\">international campaign</a> to get Ghina the medical assistance she needed. She was eventually evacuated to Damascus via the Syrian Red Cresent. My family and I were hugely relieved, but tension spread when other families with ill children discovered that Ghina would be evacuated from Madaya, while their loved ones would not. Some in the town said Ghina couldn\u2019t leave alone without other children being evacuated. After intense negotiations with our family and the Hezbollah militias, Ghina was evacuated in the middle of the night. The next day, we tried to keep our good news quiet, but news travels fast in a besieged town.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/omran-picture-turning-point-syria-war-aleppo-david-nott\">Omran\u2019s picture must be a turning point in Syria\u2019s war | David Nott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the following days I was bombarded with requests from other Madaya residents to help their children. Thankfully the humanitarian groups that had helped us continued to put pressure on the regime to evacuate 14 other children in need of urgent care, including 11-year-old Yemaan who had been diagnosed with meningitis. And on Friday the Syrian Red Crescent was able to rescue 36 children from Madaya and rebel-held Foaa and Kefraya.</p> <p>But after Omran, Yemaan and Ghina, what now? The situation in Madaya is only getting worse and many more children will get ill. I\u2019m convinced many will die if the siege is not broken. Winter is coming and many are spending what little they have stocking up on fire wood and dried beans.</p> <p>Everyone is worried about the coming months, there are very few supplies and the entire town is relying on more aid to make it in. We urge the UN to keep getting food parcels into us, especially flour, rice and milk for babies. We are all hostages of the regime\u2019s war game, and we just want to be free to go. Don\u2019t forget about us, world. We are living in an open air prison.

  "<p>Whoever came up with the phrase \u201cno rest for the weary\u201d obviously didn\u2019t follow the NFL. </p> <p>The best NFL teams each season fight to earn one of the coveted top two seeds in the playoffs. Not because it earns them a trophy or a banner \u2013 although it\u2019s the kind of thing the Indianapolis Colts <a href=\"https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-11-at-4-08-03-pm.png?w=1000\">would definitely deem banner-worthy</a> \u2013 but because it gives players a week off and a home game. Then there\u2019s the teams that do so well in the regular season that they have nothing left to play for by late December, earning their top players extra recovery time in Week 17, as well. </p> <p>Time off. Rest. Being at home. NFL teams clearly find these things to be important. And for good reason. Professional football is a brutal sport that leaves every player bruised, battered and hobbled after playing a full 16-game season. <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/ePbqVm5JI7V\">Even the punters</a>. There\u2019s no way around it, save for getting some unscheduled time off. </p> <p>Yet resting players late in the season doesn\u2019t produce the results most teams hope. Fewer than 25% of Super Bowl champions over the past 22 seasons had a first-round bye in the playoffs. Once the postseason begins, it\u2019s often the teams with momentum and a regular rhythm going that have proven to be the toughest to beat, not those just waking up from a winter\u2019s nap. </p> <p>We saw a glimmer of this last season even with the No1 seed in the AFC winning the Super Bowl. Carolina raced to a 14-0 mark in the regular season, but then lost two of their final five. The Panthers likely peaked too early and were beaten by a Broncos team that had Peyton Manning playing his best football (which still wasn\u2019t that great) after using the middle of the regular season to get healthy and let his body recover. Maybe Cam Newton would have played better in February if he took some time off in November. We\u2019ll never know.</p> <p>What we do know is that the bye week(s) v momentum question puts coaches in a tough position. Do they try to avoid a playoff bye to ensure their players keep plugging along no mattered how injured and exhausted they are? Or do they try to let their veterans relax in late December and early January and hope their players can suddenly turn the switch back to ON when a peaking underdog comes to town? It\u2019s almost a lose-lose. </p> <p>If only there was a way to give players a break, keep them healthy and have them rolling in mid-season form for the playoffs. Perhaps we\u2019ve accidentally hit upon the one area in which Roger Goodell can be useful after all.</p> <p>Goodell is a disaster in most every area under purview of his job description. That\u2019s not in question. But if there\u2019s anything the NFL commissioner does well, it\u2019s giving wildly arbitrary and often undeserved fines and suspensions. In the last six weeks we\u2019ve seen Tom Brady have his four-game suspension for ball deflation/cell phone etiquette upheld and Le\u2019Veon Bell get three games for missing drug tests for a natural, non-performance-enhancing substance that is legal in a growing number of US states. Two of the NFL\u2019s biggest stars, playing for two of the biggest Super Bowl favorites, given time off by the commissioner to watch from home while their lesser opponents go out and slaughter themselves for the first month of the season. As punishments go, they\u2019re pretty great.</p> <p>Brady and Bell surely want to play Week 1, but it\u2019s only because they have yet to realize they\u2019ve lucked into what could be the NFL\u2019s new market inefficiency: using suspensions as a way to keep players healthy and in midseason form for the postseason. </p> <p>No team is doing this yet. But maybe they should. Many pundits have already said that Brady\u2019s suspension will ultimately help the Patriots \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/12/why-tom-bradys-deflategate-ban-may-well-help-the-new-england-patriots\">yours truly included</a> \u2013 so aren\u2019t planned and purposeful suspensions the next logical step? And, no, no one is advocating Greg Hardy-type actions to earn a suspension via Goodell\u2019s Wheel Of Punishments. Victimless, non-violent crimes only, please. Your small amount of marijuana possessions, your repeated uniform violations, your refusal to turn your cell phone over to one of the America\u2019s creepiest corporate executives (a very crowded field, to be sure). The goal of time off can be achieved with the little, stupid stuff that gets NFL players banned. Stuff far from the Aaron Hernandez neighborhood of wrongdoing. </p> <p>Just last week, under threat of suspension by Goodell, defensive stars James Harrison, Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers caved and agreed to answer the league\u2019s questions about allegations made against them in a 2015 Al-Jazeera report. </p> <p>What a missed opportunity. Harrison is 38. Peppers is 36. Matthews is 30. All three are at a stage in their career in which their bodies could use a few extra weeks off during the season. And each plays for a team that should be able to handle making the postseason even without them in the lineup for a portion of the schedule \u2013 same as with Brady and Bell. Why not skip the interviews, take a four-game suspension, a come back with energy and an edge right when the games really start to matter? <br>Turning Goodell\u2019s one, true love of suspensions against him would be the ultimate F-you to a commissioner the majority of NFL players despise, Harrison chief among them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jharrison9292/status/509832809570377729\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nflcommish\">@nflcommish</a> ain&#39;t no fun when the rabbit got the gun huh?</p>&mdash; James Harrison (@jharrison9292) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jharrison9292/status/509832809570377729\">September 10, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Goodell has over-punished during his tenure to such a degree that there\u2019s no stigma left to getting suspended. Brady isn\u2019t being dropped by sponsors or booed around Boston. What\u2019s the worst that could happen if players start openly trying to get time off? Goodell gets wind of the strategy and suspends them for it? The man would lose his mind. There\u2019s no bad outcome here. </p> <p>Coaches want their players to stay healthy and fresh, but they also want them building momentum late in the season. It just might be that getting suspended early in the season is the only way to do both. Come on, NFL teams. Think outside the box. Especially if thinking outside the box is something that can earn a suspension. <br><br></p>",
  "<p>When Donald Trump visited the Indian city of Pune, his private jet was so large that he was forced to wait on board for nearly an hour while airport staff cobbled together a makeshift landing ramp for him to come down to earth. </p> <p>According to his business partner Atul Chordia, Trump remained jovial despite the glitch during his grand entrance in August 2014. \u201cHe was joking around with the staff \u2013 he could have made a scene about it, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Chordia in a telephone interview. \u201cHe was nice, friendly.

The bizarre return of Are You Being Served?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This series of one-off specials \u2013 which, in an era of cultural nostalgia, may possibly result in new series being commissioned \u2013 will certainly help the BBC with any monitoring of birth-date diversity. Hyacinth\u2019s creator, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0164983/\">Roy Clarke</a>, 86, has written the script about her, while the original writers of Porridge, 80-year-old <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/462850/\">Ian La Frenais and 78-year-old Dick Clement</a>, have also scripted its continuation. Only the shop comedy has brought in new blood, with <a href=\"http://www.derrenlitten.com/\">Derren Litten</a>, creator of the ITV holiday comedy Benidorm, standing in for the late Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft.</p> <p>Each show has been revived in a different way. Clement and La Frenais have set their episode in the present-day. Nigel Norman Fletcher, grandson of the inmate played by Ronnie Barker on BBC1 from 1974-77, is serving a five-year stretch for cybercrime at Wakely, a C-list prison, rather than the higher-security Slade of the original series. The new Are You Being Served? takes place in 1988, three years after the comedy ended its 13-year run on BBC1. Located in the 1950s, before its protagonist gained by marriage her shaming surname, Young Hyacinth is even more of a period piece.</p> <p>The challenge in reviving a situation comedy is how much of the sit can be changed without losing the com. Are You Being Served? is most obviously a cover version. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0914327/\">Jason Watkins</a>, as Mr Humphries, and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382137/\">Sherrie Hewson</a>\u2019s Mrs Slocombe offer karaoke acting, more or less copying the intonations, body language and costumes of John Inman and Mollie Sugden. And, though supposedly translated to the final Thatcher administration, the shop occupies, as it always did, the England of the 1960s, when the Carry On movies were at their height. Although Litten is only 45, his Grace Bros finds display space for many jokes much older than he is.

The maven of ladies\u2019 fashions makes numerous references to her \u201cpussy\u201d, although the new scriptwriter doesn\u2019t always seem to appreciate that the best double entendres work both ways, as in Lloyd\u2019s and Croft\u2019s frequent variations in the area of: \u201cThe hairs on my pussy stood up on end.\u201d</p> <p>There was also a pleasure, in the show\u2019s first incarnation, in suspecting that the BBC censors might not have been feline enough in their suspicion. In a line that Litten gives Hewson \u2013 \u201cMy pussy had a sneezing fit\u201d \u2013 the audience, the other characters and the BBC editorial compliance department are so in on the gag that it\u2019s effectively a single entendre.</p> <p>The introduction of a new character, trouser department novice Mr Conway (<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bimadewunmi/keep-it-locked-yeah\">Kayode Ewumi</a>), is in line with the main innovation of the Landmark Sitcoms project: more diverse casting. Nigel Norman Fletcher is sent down by a black judge, although, to be fair to the original 1974-77 series, it was ahead of its time in the non-white character of Tony Osoba\u2019s McLaren. The 1950s rural young womanhood of the pre-Bucket Hyacinth also features a racially mixed community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45b57fe379ea99ea22375277d0cd3c36e357e7db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45b57fe379ea99ea22375277d0cd3c36e357e7db/0_81_4383_2629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Watkins and Kayode Ewumi in are You Being Served?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Watkins and Kayode Ewumi in are You Being Served?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Kershaw/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the new Porridge, Clement and La Frenais, having gone down the route of Fletcher: The Next But One Generation for their central character, also shadow the classic series in other ways. Dialogue reveals the current whereabouts of the original Fletch and of Lenny Godber, the cellmate played by Richard Beckinsale, while Mr Meekie, a twitchily suspicious Scottish warder, is in name and manner a soundalike for Fulton Mackay as Officer Mackay.</p> <p>In the tradition of other recent TV prequels such as Young Morse and Rock and Chips (imagining the earlier years of the characters in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/aug/21/only-fools-and-horses-nicholas-lyndhurst\">Only Fools and Horses</a>), Young Hyacinth seeks to show the development of the personality of a later stand-out character. It was clear in Keeping Up Appearances, the BBC1 series that ran from 1990-95, that Patricia Routledge\u2019s Mrs Bucket came from a lower-class family with people and secrets that threatened to embarrass her carefully elevated status. Clarke expands this background \u2013 an alcoholic, philandering dad, sisters who mock Hyacinth\u2019s snobbery \u2013 in a show in which Kerry Howard has little choice except to impersonate Routledge\u2019s delivery.</p> <p>In parallel to this BBC1 trio of humour reboots, BBC4 will run new takes on three earlier hit comedies: Hancock\u2019s Half Hour and Steptoe &amp; Son (both written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson) and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/tilldeathusdopart/\">Till Death Us Do Part</a>, in which writer Johnny Speight and actor Warren Mitchell gave voice to the bigot Alf Garnett.</p> <p>It would be interesting to know what staunch West Ham Utd supporter Alf made of the club\u2019s new Olympic-legacy London Stadium, but, although Galton and Simpson are still available at 86, these shows are remakes of original scripts rather than updates. As Alf, Simon Day bravely avoids an imitation of Mitchell, especially the elongated wheedling tone that the formative performer brought to Alf\u2019s it-stands-to-reason speeches. Playing safe, the BBC has chosen an episode that contains none of the racism, which Speight and Mitchell were satirising rather than endorsing, but which would be too high risk for TV today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d41acc047634088bceac7bda35e353b6dc6dcc2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d41acc047634088bceac7bda35e353b6dc6dcc2a/0_197_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Day as Alf Garnett, Lizzie Roper as Else, Sydney Rae White as Rita and Carl Au as Mike as they star in an episode of Till Death Us Do Part.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Day as Alf Garnett, Lizzie Roper as Else, Sydney Rae White as Rita and Carl Au as Mike as they star in an episode of Till Death Us Do Part.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Peebles/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the plot of this Till Death Us Do Part revolves around a public phone box, it will be science fiction for any younger members of the audience who tune in, although it must be questionable that many will.

  "<h2>Todd Solondz, director</h2> <p>After the failure in 1989 of my debut <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nN1Tj3Ac40\">Fear, Anxiety &amp; Depression</a>, an ill-conceived, ill-begotten project, I left the film business for several years and taught English to Russian immigrants. I was terrified of failing again, and irretrievably so \u2013 I don\u2019t know that I would have survived. But I didn\u2019t want that first movie to have the last word.<br></p> <p>I started writing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTCoF7ZQG0E\">Welcome to the Dollhouse</a> around the time of that first film. I couldn\u2019t think of any American films that dealt in any serious way with childhood. Children in American films were either cute like a little doll or evil demons. The early drafts of Dollhouse were all darker and more depressing; it took time to find the right level of bleakness. My hope was the film would succeed well enough to let me make a living doing after-school specials [educational TV films for teenagers].<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a5b11482ce75561693204c7dcddbcc76713bcf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a5b11482ce75561693204c7dcddbcc76713bcf4/0_122_4094_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brendan Sexton and Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Each take made Heather\u2019s mother more and more uncomfortable\u2019 \u2026 Matarazzo with Brendan Sexton in Welcome to the Dollhouse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Film Pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was [lead character] Dawn Wiener a version of me?

We sometimes worked in the middle of the night, which wasn\u2019t really legal in the US, certainly with child actors. Heather, who I\u2019d chosen to play Dawn, was a feisty girl who always had the energy and desire to work beyond what was required. Her mother was on set every day; there was certainly visible in Heather a kind of rebelliousness to go to places beyond what her mother felt comfortable with. On the second day of shooting, she had to kiss her tormentor, Brandon (played by Brendan Sexton). Each successive take made her mother more and more uncomfortable. That was Heather\u2019s first kiss.<br></p> <p>I had wanted to call the film Faggots and Retards, but I knew I had to be responsible if I wanted it to sell. The working title had been Middle Child \u2013 something that could have been a Disney film \u2013 because I didn\u2019t want to attract any undue attention. When you\u2019re dealing with children and sexuality, you have to be cautious. In the end, I took the title from the song in the movie. The poster was my concept: cut-out letters from different magazines and newspapers that the kidnapper in the film might have used. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Interviewers would say, \u201cHow does it feel to play an ugly girl?\u201d What I'd hear was: \u201cHow does it feel to be so ugly?\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because a lot of people who had seen the rough cut were sceptical about the film\u2019s content, I wasn\u2019t just being paranoid when I expected it to fail. But when it sold to Sony Classics after Toronto film festival, I knew it was going places. It was a seismic shift in my life that I was capable of making a movie with such an impact. I was happy when I won the Grand Jury prize at Sundance in 1996 \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t be? It\u2019s nice to win prizes, it brings out the child in everyone. <br></p> <h2>Heather Matarazzo, actor</h2> <p>I was due to audition for one of Dawn\u2019s friends, a role that ended up being cut. But Todd asked me to read for the lead. I was very candid about the script \u2013 I didn\u2019t censor myself when I was young. I thought it was a PG version of what happened in junior high, and I said as much. Todd just did that nodding of the head, that slight smile \u2013 \u201cOh, reeeallly!\u201d \u2013 that he has mastered so well.

Working with Todd was a silent, intuitive collaboration. My mother definitely had some reservations, though. In an earlier version, Brandon actually raped me. But I was very persistent and very adamant that this script was incredibly honest and spoke to me: the concept of a young woman who isn\u2019t necessarily popular, doesn\u2019t have any friends, and yet survives. My heroes at the time were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU5bQ7W4c6k\">Vivien Leigh in Gone With the Wind</a>, Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz \u2013 other underdogs. </p> <p>They didn\u2019t fly me out to Toronto or Sundance, because of the expense, I think. It felt like having helped set up the party, then not being invited to it. I went into seventh grade that following year, so I was entering into the experience I had just done on film. When Dollhouse came out, there was definitely an element of kids being jealous. Acting like little assholes. I said to myself: I\u2019m doing what I love right now. And you\u2019ve probably peaked already.<br></p> <p>I refused to play Dawn again when Todd brought her back in 2004\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/103223/palindromes\">Palindromes</a> [Solondz resurrects Dawn again in Weiner Dog, played by Greta Gerwig].

On the one hand, absolute control and exultation in what a human body can achieve in the water; on the other, the appalling tragedy that can result when we lose control \u2013 all the more awful because it can happen so quickly \u2013 in the act of having fun.</p> <p>I never learned to swim until I was in my late 20s. Despite being born and brought up in a city by the sea, I feared it, and its power. I know many people share that trauma: pretending you\u2019ve got a cold when everyone else goes to the swimming baths.

That tension stays with us, in our relationship to the water.</p> <p>There are many contradictions at work here. Some people who decline to take part in competitive sport \u2013 often because they were put off it for life by experiences at school \u2013 look to swimming not for exercise, but for a kind of meditation or release. This certainly lies behind the appeal of \u201cwild swimming\u201d.

I dislike swimming \u201cbetween the flags\u201d on public beaches. I feel as though I\u2019m under surveillance, even in the wilderness offered by a wide open Cornish strand. But I know I\u2019d thank God for the presence of a lifeguard if anything went wrong.</p> <p>I swim in the sea, every day. I sometimes swim in the dark, if that\u2019s when the tide falls. People tell me to be careful, to tell others where I\u2019m going, to take a phone with me. What would be the point? Even if I did own a phone, you can\u2019t put it in your trunks (which I don\u2019t wear either). I was once caught in a rip tide off Brighton beach. I remember thinking, as I realised I may not make it back, how banal it would be to drown within sight of a dual carriageway and a row of fish\u2019n\u2019chip shops.</p> <p>In winter storms we are warned not to go near the sea, for fear it might engulf us, as if its tentacles might reach out and drag us in. A Welsh quarry pond was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-36997347\">dyed</a> this summer to deter potential swimmers. School swimming lessons are threatened by the lack of facilities. In the US, even as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/michael-phelps-olympic-career-swimming-gold\">Michael Phelps</a> was winning yet another medal, a report was released showing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/american-swimming-heritage-michael-phelps-thoreau-hepburn\">54% of the population</a> could not pass a swimming test.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8bAbEFT_54\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g8bAbEFT_54?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A child takes a dive off the cliffs in prewar Torquay</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Fear of the water is institutionalised, and our sense of the wild and the outdoors has been steadily taken away from us.

I was working in a big urban comprehensive. There wasn\u2019t much homework going on and I\u2019d been in the middle of more than one lesson when the police had arrived to have a chat with someone. The kids were always there for their exams though. And they got what I expected.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m a headteacher.

I also didn\u2019t take eight level 2 qualifications at 16 either, so I personally wouldn\u2019t show in the Progress 8 measures. Some children will never attain grade Cs in maths and English, no matter how many times they try. This should not make them or their schools failures.</p> <p>There has been an unprecedented clampdown on \u201cgaming\u201d \u2013 when schools did everything they could to improve headline figures. But I\u2019d say this went too far. Some of the alternative qualifications were genuinely better for some kids and it\u2019s not fair on others not to allow retakes. Coursework was a good preparation for university, too. These were sacrificed for the sake of the headline A*-C scores and in schools like mine that is bad for the students. There is an obsession by already-advantaged parents with the league tables and with the schools at the top of them. Comprehensive education is becoming far less comprehensive in some areas of the country.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t really matter that I\u2019d like a fairer system for the children and also for the teachers.

  "<h2>The big story</h2> <p>There are few shows that show the disparity between what critics like and what viewers watch than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/23/mrs-browns-boys-voted-best-sitcom-of-century\">Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys</a>. It is regularly and savagely panned by critics, yet is one of the BBC\u2019s most consistent ratings winners. </p> <p>And like most references to popularity on the BBC at the moment, it raises the question of whether or not this is the kind of programming the corporation should be making. </p> <p>The problem is that many popular shows are disliked by the BBC\u2019s critics because they are a) not the sort of shows they personally want to watch, and b) are so popular they have an impact on the number of people tuning into commercial TV. But if you asked the many millions of people who regularly tune into Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys, it\u2019s unlikely they would say the BBC should be making something that keeps the critics happy instead. </p> <h2>MediaGuardian\u2019s top stories</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"411504820bf4407fd7ef0ad0b59df696b75156f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/411504820bf4407fd7ef0ad0b59df696b75156f2/0_126_3783_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Dimbleby has renewed his contract to host Question Time\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Dimbleby has renewed his contract to host Question Time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Crossick/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/22/dimbleby-signs-new-bbc-question-time-contract-starting-with-labour-debate\"><strong>Dimbleby signs new Question Time contract starting with Labour debate</strong></a></p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/melania-trump-lawsuit-daily-mail\"><strong>Melania Trump pursues Daily Mail over \u2018100% false\u2019 rumors about her past</strong></a> </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/mail-on-sunday-reporter-iraq-mark-nicol-islamic-state\"><strong>Mail on Sunday removes photo of reporter posing with gun in Iraq</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/jeremy-kyle-show-sex-orgasm-comments-easter-sunday-show\"><strong>Jeremy Kyle Show rapped over sex and orgasm comments on Easter Sunday</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/fox-news-brexit-eu-referendum-bbc-ofcom\"><strong>Fox News broke broadcasting rules with pro-Brexit views on EU referendum day</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/complaints-channel-4-news-hijab-the-sun-kelvin-mackenzie-fatima-manji\"><strong>Complaints about Channel 4 News presenter wearing hijab rejected</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/bbc-jeremy-clarkson-top-gear-mark-thompson\"><strong>BBC should have tried to keep Jeremy Clarkson, says ex-director general</strong></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/talksport-brexit-ad-wireless-group\"><strong>TalkSport owner hit by Brexit ad slowdown but scores with Euro 2016</strong></a></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/bbc-youth-viewing-bbc3-tv-itv2-e4\">BBC sees almost 20% drop in youth viewing after BBC3 TV channel axed</a></strong></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"686822fc3fcc9a60c9df1fa6f3fa6542a7fe16c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/686822fc3fcc9a60c9df1fa6f3fa6542a7fe16c6/0_164_3940_2364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Speedo have dropped their sponsorship of Ryan Lochte\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speedo has dropped its sponsorship of Ryan Lochte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Pennington/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Starter for ten: </strong>The Telegraph tells the story of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/08/22/how-britain-fell-in-love-with-the-highbrow-game-show/\">how the UK fell in love with the highbrow gameshow</a></p> <p><strong>Tight call: </strong>Speedo has <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/ryan-lochte-speedo-sponsors-drop-1201842000/\">dropped its sponsorship of Ryan Lochte</a> over his controversial time in Rio, says Variety</p> <p><strong>King content:</strong> News UK has <a href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/news-uk-poaches-trinity-mirrors-mark-field-head-content-arm/1406373\">poached Trinity Mirror\u2019s head of innovation</a> to run its new branded content studios, reports Campaign</p> <p><strong>Tune out:</strong> Acting head of the culture select committee Damian Collins is <a href=\"https://t.co/rS8TkJYqDS\">not too keen on the idea of James Purnell being lined up to head BBC radio</a>, says the FT (\u00a3)</p> <h2>And finally...</h2> <p>While many appear to have lauded the BBC for its Rio Olympics coverage, a big sporting event wouldn\u2019t be complete without someone (in this case the Guardian\u2019s Stuart Heritage) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/22/john-inverdale-the-bbcs-biggest-olympic-fails\">pointing out all the things that went wrong</a>.

  "<p>A day before the Northern Territory government went into caretaker mode, it secretly arranged for a Texas-based coal company to potentially extend its explorations licence over 15,000 sq km in central Australia.</p> <p>The arrangement, under a rarely used mechanism which allows legislative requirements including public submissions to be bypassed, was the result of more than 18 months\u2019 work, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/sweetheart-coal-deal-locked-in-before-nt-poll/news-story/82da87f5228eb048b3ef756e52a5008d\">the Australian reported</a>.</p> <p>The revelations have raised questions about the NT government\u2019s timing ahead of Saturday\u2019s election, and about the viability of such a project, which one financial analyst said would be a \u201cstranded asset\u201d before it was even finished.</p> <p>But the Department of Mines and Energy has said the process is \u201coperational work\u201d and can continue during caretaker mode. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/20/full-holes-australia-mining-boom-permanent-scars\">Full of holes: why Australia's mining boom will leave permanent scars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tri-Star holds 23 thermal coal exploration licences, covering about 10% of the 15,000 sq km Pedirka basin south of Alice Springs. Just under half of them expired on 9 August. The rest are expected to expire over the next two years, but the licences can also be surrendered at any time by the holder.</p> <p>On 5 August the NT government gazette revealed all 23 would become \u201cgeneral reserve\u201d land, a designation which is usually used to protect areas from potential threats but which is open to other applications, including a mineral authority.</p> <p>A mineral authority allows the minister for mines and energy to waive requirements under the act, including seeking public comment, and to grant a title for as long as deemed appropriate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary title because the minister can grant or renew it for a period of time they consider appropriate,\u201d said David Morris, principal lawyer for the Environmental Defenders\u2019 Office NT.</p> <p>\u201cYou can have a mineral authority for exploration, but you can tailor all the conditions for that mineral authority in a way you couldn\u2019t tailor an exploration licence. The minister can choose to exempt or exclude any provision of the act.\u201d</p> <p>When an area is deemed general reserve a company can lodge an application on \u201cfirst come first served\u201d basis for a mineral authority \u2013 as Tri-Star did for the 23 areas on the day the gazette was released, thereby preventing other companies from applying. </p> <p>The gazette of the Pedirka basin land came with the caveats that uranium exploration was off the table, that the only mineral title that could be applied for was a mineral authority, and that only coal developers could apply for that mineral authority.</p> <p>It is understood the mineral authority will be published tomorrow, probably with the corresponding title of exploration. Although production could be allowed, it would be unlikely given the size of the potential project and the further government approvals a coal mine would need.</p> <p>The mines and energy department rejected the suggestion there was any special treatment or deal for Tri-Star, and said the process was continuing despite the start of the caretaker period \u201cas it is considered part of the operational work of the department\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThese applications have not been approved,\u201d said the department head, Ron Kelly. \u201cThe department will ensure that mineral authority applications must follow the well-established assessment process as with all other mineral title applications.\u201d </p> <p>He said there was no reduction in rent obligations or costs to the company. The application was within the bounds of the Mineral Titles Act, and the six-year arrangement provided \u201cgreater security for exploration investment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/29/what-will-fill-the-hole-left-by-coal\">What will fill the hole left by coal?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Morris questioned the secrecy: \u201cIf the object of this land reservation is to provide Tri-Star with a secure tenure for a potentially major development, why not be public about that?</p> <p>\u201cIf the current legislation doesn\u2019t provide adequately for large-scale exploration programs, why didn\u2019t the government fix that during the last four years? Ultimately the whole thing has been secretive. </p> <p>\u201cWhatever the motive, and no matter the explanation, it\u2019s a bad look for information about this potentially major development to come to light in this way.\u201d</p> <p>The NT chief minister, Adam Giles, dismissed accusations the arrangement was made in secret, and said the entire process had been \u201copen and transparent\u201d, despite only becoming aware of it himself on Tuesday.</p> <p>Giles told ABC radio in Alice Springs the Australian\u2019s report was \u201ca slur on the good officials who work in a government agency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was about a renewal of a lease that has been there for a long period of time,\u201d Giles said. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be publicly advertised. It has been publicly advertised as far as I understand it, and it\u2019s good to see the process is being followed.</p> <p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t publicly advertised, and it didn\u2019t go through that process, that would be be when it\u2019s sought to have been hidden, but it\u2019s been open and transparent as far as I\u2019m aware.\u201d</p> <p>Jimmy Cocking, spokesman for the Arid Lands Environment Centre, said the decision was reprehensible.</p> <p>\u201cThe CLP has outdone itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is moving away from coal and here we have the [mines and energy department] reserving land for a coalmine in the middle of the Great Artesian Basin.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision sets the NT up for legal liability where the company may push for compensation if it is not allowed to proceed down the track.\u201d</p> <p>Cocking called for Labor to commit to reverse the decision if it won government.</p> <p>Tim Buckley, a financial analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis, said if a large thermal coal mine was developed in the area, it would be a stranded asset before it was even finished.</p> <p>The only way a mine that far from a port could ever be profitable was with huge subsidies from the taxpayer.</p> <p>Existing coalmines were already struggling, so developing a new one from scratch was unlikely to be profitable even in the most favourable circumstances. </p> <p>Buckley said rail costs for coal can be about about 4c a tonne for each kilometre. If Tri-Star could get the coal to a port just 1,000km away, that would add $40 to a tonne of coal, which currently fetches about $65 a tonne.</p> <p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re talking about moving it from south of Alice Springs to Darwin, you\u2019re talking a prohibitive cost of rail transport,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThen you need to build and operate a dedicated coal port.\u201d</p> <p>The cost of building a port, even in Queensland<strong> </strong>where there are massive economies of scale, would add $5 to $6 to a tonne of coal, he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo you could be looking at a cost of $50 a tonne, before you\u2019ve even mined the coal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On top of that, Buckley said thermal coal was in structural decline, with prices unlikely to recover as the world moved towards cleaner forms of energy.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be a stranded asset before it\u2019s even finished construction would be my guess,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way it could survive would be with taxpayer subsidies of the railway and all the other essential infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>The Central Land Council, which acts for Indigenous landholder groups in the region, said it was concerned the NT lacked sufficient regulatory regimes or experience in regulating the coal industry. </p> <p>\u201cWe will discuss these developments with traditional owners and seek their instructions,\u201d CLC\u2019s director, David Ross, said.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect whoever wins the NT election to exercise a high degree of transparency where extraordinary arrangements are to be put in place for particular exploration projects, particularly for fossil-fuel projects with major environmental impacts.\u201d</p> <p>The NT minister for mines and energy, David Tollner, referred questions to the department.</p> <p>Tri-Star has been contacted for comment.</p>",

These will all be familiar to readers of a certain age, even if you were unaware they were all plucked from the UK\u2019s vast archives of library music \u2013 essentially stock songs recorded with no definitive purpose, other than to be perused and selected in the future for use on TV, film or radio projects.<br></p> <p>As Keith Mansfield, composer of the Wimbledon and Grandstand themes, says: \u201cThere was no pressure to have a hit record. We were making music that people might find useful, and some of that would be really unusual music \u2013 strange time signatures or key changes. If it got picked up, well, that was a bonus. And if it lasted 35 years? Wonderful! Who could have ever expected that?\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You had very little time and very little control. There was no overwriting. Any mistakes went in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mansfield was one of several young musicians who helped reinvent KPM, perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/29/electronicmusic\">most famous of all library labels</a>. He was there during its golden period between 1966 and 1973 when, energised by the revolution sweeping British pop music, KPM went from being a slightly old-fashioned, second-division library to the world\u2019s premier destination for production music. The music Mansfield composed, alongside names such as Alan Parker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/06/johnny-pearson-obituary\">Johnny Pearson</a> and Alan Hawkshaw, still sounds fresh: a mixture of pop, jazz, funk, big band and orchestral work played with a soulful looseness that\u2019s impossible to imitate without access to top musicians playing live.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s undoubtedly the reason why KPM have decided to relaunch their catalogue by getting those original musicians back together to make another record. I\u2019ve joined them in the studio as they do so \u2013 there are four trumpets, trombones, saxophones, french horns, plus drums, Rhodes piano, Hammond, and the effect is invigorating. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0f81cef50f905d31f35b297033482a9195596732\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f81cef50f905d31f35b297033482a9195596732/15_13_619_774/400.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Mansfeild\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Mansfield</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The musicians\u2019 stories are equally refreshing. Despite their considerable talents, they had no idea that the songs they were composing at the time would end up soundtracking the lives of future generations. Mansfield says he first became aware of this when his 13-year-old daughter got home from school and asked if he\u2019d written Grandstand. \u201cI thought it was going to be some wind up, but she said, \u2018All my friends think it\u2019s a wonderful tune.\u2019\u201d I realised that it had gone somewhere else \u2013 it\u2019s part of their growing up.\u201d</p> <p>The reason why the songs have stood the test of time is simple: they\u2019re clever pieces of music. Grandstand transitions gracefully from pop triads to big band chords without the listener detecting a shift, for instance, whereas Wimbledon is constantly changing key. But none of those ideas were brought to the table with the sporting events in mind. Rather, when the likes of Johnny Pearson, Johnny Scott and Mansfield composed a theme for Grandstand, the programme\u2019s makers decided that they didn\u2019t like any of the tracks in KPM\u2019s archive and went for something completely different instead. </p> <p>\u201cI thought, \u2018Why have they chosen that? That\u2019s not sports music!\u2019\u201d laughs Mansfield now. \u201cBut they saw in it things that I didn\u2019t. They saw the fun in it. And that it was quite chameleon-like \u2013 it could work for a small event or a big event, too.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7663d31f90f3dc00d2432eada73133be75ba9bc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7663d31f90f3dc00d2432eada73133be75ba9bc0/64_52_2798_1988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You had to walk in there on the day and play what you were given\u2019 \u2026 the KPM Orchestra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You had to walk in there on the day and play what you were given\u2019 \u2026 the KPM Orchestra</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR IMage/PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These songs were not long projects that had been in the works for months. Rather, they were bashed out, six at a time, during frantic three-and-a-half-hour sessions \u2013 nobody knew at the time that some would go on to be so iconic. As Mansfield recalls: \u201cAll this music flying past people. All that energy. And the whole orchestra in the studio at the same time. You had little time and very little control. There was no overwriting. Any mistakes went in.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SlvZF6k5bE\">Grange Hill theme</a> was one such speedy example. Alan Hawkshaw was told during a session in Munich that they had half an hour to spare and could he write something quickly. \u201cLuckily, I had some good players.

Phillips was responsible for reinventing KPM, bringing this new generation onboard to fuse the old orchestral sound with pop and soul energy. Everybody talks of him giving young talent a chance. \u201cHe taught me how to write for pictures,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the music \u2013 the music is to make the pictures look good and to get people out of the kitchen to go watch something on television.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/29/electronicmusic\">The lost geniuses of library music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says you need to have an imaginary programme in your head when you write (indeed, his politically edged new song We Come in Peace was written with a current affairs show in mind).

  "<p>A contemporary chronicler, writing in the 1850s, observed that Indians \u201cwere rather apt to look on a cricket match as proof of the lunatic propensities of their masters the sahibs, and to wonder what possible enjoyment they could find in running about in the sun all day after a leather ball\u201d. Soon, what had been deemed lunatic and marginal, came to be seen as central. By 1981, according to the writer R Gopal Krishna, \u201ccricket, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou0B9T89L0g\">Lata Mangeshkar</a> and the transistor make India one nation\u201d. These days, with the wealth of its leagues, the theological status that fans accord star players, its diasporic outposts in Sharjah and New Jersey, cricket is still used as a lens through which to assess the country\u2019s fantasy life and its realities.</p> <p>Aravind Adiga, whose first novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/22/white-tiger-aravind-adiga-review\"><em>The White Tiger</em></a> won the Man Booker prize in 2008, has always been drawn to that gap between the glitter and gleam of India Shining and the violence, inequality and social misery that give a partial lie to the nation\u2019s desire to rebrand itself. <em>Selection Day</em> follows the shifting fortunes of 14-year-old Manju Kumar and his better-looking, apparently more talented elder brother Radha. Both would be social lepers were it not for their cricketing prowess. From an early age they were coached by their father Mohan, a lowly chutney seller, who had brought them to Mumbai where they live in a single-room shack on the edge of the city.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>According to the cynical Mehta, cricket is a form of social control, a tool to combat 'rogue Hindu testosterone'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another writer, perhaps one more inclined to neorealist poetics than the kind of broad-brushed satire at which Adiga excels, might have chosen to place Mohan at the centre of this novel. In his relentless incantation of proverbs, his insistent superstition (telling Manju not to shave until he\u2019s 21 because the sensation of razors on flesh will make his hormones crazy), and also his devotion to his dreams (taking his kids to swampy dumping grounds where, sporting leg pads chewed through by rats, he forces them to practise strokes), he\u2019s both absurd and touching.</p> <p>Everything hinges on Manju\u2019s ability to break schoolboy batting records, avoid the baneful influence of his rival, Javed, and enter the big time. On this rests not only their father\u2019s hopes of breaking out of poverty, but also the reputation of Tommy Sir, allegedly the best talent scout in the country. Also holding his breath is Anand Mehta, born into a family of stockbrokers, and described as \u201cdriven, anglophone, numerate, and freed by postcolonial entitlement from almost all forms of liberal guilt or introspection\u201d. It\u2019s Mehta who also hatches a sponsorship programme, which in return for a small investment in the teenage Manju promises to earn him untold millions on future earnings.</p> <p>This, then, is Indian cricket. It\u2019s about grooming and commodification, about high school coaches who serve as \u201cfat pipes in the filtration system\u201d that channels and exploits the potential of the undercommons. According to the cynical Mehta, it\u2019s a form of social control, a state-sponsored scheme \u201cto pacify hundreds of millions of desperately horny young Indians of the lower social classes\u201d, a tool to combat \u201crogue Hindu testosterone\u201d.</p> <p>Mehta is forever gabby, forever entertaining.

Typically he will have a history of criminal behaviour and the final act is often fuelled by intoxication and triggered by a significant loss, often that of an intimate relationship. Commonly these men are narcissistic and the more they feel neglected, rejected or opposed, the greater their desire for attention. </p> <p>What better way to sear one\u2019s presence into the mind of others than by the dramatic violent taking of lives, especially if it can be emblazoned in the news?

Delayed maturation is particularly evident in men, and correlated with egocentricity and antisocial attitudes.</p> <p>Not surprisingly then, disaffected and confused young males will see detailed, graphic and protracted global reporting of others with whom they identify and find justification for emulation alongside an opportunity for attachment to a group that would amplify the significance of their behaviour. There may even be a wish to \u201cbetter\u201d the latest atrocity in a perverse competition to be the biggest badass.

This is to miss the point that their wish is be noticed not so much by their fellow fringe dwellers but by the mainstream they feel is responsible for not seeing their true worth. Having the law-abiding and the powerful cringe and quake in response to reports in which their personal details are endlessly pored over is the Holy Grail. Besides, even social media relies heavily on news reports.</p> <p>Research from the 1960s onwards established a link between detailed personal reports of suicide and subsequent suicide by others who found misjudged validation from the publicised account. It was dubbed the Werther effect (named after copycat suicides by young men following the publication in 1774 of Goethe\u2019s The Sorrows of Young Werther). Acceptance by responsible media organisations of the findings has led to a <a href=\"https://www.iasp.info/media_guidelines.php\">growth in guidelines</a> in many countries curbing detailed accounts of a personal nature regarding suicide.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/10/violence-is-contagious/309459/\">Similar findings are now emerging in relation to acts of public violence</a>. The right for the public to read lurid details of little direct relevance and with a potential to cause loss of life is hard to justify.</p> <p>None of this is to discount that social, economic and ideological influences are important and must be vigorously confronted. However our most potent influence are others and our relationships with them, perhaps even more so when it is imagined rather than real and lends itself to a romantic idealised experience. They shape our identity and our state of mind. In the end any act is the product of that mind.</p> <p>The male brain in early adulthood has yet to attain full maturation and struggles to curb impulses, delay gratification and exercise judgment over the emotions. Allied to the brain\u2019s deficient self-control is the major psychological challenge of developing a satisfactory self-identity that allows, as Freud said, the goals of a mature person in society to love and to work; to feel a sense of meaning, purpose and belonging. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/french-media-terrorists-identities-le-monde-social\">French media\u2019s blackout on terrorists\u2019 identities is missing the point | Jason Burke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before this final stage is realised, the identity is in flux and inclined towards its need to discover itself.

  "<p><strong>Sunday 24 July 8.43am.</strong> In the midst of the US presidential election, news breaks that WikiLeaks plans to release 20,000 hacked Democratic Party emails that will likely damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances, and enhance Donald Trump\u2019s. I read the relevant passage aloud to my wife, before adding my own searing commentary: \u201cI would\u2019ve thought Assange and Co would have the intelligence to realise ...\u201d I suddenly pause. </p> <p>A ripple of panic pulses through me. Am I complaining?</p> <p>Over the past five months that question is one that has developed the ability to paralyse me. Why? Because I\u2019m in the throes of what has turned out to be an epic challenge. I am trying to go 21 days without complaining. A self-imposed abstinence from grumbling of any kind: no slander of public figures, no whining about the weather. Nothing.</p> <p>It\u2019s an exercise that I first heard of while listening to a podcast by Tim Ferriss, the productivity expert and quasi self-help guru. Ferriss in turn discovered it after it was popularised by a new age pastor from Kansas City by the name of Will Bowen. And while I identify neither as a member of the self-help set nor the god squad, I was instantly fascinated by the mission.</p> <p>The rules are ostensibly simple: put an elastic band on one wrist. Every time you complain, switch it over to the other wrist. Repeat, until the band has remained on one wrist for three weeks.</p> <p>The simplicity is compelling, but the moment you start it becomes awfully complex. It turns out that \u201cAm I complaining?\u201d can be a very hard question to answer, because what<em> is </em>a complaint? There\u2019s obviously the dictionary definition: an expression of discontent about a person or state of affairs, something like that. But in practise it gets murky. Consider the following three phrases.</p> <ol> <li>\u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cDamn it\u2019s cold.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cDamn this cold.\u201d</li> </ol> <p>I think we could all agree that (1) is probably not a complaint. Assuming the weather is actually cold, it\u2019s just a statement of fact. And we could reach a similar consensus that (3) definitely is a complaint. But what about (2)? What about (1) said in a slightly whiny tone of voice? What if someone else says (3) and you agree with them? </p> <p>Or how about this: \u201cI would\u2019ve thought Assange and Co would have the intelligence to realise that a Trump government will not be good for people like him.\u201d Is that a complaint, a pointed observation, or merely the expression of a dashed expectation? </p> <p>On that particular Sunday morning, I decide it is not a complaint. I turn the page and leave the worn-out hair elastic clinging to my left wrist. </p> <p><strong>Monday 25 July 11.19am.</strong> The following day I meet my wife for coffee. As we approach the cafe, I spot a former colleague waiting at the counter. Let\u2019s call him Gary. I\u2019m not a fan of Gary\u2019s. I mean, I wish him no specific harm. He\u2019s not a bad person \u2013 he just has an awful sense of humour. Dad jokes and cries of \u201cTaxi!\u201d when a glass breaks are the cornerstones of his comedic oeuvre. Now I\u2019ll have to endure some of it and, worse, my sweet wife will be subjected to it. For a moment I forget myself. As I spot The Gazmeister I let out a big sigh and two words slither out after it: \u201c<em>This </em>idiot.\u201d</p> <p>That sentence isn\u2019t even a sentence. It doesn\u2019t have a verb. But the moment I utter it, I know the truth. It\u2019s a complaint. I change the elastic band over and brace myself for some punny pleasantries. It stings, because at that point I was into my fourth consecutive day without complaint. And in five long months of trying, the longest I have gone is six days.</p> <p>Not complaining is really, really hard. Until you try to stop, you\u2019ve no idea how often you do it. It\u2019s not a question of whether you\u2019re an inherently positive person or a negative one. Complaint is a pivotal part of all conversation \u2013 it can be used for good as well as evil. A lot of the time, we complain as a way to connect. A shared moan is a time-honoured technique for relating to a co-worker, fellow traveller or life partner. Who hasn\u2019t felt the warm rush of catharsis that occurs when you discover that someone else hates that thing you hate? Bellyaching is bonding.</p> <p>So it\u2019s wrong to say that complaints are wholly negative. In fact, some can be extremely positive. In a certain light, you could even view the whole of human progress as the result of complaints. Complaints about slow horses, or polio. Complaints about apartheid, or gender inequality.</p> <p>We need complaints, and we need negativity. But for me at least, this challenge is not about disputing that fact. Nor is it about worshipping at the altar of positivity. The reality is you can perform some verbal gymnastics that allow you to express negative sentiments without complaining. \u201cThis traffic sucks\u201d can become \u201cI would love it if this traffic would clear.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/five-of-the-best-meditation-apps\">Five of the best meditation apps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in order to do that you\u2019ll need to pause and really think about your choice of words. This is where the challenge becomes fascinating, because you start to realise how little thought we give to what comes out of our gob. The words just tumble out, like goods being looted from a supermarket. By focusing the mind on complaints, you employ someone to work the checkout. And why is that of any benefit? Well, it becomes a sprawling and highly effective exercise in mindfulness.</p> <p>Mindfulness, in case you missed it, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/26/mindfulness-craze-schools-university-near-you-cambridge\">approaching the status of full-blown fad</a> \u2013 pretty impressive for something that is a few millennia old. One description is that it\u2019s the practice of being present in any given moment. If that smells a bit too much like smouldering sandalwood for your liking, try \u201cbeing aware of what you\u2019re doing and what\u2019s happening around you\u201d. </p> <p>Buddhists long ago observed what they call the \u201cmonkey mind\u201d, the idea that the mind is inherently a bit restless and fidgety. If you don\u2019t give it a clear task, it will either keep a running commentary, or wander off on tangents. Your head becomes filled with an endless, meandering chatter \u2013 a din that has been blamed for everything from anxiety to insomnia. The solution, say the Buddhists, is to give the monkey a job. It could be watching your breath come and go (meditation), or it could be keeping a keen eye on what you\u2019re doing (mindfulness).</p> <p>The claimed benefits are as varied as they are numerous: improved focus, anger management, treatment of depression, lower blood pressure, stress relief, general wellbeing. It\u2019s a laundry list of advantages that has seen mindfulness teachings adopted by everyone from captains of industry to captains of football teams. All sorts are trying to experience the benefits of silencing their simian. There are countless ways to do it, but I\u2019ve found one of the best ways to shut him up is to have him monitor your moaning.</p> <p><strong>27 July.</strong> Mid-morning a colleague and I travel to a meeting in his 2006 Toyota, a vehicle he calls Sonia Kluger, after the Australian media personality. I ask him how he feels now that his people mover has become associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/18/tv-host-sonia-kruger-calls-for-end-to-muslim-migration-to-australia\">calls to ban Muslim immigration</a>. He says there\u2019s not much he can do about it. But our conversation has taken a turn, and we make some very pointed observations about Isis and the state of the world. I come dangerously close to complaining, but stop just short.</p> <p>It\u2019s not until later that evening that things fall apart. Over dinner a family member tells us she\u2019s recently discovered that her former boss underpaid her entitlements. The business is no longer trading, so she\u2019s unlikely to see the money owed. I simply can\u2019t participate in the conversation without making negative comments about the person in question. It occurs to me that if I have any chance of making it to 21 days, I\u2019ll need to recognise these situations immediately, and turn mute.</p> <p>It\u2019s that recognition that is the hard part though. That\u2019s what makes it so different from other abstinences. When someone breaks their commitment to Dry July, they do so consciously. I\u2019d imagine very few people get halfway through a beer and suddenly remember that they\u2019re meant to be off the sauce. But that is exactly how it is with complaints. By the time you realise a gripe is in the vicinity, it\u2019s usually too late.</p> <p><strong>5 August. </strong>Seven days and counting, a new record. I call the bank about two errors it has made, and manage to correct both without complaining. Instead, I simply state that I \u201ccan\u2019t understand\u201d why these things occurred when I was led to believe they would not occur. Sure I sound like a robot, but who cares? I\u2019ve completed a task with a high degree of difficulty. If not complaining were figure skating, the bank call would be equivalent to a triple axel. I might not have shown much grace through the air, but I stuck the landing. </p> <p><strong>12 August. </strong>It\u2019s at this point that I could veer off on a tangent about the general level of whingeing in the world. I could note that social media has amplified gripes about everything from overpriced avocados to sluggish Wi-Fi. I could write about how millennials are profuse whingers, surpassed only by non-millennials when you get them on to the topic of those wretched millennials. I could do all that, but I won\u2019t. That would be a meta-whinge, and I\u2019m 14 days without complaint. I\u2019m into the home stretch and I\u2019m not about to slip up now.</p> <p><strong>19 August. </strong>I took on whining, and I won. Were there some 50/50 calls that went in my favour? You bet there were. But when it\u2019s all said (or weirdly bottled up) and done, I achieved my objective. Thrust into all manner of less-than-stellar scenarios, I summoned the strength to stifle my disapproval. I came, I saw, I concurred. Not only that, I did it at a time when the Pok\u00e9mon GO frenzy was at its peak.</p> <p>So how do I feel? Well, unsurprisingly, there\u2019s not some powerful benefit that is unlocked on the 21st day. Rather there is an accumulation. I definitely think my focus has improved, along with general calmness. But perhaps the most noticeable benefit is a greater sense of control. You might think your level of control is just fine as it is \u2013 I certainly did \u2013 but it can be much better. If you try to stop complaining you\u2019ll see what I mean. </p> <p>Turning off autopilot is hard to do, and you\u2019ll find those muscles that steer the plane have atrophied. But if you pump them up for a few weeks, the flight becomes more interesting and engaging. </p> <p>How do I feel? Can\u2019t complain.</p>",

  "<p>As the current women\u2019s officer at the University of Sydney, students often come to me with stories of sexual assault or harassment \u2013 of being chased around campus after dark, touched by lecturers after class, or assaulted at parties by people they knew and trusted.

Who can we report this to?\u201d</p> <p>Although I feel obliged to tell them that the reporting system exists, I cannot, in good faith, recommend that they take that path, given its major flaws. I can\u2019t refer them to specialist sexual assault counselling on campus, because it doesn\u2019t exist. I can\u2019t tell them that the university will support them and help them through this incredibly difficult time in their life, because \u2026 well, I know that it won\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/23/study-to-determine-sexual-assault-prevalence-in-australian-universities\">Study to determine sexual assault prevalence in Australian universities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The University of Sydney vice chancellor, Michael Spence, received an open letter on Monday written by the women\u2019s officers from the past 10 years. Tuesday marks the launch of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/23/study-to-determine-sexual-assault-prevalence-in-australian-universities\">national survey on sexual assault and harassment at universities</a>, developed by Universities Australia in conjunction with the Australian Human Rights Commission. Although research is important to gauge the full extent of this issue, it needs to be followed up by concrete, well-informed action. Unfortunately, this was not the case with the university\u2019s own \u201cSafer Community\u201d survey last year, which made five vague recommendations that have not yet led to any tangible benefits for students.</p> <p>The problem of sexual assault and harassment on campus isn\u2019t new \u2013 it is an ingrained and systemic issue. <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/05/11/rackweb-slut-shames-female-students-sydney-universitys-wesley-college\">Wesley College\u2019s Rackweb journal </a>was exposed in March, and just last week an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/police-investigate-claims-schoolgirls-across-australia-targeted-by-site-hosting-explicit-images\">online porn ring targeting girls at Australian high schools</a> was brought to light. These incidents are appalling but they are also unsurprising. Sexual assault and harassment are the predictable outcome of a misogynistic culture, in which women are objectified and degraded.</p> <p>For decades, students have been trying to push the university into action on these issues, to little avail. Although it\u2019s only one of many, this is my experience.</p> <p>I\u2019ll start back in March. I set out to organise a screening of The Hunting Ground, a documentary about sexual assault at US colleges that has been a major catalyst for change, both in the US and Australia. When I contacted the film organisation, I found out that members of university management had already taken control of the one screening allocated to our campus by The Hunting Ground Australia Project.</p> <p>With only days to go, the screening wasn\u2019t advertised anywhere \u2013 students and staff had no idea that it was to take place. Student representatives sent a letter to university management, asking them to delay the screening until it could be promoted properly. We never received a reply.</p> <p>The screening went ahead on a sunny April morning. At 10am. When no one is on campus, let alone at the university bar.</p> <p>When I arrived at the venue, rows of chairs were laid out neatly, the film was cued up on the screen. But no one was there. It was just me, a journalist from the student paper, and a representative from The Hunting Ground Australia Project.</p> <p>Not even the members of senior management who organised the screening had bothered to show up.</p> <p>The film played. Brave survivors told their stories, but no one was there to listen. Halfway through the film, I left my seat and went to sob in the bathroom.</p> <p>This event set the tone for the rest of the year. Empty promises, unanswered emails and business conducted secretively, far away from students and their messy problems. When students are abandoned by the university, student representatives are inevitably left to pick up the slack.</p> <p>This work is as harrowing as it is fulfilling, but the major roadblock I\u2019ve faced is trying to work with the university to change the way that it handles sexual assault as an institution. Time and again, I\u2019ve realised that this problem exists for the university only to the extent that it is a public relations issue. For the university, this isn\u2019t about student safety \u2013 it\u2019s about future enrolments, profits and reputation.</p> <p>It is crystal clear to student representatives what the problems are, why there is rampant sexual assault on campus, and why, according to the university\u2019s own survey, it will go unreported 99% of the time.</p> <p>Students need education around consent to know what sexual assault looks like. When rape does occur, students need access to a quality reporting system, with trained specialists to support them through the process. Currently, all that exists is an impersonal and generic web form \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise that only 1 in 100 survivors choose to use it to report their experiences to the university.</p> <p>Spence himself conceded that this is \u201cappalling\u201d. The admission was made on a panel discussion I took part in after a second, student-run screening of The Hunting Ground. This second event was well-attended, and a number of survivors openly challenged Spence about the university\u2019s handling of their cases.</p> <p>On the panel, I laid out the specific changes that need to take place: timely responses, trained staff, and guaranteed confidentiality. But three months later, nothing has changed. This is why we are now formally demanding these reforms in an open letter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/25/its-time-australians-looked-more-closely-at-our-privileged-ruling-class\">It\u2019s time Australians looked more closely at our privileged ruling class | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While these demands remain unmet, the task of supporting survivors falls on community services, underfunded clinics, and student representatives. For me, having to carry around these horrific stories of sexual harassment and assault is made all the worse by the university\u2019s failure to take action. The university knows what changes need to be made, but trying to work with it to implement these changes feels like a Sisyphean task.</p> <p>That\u2019s why, along with the women\u2019s officers of the past 10 years, I have decided to make these demands heard publicly. Our open letter, published<strong> </strong>on Tuesday, lists the actions the university must take to tackle sexual assault and harassment. After decades of inaction,<strong> </strong>the university advises it will have a full response to our letter within a fortnight. The time to act is now.</p> <p>In the words of the university\u2019s own 2016-2020 strategic plan, \u201cif you change nothing, nothing will change.\u201d</p> <p><em>Anna Hush is the current co-women\u2019s officer at the University of Sydney Students Representative Council. </em></p> <ul> <li><em><strong>If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual assault or domestic violence, support is available at 1800RESPECT.</strong></em><br></li> </ul>",

But now there\u2019s a new option that could disrupt the working model: co-living. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/09/punishing-workload-v-independence-are-small-businesses-really-the-answer\">Punishing workload v independence: are small businesses really the answer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Offering \u201cdigital nomads\u201d (usually millennial creatives such as designers, developers or tech startups) a bed/room, bathrooms, internet access, working space, laundry facilities and shared kitchen space, these co-living spaces give freelancers the luxury of working and living in a prime location while being surrounded by a community of like-minded individuals. </p> <p>From <a href=\"https://nomadhouse.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nomadhouse\u2019s</a> abundant co-living spaces in Europe, Asia, South America, the US and Africa, to the popularity of hostel co-working space <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://construkt.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Construkt</a> in Banaglore and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.roam.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roam\u2019s</a> covetable spaces in Bali, Miami and Madrid \u2013 these short-term co-living spaces are taking off.</p> <p>While the majority of co-living spaces are offered on a weekly or monthly basis, demand is building for longer-term leases \u2013 a demand that <a href=\"http://base.life/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Base</a>, a soon-to-be-launched co-living space in Melbourne, hopes to fulfil.</p> <p>By bringing together 16 like-minded individuals to live and work in the same space in Melbourne for a year, Base aims to set up \u201cAustralia\u2019s first curated co-living space for personal and professional growth, creative expression, community connection and support, and efficient and affordable living\u201d.</p> <p>Although the company is still looking for an appropriate property to turn into a co-living space (with shared living and cooking spaces, but private rooms and bathrooms), it is expected that the property will be within 5km of the city and should be up and running by April 2017.</p> <p>Al Jeffery, in charge of people and management at Base, says the success of the company\u2019s US co-living business partners <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://opendoor.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenDoor</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thecospace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Co.Space</a> inspired Base to introduce a similar model to Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/25/unlimited-annual-leave-is-it-good-hr-or-good-pr\">Unlimited annual leave: is it good HR or good PR?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to a point as a society where we find it hard to live and be together,\u201d he says. \u201cHumans lived in tribes and communities for centuries but since the industrial era, we\u2019ve decided not to. So we really want to explore the philosophy of ancient wisdom in a modern context</p> <p>\u201cWe think that bringing together like-minded people with the same intention and fuelling them with the right resources will undoubtedly incubate great ideas and make incredible things happen.\u201d</p> <p>According to Jeffery, Base has received hundreds of applications for the co-living prototype already, mainly from \u201cthe younger, more creative, more entrepreneurial type of person, because they tend to resonate with a more community-minded outlook\u201d.</p> <p>And although some may find working and living in the same environment a strain on work-life balance, the development professional and organisational psychologist Dr Jim Bright says that it may not be such an issue for creatives.</p> <p>\u201cIf you start from the premise, \u2018I hate my work,\u2019 then obviously getting away from it is a good thing. But for the majority of creative people, they don\u2019t want to get away from it. They tend to enjoy what they do. Most musicians will have a guitar or piano in their house, and most writers will have a notepad next to the bed, so they can work when inspiration strikes.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether Beethoven knocked off at six o\u2019clock or Shakespeare put down his pen at the end of the day. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a common way for creative people to work. So putting people in an environment where they can create without constraining them to place or time and giving them the tools to do it, could be very beneficial.\u201d</p> <p>But Leanne Faraday-Brash, organisational psychologist and principal of <a href=\"http://www.brashconsulting.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brash Consulting</a>, warns that there are two issues co-living projects should bear in mind: \u201cThe benefits, including enjoyment of the environs, will hinge on the quality of the physical space, the personalities and how accommodating or respectful people are of others who share the space\u201d, and that \u201csome people refresh by keeping life outside work separate\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jun/27/improve-work-life-balance-tips-stress\">Improve your work-life balance with these tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jeffery says to ensure that the residents of the co-living space are happy, there will be a rigorous curating process (mainly through personality profiling), a weekly check-in to work out any conflicts and \u201censure everyone can be heard and understood without judgment\u201d, as well as quarterly weekend retreats to \u201crefresh\u201d the energy in the group.</p> <p>He says that given some people prefer to work in a environment separate from their living environment (some early adopters of Co.Space also rented separate co-working space), the Base co-working area will be separate from the living space, either physically, or aesthetically (decorated in a different way). The co-working space will also be open to the public, to \u201cbring in new energy and ideas\u201d and make additional money that will go towards subsiding living costs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about learning to be a community again, to live and work together and help one another,\u201d Jeffery concludes. \u201cBecause when we rely on each other, when we value each other and care for one another, we help each other grow.\u201d</p>"
