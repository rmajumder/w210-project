  "<p>\u201cI would never deliberately hurt you.\u201d Demelza had the best comeback here. Oh, so you accidentally \u201cfell\u201d on to Elizabeth? I paraphrase, but it was close to that. \u201cPerhaps I might have hoped for some understanding ...\u201d Oh Ross, what are you on? Demelza\u2019s loss was our gain, though, as this was a wonderful episode, however heartbreaking \u2013 the perfect blend of plot and characterisation, leading us up to next week\u2019s series finale.</p> \n<p>In short, everything that was written in the stars has come to pass. There were some classic moments. Prudie and Jud cold-shouldering Ross for betraying Demelza. The look of quiet hatred that passed between Aunt Agatha and Evil George. And, as Evil George entered Trenwith, the looming figure of Ross smouldered in the background, his scar glistening in the late afternoon light. Vintage Poldark.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/24/poldark-rape-scene-prettifying-it-doesnt-make-it-ok-elizabeth-said-no\">Prettifying the Poldark rape doesn't make it OK. Elizabeth said no</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I don\u2019t want to gloss too quickly over last week\u2019s shocking \u201cevents\u201d and how they were interpreted. (Summary of opinions: \u201cIt was a rape and should have been filmed more sensitively.\u201d \u201cIt was clearly not a rape.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what it was, but in those days Elizabeth would not have considered herself a gentlewoman if she had behaved otherwise.\u201d) But this episode put us all firmly in our place: whatever that scene might have looked like to us, Elizabeth was not unhappy with what happened that night. She was left hoping that Ross would leave Demelza and marry her. Demelza feared the same. Ross seemed hilariously unaffected, just rather inconvenienced by it all. He is a right wazzock, isn\u2019t he? What was I thinking before? Story of my life. I will say this though: Ross Poldark is a fiendishly difficult character to portray and Aidan Turner is tackling what is turning out to be an almost impossibly nuanced role with wit and vigour.</p> \n<p>As if to underscore the fact that we were meant to buy into Elizabeth\u2019s compliance, Demelza\u2019s interaction with the Scottish captain was unambiguous. Demelza booked herself into The Red Room of Pain at Evil George\u2019s dodgy boutique hotel and before she knew it The Third Proclaimer was wanting to indulge his appetite and have Demelza do him a very special favour: \u201cWould you consider calling me Malcolm?\u201d In terms of lines a lady wants to hear, this goes down in screen history alongside When Harry Met Sally\u2019s \u201cRide me, big Sheldon.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63e7be9ec31732cabea7c403036b7f50564af6b2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63e7be9ec31732cabea7c403036b7f50564af6b2/0_109_4425_2656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Would you consider calling me Malcolm?\u2019 Demelza with Captain McNeil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Would you consider calling me Malcolm?\u2019 Demelza with Captain McNeil.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Adrian Rogers</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI know a better way to warm you.\u201d \u201cYou are most attentive, Malcolm.\u201d Unbearable. \u201cI hope I know how to conduct an ambush, my darling.\u201d I thought I was going to be sick. But then it turned into a brilliantly layered scene, with comedy and tragedy and a near-miss for Demelza. Top marks to Eleanor Tomlinson and Henry Garrett (Captain McNeil). There followed a superb scene with Tweedledum and Tweedledee arguing at the keyhole over the etiquette of breaking into a lady\u2019s room. Never was there a better time to leg it out of the window, billowing red curtain dress be damned. Meanwhile, Ross\u2019s idea of \u201cgood news\u201d at a time like this? \u201cWe can re-open Grace!\u201d Well whoop-de-do.</p> \n<p>Best bits? Aunt Agatha\u2019s declaration of warm feelings towards Ross. (She fancies him, basically.) Sindy doll dog woman showing that she sees right through Elizabeth and Evil George. And the hilarious scene between Elizabeth and Verity. \u201cAs his sister ...\u201d Oh, Verity, she doesn\u2019t give a burnt loaf about Francis. She can barely remember who he is.</p> \n<h2>Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor</h2> \n<p>Regular readers will note that Eleanor Tomlinson (Demelza) has never featured in this section. (Usually this section can be summarised as: \u201cBig up Dr Enys, Aunt Agatha and Sindy doll dog woman.\u201d And no one can argue with that sentiment.) That is not because I do not consider Demelza worthy of the tankard. If anything, she deserves an entire looted shipload of tankards. It is purely because I do not think she qualifies as a supporting actor: she is on a par with Aidan Turner as a lead. If not even, after last week\u2019s shocker, far above him.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless I wish to pay tribute to her here this week: Demelza is a corking character and brilliantly portrayed by Tomlinson who has wisdom, maturity and acting chops way beyond her preposterously young age. This actor is 24 years old. I have pairs of tights older than her. At Tomlinson\u2019s age, Meryl Streep was still waitressing and considering dropping out of her acting course to take a law degree. That\u2019s how bloody good this woman is. Demelza/Eleanor, we raise aloft a tankard of burnished gold to your talent.</p> \n<h2>Classic Poldark lines</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e3a004626b743e642eff1bc9713f3173c1ca5c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e3a004626b743e642eff1bc9713f3173c1ca5c/0_0_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018How often does a man get married?\u2019 Once is too often for you, Evil George.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018How often does a man get married?\u2019 Once is too often for you, Evil George.<br></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Adrian Rogers</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cHow often does a man get married?\u201d Once is too often for you, Evil George.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cDo you suppose that she ever meant to marry George?

It\u2019s appalling for some, a revelation for others,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For many people, the shock of the Brexit vote on 23 June was enough to sweep away generations of hostility. Oliver Marshall, 58, a historian of international migration, called his sister and her three children on 24 June, alerting them to the fact that they were eligible for German passports.</p> <p>His grandparents, who were German-Jewish apple wine producers from near Frankfurt, eventually settled in the UK after fleeing to the US in 1941.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit is closing doors and getting a German passport is opening doors for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything Jewish about me, I think, it\u2019s that I want to keep things open, as you never quite know what might happen.\u201d</p> <p>His grandmother, Klara Rosenberg, lost many close members of her family in the Holocaust. \u201cShe hated Germans for the rest of her life,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have understood why we\u2019re doing this.\u201d </p> <p>But his mother, Liselotte, who is 93 and obtained British citizenship in 1953, has welcomed her son\u2019s response. \u201cI asked her about it and she just raised her eyebrows and said: \u2018The wheels of history\u2019. She was, after all, close to doing it herself over the Iraq war when she was furious with Tony Blair.\u201d</p> <p>Marshall\u2019s nephew, Sam Bowers, a 28-year-old tropical ecologist at Edinburgh University, said the German citizenship he received at the country\u2019s embassy in London on 14 September was his post-Brexit insurance policy. He hopes it will enable him to work and carry out research in his specialised field elsewhere in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern in my academic field as to where our funding will come from in future, as a lot of it is EU money,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cAnd for me to be able to compete for jobs in Europe without the disadvantage of a non-EU passport is hugely important.\u201d</p> <p>Bowers admitted that he had little attachment to his German-Jewish heritage. \u201cMaybe that will grow in time,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019ve only been German for about a month.\u201d</p> <p>The decision would have been harder had he needed to renounce his British citizenship, hesaid. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly like what is happening in the UK right now, so to take back the German citizenship stolen from my family is, in a small way, to be able to reject what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>The move to become German put some people in touch with a troubled past they had known little about.</p> <p>Judith Wolff, 45, a student nurse from Bromley, south-east London, said the paper trail had made her feel closer to her roots. \u201cAnd although I don\u2019t speak German, I could imagine going to live in Germany,\u201d she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"904814c0e7065e6225ee27ab8e0e1744b4698206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/904814c0e7065e6225ee27ab8e0e1744b4698206/1705_884_3596_2157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Judith Wolff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judith Wolff had never considered trying to obtain German citizenship until after the Brexit vote on 23 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Brown/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wolff\u2019s father, Franz, escaped from Berlin in 1939 when he was 18 and got a job at the Hotel Russell in London.

families move elsewhere to encourage refugees to accept resettlement in third countries.</p> <p>He said the law, <a draggable=\"true\"

country of origin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working with a number of countries now.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is if somebody is to go to a third country that they apply for a tourist visa or some other way to circumvent what the government\u2019s policy is by coming back to Australia from that third country.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\">

was not linked to \u201csome other deal\u201d, denying that it was the first plank of a deal to have refugees in offshore detention accepted by the United States.</p> <p>On ABC Radio the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, confirmed that the US was \u201cone of a number of countries that take resettlement\u201d but she was \u201cnot in a position to confirm or deny\u201d whether it was one of the countries Australia could ask to take refugees.</p> <p>Asked if taking refugees from Costa Rica was part of a deal to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, Bishop said: \u201cthat is not my understanding \u2013 that is not my understanding at all.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how the policy would affect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/australian-woman-with-family-on-nauru-pleads-for-end-to-offshore-detention\">refugees and asylum seekers with families in Australia</a>, Dutton said: \u201cThere is a ministerial discretion to act in the public interest.</p> <p>\u201cSo there may be individual cases around families, for example, where the minister of the day can provide a migration outcome, so that person can be allowed in.\u201d</p> <p>Dutton said: \u201cWhere there are family units that are separated we will look at those circumstances and if it\u2019s possible and we have a third-country option available to those families, we will talk to them about that option.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that the policy did not apply to children who were under 18 when they went into offshore detention.</p> <p>Dutton said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d the law was both constitutional and consistent with international law, citing legal advice from the international division of the Attorney General\u2019s Department, the Australian government solicitor and counsel in the immigration department.</p> <p>Both Labor and Nick Xenophon have said they need to see the detail of the government\u2019s proposal before deciding whether to support it.</p> <p>The deputy opposition leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tanya-plibersek\">Tanya Plibersek</a>, has said the proposal is \u201ca distraction from Peter Dutton\u2019s hopeless mismanagement of his portfolio\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is extraordinary that, three years on, the government has not found third countries to resettle those people who are in limbo on Manus Island and Nauru.\u201d</p> <p>The Greens criticised the announcement, saying the Turnbull government had

  "<p>At first, the idea was simply to stop the bleeding. Three-nil down at half-time against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium a little over five weeks ago, Antonio Conte switched to a back three. The Chelsea manager had enjoyed success with the approach in his previous jobs with Juventus and the Italy team and, against Arsenal, it restored a measure of stability. Chelsea still lost, 3-0, but Conte could feel the stirrings of something.</p> <p>Look at Chelsea now. This was their fourth Premier League game since Conte\u2019s tactical move and it was also their fourth clean sheet. Even better from a Chelsea perspective, Southampton never looked like scoring. The only time Thibaut Courtois was worked in the Chelsea goal was in the 28th minute, from a Dusan Tadic free-kick, and the save was entirely regulation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/chelsea-antonio-conte-premier-league-title\">Antonio Conte cautious on title chances after Chelsea extend winning run</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Claude Puel\u2019s Southampton had entered on the back of a five-match unbeaten league run, a sequence that took in the impressive 1-1 draw at Manchester City the previous weekend.</p> <p>The manager deserved the plaudits that had tracked him for his dynamic style of football, in which the player in possession is encouraged to take the daring option. Puel does not tolerate sideways tedium. He has given the club\u2019s latest reworked team the platform to play.</p> <p>Here it was dismantled, and Conte could revel in how he brought that about. His system has flexibility, speed and options, and it has also had Chelsea\u2019s recent opponents gasping for breath. Southampton could not find the spaces, they had the life steadily squeezed out of them and, from the moment that Eden Hazard put Chelsea in front early on, it was possible to feel that it would be a long afternoon for the&#xa0;hosts.</p> <p>It was Chelsea who constructed the platform to play. They had 45% of possession but they made it count. It was they who created the chances and they could conceivably have scored more to emulate the 4-0 scoreline that they inflicted upon Manchester United at Stamford Bridge last Sunday.</p> <p>What makes Conte\u2019s work so praiseworthy is how he has adapted. He did not moan when the summer transfer window closed and he had not made the signings he wanted; instead, Conte took what was available and worked with what he already had.</p> <p>David Luiz, who arrived on deadline day, looked assured again in the middle of the back three \u2013 in other words, not as though he was about to step on a rake and be smacked in the face \u2013 while C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, the right\u2011back turned left-back turned right central defender, continued to impress with his decision\u2011making. He did not put a foot wrong.</p> <p>What about Victor Moses? There have been times in the past when his Chelsea future has looked bleak. After a few months under Conte, he seems as if he has been a marauding right wing\u2011back all of his career. The manager described him as a pleasant \u201csurprise\u201d. The drive and stamina of Moses and Marcos Alonso, the left wing-back, helped to make Chelsea tick here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/southampton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea\u2019s Eden Hazard and Diego Costa turn on style to sink Southampton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Saturday, three of the major title contenders had made statements \u2013 City, Arsenal and Liverpool each scoring four times in victory \u2013 and Chelsea had to respond. How they did so, and it was the control with which they won that resonated most loudly. Conte danced around the questions about his club\u2019s title-winning prospects but, on this evidence, the notion is far from outlandish.</p> <p>Conte had moved Azpilicueta back into the back three at John Terry\u2019s expense, after the 2-1 EFL Cup defeat at West Ham United last Wednesday, with Moses and Alonso returning to the starting lineup. The A-team had been reinstated and, with N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Nemanja Matic harrying relentlessly in front of the defence, there was a robustness about Chelsea.</p> <p>There were numerous moments when their height and physical power was decisive, particularly in the air on defensive set-pieces and, with Haz-ard and Diego Costa at the other end, Conte had the ruthlessness where it mattered the most.</p> <p>Puel gave Hazard his professional debut at Lille and he could curse Steven Davis for taking his eyes off him in the sixth minute. Hazard\u2019s goal was marked by his presence of mind. He could have crossed when Moses ushered him in but the he believed that there was a better option.</p> <p>For long spells Chelsea were happy to allow Southampton to have the ball, and Conte\u2019s formation was more 5-4-1 than 3-4-3, with the wing-backs and wide attackers dropped back. When Southampton looked forward, it felt like a daunting assignment to plot the way&#xa0;through.</p> <p>Costa\u2019s goal was a beauty out of very little and, in many respects, this was the perfectly balanced away-day performance. It ought not to have been this straightforward. Chelsea have their tails up.</p>",

  "<p>No election has a global impact to match a US presidential contest. Few White House races have been more bitter than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">the current one</a> between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. So any public official who intervenes in it, 11 days before polling, needs to be very sure what they are doing. Such interventions don\u2019t come bigger than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\" title=\"\">FBI director James Comey\u2019s announcement</a> that the bureau is reopening its probe of Mrs Clinton\u2019s private emails. The potential impact is huge. Until last Friday, Mrs Clinton was looking on course to hand Mr Trump a decisive beating. It may still happen. But that is now all up in the air.</p> <p>Mr Comey\u2019s defence appears to be that justice must be done and that he would be damned if he made the announcement and damned if he didn\u2019t. It is certainly true that US politics has become so polarised and so riddled with paranoia that the FBI director faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fbi-guilty-political-act-crucial-moment\" title=\"\">an unenviable choice</a>. If he had carried out the new investigation behind closed doors and it had only become public after the election, whatever the result, one or both sides would be certain to cry foul. Conspiracy theorists would have had a field day. Yet by making it public now, he makes the investigation itself into a red-hot pre-election issue in a contest that will shape not just America but the world \u2013 and that\u2019s awful.</p> <p>This is precisely why the US Justice Department, with which the FBI works, has an established framework of rules designed to protect its impartiality from allegations of political bias. The department puts strict limits on disclosures about ongoing investigations and especially on anything that might be seen as influencing an election. A memorandum to this effect has been issued by a succession of US attorneys general every four years, including in 2016. Mr Comey has broken with this. Former Justice Department officials from both political parties have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comey-is-damaging-our-democracy/2016/10/29/894d0f5e-9e49-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.9ea156488389\" title=\"\">denounced him for this</a> over the weekend. The current attorney general is believed to have advised against it, too.</p> <p>Mr Comey has also compounded the potential abuse of power in two important ways. First, the investigation is at an embryonic stage. It may go no further. In his Friday announcement he spoke of emails \u201cthat appear to be pertinent\u201d to the previous investigation he completed \u2013 concluding then that there was no case to answer \u2013 in the summer. But the emails come from a separate investigation, may not even be from Mrs Clinton at all and the FBI chief has not read them. His phrasing was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\" title=\"\">extraordinarily vague</a>. Mr Comey has thus launched his missile with minimum facts and maximum innuendo. There are echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/13/operation-midland-report-due-met-police-alleged-vip-ring\" title=\"\">British police blunders</a> over child sex allegations. Even louder are the echoes of anti-Clinton fanatics like <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org\" title=\"\">Judicial Watch</a>. This strikes at the democratic process, not just individuals.</p> <p>Second, Mr Comey should not have deferred to Congress, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/28/us/politics/fbi-letter.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">as he did last week</a>. The investigation and prosecution processes should be kept rigorously apart from politics. That\u2019s especially true at election time and even more necessary in such a polarised and acrimonious polity as the US Congress has become. One of the recipients of Mr Comey\u2019s report, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\" title=\"\">Jason Chaffetz</a>, announced even before the FBI director\u2019s move that he intends to begin oversight hearings into Mrs Clinton as soon as she is elected, if she is. Incredible though it may seem to the outside world and many Americans, impeachment efforts by Republicans against Mrs Clinton are already a serious possibility. Law enforcement officials have to be completely scrupulous in such a world. Mr Comey has not been. It is a step towards a lawless process.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton is in many respects the author of her own problems on the email row. But Mr Comey took exactly the wrong decision. If the emails needed investigation, he should have authorised one behind closed doors, carried it out thoroughly, reported it to prosecutors and made an announcement, if one was necessary, in the fullness of time. This is called due process and it is a bulwark of the rule of law, not rule by politicians \u2013 least of all rule by a potential tyrant like Mr Trump.</p> <p>Instead, Mr Comey has rocket-fuelled a venomous contest just when Mr Trump was desperate for a lifeline, just when Republican candidates in other races were craving something to energise their voters and just when some media were becoming bored with the predictability of the White House contest. His action was at best naive and at worst an abuse of office. It may, ultimately, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/29/fbi-email-probe-election-clinton-presidency\" title=\"\">rather less effect on the election outcome</a> than some suppose. Yet it is no consolation that Mr Comey has also guaranteed that, if no charges are brought, he will inevitably be accused of rigging the outcome.</p>",

Christian Eriksen disappointed on the left and the thought occurred that Tottenham needed greater subtlety, a player who could dictate the tempo.</p> <p>They will probably be sharper when Harry Kane returns from the knee injury that has kept him out for more than a month. Pochettino said that his main striker has a 50% chance of being involved on Wednesday. How they could do with Kane to be fit and firing against Arsenal on Sunday.</p> <p>Janssen is yet to prove that he is a suitable alternative. The Dutch striker has scored three penalties since his arrival from AZ Alkmaar and he was not a threat in open play. More damagingly, there were few signs of any understanding with Eriksen, Alli and Son Heung-min. Erik Lamela is likely to start against Leverkusen if he recovers from illness.</p> <p>Those creative players must accept some of the blame. They all flattered to deceive and Pochettino wants them to be more determined in the hunt for goals. If they develop that hunger, Tottenham will take some stopping.</p>",
  "<p>Teenagers should be educated on how to sext more safely and be respectful of each other rather than be persuaded by educational materials to abstain from sexting, a new report says. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://yfoundations.org.au/explore-and-learn/publications/policy-position-papers/\">paper</a>, written by Yfoundations youth health sector support officer Jessie Hunt, is a first in Australian public health policy.

  "<p>The victory against Uber by drivers and the GMB is an important one, and not just for the many workers suffering the effects of bogus self-employment and poverty wages at the hands of big companies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\" title=\"\">Uber drivers triumph in rights battle</a>, 29 October). The rise of Uber has affected the livelihoods of traditional taxi firms all over the country and the pressure to drive down fares has compromised passenger safety.</p> <p>Hedge-funded Uber\u2019s success started with the Tory-Liberal coalition government\u2019s deregulation legislation, which received the royal assent 18 months ago. While the consultation around the bill was going on, I supported the taxi trade here in Medway and many other drivers\u2019 associations and their trade unions who lobbied against deregulation because they knew it would drive down wages and weaken the powers of local councils to determine how many cabs were licensed, or to maintain safe working practices.</p> <p>In spite of the overwhelming consensus in the consultation that the new measures were a bad thing and the achievement of one of the highest responses ever recorded in a legislation consultation, the bill slipped through, demonstrating that the consultation was a sham. Drivers have endured loss of earnings and security, while passengers found themselves driven to their destination by out-of-town strangers, reliant on a sat-nav instead of a local driver who knew the shortest routes. If drivers have behaved badly or their vehicles are in poor condition, the deregulated environment has made it much harder to trace the culprits or to award sanctions against them.</p> <p>The latest court ruling gives me hope that things can change and will embolden other exploited workers to challenge their employers, but if we want a fair and safe taxi trade, then everyone has to play their part. The lure of a cheap fare costs our community much more than the few pounds we think we are saving by taking the Uber option.<br><strong>Cllr Teresa Murray</strong><br><em>Deputy leader of the Labour group on Medway council</em></p> <p>\u2022 The landmark ruling on Uber taxi drivers\u2019 employment rights shows that the development of the so-called gig economy has, to date, been at the expense of the workers. This is hardly a surprise. Alongside the growth in self-employed workers we have seen a rise in the number of freelancers starting co-ops in order to create more security for themselves \u2013 and they have been doing this precisely because employers and legislation do not do it for them.</p> <p>Whether the judgment on Uber will set a precedent for other employers remains to be seen. What is clear is that we need to find a way for self-employed workers \u2013 from taxi drivers to music teachers \u2013 to create greater financial security and less uncertainty for themselves.<br><strong>Ed Mayo</strong><br><em>Secretary general, Co-operatives UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 I applaud the court victory of the Uber drivers and hope it begins a trend to ensure that workers are not exploited by rapacious organisations through false self-employment, zero-hours contracts or employment via an agency. It should also be a reminder that as consumers ever seeking lower prices we are unwittingly complicit in this exploitation. Perhaps we all need to remember that our low price is another\u2019s low pay, and be willing only to buy from companies that treat their workers fairly, even if we have to pay a little more.<br><strong>Michael Miller</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 The rise of self-employment in the UK predates apps and Uber. HMRC must play a leading role in stemming the tide of bogus self-employment forced on workers by firms who regard employment status as a matter of choice rather than tax law. HMRC has a simple to use online tool to determine employment status \u2013 the Employment Status Indicator. Why does HMRC not compel firms to use the ESI for each new worker taken on (with sanctions for wilfully answering the questions wrongly)&#xa0;and to record the results in their records?<br><strong>Malcolm Thick</strong><br><em>Harwell, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 We should welcome the Uber decision, but it is too early to celebrate. While there may be no obvious legal grounds for a challenge, the fact that the implementation of the decision will have widespread implications will not be lost on the government and employers. They will not be supportive. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that discreet pressure, behind the scenes, will be brought to bear to ensure that the appeals tribunal reverses the findings. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but I have little faith in the sanctity of the British legal system.<br><strong>Tim Webb</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Following on from the Uber drivers\u2019 employment status victory, the construction industry was also guilty of dubious practices. Persons seeking work on building sites were handed an officially-designed checklist designed to check their employed/self-employed status, and told to \u201cjust tick these boxes and sign it\u201d. Such men carried out exactly the same jobs as directly employed men on the same site. Although their registration with HMRC was essential, the absence of holiday pay was a constant issue and subject to legal challenges from time to time.<br><strong>Peter Green</strong><br><em>Rotherham, South Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Is the Guardian anti-union?

  "<p>Driven grouse shooting (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/28/grouse-shooting-estates-shored-up-by-millions-in-subsidies\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 28&#xa0;October) is a minority \u201csport\u201d which uses live birds as target practice, yet its destructive effects are paid for by the public. Earlier this year, Dr Mark Avery, Chris Packham, and the League Against Cruel Sports launched a petition calling on the government to ban driven grouse shooting. Shortly after the start of shooting season, the petition passed 100,000 signatures.</p> <p>The effects of driven grouse shooting are wide-ranging and devastating. Birds of prey are relentlessly persecuted to the point where the hen harrier is facing extinction in England. Other animals such as foxes, hares and stoats are wiped out on grouse moors using a range of cruel and indiscriminate devices. The burning of heather contributes to flooding and reduces the effectiveness of moorland to act as a reservoir to store carbon in the ground. All of this is done with considerable subsidy from the public purse; astonishing in these times of austerity.</p> <p>The government needs to take an impartial, scientific look at the industry, and its wider impact. Millions of animals are suffering and our moorlands are becoming monocultures. This is too high a price to pay for a minority hobby. We believe it is time to treasure our natural environment. It is time for a ban on driven grouse shooting.<br><strong>Isobel Hutchinson</strong><em> Director, Animal Aid</em><br><strong>Eduardo Goncalves</strong><em> CEO, League Against Cruel Sports</em><br><strong>Dominic Dyer</strong><em> CEO, Badger Trust</em><br><strong>Philip Mansbridge</strong><em> UK director, International Fund for Animal Welfare</em><br><strong>Claire Bass</strong><em> Executive director, Humane Society International UK</em><br><strong>Elisa Allen</strong><em> Director, Peta UK</em><br><strong>Anne Brummer</strong><em> CEO, Save Me Trust</em></p> <p>\u2022 Only agricultural land is eligible for Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) payments as determined by Defra\u2019s Rural Payments Agency (RPA), which administers the scheme in England. The RPA guidelines make it clear that moorland used primarily for shooting purposes is not eligible for BPS payments, and there is also an \u201cactive farmer\u201d test for claimants along with a range of other criteria to prove that the land is in agricultural use. The primary land use on many moors managed for grouse shooting is low-intensity grazing, often leased to a tenant farmer, and it is the farming side of the business which benefits from these payments, not grouse shooting.</p> <p>Defra may be surprised that anyone is trying to suggest that they are subsidising grouse shooting, but divisive, class-war rhetoric has been an unfortunate feature of the latest campaign against moorland management. This attempt to suggest that government subsidies are being used to pay for grouse shooting makes for sensational headlines, but doesn\u2019t reflect the truth on the ground.</p> <p>Subsidies in the uplands are used to support agricultural and conservation activities, just as they are in the lowlands. These attempts to politicise the debate over how we manage our moorlands are deeply unhelpful, our solutions need to be driven by evidence and based in cooperation between landowners, conservationists and the shooting community.<br><strong>Liam Stokes</strong><br><em>Head of shooting, Countryside Alliance</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

  "<p>My aunt, Leone Exton Beale, who has died aged 94, was the restaurant and catering director at the Westminster theatre, London.</p> <p>She came to the role as the daughter of Leo and Grace Exton, who owned five hotels in Bournemouth. Leone was born and brought up in the town, along with her younger sister, Valerie, and brother, Clive.</p> <p>The family\u2019s lifestyle changed completely when they came under the influence of Leone\u2019s kindergarten teacher, Gweneth Medwin, who was a member of the Oxford Group, the 1930s Christian movement which was renamed Moral Re-Armament (MRA) in 1938. Leone was brought up under the guiding principle of listening early each morning to the \u201cstill, small voice\u201d of God in order to determine the priorities for the day ahead.</p> <p>After attending boarding school in Felixstowe, Suffolk, Leone trained as a nurse but committed herself full-time to MRA\u2019s work. This took her to London, where plays written by MRA authors, addressing contemporary ethical issues from a faith perspective, were staged at the Westminster.</p> <p>At first, Leone helped backstage \u2013 but she also often found herself dancing and singing on stage, and, as a result of touring internationally with the company, acting in films such as Jotham Valley (1952), shot in the US. The outreach programmes of MRA took her all over the world: to America, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and to countries throughout Europe.</p> <p>Returning to London, Leone lived at first in Victoria, close to the Westminster theatre in Palace Street (now the site of the St James theatre), before moving into Valerie\u2019s family home nearby.</p> <p>Leone\u2019s hotel background stood her in good stead as the Westminster\u2019s catering director. The role involved her care for all the restaurant\u2019s customers \u2013 among them politicians, company executives and celebrities \u2013 and an attention to detail which they greatly appreciated.</p> <p>On her retirement, at the age of 71, she moved back to Bournemouth. There, in 1992, she was reunited with Frank Beale, a former mayor of Bournemouth and United Reformed Church elder, whom she had not seen in 46 years. They had been sweethearts as teenagers, though their lives had taken separate paths.

  "<p>The GMB union has accused Uber of misleading its drivers by claiming last week\u2019s tribunal decision on working conditions only affects two drivers involved in the case. </p> <p>In a long-awaited judgment, an employment tribunal agreed with two drivers for the ride-hailing app that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\">Uber\u2019s drivers were not self-employed and should receive the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, annual leave and other benefits</a>. Uber has said it will appeal against the judgment.</p> <p>James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam brought the case on behalf of a group 19 Uber workers who argued they were employed by the San Francisco-based company and not working for themselves. Lawyers said the victory would affect their fellow Uber drivers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/28/uber-ruling-an-enormous-decision-says-employment-lawyer-video\">have implications for tens of thousands of workers</a> in the so-called gig economy.</p> <p>But the GMB said Uber sent an email to its 40,000 drivers on Friday, signed by its regional general manager for northern Europe, Jo Bertram, who was criticised by the tribunal judges for using \u201ctwisted language\u201d and for being \u201cgrimly loyal\u201d to her company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-gig-economy-obligations-not-excuses-to-workers-are-needed\">The Guardian view on the gig economy: obligations not excuses to workers are needed | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bertram\u2019s email to the drivers said: \u201cAs you may be aware, earlier this year a small number of London partner-drivers brought a claim to challenge their self-employed status with Uber. Although we have today heard that this challenge has been successful at this first stage, it\u2019s very important to note that today\u2019s decision only affects two individuals and Uber will be appealing it.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be no change to your partnership with Uber in light of this decision and we will continue to support the overwhelming majority of drivers who tell us that they use the Uber app to be their own boss and choose when and where to drive.\u201d</p> <p>The tribunal judges dismissed Uber\u2019s claim that its London operation was a mosaic of thousands of small businesses linked by a technology platform as \u201cfaintly ridiculous\u201d. They said Uber resorted to \u201cfictions, twisted language and even brand new terminology\u201d to portray their drivers as self-employed.</p> <p>In their judgment, the <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aslam-and-farrar-v-uber-reasons-20161028.pdf\">tribunal judges singled out Bertram for criticism</a> and quoted from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet to cast doubt on her testimony.</p> <p>\u201cMs Bertram spoke of Uber assisting the drivers to \u2018grow\u2019 their businesses, but no driver is in a position to do anything of the kind, unless growing his business simply means spending more hours at the wheel. Reflecting on the case, and on the grimly loyal evidence of Ms Bertram in particular, we cannot help being reminded of Queen Gertrude\u2019s most celebrated line: \u2018The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>Maria Ludkin, GMB\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cEven after the judge found Ms Bertram\u2019s evidence lacked credibility and described her as \u2018grimly loyal\u2019, she continues to try and advance a misleading and false set of facts. The Uber judgment applies to 40,000 UK drivers, not two. Ms Bertram might be wise to think how this judgment reflects on her before she issues any more statements.\u201d</p> <p>Uber will take the case to the employment appeal tribunal, and following its decision there could be further hearings in the court of appeal and then the supreme court. Any payments due to drivers will not be calculated until that process is over.</p> <p>Other drivers with the firm will not automatically receive payouts but, if the company accepts the ruling, it will have to change its contracts to avoid more cases being brought by drivers. Lawyers say that Uber\u2019s terms and conditions are similar for all of its UK operatives.</p> <p>GMB also rejected Uber\u2019s claim that its drivers earned an average \u00a316 an hour and that most wanted to keep the flexibility their current contracts provide.</p> <p>Ludkin said: \u201cThis judgment in no way affects driver flexibility, it merely guarantees them basic employment rights. Uber\u2019s decision to appeal that is purely related to protecting their ample profits and nothing to do with protecting the drivers.\u201d<br></p> <p>Meanwhile other cases are likely to follow the Uber judgment. Cycle couriers are making similar claims against firms including CitySprint, Addison Lee, eCourier and Excel. Law firms are also talking to workers at Deliveroo, which delivers meals by cycle and motorbike.</p> <p>An Uber spokesman said: \u201cThe ruling would affect the two drivers that were the test cases in the tribunal. However, while we appeal this judgement drivers that use the Uber app remain independent and able to choose when and where they drive.\u201d<br></p>",

The older Choi claimed that Yuk had appeared to him in a dream and asked him to help her traumatised daughter.</p> <p>Choi reportedly married six times, had numerous aliases and founded a shady pseudo-Christian cult called the Church of Eternal Life.</p> <p>Choi Soon-sil and Park grew closer still after the death of Choi\u2019s father in 1994, four years before Park was elected to the national assembly.</p> <p>Choi\u2019s ex-husband worked as a close aide to Park in the run-up to her successful presidential bid in 2012, and was allegedly with the president on the day of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/16/rescuers-battle-to-save-476-passengers-after-ferry-sinks-off-south-korea\">Sewol ferry tragedy</a> in April 2014, in which 300 schoolchildren, teachers and crew drowned.</p> <p>At the weekend thousands of protesters accused Park of betraying public trust and of gross mismanagement, and one recent poll showed 70% of voters wanted her to resign or be impeached.</p> <p>Few observers believe the crisis will lead to her resignation, with little more than a year left of her single five-year term in the Blue House. Opposition parties have demanded an investigation, but have stopped short of calling for her impeachment.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Park offered the country a brief apology, but insisted Choi\u2019s influence had not extended beyond checking drafts of her speeches soon after she entered the presidential Blue House in early 2013. \u201cChoi is someone who helped me in a difficult time in the past, and I received her help on some of my speeches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Files obtained from Choi\u2019s personal computer by the broadcaster JTBC TV, however, suggest Choi edited some of Park\u2019s key speeches and received confidential documents, including files relating to Japan and North Korea.</p> <p>In an interview with South Korea\u2019s Segye Ilbo newspaper last week, Choi confirmed she had received drafts of Park\u2019s speeches but denied she had influenced government policy or benefitted financially.</p> <p>Park sought to defuse the controversy by demanding the resignation of 10 of her senior secretaries and promising a cabinet reshuffle, but the move has done little to cool criticism of her conduct.</p> <p>Some observers believe that Park will ride out calls for her resignation, with opposition parties reluctant to plunge the country into the political uncertainty that would accompany a lengthy impeachment trial.</p> <p>Victor Cha, a senior adviser and Korea chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Park was unlikely to quit. \u201cDespite calls from the opposition parties for her resignation (which are only likely to grow during the Choi investigation), the more likely outcome is that she may heed demands to leave the Saenuri party, particularly if Saenuri wants to distance itself from Park in the 2017 presidential election year,\u201d Cha <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/controversy-roils-park-government\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea\u2019s largest newspaper, said the scandal marked \u201c<a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/10/26/2016102601669.html\">a complete collapse</a> of a president\u2019s ability to run a government\u201d.

  "<p>Chelsea\u2019s title challenge under Antonio Conte seems more persuasive with every passing week. This was arguably a more impressively constructed victory than that handed to them so obligingly by Manchester United the previous Sunday, a win chiselled out against one of the form teams in the division and a side who had not lost here since February.

This, in contrast, was a masterclass in how to exert almost complete control despite the home side hogging the ball for the majority of the play. Conte\u2019s side, so expertly drilled, kept their opponents at arm\u2019s length throughout.

Claude Puel cited fatigue as a contributory factor, but figuratively thumping your head against a brick wall for 90 minutes can presumably have that effect. \u201cIt is so difficult to play against,\u201d added the Frenchman through a sigh.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/30/chelsea-antonio-conte-eden-hazard-diego-costa-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a37h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2856428\"            data-video-name=\"Chelsea's Antonio Conte has high praise for goalscorers Hazard and Costa \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5816512ee4b08d944ba4c5b0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/30/161030ChelseaPresser_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/30/161030ChelseaPresser.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/30/161030ChelseaPresser_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/30/chelsea-antonio-conte-eden-hazard-diego-costa-video\">Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Conte has high praise for goalscorers Hazard and Costa</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Stubborn, well-marshalled defence alone would not have been enough to prevail here, but Chelsea boast sufficient spark in forward areas to capitalise on such solidity. Those wing-backs, and particularly the revived Victor Moses down the right, offer pace and width while the trickery of Eden Hazard and Pedro combines thrillingly with Diego Costa\u2019s brute strength.</p> <p>The goal the Spain international curled so gloriously beyond an exposed Fraser Forster from just outside the penalty area 10 minutes into the second half, as Cuco Martina limply hung out a leg in a half-hearted attempt to block, was his eighth this season and 40th in only 64 top-flight outings, a record all the more staggering given his own rather fitful contribution through last season\u2019s toils.</p> <p>Costa may not always see eye-to-eye with a manager every bit as intense on the touchline as the striker is out on the turf, but a player whose temperament has so often left him open to sanction has led the line through four league wins without accruing the fifth yellow card of term that will see him serve a ban. The 28-year-old has effectively played on the edge of suspension for well over a month, retaining his snarl but ensuring his infamously physical and inflammatory approach has not crossed the line. At some point the yellow will come Costa\u2019s way but, at present, it is more appropriate to acknowledge the goalscoring contribution he is making to the team.</p> <p>Then there is Hazard. It had been the Belgian who eased the visitors aheadat St Mary\u2019s, a cleverly delivered move upfield culminating in Moses slipping a return pass round Ryan Bertrand for the winger, evading Steve Davis, to collect. He took his time to tease out Davis\u2019 sliding tackle before cutting inside and ripping a low shot through Forster\u2019s legs at his near post.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/everton-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\">Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley get Everton back on track against West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the third successive game in which Hazard had scored, swelling his season\u2019s tally to five. He has managed more goals in 10 games this season than he mustered in all 31 last time round and feels less of an indulgence when he contributes like this. \u201cHe has come back to a good level after last season\u2019s difficulties,\u201d said Puel, who had handed Hazard his first-team debut while at Lille. The 25-year-old was a constant threat here, as he has been all season, and was denied further reward only by Forster\u2019s excellence and a timely Jos\u00e9 Fonte interception.</p> <p>Southampton should not wallow in this mismatch overly long. They have Internazionale to come here on Thursday in the Europa League, when Puel will seek an immediate response. They are more than capable of claiming that tie so impressive has their own recent form proved, but here it was Chelsea who imposed themselves more coherently. It took them 20 games and into the new year to gather this many points last season. This time round theirs is an unnerving presence hovering on the leading trio\u2019s shoulder.</p>",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Spaniard has plenty of qualities - you don\u2019t play in <em>that </em>Barcelona team without qualities - but to my mind Willian is a far more consistent threat, and better at playing the ball between the lines. His free kicks aren\u2019t half bad either. Is Conte just sticking with a winning team, or is Pedro really the better choice?\u201d</p> <p>Willian is probably a better player but I\u2019d say Pedro suits the 3-4-3 system a bit better.

Now, after Antonio Conte\u2019s switch to three at the back, they are apparently the likeliest challengers to Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool.</p> <p>William Goldman was right: nobody knows anything. So we might as well just enjoy what looks like a cracking game between Chelsea and the always admirable Southampton. Chelsea are the only team to win a league match at St Mary\u2019s this year, a reflection of how tricky a match this is likely to be.

  "<p>When I was a child in Lahore in Pakistan, my parents employed a&#xa0;driver called Sultan. Sultan, a retired soldier, was from a village near Jhelum. He was a cheerful man in his 60s who readily joined in our games of&#xa0;badminton. But to me the most interesting fact about Sultan was that he could speak Italian. A&#xa0;fragmentary, broken Italian, but Italian nonetheless, picked up as a prisoner of war in Italy. He called me <em>signorina</em> and taught me three Italian words: <em>si</em>, <em>grazie</em> and <em>buongiorno</em>. Decades later, when I told my children about Sultan, they were gobsmacked. What was a Pakistani villager doing fighting in Italy? He wasn\u2019t Pakistani then, I&#xa0;explained, he was Indian. Sultan was one of more than two million Indian soldiers who fought for the allies in the second world war. \u201cNo! Really?\u201d they breathed.</p> <p>My children (daughter 17, son 15) were born and raised in London and have had the good fortune to attend fantastic schools where they have been offered, alongside the usual array of subjects, a rich diet of music, drama, art, sport and languages. Their extracurricular clubs include Arabic, feminism, astronomy, mindfulness and carpentry. In my convent school in Lahore, I had to listen in&#xa0;respectful silence. In London, they are encouraged to question and argue.</p> <p>Yet, for all the range and candour of their education, they haven\u2019t once encountered Britain\u2019s colonial past in school. My daughter is now in her second year of A-levels. She has studied history from the age of nine, but the closest she has come&#xa0;to any mention of empire was in her GCSE syllabus that included the run-up to the second world war. While studying the Treaty of Versailles, she learned that some countries had colonies at the time and, as part of Germany\u2019s punishment, it was stripped of its colonial possessions. Period.</p> <p>Though she read about the brutal battles in the&#xa0;Pacific and North Africa, no mention was made of the 2.5 million Indian soldiers who volunteered to fight in the second world war \u2013 or the 1.3 million who served in 1914-18. There was nothing about the 87,000 jawans killed in 1939-45. She&#xa0;had no notion of the massive contribution India \u2013 and Britain\u2019s other colonies \u2013 made to the war effort. Hence her astonishment at Sultan\u2019s Italian connection.</p> <p>Of course, my kids know that their grandparents, along with the citizens of almost half the globe, were once British subjects. But they have acquired this knowledge at home, not at school. Aged 11, my son learned in a geography class that one of the many reasons Ghana (the Gold Coast to its 19th-century British rulers) was economically less developed was because of its colonial past. It had been stripped of its wealth by the British. Just one bland sentence. Now, in secondary school, he is currently reading a past Booker winner, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/white-tiger.html\" title=\"\">The White Tiger</a> by Aravind Adiga. For half-term, his English teacher has asked him to read another novel about India. The list she has&#xa0;given him includes Rudyard Kipling\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/kim-11.html\" title=\"\">Kim</a>, EM Forster\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/passage-to-india-3.html\" title=\"\">A&#xa0;Passage to India</a> and Salman Rushdie\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/midnight-s-children-5.html\" title=\"\">Midnight\u2019s Children</a>. I imagine some mention of&#xa0;colonialism will be made when discussing those texts.</p> <p>But even this is off-piste learning, the initiative of an individual teacher; it is not part of the curriculum. Last year, my daughter, who is studying history of art at A-level, was taken to see Tate Britain\u2019s exhibition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/23/artist-and-empire-review-tate-britain\" title=\"\">Art and Empire</a>. Her teacher thought it important for the paper on orientalism and, something of a political activist in her youth, gave them an impassioned lecture on Britain\u2019s imperial past. But the historical context was not obligatory in the curriculum. Students were required to restrict themselves to a technical visual analysis of the paintings they studied, not explore the political background that produced them.</p> <p>Dr Mukulika Banerjee, director of the <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/southAsia/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">South Asia Centre</a> and associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, talks of British students who \u201carrive at university completely ignorant about the empire, that vital part of their history. When we talk of Syria today, they have no knowledge of Britain\u2019s role in the Middle East in the last century. When discussing burning political questions today, they have no historical context to &#xa0;draw on that links Britain\u2019s own past with those events. Similarly, they have no clue about the history of the immigration. They don\u2019t understand why people of other ethnicities came to Britain in the first place. They haven\u2019t learned any of it at school. So, in their second year at university, when my students discover the extent of their ignorance, they are furious.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know whether this amnesia is due to embarrassment or fear of reparations or, indeed, a&#xa0;sinister desire to keep the electorate ignorant and pliable. Whatever the original rationale, the ugly xenophobia unleashed since the EU referendum has brought home the urgent need to reform history textbooks and address this abyss at their heart. Without it, they are distorted, dishonest. I used to laugh when British people asked me where I&#xa0;had learned my English. (Despite 20&#xa0;years in&#xa0;this country, I still have a strong Pakistani accent.) Post-Brexit, I am not amused. And it\u2019s no good pretending that the history of Malaysia, Nigeria, India or Kenya is world history and therefore not relevant to the modern British curriculum. It is British history. To quote Kipling, that controversial yet compelling poet of empire: \u201cWhat should they know of England who only England know?\u201d</p>",

That year, he joined a Senate investigation into Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s real estate investments, named Whitewater after a failed venture they joined. </p> <p>He remained in the background of an investigation that ultimately petered out, but Comey soon joined two prestigious prosecutor\u2019s offices, in eastern Virginia and Manhattan, where he pursued high-profile cases against <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/26/nyregion/identity-ring-said-to-victimize-30000.html?pagewanted=all\">identity thieves</a>, a top <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/13/business/top-technology-banker-indicted-on-obstruction.html\">Credit Suisse banker</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/05/business/prosecuting-martha-stewart-overview-martha-stewart-indicted-us-obstruction.html\">Martha Stewart</a>.</p> <p>In 2003, he was named deputy attorney general in the administration of George W Bush, becoming a dissenting voice against surveillance programs of the National Security Agency <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/bush-lets-us-spy-on-callers-without-courts.html\">revealed in 2005</a> by the New York Times. </p> <p>Comey later testified to Congress that one night in March 2004, with attorney general John Ashcroft hospitalized for an emergency procedure, he raced to the sickbed to prevent the renewal of warrantless wiretapping programs which the justice department had determined were illegal.</p> <p>Comey arrived just before Bush\u2019s top lawyer and chief of staff, and Ashcroft did not sign the renewal. \u201cI was angry,\u201d Comey <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051500864.html\">told the Senate</a> in 2007. \u201cI thought I just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man, who did not have the powers of the attorney general because they had been transferred to me.

Their key players are fit which means their key combinations are working; the best time to play them has already passed. </p> <p>Everton, meanwhile, are in the midst of their own dodgy run. Since beating Middlesbrough in the middle of last month, they\u2019ve not won a game, losing to Norwich, Bournemouth and Burnley and drawing with Crystal Palace and Manchester City. And yet, they are a team of formidable attacking ability. Ross Barkley is a transcendental talent - if he can learn the game, he will be a star - and on a good day, Romelu Lukaku is unplayable. Behind them, Gareth Barry and Idrissa Gueye know what to do, and on the wing, Yannick Bolasie and Kevin Mirallas are, well, wingers.

Seti\u2019s policy, once it is fairly sure that an intercepted signal is an alien message, will be to share it openly to allow people all over the world to try to understand it. Thereafter, it will be hard to stop anyone from answering. \u201cI would have thought that there would be a reply made in some form at some point round the globe by someone with the required equipment,\u201d Elliot says.</p> <p>This scenario imagines receiving a transmission, but not alien visitors themselves. The chance of that is considered remote, even by those who expect aliens to exist, because even aliens are presumed to work within the laws of physics. In summary: our galaxy is a flattish disc about 100,000 light years across, and our planet is right at a sparse edge of it; only a small proportion of the planets in our galaxy are within, say, 1,000 light years of us. As a result, even a craft from such a nearby planet travelling directly towards us at half of light speed \u2013 which may be impossibly fast for a machine with life inside it \u2013 would take 2,000 years to get here. Why would it come? And what are the chances of it arriving exactly now?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a1171ac46b9bc485b1ac33932e575b2e8b0b7b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a1171ac46b9bc485b1ac33932e575b2e8b0b7b2/0_0_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Spielberg\u2019s Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of this world ...

Much of the problem is a matter of linguistics. Part of Elliot\u2019s work is to devise and understand languages that might make sense to an intelligent alien \u2013 so-called xenolinguistics. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as if you\u2019re in the Amazon rainforest and you encounter a lost tribe,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d include their message, or part of it, as an echo. But you\u2019d need to have something simple at the front and build upon it.\u201d A good part of the work could be done by sending simple binary images \u2013 perhaps a picture of a rock \u2013 and starting to establish words from there.</p> <p>The trouble is, it won\u2019t happen quickly. If the aliens are only 100 light years away, their message will be 100 years old by the time we get it \u2013 as will our reply by the time it turns up. \u201cIt\u2019s a 200-year turnaround even just to say hello,\u201d says Elliot. We might improve on this by imagining a technology that can send messages faster than light, but then we have overturned a fundamental law of physics, which leaves yet more explaining to do.</p>",
  "<p>About 100 minutes into Adam Curtis\u2019s latest documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/09/adam-curtis-donald-trump-documentary-hypernormalisation\">HyperNormalisation</a>, there\u2019s a montage of movie scenes in which skyscrapers are blown up by bad guys, crumbling into themselves as people leap from flaming top-storey windows. All of these films, Curtis tells us, were made before 9/11. As the strangely prophetic scenes keep coming, Suicide\u2019s Dream Baby Dream drones in the background. </p> <p>In the context of a film convinced that we have \u201cretreated into a dream world that allows dark and destructive forces to fester and grow outside\u201d, Martin Rev and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/18/suicide-alan-vega-punk-pioneer\">Alan Vega</a>\u2019s track seems to mock the state of blissful ignorance Curtis believes society has wrapped itself in. Dream Baby Dream is a song that hangs between hope and nihilism, and Curtis\u2019 disaster reel embraces the latter. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Dream Baby Dream\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aguardianmusic%3Aplaylist%3A6qTIelayZ3NlNPMYddoVgM\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Released in 1979, two years after an earlier incarnation, Keep Your Dreams, had been recorded, Dream Baby Dream is unquantifiable. There\u2019s a weightlessness to it, a timelessness too, which perhaps explains why it\u2019s circled back around. Anchored by an urgent electric drum beat that lurks like a ticking bomb beneath Vega\u2019s murky vocals, its lyrics are stark, yet impenetrable. \u201cDream baby dream, forever and ever,\u201d sings Vega in a voice that has been likened to Elvis \u2013 though it\u2019s more of a hazy drawl, with Vega swallowing his consonants as if he lacks the enthusiasm to let his lips touch. \u201cYeah those dreams keep you free.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/18/suicide-alan-vega-punk-pioneer\">Suicide's Alan Vega: a punk pioneer who shoved the streets back in people's faces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where Curtis drew on the song\u2019s darkness, Bruce Springsteen found hope. His cover version, which he recorded in 2014 after performing it live for nearly a decade, shaves off some of the original\u2019s eeriness \u2013 with its purposely flat, unresolved melodies \u2013 and sneaks in a little more sentimentality. Where Vega mumbles the line, \u201cI see that smile on your face now baby, yeah you got the idea now\u201d, Springsteen sings, \u201cI just wanna see you smile / Now I just wanna see you smile\u201d. He adds new lyrics too: \u201cCome on and open up your hearts \u2026 come on darling and dry your eyes.\u201d Suicide\u2019s refrain is a vague suggestion, of which even they don\u2019t seem entirely convinced. Springsteen\u2019s is a command: \u201cDream, baby, dream.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cA lot of bands have done my stuff, Suicide stuff, and they basically try and copy and do it the way that you do it,\u201d Vega said of Springsteen\u2019s cover back in 2005. \u201cThank God \u2013 finally somebody did their version of it. He did it his way, and such a great way, that I\u2019m going to have to sing it that way, or not sing it at all any more.\u201d<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaZRSQfFo8Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eaZRSQfFo8Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Bruce Springsteen: Dream Baby Dream video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s this version that crops up in another film released this year, Andrea Arnold\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold\">American Honey</a>. In one of the road movie\u2019s best scenes, Sasha Lane\u2019s Star clambers into the passenger seat of a lorry to try to sell a magazine subscription to its middle-aged driver. He\u2019s in a rush, he says, so she decides to travel with him to his next pit stop. Something bad is going to happen. You can feel it in the dank, dusty highway air. Besides, the rules of cinema dictate that vulnerable young women don\u2019t get into cars with strange men without something very bad happening. But it doesn\u2019t. Instead, the driver puts on a tape of Dream Baby Dream, Star announces, delighted, \u201cI know this one!\u201d and for a blissful couple of minutes the two of them sing along tunelessly as he drives. It\u2019s a moment of pure optimism. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28d85e44583e8f58dc08db5f309901b5964df07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28d85e44583e8f58dc08db5f309901b5964df07f/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sasha Lane in American Honey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Optimism \u2026 Sasha Lane in American Honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Film4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The song\u2019s ambiguity lends itself well to other artists\u2019 interpretations; they find just enough space to pour themselves into it. <a href=\"http://www.qthemusic.com/17087/savages-dream-baby-dream-live-q-awards-16/\">Savages started playing it live</a>, then released their live version as a B-side in 2014.

To suggest, maybe, that its enigmatic and contradictory tone are fitting in today\u2019s unsettled climate. But, in truth, the song\u2019s appeal is no more tangible now than it was almost 40 years ago. \u201cSome folks find it sad,\u201d says Cherry, \u201cothers endlessly happy and blessed.

  "<p>Ministers are looking at whether to ban unpaid internships that have been criticised for helping young people with wealthy parents get ahead in the workplace.</p> <p>Damian Hinds, the employment minister, said it was right to review internships as unpaid posts are not accessible to those who do not have help with their living costs.</p> <p>He told ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday: \u201cI think it is important that young people have an opportunity to get work experience. One of the big barriers to getting a job is not having had employment experience and so there is a role for work experience.

  "<p>Prime minister Matteo Renzi swore that Italy would rebuild devastated towns and villages across central Italy that were rocked by a 6.6-magnitude earthquake on Sunday morning, saying the area represented the \u201csoul of our country\u201d.</p> <p>It was the most powerful earthquake to hit Italy since 1980, striking a blow to the regions of Marche and Umbria just days after they were hit by two other earthquakes. It also frightened and displaced thousands of already-jittery residents who have seen the ancient structures and walls in their towns, including the San Benedetto basilica in Norcia, which is considered a sacred site, crumble into heaps on the street.</p> <p>\u201cWe will rebuild everything \u2014 the houses, the churches, the shops. We are dealing with marvelous territories, territories of beauty,\u201d Renzi said.</p> <p>The epicentre of the latest earthquake was about 40 miles (68km) (40 miles) south-west of Perugia and close to the town of Norcia, which had also been hit by Wednesday night\u2019s quakes. </p> <p>There were no reported fatalities in the wake of the quake on Sunday, although it was even more powerful than the 2009 earthquake that hit L\u2019Aquila, killing more than 300 people, and worse than the August earthquake that killed hundreds in Amatrice. </p> <p>There were about a dozen injuries, with one person described as being in serious condition. Emergency services pulled three people from the rubble in Tolentino, a town in Marche. Main roads to the affected areas were closed, some impassable due to large boulders falling to the ground in the rocky, mountainous terrain.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re safe,\u201d Alberto Rendina, the owner of a bar in Norcia, told La Stampa.</p> <p>\u201cThis morning, my wife was late opening the bar and was saved.\u201d The family was at home but had been sleeping on the floor near the door, in preparation \u201cfor any eventuality\u201d, Rendina said. <br></p> <p>Residents in Visso, a town of 1,107 in Marche, told Sky TV that their homes \u201care no longer there\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe bedroom has collapsed into the living room,\u201d one resident said.<br></p> <p>A man looked stunned as he was asked question by a journalist on television and could barely answer as he fiddled with a crate holding his dog, which he put in the back of a pick up truck.</p> <p>Regional officials in Marche warned that the earthquakes could lead to 100,000 residents being displaced.</p> <p>Requests for some 5,000 beds have been made to hotels along the Adriatic coast. \u201cBut we think this number will rise,\u201d Marco Manfredi, the chief of the Ancona unit for Confcommercio, the Italian business association, told La Stampa.</p> <p>The earthquakes in August and earlier this week had already displaced about 14,000, said Paolo Bazzurro, professor of Hazard and Risk Assessment at the University Institute for Superior Studies (IUSS) in Pavia, but he said the number would rise.</p> <p>\u201cThat there have not been any deaths is partly due to the fact that many houses were not inhabited after the quake on Wednesday. Also there were many that hadn\u2019t been inspected yet, so people would not have received an order [to return home],\u201d Bazzurro said.</p> <p>\u201cWith the winter drawing in, housing people will be much more complicated,\u201d he added, saying more aftershocks or other earthquakes could be expected in the next days and weeks. </p> <p>While there was relative relief that the area was spared mass casualties, there were other losses that were devastating. Centuries-old structures, including the cathedral and basilica of San Benedetto in Norcia, a 14th century church that was built to honor the patron saint of Europe, Saint Benedict, was reduced to rubble, as was a tower and St Augustine church in Amatrice.<br></p> <p>News of the basilica\u2019s destruction was confirmed by Benedictine monks in Norcia who reported it on Twitter. In a statement on Sunday morning the monks said they were safe because they had temporarily moved their monastery after August\u2019s earthquake in Amatrice, but that there were looking for victims who might possible require the sacrament of last rites, given to people close to death. </p> <p>The statement, <a href=\"http://us13.campaign-archive2.com/?u=9c8b7f2ca0c8ac14f8ab4b8c1&amp;id=7df0ad2401\">posted</a> below an image of the ruined basilica, said: \u201cMay this image serve to illustrate the power of this earthquake, and the urgency we monks feel to seek out those who need the sacraments on this difficult day for Italy.\u201d</p> <p>The quake was strongly felt in Rome, where it temporarily shut the city\u2019s metro lines to let officials check for damage, and some reported feeling tremors as far away as tremors in neighbouring countries Slovenia and Croatia.<br></p> <p>St Paul\u2019s Outside the Walls basilica was also temporarily shut after some plaster fell off the church but was later reopened. Vatican firefighters inspected St Peter\u2019s basilica and other churches in the area.</p> <p>On Sunday morning, live television images showed firefighters in Norcia\u2019s main square helping people running down small alleyways seeking safety, including monks and nuns from a nearby monastery. Some then fell to their knees in prayer in the town\u2019s main square.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/quakemap-zip/giv-1406C6IxvR09M0EO/\" data-alt=\"Towns affected by Italian earthquake\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/quakemap-zip/giv-1406C6IxvR09M0EO/\">Towns affected by Italian earthquake</a> </figure>  <p>Major destruction was also reported in other small towns.</p> <p>\u201cIt all came down.

There had already been \u201cred zones\u201d in place, abandoned after the previous quakes. \u201cThe few people who remained have gone out to the streets and are embracing. Now we\u2019re going around to see what happened,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Cesare Spuri, the head of civil protection in Marche, said: \u201cThere are collapses everywhere. We report collapses in Muccia, Tolentino and in the areas surrounding Macerata. We\u2019re trying to establish if people are underneath the rubble. There was also a strong shock in Ancona.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s collapsed. I see plumes of smoke, it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said Marco Rinaldi, the mayor of Ussita, a town in the Marche that was among the worst hit in a 6.1-magnitude quake on Wednesday night.<br></p> <p>In Rome, the strong tremors caused concern.</p> <p>\u201cI was woken up by the earthquake,\u201d Gianpaolo Giovannelli, who lives in the Flaminio area of Rome, told the Guardian. \u201cThe apartment started to shake. We feel them here in Rome, but we never get used to them so each time we feel fear.\u201d <br></p> <p>Assia Staffoli, from Rome, said her husband put their six-year-old daughter under the table when they felt the earthquake, which caused their bedrooms, on a mezzanine level, to shake badly.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re told to do when there\u2019s an earthquake, go under the table,\u201d Staffoli said. \u201cI was feeding my son [aged seven months] when it happened. We then quickly left the apartment.\u201d</p>",

Admittedly, that\u2019s not an especially high bar, but with his record (he\u2019s won promotion in the last four seasons he\u2019s managed in this division), they could hardly have found a safer pair of hands.</p> <p><strong>After Villa\u2019s ropey start to the season under Roberto di Matteo,</strong> a fifth might look like a tall order, but they\u2019re only seven points off the playoffs and a win here would put Birmingham under some pressure. \u201cIt will certainly help if you can get the result,\u201d Bruce said this week. \u201cTwo weeks ago we were in the bottom three. If we do manage to turn them over we\u2019d be three points behind them and sitting outside the play-offs. That\u2019s got to be the long-term game and if we do make it three wins out of four it would be a smashing achievement for what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Opposite Bruce, the old stager and experienced hand, </strong><strong>will be Gary Rowett,</strong> one of the division\u2019s brightest young managers. Having guided Blues through years of uncertainty as their chaotic ownership situation precluded him from really spending any money of note, that is now (almost) sorted and he can get on with being a normal manager. Rowett usually has a glass of wine before games as his team are warming up, but given this is a noon kick-off, that might be more of a struggle. \u201cI might have a bottle for breakfast, I might even put it on my cornflakes!\u201d he joked the other day. Or, at least, I hope he was joking.</p> <p><strong>This game is usually pretty spicy,</strong> and we\u2019ll have some highlights from games past for you shortly.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 12.00 GMT</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>The phone call that would, just hours later, inflict a highly damaging blow to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions came through to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold mid-morning on Friday 7 October.

Would he be interested in viewing it?</p> <p>\u201cDavid recognised immediately that [the footage] was explosive,\u201d says the Post\u2019s executive editor Martin Baron, \u201cand the first task was to make sure it was authenticated, which he was able to do pretty quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The Post sent a transcript of the video \u2013 outtakes from a 2005 edition of the NBC show Access Hollywood, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">Trump is heard bragging</a> that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star \u2026 you can do anything [to women] \u2026 grab them by the pussy\u201d \u2013 to the Trump campaign for comment. </p> <p>\u201cThey asked us for the actual video,\u201d says the softly-spoken Baron, \u201cand shortly after that they sent us Donald Trump\u2019s initial response.\u201d Five hours on from the tip-off, the video and accompanying piece went live on the Post, reverberating around the world.</p> <p>While Grope-gate (as <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/10/trumps-defense-gropegate-accusers-too-ugly-molest\">some</a> are inevitably calling it) may be a far cry from Watergate, the Post\u2019s most famous scoop, it was nevertheless a momentum-shifting event in the presidential race, which has seen Trump, who had previously claimed that he could <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/donald-trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-and-still-not-lose-voters\">\u201cshoot somebody\u201d on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue</a> and not lose votes, since <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/clinton-holds-lead-in-new-polls-but-trump-tape-impact-mixed.html\">struggle</a> to regain his swagger. Yet, while the Trump revelations have lately flowed thick and fast, there has been criticism (even in the Post) that much of the US media was initially slow to take Trump seriously, particularly early on in the Republican primaries.</p> <p>Baron vigorously defends his corner. \u201cAt the Post, we took the candidacy seriously from the very beginning,\u201d he insists, going on to cite reporting, among other things, on Trump Mortgage, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/trump-university-claim-revisited-by-new-york-appeals-court\">Trump University</a>, and his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/06/donald-trumps-greed-helped-ruin-atlantic-city-is-the-rest-of-the-country-next/?utm_term=.4d2a700971f6\">\u201cmultiple bankruptcies in Atlantic City\u201d</a>. </p> <p>\u201cOther people reacted in a different way. Certainly there was a tremendous amount of cable coverage of his rallies,\u201d he says. \u201cWall-to-wall, they would cover his rallies from beginning to end, on live television. I don\u2019t happen to think that was a wise decision on their part.\u201d</p> <p>Baron does concede, however, that Trump is \u201cskilful\u201d at using the media. \u201c[During the primaries] he would call into shows, which would normally require a candidate to show up in person, they would just take his phone call and he\u2019d be on the air, and then he\u2019d call the next show. He\u2019s been by far the most accessible presidential candidate ever.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, even when the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/13/donald-trump-just-banned-the-washington-post-from-covering-him-that-should-bother-everyone/\">barred</a> the Post\u2019s reporters from his events (for, they claimed, inaccurate reporting), he still made himself available to Baron\u2019s team. \u201cWe had actual published interviews with him, [even] while we were on the blacklist,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Born in 1954 and raised in Tampa, Florida, Baron, who\u2019s a fluent Spanish speaker, cut his teeth at the Miami Herald, which he first joined in 1976. He went on to work at some of America\u2019s most prestigious titles \u2013 the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the Boston Globe. As Globe editor, the paper won six Pulitzer prizes, including in 2003 for the Spotlight team\u2019s investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic priests, which was turned into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/28/spotlight-review-catholic-church-called-to-account-over-child-abuse\">Oscar-winning movie Spotlight</a> last year.

Beyond financial capital, the Amazon CEO has provided the Post with \u201cintellectual capital, too\u201d, Baron explains. \u201cHe\u2019s basically forced us to confront how the internet is different and how we have to adapt to it and embrace it. He\u2019s also given us what he calls \u2018runway\u2019, which is time to experiment. So, in funding the experiments, we have time to let them play out, without having to adhere to some strict timeline or strict requirements for profit.\u201d</p> <p>One area Bezos was especially keen that Baron address was the issue of aggregation. \u201cOne of the first questions he asked was: \u2018You do these long narratives, these deep investigations, but after you\u2019re published, within 15 minutes, half a dozen websites have decided to aggregate you \u2013 and they get more traffic than you do. How do you propose to deal with that?\u2019\u201d Baron\u2019s solution was, in effect, to fight fire with fire; hiring in-house bloggers, not only did the Post start aggregating itself, but it began aggregating other people\u2019s content too.</p> <p>Since acquiring the Post, Bezos \u2013 who\u2019s added 140 employees in three years \u2013 has held regular conference calls with senior staff. So how interested is he in the editorial side of the paper? The question isn\u2019t even complete before Baron jumps in: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t inject himself at all into our journalism. He doesn\u2019t suggest stories for us to do. He doesn\u2019t critique us in any way. Every once in a while, when he sees a story which delights him, he tells us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/04/washington-post-amazon-jeff-bezos\">The Washington Post embarks on Amazon adventure with Jeff Bezos | Dan Gillmor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c[The conference calls] are all about tactics and strategy. We talked about aggregation, way back when. We\u2019ve talked about our audience engagement team. But in terms of particular stories, particular projects, or particular avenues of coverage, he does not get involved at all.\u201d</p> <p>When asked what he thinks the Post\u2019s output and business model will look like in five years time, Baron concedes that he simply doesn\u2019t know. \u201cI always say the people who are most certain about what the model will be are the furthest removed from any responsibility for actually making that model occur,\u201d he says a touch world-wearily.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s happened so fast, and the pace of change has really accelerated. Today we\u2019re sitting here talking about what we are doing for Facebook Live. Or what we\u2019re doing for Snapchat. We\u2019re talking about using bots for Amazon Echo, which we did to provide scores during the Olympics. And during this election we\u2019ll be [using bots] to provide election results. [These aren\u2019t] things we talked about a year ago \u2013 maybe we should have, but we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his ink-stained background, Baron believes that if institutions such as the Post are to survive, they have to think and behave like technology companies: they need to move fast, take risks, and accept that failure is an essential part of experimentation. \u201cI think people [at the Post] do feel free to propose new ideas and try new things,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no penalty for failing. If it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d But, he adds quickly, newspapers must always stick to their principles and values. \u201cWe can never violate that. If we do, then we destroy our entire argument for existence.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>CV</strong></h2> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 62</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Lehigh University, Pennsylvania.

  "<p>A red baseball cap provides Azmani Ridoin with only minor relief against the dazzling autumn sun as he squints across an artificial football pitch to scrutinise every move being made by his players.</p> <p>Like any self-respecting coach, he has little time for slackers as he furiously blows his whistle at the guilty while throaty barks of \u201c<em>voil\u00e0</em>\u201d are hurled at those whose efforts deserve recognition. Once the routine drills of sprinting, skipping and ball control are over, the 24 youngsters break into two groups for an intense practice match that is intermittently stopped as Ridoin remonstrates with his charges, who are struggling to adapt to a new tactical formation.</p> <p>It is a tough, no-nonsense approach that some may consider harsh given the tender years of those on the pitch, but it is paying dividends. The under-12s of Acad\u00e9mie Jeunesse Molenbeek are reigning champions and currently top of their league \u2013 and last season they lifted the trophy in a 24-team tournament in Spain in which children from Real Madrid, Barcelona and other leading European sides also competed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/oct/24/football-boxing-extremism-young-people-excluded-radicalise-brussels\">Sport and extremism: 'If young people are excluded, they're easier to radicalise'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ridoin calls an end to proceedings and his players trudge off the pitch in sweat-drenched shirts to be met by more straight talking and what have become his trademark words: \u201cDiscipline on the pitch means discipline off it,\u201d he warns. \u201cFocus on your studies and keep good company.

Some of the bombers who took part in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/22/brussels-airport-explosions-live-updates\">attacks on Brussels airport and a metro station in March</a>, killing 32 people, were found to have links to the area. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/france-train-attack-investigators-focus-on-extremist-motive\">Ayoub el-Khazzani</a>, a Moroccan national suspected of opening fire on a train between Brussels and Paris last August, was also from Molenbeek, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/01/french-suspect-brussels-jewish-museum-attack-syria\">Mehdi Nemmouche</a>, who is accused of killing four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in 2014, once lived in the area.</p> <p>Figures later published showed that of the 543 Belgians who had gone to fight in Syria \u2013 the highest per head in Europe \u2013 47 came from Molenbeek\u2019s 100,000-strong population.</p> <p>Within days of the Paris attacks, the compact Brussels district was flooded by police, soldiers and an army of journalists from around the world. The various undesirable sobriquets they gave the area have stuck: \u201cThe Islamic state of Molenbeek\u201d; \u201cEurope\u2019s jihadi capital\u201d and \u201cEurope\u2019s jihadi heaven,\u201d to name but a few.</p> <p>In the 12 months since the Paris attacks, on 13 November 2015, the people of Molenbeek have been trying to rebuild its battered reputation and also get to grips with the underlying problems they say pushed some of its young men towards violent Islamic fundamentalism. And football has become key to this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59752a7c464275da3c214049fb2bbb4930bfa3c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59752a7c464275da3c214049fb2bbb4930bfa3c4/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Despite its reputation, Molenbeek is beginning to show signs of gentrification.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite its reputation, Molenbeek is beginning to show signs of gentrification.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Acad\u00e9mie Jeunesse Molenbeek was founded in 2004 by Omar Tizguine \u2013 who is also the club secretary \u2013 and a group of friends who felt they were being discriminated against by other Brussels teams on account of their Moroccan backgrounds.</p> <p>Over the past year its numbers have more than doubled to above 500 as players flood to join its ranks, driven by parents, imams and the wider community who maintain that delinquency, poor education and social alienation allowed the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/23/brussels-attacks-suspects-belgian-media\">Salah Abdeslam and his brother Ibrahim</a>, who blew himself up in Paris last November, to be exploited by Islamic State recruiters.</p> <p>Around 41% of the residents of Molenbeek \u2013 which is a short walk from Brussels city centre \u2013 are Muslim (compared with 6% for Belgium as a whole), the bulk of Moroccan descent. The area suffers from 30% unemployment, compared with the national average of 8.5%, while youth unemployment is even higher, at 40%.</p> <p>Despite high levels of deprivation and petty crime, those entering a district dubbed by many as a \u201chostile Muslim enclave\u201d will be in for disappointment if they are expecting an aggressive reception from fundamentalist hotheads.</p> <p>Molenbeek\u2019s sedate, well-swept streets are lined with cafes serving visitors mint tea, Moroccan delicacies and a warm smile. Any heated conversation, if they want one, is mostly likely to centre on football. Chic eateries and even a boutique hotel have sprung up among its apartment blocks, halal butchers and greengrocers, suggesting a modicum of gentrification.</p> <p>Over a traditional Moroccan breakfast of sweet milky coffee and pitta filled with cheese and honey, Tizguine\u2019s face contorts with anger as he recounts what he and other locals refer to as the \u201ccollective punishment\u201d meted out to them. \u201cAll of us have been portrayed as terrorist monsters and stigmatised by politicians and the media,\u201d he railed. \u201cI fully accept that we have problems but there is good and bad in every community.</p> <p>\u201cFor one whole month after the Paris attack I was asked every day by journalists if I had gone to Syria, ever thought about going there or knew anybody who had gone there. People think we are all members of the Islamic State. But I let football do my talking and we are using it to make our community a better place to live.\u201d</p> <p>Utilising the beautiful game to overcome the Molenbeek \u201cmonster\u201d stereotype has become central to the club\u2019s ethos. All players are instructed to shake hands with opponents before and after games, arguing with match officials is prohibited and visiting teams are often treated to food and drinks. The result is that all 10 teams of the Acad\u00e9mie Jeunesse Molenbeek, from the seven-year-olds to the over-18s, have the best disciplinary record in their respective leagues, while last season it was voted the friendliest club.</p> <p>Virtually all its players are Muslim and live locally. As part of the club\u2019s drive to tackle the more endemic problems they face, each has to show his school report and attendance record at least once every three months to prove he is keeping up with his studies, while coaches regularly meet with parents to discuss their social development and address any behavioural concerns.</p> <p>Tizguine said: \u201cOur priority is not football but discipline and keeping children off the street. Many boys in Molenbeek are poorly educated and unemployed: they get into bad company and this makes them vulnerable. We make it clear that if you do not focus on school and don\u2019t behave in all areas of your life, you cannot be part of this club.\u201d</p> <p>Mohamed Tabakkalt, the club\u2019s sporting director, added: \u201cSince the Paris attacks, parents are scared for their sons and they want to get them involved in something positive. We are struggling to keep up with the demand because so many boys want to join us.\u201d</p> <p>Molenbeek\u2019s \u201cterrorist\u201d tag, however, has weighed heavily at times over the past year. Attempts to recruit white footballers from outside the area in order to create more integrated teams have failed, while existing white players have left because of fears that it\u2019s a dangerous place to visit. Earlier this year, all 26 teams scheduled to take part in an annual girls\u2019 tournament cancelled for the same reason, while the boys\u2019 teams did not organise one at all. Players from Acad\u00e9mie Jeunesse Molenbeek have also been verbally abused on the pitch, called \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201cgangsters\u201d.</p> <p>The club has also had to have some difficult conversations with its players over the past year, most of them nothing to do with football. Meetings have been held to address concerns raised by inquisitive youngsters seeking explanations about Molenbeek\u2019s links with Paris, Brussels and other attacks and the impact it has had on their lives. The likes of Salah Abdesalam, who is awaiting trial in Paris, are held up as anti-role models.</p> <p>The club\u2019s work is supported by Fran\u00e7oise Schepmans, the mayor of Molenbeek, who has launched a wide-ranging plan centred on education and sport to try to combat some of the problems young people in the area face.</p> <p>Like many of her constituents, she also believes that delinquency and poor education within Molenbeek, rather than an ingrained, widespread sympathy for violent Islamic extremism, explain the radicalisation of Abdesalem and his cohorts.</p> <p>This was borne out recently by the findings of a comprehensive two-month survey of Molenbeek residents from all religious backgrounds by the <a href=\"http://www.eip.org/\">European Institute of Peace.</a> The majority felt a lack of opportunities, social isolation and poor education were the main reasons for violent Islamic extremism. The top three issues they listed as affecting them were unemployment, poor education and antisocial behaviour, with the majority calling for a stronger police presence to make their community safer. Around 90% said they did not trust politicians and journalists because of the way they had portrayed their home district.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/16/radicalisation-molenbeek-terrorist-brussels-belgian\">Radicalisation in Molenbeek: 'People call me the mother of a terrorist'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schepmans said: \u201cIf you look at somebody like Abdesalam, he was part of a group of petty criminals and we had no way of knowing that these delinquents would become such violent radicals.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a lot of young people in Molenbeek who are poorly educated, which affects their job prospects and pushes them into delinquent behaviour. They are on the streets, commit petty crimes and can be easily led. Education is the priority for us, but sport has an important role to play because it can motivate them in other areas of their lives, helps tackle delinquency and brings prestige to an individual and an area.\u201d</p> <p>An extra 50 police officers have been drafted into Molenbeek to deal with petty crime, leading to a threefold increase for the first half of this year in arrests for minor offences. New facilities and programmes for football and other sports are also being rolled out over the coming months, with funding from the <a href=\"http://www.cruyff-foundation.org/en/\">Cruyff Foundation</a>, which was founded by former Netherlands captain Johan Cruyff to help youngsters in deprived areas.</p> <p>For the Acad\u00e9mie Jeunesse Molenbeek, the prospect of financial assistance could not be better timed. It costs \u00a3130,000 a year to run the club but it only receives \u00a330,000 in grants from the local authority. The remainder is supposed to be made up of annual player subscriptions of \u00a3300, but only half its players can afford to pay the full amount.</p> <p>Officials often have to dig into their own pockets to keep the club afloat and ensure that it continues to grow. As they battle to get Molenbeek back on its feet and restore its reputation in the eyes of the world, they have vowed not to turn any boy away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8db35be5299f6b731dd43aaa1812be3750dcde9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8db35be5299f6b731dd43aaa1812be3750dcde9/0_119_1497_898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salah Abdeslam, captured on CCTV in Molenbeek market a year before the Paris attacks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salah Abdeslam, captured on CCTV in Molenbeek market a year before the Paris attacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 4 November to amend an incorrect caption.</em><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In the space of a short \u2013 sometimes elliptical \u2013 interview on BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Greg Clark, the business secretary, revealed more than any other UK minister not just about about the content of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland\">successful talks the UK government has held with Nissan</a> but also the wider negotiations strategy towards Europe. For what Nissan sought and received by way of government assurances will surely apply more widely.</p> <p>Speaking to Marr, Clark made it clear that the UK objective is not just to avoid tariff and non-tariff barriers with the EU, but probably also to adopt a sector-by-sector negotiating approach.</p> <p>He also confirmed that UK ministers also cannot by law provide direct compensation to industries that may be subject to tariffs, but they will endeavour to ensure the industry remains competitive. </p> <p>The \u201cdemeanour of the UK government\u201d in the talks with Brussels, as Clark described it, will be to reach a deal on access to the EU market, due to the extent to which UK industry supply chains are integrated with Europe. The aim will be to avoid a breakdown in these talks, or a hard Brexit. No decision has yet been crystallised about whether the UK believes it can afford to leave the EU customs union.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/30/uk-seeks-brexit-deal-with-no-trade-tariffs-for-car-companies-nissan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a2vk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2855513\"            data-video-name=\"UK seeks Brexit deal with \u2018no trade tariffs\u2019 for car companies \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5815efc6e4b0219a00d3a47f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/30/161030MarrClark_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846490&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846490&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/30/uk-seeks-brexit-deal-with-no-trade-tariffs-for-car-companies-nissan-video\">UK seeks Brexit deal with \u2018no trade tariffs\u2019 for car companies \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The overall tone is closer to the one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\">Theresa May expressed in her private speech to bankers revealed by the Guardian last week</a> than the one the prime minister set out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">her speech to the Conservative conference</a> at the beginning of the month.</p> <p>It is striking how forthcoming Clark chose to be.

Clark repeatedly referred to industry sectors and their different needs, implying the UK would seek to negotiate sector-by-sector deals for UK industry with the EU.</p> <p>The single most important commitment does not take the form of taxpayers\u2019 cash but what Clark described as a demeanour to the negotiations with the EU.</p> <p>He said the objective of the negotiations would be to prevent tariff barriers being erected and for the minimum of bureaucratic hurdles to be established, by which he meant a minimum number of non-tariff barriers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63985a5780dae7f359d504d9b4d20a0f09ec68a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63985a5780dae7f359d504d9b4d20a0f09ec68a8/0_100_2400_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nissan plant in Sunderland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Clark confirmed that under World Trade Organisation rules Nissan could not be compensated by the UK government if it faced tariff barriers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Heppell/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Describing his talks with Nissan executives, Clark told Marr: \u201cWhat I said was that our objective would be to ensure that we would have continued access to the markets in Europe \u2013 and vice-versa \u2013 without tariffs and without bureaucratic impediments and that is how we will approach those negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cFor the continental European car manufacturers, they export a lot to us, we export a lot to them, components go backwards and forwards.

In recent weeks, polls have given the Democrat hope, in part because Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton in Florida by around three points. But with nine days left before Election Day, Rubio is about seven points up on Trump in the state.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Less than ideal choices\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This week, both candidates spoke to the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that these are less than ideal choices before us,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cand that\u2019s why we need a senator willing to stand up to the next president no matter who it is \u2013 even if it\u2019s from your own party.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio was speaking on the day the FBI director, James Comey, said the agency was reviewing emails that might be pertinent to the closed investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state. </p> <p>\u201cThe question now is will Patrick Murphy still 100% trust Hillary Clinton, as he has said in the past,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murphy, who spoke earlier in the week after appearing with Clinton at a rally in Coconut Creek, said there was no comparison between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful that Senator Rubio\u2019s connecting me to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou look at what she\u2019s been fighting for her entire life, and you contrast that to Donald Trump. You talk about a contrast of both qualifications and temperament for who our next world leader is going to be.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Trump\u2019s litany of inflammatory comments \u2013 against immigrants, Muslims, women, the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero, prisoners of war and more \u2013 Murphy said it was \u201cappalling to a lot of Floridians that Marco Rubio continues to stand by Donald Trump\u2019s side\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people had the courage to stand up to Donald Trump,\u201d he added, noting the flurry of Republicans who withdrew their support earlier this month after a video was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">unearthed from 2005</a> in which the former reality TV star bragged about groping and kissing women without consent.</p> <p>Rubio, despite condemning Trump\u2019s comments, was not among them.

In the primary, Rubio doubted whether Trump would nominate a conservative. He told the Guardian a list of potential appointees released by Trump was \u201cencouraging\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see who wins the election and whether he\u2019ll actually do that,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be held to the same standard, whether it\u2019s a Republican president or a Democrat president \u2026 I\u2019m looking for people that will apply the constitution according to the original intent of the words of the constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio also expressed confidence that he would be judged on his own record. Saying his opponent lacked any legislative accomplishments despite having served in Congress for four years, Rubio touted his own work on issues such as human trafficking, sanctions against Venezuela and Hezbollah, and veterans affairs.</p> <p>Asked if he would be willing to work with Clinton, he stopped short of naming potential areas of agreement. \u201cI have a record of working with people across the aisle, and I\u2019ll work with anyone if they\u2019re pursuing ideas that I think are good for America,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murphy, whose time in Congress has been been spent in the minority, denied he had little to show. He listed funding for the Everglades, preventing cuts to a key component of Medicare, and securing lower flood insurance rates, and stated his commitment to issues such as climate change, equal pay and raising the minimum wage.</p> <p>He has nonetheless struggled with a lack of name recognition, compounded by limited resources after national Democratic groups withdrew millions of dollars in reserved ad spending. </p> <p>The decision has drawn criticism from some observers, for its apparent abandonment of a race many believe is winnable. Others complain of a missed opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to Rubio, whom many believe will make another run for the presidency, potentially challenging Clinton in 2020. </p> <p>But some involved in Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake the Senate defended their move, citing Florida\u2019s expensive media markets in comparison to battlegrounds such as Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina, where money can prove more influential. </p> <p>\u201cI do think the threat of him running for president in 2020 is real,\u201d a Senate Democratic strategist said of Rubio. \u201cBut our goal is to take back the Senate and win the White House right now.

On Thursday, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/senate-update-rubio-is-keeping-the-republicans-hopes-alive-in-the-senate\">FiveThirtyEight</a> gave Rubio an 81% chance of defeating Murphy, finding the sitting senator ahead in 48 of 50 public polls. On Sunday, two new polls showed Rubio up by eight and nine points.</p> <p>Pressure to reinvest in the race did pay some dividends last week, when a Super Pac affiliated with Senate minority leader Harry Reid confirmed it was transferring a seven-figure sum to a pro-Murphy super pac in Florida. Nonetheless, Murphy has largely had to rely on earned media coverage and high-profile surrogates.</p> <p>Among the most vocal has been Barack Obama, who called Rubio\u2019s support for Trump \u201cthe height of cynicism\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHow can you call him a \u2018con artist\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019 and object to all the controversial things he says and then say, \u2018But I\u2019m still gonna vote for him?\u2019 C\u2019mon, man!\u201d Obama said at a campaign stop in Miami Gardens.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sign of somebody who will say anything, do anything, pretend to be anybody, just to get elected.

For one thing, Rubio has a solid base of support among Hispanic voters, many of whom identify with the Spanish-speaking son of Cuban immigrants and in 2012 accounted for 17% of Florida\u2019s electorate. </p> <p>Murphy ramped up his outreach to the Hispanic community \u2013 somewhat belatedly, some say. In doing so, he sought to revive Rubio\u2019s involvement in a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, noting that the senator backed away from the issue when faced with backlash from conservatives.</p> <p>It has been an uphill battle. In Miami\u2019s Little Havana recently, at one of Clinton\u2019s 81 Florida field offices, volunteers labored to get out the vote. Dozens of voters, mostly Latino, entered and left the building.</p> <p>Among them were Azalia and Lucia Rodriguez. Originally from Nicaragua, they were motivated in part by resentment of Trump and said they would vote for Clinton. They did not support Rubio, they said. But they also did not plan to vote for Murphy. </p> <p>Their reason? They hadn\u2019t heard of him.</p>",
  "<p>If you grew up in the US, you\u2019re probably familiar with the Ouija board. Whether you\u2019ve seen it used in movies like The Exorcist or huddled around it with some friends at a seance, the mysterious talking board has long captivated us with its promise to connect the living and the dead.</p> <p>And though the board is a fixture in American pop culture, very little is known about where it came from. According to the historian Robert Murch, the history of the Ouija is as mysterious as the workings of the board itself. Murch has spent years tracing the history of America\u2019s favorite seance tool and we asked him to tell us a little bit about what he\u2019s learned so far. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/23/ouija-origin-of-evil-review\">Ouija: Origin of Evil review \u2013 dark side of suburbia</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>After the civil war, spiritualism exploded in America</h2> <p>The mass deaths in the civil war created a widespread desire to contact the dead, and mediums began marketing their services in major cities around the country. \u201cEveryone lost a father, a son, an uncle, a grandfather, a cousin,\u201d Murch said. \u201cDeath touched everybody in a way that had never happened in the US.\u201d According to Murch, many families had to grapple with the bodies of their loved ones never being recovered and spiritual devices like the Ouija board answered questions that no one else could. \u201cThey gave people peace of mind because they couldn\u2019t get answers any other way.\u201d</p> <h2>The name Ouija comes from a rooming house in Baltimore</h2> <p>Like Band-Aid or Kleenex, the trademarked name Ouija is now generally used for all talking boards. But the name was coined by Helen Peters, a medium who was using the board with her brother-in-law Elijah Bond one night 1890 in Baltimore. When she asked what they should call it, the planchette spelled out \u201cOuija\u201d, which the board told her meant \u201cgood luck\u201d.</p> <p>The building where Peters named the board is now a 7-11 convenience store, which has a plaque commemorating the event on the wall. </p> <p>Peters got the first patent on the Ouija board but the business was soon taken over by the American entrepreneur William Fuld, who began to market the board, especially in national catalogues like Sears. </p> <p>\u201cOuija \u2013 The Magic Game. Remarkable, interesting, and mystifying game. Great mirth and making game for parties. Apparently answers questions concerning past, present, and future,\u201d reads one ad in the Sears catalogue.</p> <p>\u201cWe would not be talking about the Ouija Board today had it not been for the brilliant marketing of William Fuld. He just knew how to change the story, retell it,\u201d Murch said. </p> <h2>Helen Peters, \u2018the mystery lost to history\u2019</h2> <p>As the board\u2019s popularity, and profit, increased, most of the early investors sought to highlight their role in the creation of the Ouija board. But Helen Peters wanted nothing more to do with it after the board caused serious damage to her family. </p> <p>When some civil war family heirlooms went missing from Peters\u2019 home, Peters asked the Ouija board who had taken them. According to Peters\u2019 grandson, the board indicated a member of the family. \u201cHalf the family believed it and half the family said \u2018bullshit\u2019, including Helen,\u201d said Murch. The event created a conflict that was never resolved, and tore the family apart.</p> <p>After the fight, Peters sold all of her stock in the company. \u201cUntil her dying day, she\u2019s telling everyone: don\u2019t play the Ouija board because it lies,\u201d Murch said.</p> <h2>The mysterious death of William Fuld</h2> <p>William Fuld had his own Ouija-related family troubles. In 1919, he cut his brother out of the business and the two never spoke again. That year was a particularly good one for sales following a world war and a flu epidemic. In a 1920 article, the New York Times compared the popularity of the Ouija board to that of bubble gum, and in 1927 the Baltimore Sun reported that Fuld had personally made $1m from sales of the board.</p> <p>He continued to open new factories, building the largest \u2013 a 3-story building in Baltimore \u2013 after the Ouija board itself told him to \u201cprepare for big business\u201d.</p> <p>In early 1927, he went up to the roof of the building to supervise the replacement of a flag pole. According to the Baltimore Sun, \u201che was standing near the edge of the roof, grasping an iron support of the pole to study himself, the workmen said, when the support suddenly pulled away and he toppled over backward.\u201d</p> <p>As in a movie, Fuld initially grabbed hold of the sill of an open window, which suddenly closed, sending him crashing down to the sidewalk below. He broke several ribs, but was expected to survive, until a bump in the road on the way to the hospital sent one of the fractured bones through his heart and he died. </p> <p>His family continued to run the business until 1966, when they sold it to Parker Brothers, which was later bought by Hasbro, whose website warns: \u201cHandle the Ouija board with respect and it won\u2019t disappoint you!\u201d </p>",
  "<p>In recent weeks, the Hollywood film about Edward Snowden and the movement to <a href=\"https://pardonsnowden.org/\">pardon </a>the NSA whistleblower have renewed worldwide attention on the scope and substance of government surveillance programs. In the United States, however, the debate has often been a narrow one, focused on the rights of Americans under domestic law but mostly blind to the privacy rights of millions of others affected by this surveillance. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/22/government-privacy-fbi-justice-department-surveillance\">As quietly as possible, the government is renewing its assault on your privacy | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, just last week, a British court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/uk-security-agencies-unlawfully-collected-data-for-decade\">held</a> that British intelligence agencies acted unlawfully by concealing bulk spying programs from the public for over a decade. Soon, in a lawsuit brought by Privacy International, the ACLU and eight other organizations, the influential European court of human rights will also weigh in on surveillance programs revealed by Snowden, and the result could have implications far beyond Europe.</p> <p>Although the debate in the US has led to some piecemeal reforms \u2013 including the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/nsa-unplugged-government-finally-stopped-vacuuming-our-phone-records\">USA Freedom Act</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/17/presidential-policy-directive-signals-intelligence-activities\">modest policy changes</a> \u2013 many of the most intrusive government surveillance programs remain largely intact. These include programs conducted not just by the NSA, but also by its close partner in the United Kingdom, called the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), with whom the NSA swaps vast sets of private data. </p> <p>This bulk surveillance violates rights to privacy and freedom of expression \u2013 rights that are guaranteed not only under US domestic law, but also under international human rights law. That latter legal framework speaks a universal language, enumerating fundamental rights that every person enjoys by virtue of our common humanity.</p> <p>Following the Snowden revelations, we brought suit in British court, challenging surveillance programs that violate these fundamental rights. The case has now made its way to the <a href=\"http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home\">European court of human rights</a>, where we recently filed our principal <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3115985-APPLICANTS-REPLY-to-GOVT-OBSERVATIONS-PDF.html\">submission</a>. The court plays a critical role in the international human rights system by enforcing the European Convention on Human Rights, a treaty ratified by 47 nations. Its judgments are legally binding and its rulings help shape the interpretation of human rights law throughout the world.</p> <p>The lawsuit challenges the British government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\">mass surveillance</a> of internet traffic transiting undersea fiber-optic cables, as well as the UK\u2019s access to information gathered through the NSA\u2019s breathtaking array of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/07/01/nsas-google-worlds-private-communications/\">bulk spying</a> programs. These have included, for example, the NSA\u2019s recording of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/\">every single cellphone call</a> into, out of, and within at least two countries; its collection of hundreds of millions of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html\">contact lists and address books</a> from personal email and instant-messaging accounts; and its surreptitious interception of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html\">data from Google and Yahoo user accounts</a> as that information travels between those companies\u2019 data centers located abroad. The suit also seeks to shed light on the secret information-sharing agreements governing GCHQ\u2019s access to these massive hoards of NSA-collected data \u2013 and vice versa. </p> <p>While this lawsuit has clear implications for the rights of non-Americans, it matters for Americans as well. It is one of the first direct challenges to mass surveillance within the international human rights framework. The judgments of the European court of human rights influence the interpretation of other international human rights instruments, such as the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/faq-covenant-civil-political-rights-iccpr\">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, which the US ratified in 1992. A determination by the court that GCHQ\u2019s mass surveillance is unlawful would call comparable NSA surveillance programs into question by sending a powerful message that they are fundamentally incompatible with human rights.</p> <p>The international human rights law framework makes clear that government surveillance must be prescribed by law, targeted and proportionate. These requirements are designed to balance a government\u2019s need to address security threats and its obligation to protect fundamental rights. Bulk spying programs plainly fail that test. </p> <p>By their very nature, bulk spying programs are neither targeted nor proportionate. They invade the privacy of broad swaths of people without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. Surveillance should be directed at obtaining specific intelligence in individual operations, not indiscriminately subjecting all of our private information to government scrutiny. </p> <p>Moreover, in both the UK and US, the legal basis for and full scope of government surveillance powers remain opaque. Critical safeguards \u2013 such as independent judicial review of spying programs \u2013 are hobbled or, in many instances, non-existent. </p> <p>The intelligence-sharing arrangements challenged in this case underscore a critically important fact as well: we are all foreigners to someone. The British government\u2019s mass surveillance programs surely intercept the communications and data of Americans. If Americans are concerned about other countries intercepting their information in bulk and sharing that information \u2013 including with the US government \u2013 then they should care about ensuring there is an international legal framework that constrains these activities. </p> <p>Just as human rights law requires that surveillance be prescribed by law, targeted, and proportionate, government information-sharing should adhere to the same standard. Outsourcing surveillance hardly lessens the intrusion. Therefore, whether the UK or US intercepts the information itself or obtains the same flow of data from another intelligence agency, the same protections should apply. </p> <p>As the debate over mass surveillance continues, it is vital that we consider the ways in which this spying violates the fundamental rights of millions of individuals throughout the world. Should the European court of human rights rule against mass surveillance, its decision will have far-reaching implications for the rights of Americans and non-Americans alike. </p>",

Because there is no area, civilian or military, that the group will not lace with explosives, many Iraqis fear that returning to their homes and former lives could be deadly, even long after militants have left.</p> <p>In Sinjar city, a centre for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/27/yazidi-women-who-escaped-isis-win-sakharov-prize-human-rights-nadia-murad-lamiya-aji-ashar\">Yazidi minority</a> who have been victims of some of Isis\u2019s worst atrocities, Hassan\u2019s men cleared five tonnes of explosives from a single school, he says. His engineers\u2019 unit, 1st Support Force Command, has been working through areas to the west of Mosul city for around two years.</p> <p>They must second-guess every pile of stones or rubble, every door and window, every apparently discarded or abandoned object, on guard against their own complacency as much as the bombs themselves.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day there is a new device. Some of our men have disposed of things that others have not even seen before,\u201d he says. His men have little protective equipment. Two have been killed and 15 injured. The training school, set up by Hassan\u2019s unit with help from the French military, is an attempt to limit that toll, both by teaching recruits to recognise and defuse Isis bombs, and by giving them a sense of the capacities of the forces they will fight.</p> <p>Their war is often a shadowy battle of wits, as they try to find and defuse devices planted weeks, even months, earlier. But the engineers also provide mine-clearance for advancing troops, when they sometimes face Isis and its bomb-makers in close contact.</p> <p>At the entrance to the first room in Hassan\u2019s school, there are two of those \u201cfighters\u201d waiting in suicide vests and explosive backpacks. They provide a moment of visceral shock. In fact, they are only shop mannequins, but the bombs they wear are real, taken from injured fighters. The balaclava covering one plastic face makes it less obviously incongruous, more disturbingly realistic. Beside them hangs an Isis flag, seized in a cleared area, and a glass frame with rows of detonators and rockets improvised from gas canisters and barrels.</p> <p>Then the rows of different bombs begin: there are the cleverly camouflaged ones, intended to take out a single victim, then others designed to maim and kill more widely. Some are designed for active combat and must be detonated by a fighter close by, such as the trio of radio-controlled pressure cooker bombs that could be used in sequence, first to maim a group of attackers, then to take out their rescuers. \u201cThey are set up with a view to secondary explosions,\u201d Hassan explains. Others are controlled by mobile phones or wires.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They are not even animals, they are worse than animals</p> <footer> <cite>Colonel Nawzad Kamil Hassan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the majority of the bombs are created to lie in wait for their victims. The most frequently used pressure-plate IEDs (improvised explosive devices) are so common that hundreds are dumped in a pile at the entrance to the classrooms. To an untrained eye, thin and wrapped in a tangle of wires, they look like the discarded fittings for strip lighting. Others are formed from pressure cookers and ball bearings, fibreboard and bedsprings, jugs of explosives and trip wires. The threat is in open spaces as well as in buildings and on roads.</p> <p>Wires, painted green and arranged through grass, would have detonated at a single touch. The mortars, smeared with mud and pebbled with fake stones, had been placed on a dusty, windy plain where nature would conspire to hide them further. A few of the devices target the engineers themselves, who are a particular enemy for Isis because of their work to spearhead ground operations and undo its deadly traps in liberated areas.</p> <p>Hassan points to a small, easily detectable mine that is actually a booby trap for a well-buried pressure-plate IED. \u201cSo when he goes in to defuse this, he will step on the other and it will explode,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>The collection grows with almost every mission, and Hassan fears it will not stop expanding until Isis is deprived of the space and resources to think up new ways of delivering death.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not even animals,\u201d he says, picking up the deactivated teddy bear in disgust. \u201cThey are worse than animals.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The University of Wisconsin\u2019s flagship campus is reeling from news that a student was charged with crimes against five women, including sexual assault and false imprisonment, during his two years at the school.</p> <p>The 20-year-old student, Alec Cook, has been arrested and appeared in court on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/university-of-wisconsin-sexual-assaults-alec-cook\">charged </a>with 15 crimes against five women, including sexual assault, strangulation and false imprisonment. His <a href=\"http://www.kare11.com/news/crime/more-sex-assault-charges-against-edina-man/343265253\">modus operandi</a>, according to police and prosecutors, was to befriend fellow students and eventually entrap and <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2016/10/27/200000-bail-set-uw-student/92800574/\">viciously attack</a> them, while keeping notebooks detailing his alleged targets.</p> <p>Cook was arrested almost two weeks ago, after one woman went to the authorities. Since then, four others came forward to say they had been sexually assaulted. Then, Madison police <a href=\"http://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=18392\">said</a>, \u201cdozens of females [came] forward wanting to speak about unknown acts related to Cook\u201d.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/university-of-wisconsin-sexual-assaults-alec-cook\">University of Wisconsin student charged in sexual assaults of four women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis story is horrifying. It\u2019s certainly spurred conversation on campus,\u201d Jason Klein of the student body, Associated Students of Madison, told the Guardian. \u201cMy friends and I are talking about it. I\u2019m hearing other people talk about it. Usually around Halloween, people are getting ready to enjoy the holiday, but right now this is an issue that has certainly marred our campus climate.\u201d</p> <p>The University of Wisconsin-Madison was already under federal scrutiny, for its handling of four other cases of sexual violence, as Cook\u2019s case unfolded. Those four cases are among 283 currently being investigated by the Department of Education\u2019s office of civil rights, under Title IX sex discrimination laws, across 215 US colleges, ranging from the Ivy League to small public universities. The wide-ranging inquiry began as a debate about rape on campuses around the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/26/campus-sexual-assault-training-red-zone\">intensified</a> in recent years.</p> <p>Some of the cases have been pending since 2013, and Cornell University currently has the most, with five. Columbia, Stanford, Kansas State, Saint Mary\u2019s College of Maryland and UW-Madison each have four, according to the department.</p> <p>The investigations have taken so long because of the sheer amount of work and a lack of resources, a spokesman for the office of civil rights said. \u201cWe are really overloaded right now,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe have about 4,000 discrimination cases under way, including race, disability, age and sex discrimination. There\u2019s a lot of work that goes into these.\u201d</p> <p>The office declined to discuss details of individual cases. UW-Madison has said it suspended Cook following his arrest. \u201cConsidering the circumstances, that seems like a reasonable decision,\u201d Klein said.</p> <p>Cook said nothing in county court on Thursday, but his lawyers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/university-of-wisconsin-sexual-assaults-alec-cook\">deny</a> he committed any crimes, which allegedly date back to March 2015. His attorneys insist the sex was consensual. <br></p> <p>Madison police have said it was only after a student first contacted them that others came forward. The first woman alleges that four days before she spoke with police, Cook turned violent toward her and held her captive for several hours at his apartment off campus.</p> <p>\u201cWithout the first victim I\u2019m not sure we would have known about the others,\u201d said Joel DeSpain, a spokesman for Madison police department. After Cook\u2019s arrest, local news <a href=\"http://www.wkow.com/story/33498864/2016/10/Thursday/uw-sex-assault-suspect-questioned-months-ago-no-arrest\">reported</a> that the student had been questioned by campus police in February in relation to his allegedly stalking a woman. According to that report, the campus police, which operate separately from city officers, said that a student told them of a man at the college library staring at her \u201cfor a period of months\u201d.<br></p> <p>She said she asked him to leave her alone, but he followed her out of the library. \u201cShe contacted our department and said she felt unsafe,\u201d UW police spokesman Mark Lovicott said.<br></p> <p>Officers identified the man as Alec Cook. The police told him his actions were inappropriate and he was ordered to have no further contact with the woman. There was no arrest.</p> <p>Lovicott said the woman did the right thing and if Cook had not stopped his behavior, \u201cwe would have investigated further\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything threatening,\u201d Lovicott said, adding that Cook had no criminal record and because his behavior at the time did not technically constitute stalking.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when he upped his game a bit,\u201d said Erin Thornley-Parisi, executive director of Dane County Rape Crisis Center in Madison.</p> <p>\u201cI would not be surprised if it\u2019s found out later through psychological testing that he was thinking, essentially, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m getting away with this, let\u2019s see what else I can do,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>Thornley-Parisi said she applauded UW-Madison for suspending Cook quickly after his arrest. \u201cThat\u2019s not something every university would do.

That slog sweep from Mahmadullah looks more and more brainless with every replay \u2013 certainly the 50 wasn\u2019t worth the risk. Zafar has half a shout for a bat-pad catch but it was crucially missing the former half of that. Shakib gets off the mark with a shovel round the corner for one.</p> <p>Speaking of Zafar, here\u2019s more from Will Macpherson: \u201cYeah, I guess the great nonsense is not playing a warm-up in India, and the schedulers treating this as a warm-up. But Strauss and the coaches and the players just have to work with what they\u2019ve got. And that means a bit of rest and rotation. </p> <p>\u201cOn Rayner, I love him, but don\u2019t think Zafar\u2019s been picked ahead of him.

  "<p>A historic victory for Bangladesh, and a crushing defeat for England before they head off to even more taxing territory. As the home side celebrated joyously at the fall of the last wicket, Steven Finn, the dismissed batsman, stood there wondering why his request for a review was being ignored \u2013 there were no reviews left. This somehow epitomised a session in which England went from hopefulness to hopelessness in record time.</p> <p>Needing an unlikely 273 for victory, England had managed to race to 100 for nought at tea with Ben Duckett delivering his best yet and Alastair Cook looking on admiringly. Suddenly anything was possible. Well, yes. Sadly for travelling supporters, who numbered about the same as the number of the employees of the England and Wales Cricket Board in Mirpur, this included England subsiding to 164 all out in the space of an hour and 50 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/30/england-omnishambles-gary-ballance-alastair-cook-bangladesh\">England omnishambles signals Ballance\u2019s exit and need for Cook to rethink</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Imperceptibly the stadium filled on a steamy Sunday afternoon, a work day here, and then the decibel level soared as they all realised that Bangladesh were storming to their first Test victory over England on another bewildering day of cricket in Mirpur.</p> <p>The margin of victory was 108 runs, which may not be so surprising but the manner of it was astonishing. At tea there was still the prospect of Cook\u2019s team digging themselves out of a hole far deeper than anything experienced in Chittagong. Yet within two hours the sides were shaking hands and the England team were the one that had the appearance of callow newcomers to this wondrous form of the game.</p> <p>Before tea Duckett had suggested England might escape in alien territory. Apart from the occasional trip to Taunton, English cricketers seldom experience a spinning, uneven pitch of these proportions. No matter. Duckett reverse swept freely, defended occasionally and with Cook proceeding in his own more orthodox style Bangladesh were rattled; the pitch was having a siesta.</p> <p>But after the break England were mesmerised by a 19-year-old off-spinner, whose name would not have rung any bells among their batsmen a fortnight ago. Mehedi Hasan grabbed another five-wicket haul \u2013 his third in four innings, which meant he ended the series with 19 wickets, demonstrably the best spinner on parade. This begged an awkward question: what might the infinitely more experienced Ravi Ashwin do to England if the pitch for the first Test against India in Rajkot is similar to this?</p> <p>Once Mehedi had rampaged through the top order, Shakib Al Hasan, so innocuous before tea, mopped up the lower order with England batsmen coming and going like tube trains at rush hour. Mehedi finished with six for 77 and has been a revelation in this series. There is no mystery about him, just a high level of competence and calmness for a teenager. He bowls at a goodly pace, similar to Moeen Ali\u2019s; he spins the ball vigorously enough; the ball dips naturally in flight and he knows where it is going to land. In this series on pitches that have turned from the start that is all that has been required.</p> <p>Sometimes the ball spun for him, sometimes it skidded and it was the skidding delivery immediately after tea that defeated Duckett and started the ugly procession. Then Joe Root defended against Shakib and missed a straight ball to be lbw and paralysis set in. Indeed, it became a feature of the innings that England\u2019s batsmen were dismissed when defending rather than attacking \u2013 the only exceptions being Gary Ballance and Finn, neither of whom are in princely form at the moment. Apart from Ben Stokes, who was bowled by a jubilant and subsequently saluting Shakib, the rest were either lbw or caught around the bat by one of the increasing number of vultures hovering there. Then the celebrations, richly deserved, could commence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8990c5b1eb19a8ad0ab2bd3269c24dbf277bdaca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8990c5b1eb19a8ad0ab2bd3269c24dbf277bdaca/0_0_3616_2411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Cook shakes hands with Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Cook shakes hands with Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A M Ahad/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Somehow batting had seemed more straightforward in the morning when Bangladesh continued to play their shots. For England that session, which began with Bangladesh 128 ahead, was one of frustration and missed opportunities. Four chances, which ranged from the practically impossible (when Steven Finn leapt high at mid-on) to the unmissable (when Duckett dropped an outfield catch that he would have taken 99 times out of 100 in practice), went begging.</p> <p>It was the hottest, steamiest day of the series and just before lunch England overheated. Sabbir Rahman, not for the first time, found the tourists easy to provoke. Ben Stokes had to have a word or two too many, which would ultimately cost him 15% of his match fee. England were seldom in control of the ball or their temper.</p> <p>By lunch they had managed four wickets but they had cost 116 runs on a pitch where the ball was still spitting with ominous regularity. Cook put his faith in his spinners, Zafar Ansari and Moeen, who might have made early breakthroughs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/30/bangladesh-v-england-second-test-day-three-live\">Bangladesh beat England by 108 runs in second Test to draw series \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Imrul Kayes offered a sharp chance to Cook at leg-slip off Ansari and another, equally difficult one, to Root at slip off Moeen. All the while the runs were flowing, often from byes \u2013 though on this surface Jonny Bairstow probably deserved more sympathy than chastisement. Eventually Kayes swept at Moeen and was lbw for a fine 78 but England were wilting. When Cook turned to Adil Rashid after 90 minutes, it felt like he was turning to his last resort. The runs kept coming but at least wickets fell now, four of them to Rashid, two to Stokes, who ended the series with the staggering figures of 11 for 111 from 48.3 overs. After all this, Stokes is absolutely fundamental to England\u2019s next campaign.</p> <p>As for Rashid, his rush of wickets is just one source of confusion among many. After two stunning games in Bangladesh, England have no idea what constitutes their best XI in this part of the world.</p>",
  "<p>The dealmakers behind the proposed mega-merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner have accomplished the impossible: uniting Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in their condemnation of the deal.<br></p> <p>Trump, needless to say, has been the most vituperative. The merger would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/trump-att-time-warner-deal-clinton-kaine\">destroy democracy</a>\u201d, he said. But pretty much everyone in Washington has publicly come out against it. Sanders, Clinton\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination and now campaigning on her behalf, is already <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/10/25/sanders-we-must-do-everything-possible-to-press-clinton-on-att-time-warner/\">preparing to battle a future Clinton administration</a> to ensure that anti-trust regulators turn thumbs-down on the deal. Lining up beside him? Powerhouse senator Elizabeth Warren.</p> <p>The two companies and their bankers must feel that they have walked straight into a buzzsaw. The Senate will hold a hearing on it on 7 December, after the election. Will tempers have cooled by then? Maybe, maybe not.</p> <p>So, what on earth drove Time Warner and AT&amp;T to sprint to the altar during an election season in which populist politicians are dominating the airwaves and the debate? Insanity? Desperation? A sense that there was an opportunity that was just too good to pass up? Or simply an urge to annoy the politicians?<br></p> <p>The word to bear in mind might simply be \u201cpanic\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s no shock to anyone who keeps an eye on these worlds that companies that distribute all the content that we consume, and the companies that produce it (translation: AT&amp;T as the party of the first part, and Time Warner as the party of the second part) have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/att-time-warner-acquisition-customer-service-impact\">vested interest in forging alliances among themselves</a>. The closer and more seamless those alliances are, the faster and more creatively they can work on developing and delivering more of that content for all our devices, especially those smartphones and tablets from which we are unable to wean ourselves. </p> <p>Those that get it right have captive audiences simply because they are delivering a growing proportion of that content. It\u2019s an enticing prospect.</p> <p>Analysts have been expecting that we\u2019d see yet another wave of convergence \u2013 a buzzword in this media/telecommunications universe for the better part of two decades now, having been behind the merger that formed Time Warner itself in 1995 \u2013 for several years. </p> <p>This time, it\u2019s happening in different ways, not always via mergers. Apple and Time Warner\u2019s HBO have linked their brands already, with Apple distributing the HBO Now service. Imagine <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-rosa/apple-and-hbo-think-diffe_b_10279702.html\">what might happen</a> if Apple \u2013 with its cash mountain \u2013 decided to snap up HBO\u2019s parent company, Time Warner, and pursue the myriad potential synergies between its own platforms and Time Warner\u2019s content? </p> <p>I suspect it\u2019s safe to say that the folks at AT&amp;T did just that \u2013 and panicked. </p> <p>Or else they considered what might happen if another giant rival with the potential to build a mammoth platform and plenty of cash \u2013 like Google, which has already pushed into live-TV streaming \u2013 pre-empted them. Or they allowed companies like Amazon or Netflix to get further ahead with their own plans. </p> <p>Facing that kind of strategic risk, a little bit of political risk may not look like anything terribly threatening. Sure, the politicians may indulge in a lot of saber rattling for the benefit of voters, especially since the deal was announced in the final days of the presidential election campaign. But it will be many months before regulators will rule on it \u2013 even if a deep-pocketed rival doesn\u2019t muscle in and outbid AT&amp;T for Time Warner.</p> <p>Will the public outrage endure? The dealmakers and the board members at both companies seem to be making a calculated decision that the answer is \u201cno\u201d. </p> <p>That seems optimistic. We already <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/internet-u-s-compare-globally-hint-slower-expensive/\">pay far more</a> than citizens in most other parts of the world for basic broadband access, thanks to the fact that most communities offer very limited options to their citizens. Most telecommunications services are equally pricey, relative to those offered elsewhere, from <a href=\"https://www.billshark.com/u-s-mobile-plans-expensive/\">mobile phones</a> to cable television services. The number of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21702177-television-last-having-its-digital-revolution-moment-cutting-cord\">cord-cutters</a> continue to grow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/att-time-warner-acquisition-customer-service-impact\">What will AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner mean for customers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two companies have an idea of what they\u2019ll do to keep their own customers loyal. \u201cPremium content always wins,\u201d said Randall Stephenson, CEO and chairman of AT&amp;T, in the company\u2019s press release announcing the transaction. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the world\u2019s best premium content with the networks to deliver it to every screen. A big customer pain point is paying for content once but not being able to access it on any device, anywhere. Our goal is to solve that.\u201d</p> <p>At what price, though? Stephenson does refer to delivering \u201cvalue\u201d to customers, and certainly, you can expect to hear Time Warner and AT&amp;T insist that because their proposed match is a \u201cvertical\u201d merger rather than a \u201chorizontal\u201d one, this should pose less of an antitrust threat. In other words, consumers won\u2019t see prices soar as a result of reduced competition.</p> <p>In a horizontal transaction, two companies that compete to provide roughly the same kind of services or goods (think, Cox Communications and Comcast), merge and become one, meaning that there are fewer entities involved in setting prices for content as purchasers, or for services as providers. In a vertical transaction, such as the proposed merger, companies that are in different parts of the business (in this case, content and distribution) join forces.</p> <p>But in markets where competition is already restricted \u2013 such as, say, the internet \u2013 price increases could be a result of even vertical mergers. That\u2019s the conclusion of studies by one economist, John Kwoka of Northeastern University, who found that of the 1,000 mergers of all kinds that he evaluated over the last two decades, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/25/att-time-warner-blocked/\">at least a third generated price increases in excess of 10%</a>. A remarkable 80% of them raised prices to consumers to some degree; the average increase was about 7%. </p> <p>Ponder that, antitrust regulators.</p> <p>There are plenty of ways in which this could happen. For instance, all of the programming that Time Warner produces could suddenly become unavailable to competitors to the newly merged entity\u2019s rival distributors, except at a much higher price. You have an AT&amp;T smartphone and want to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones? Congrats \u2013 you can do so on any device you own for half the price you\u2019d pay if you have a Verizon phone and want to watch on your iPad. </p> <p>It\u2019s up to the politicians not just to be blowhards about the deal or threaten to axe it. Consumers may end up with great, efficiently delivered and fairly priced content as a result of mergers like the one that AT&amp;T and Time Warner are proposing. The trick is to ensure how that potential is realized. Will the regulators do their job?</p> <p>That\u2019s why what happens in the weeks following the election is going to be so crucial. Who will the new president choose to advise her (or him) on issues like commerce and telecommunications? Who will (s)he tap for membership on the Federal Trade Commission (which governs antitrust issues) and the Federal Communications Commission (which oversees telecommunications policy, and of which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/technology/chief-who-sharpened-fccs-teeth-faces-final-hurdles.html\">the next president must name a new chairman</a>), two of the key regulators associated with this industry?</p> <p>Regulators have the ability to lay down the law and make the deal much more consumer-friendly in any number of ways, demanding (for instance) that the new company make HBO shows available more readily via apps or streaming, meaning that we wouldn\u2019t be forced to sign up for costly packages.</p> <p>For once, all the heated political rhetoric might come in useful, if it ensures that the regulators keep their eye on the ball. I wish I was confident that the attention span of outraged politicians was as long as that of the strategic thinkers and panicky dealmakers \u2013 but I\u2019m not.</p>",

They\u2019ve included the Republican party, with its years of divisiveness and racially charged rhetoric; the media, with its collective chase of the next shiny object; and the baby boomers feeling the cultural and economic ground give way.</p> <p>But it was Schwartz who sparked this strange political creature into life. As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/19/trump-co-writer-says-candidate-could-end-civilisation-the-art-of-the-deal-tony-schwartz\">ghostwriter of Trump\u2019s bestselling 1987 book The Art of the Deal</a>, he did more than anyone to create the businessman\u2019s public persona. In it he translated Trump\u2019s coarse ramblings into charming straight talk and came up with the phrase \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d, which captures brilliantly an approach to business and politics in which everything is the greatest, the most beautiful. Schwartz helped give Trump the sweet smell of success \u2013 now seemingly irresistible to millions of people clinging to the American dream.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been horrifying,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the nearly 30 years after the book was published, the main thing I felt was, I want to be as far away from this man as I can, but I didn\u2019t feel I created Frankenstein, because he was a real estate developer and reality television star. Who cared? It wasn\u2019t that consequential to the world.\u201d</p> <p>But building on the foundation of The Art of the Deal, Trump spent a decade hosting the reality TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/mark-burnett-donald-trump-apprentice-tapes\">The Apprentice</a>, reinforcing his image as a preternatural businessman with the power to say \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d (and blurring the boundaries between reality and reality television, just as he would throughout the presidential campaign). Many supporters say they trust him to run America like a company; the business of America is business. It was no coincidence that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">launched his presidential campaign</a> at Trump Tower, a marbled cathedral of capitalism in Manhattan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He is a man who is a chameleon and doesn\u2019t have any core beliefs beyond his own aggrandisement and power</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Schwartz, 64, continues: \u201cI simply didn\u2019t think that much about it until he decided to run for president and it became clear that this wasn\u2019t going to just fade away, that he was actually in a position to win the nomination. That\u2019s when I thought, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve contributed to creating the public image of the man who is sociopathic and people don\u2019t realise it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If he were writing The Art of the Deal today, he\u2019d call it \u201cThe Sociopath\u201d<em> </em>instead, Schwartz <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\">told the <em>New Yorker</em> in July</a>, an interview that broke decades of silence on the matter. \u201cI certainly felt a kind of moral imperative to step in and say what I knew about a man I considered to be so dangerous, and I am very relieved that I did.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump he observed was vulgar and vainglorious, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/16/donald-trump-narcissist-profile\">a narcissistic liar</a> with a short attention span, no appetite for reading books and an \u201cextremely mixed\u201d business record. A Trump presidency could, he warns, lead to martial law, the end of press freedom and the risk of nuclear war: \u201cStaggeringly dangerous. Worse than I imagined when he began to run. Unthinkable. Horrifying. He\u2019s way more out of control in the last couple of months than I\u2019ve ever seen him.

A liberal journalist in Ronald Reagan\u2019s America, he wrote a scathing magazine article on Trump, only to receive a note from the entrepreneur, ever greedy for attention, saying he liked it. When Schwartz went to interview him for Playboy, Trump said he wanted to write an autobiography, even though he was only 38. Schwartz suggested instead a book called The Art of the Deal.

He struck his own deal: a joint byline, half of the $500,000 advance and half the royalties. It paid off in financial if not spiritual terms: The Art of the Deal sold more than a million copies and spent 13 weeks atop the New York Times bestseller list.</p> <p>Even at the time, Schwartz felt he was selling out, but to say he feels regret alone would be too simple. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a long, long time thinking about why I did it,\u201d he muses. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the only choice I made that I\u2019m not proud of in my life. It\u2019s a complicated question to say whether I would do it differently today and here\u2019s why: if I knew everything I know about what would happen to Trump, of course I wouldn\u2019t do it. </p> <p>\u201cBut the complexity is that the experience of writing that book was so powerful, in a negative way, that it led me to change my life dramatically and move from a focus on being successful and earning more money to really exploring what a meaningful life looks like.\u201d</p> <p>Schwartz quit journalism and set up a consulting firm, <a href=\"https://theenergyproject.com/\">The Energy Project,</a> which aims to boost employees\u2019 productivity with happier, healthier workplaces. \u201cI\u2019ve spent 30 years doing stuff I\u2019m proud of, that I\u2019m not sure I would have gotten to if I hadn\u2019t written that book. It gave me such a profound experience of the wrongness the direction of my life was taking. So it\u2019s complicated, right?</p> <p>\u201cOne does good things and bad things over the course of a life and, if you get to the age I am and feel good about the life you\u2019ve lived, it\u2019s hard to say, \u2018Gee, I wish I\u2019d done this differently or that differently.\u2019 Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have landed where I did.\u201d</p> <p>Schwartz delivered <a href=\"https://www.oxford-union.org/term_events/27\">an address to the Oxford Union</a> in the UK last Friday with the title \u201cInto the belly of the beast: how Donald Trump led me on the path to dharma [enlightenment]\u201d. He says: \u201cWhat are the consequences of the choices you make that you rationalise to yourself, but can little imagine potentially huge consequences?\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen who else will find a moment of zen after election day on 8 November. Probably not the Republicans, facing bitter infighting after Trump\u2019s hostile takeover. It will also be a time for the media to look at itself closely. Last December, the Republican candidate Jeb Bush <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/261438-jeb-trump-playing-the-media-like-a-fiddle\">told press reporters:</a> \u201cHe\u2019s playing you guys like a fiddle \u2026 by saying outrageous things and garnering attention.\u201d</p> <p>In February, Les Moonves, chairman of TV network CBS, declared: \u201cIt may not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS.\u201d By March Trump was already estimated to have earned <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html?_r=0\">$2bn of media attention.</a> There will be hard questions over the thousands of hours of airtime he has been given \u2013 and whether his bigotry should have been called out sooner, rather than normalised and mainstreamed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was a reporter for many years.

It\u2019s true for the media, for politics, for the culture of this country and for the whole issue of polarisation. Assuming it ends without Trump being elected, we have to use this as an opportunity to question a lot of assumptions that vast numbers of people had accepted and he has proved are not true.\u201d</p> <p>If Trump does lose the election, as opinion polls strongly suggest, there will tremendous relief for Schwartz. \u201cThis is an inflection point and if he\u2019s as soundly rejected as it looks like he will be, it\u2019ll be quite a contrast, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/trump-clinton-polls-brexit\">to Brexit</a>. It will suggest the forces of progress and evolution hurled away the forces of hatred and fear.\u201d</p> <p>But how would Trump, whose entire personal mythology is based on winning with swagger, react to the devastating loss? Schwartz knows it won\u2019t be pretty. \u201cYou can tell he\u2019s terrified and angry about it and bewildered by it. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly how he\u2019s going to respond.

  "<p>On 5 November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-berger\">John Berger</a> will turn 90. As I travel to Paris to meet him, I carry a bagful of books. There are recently published art historical writings, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/337806/s/portraits-john-berger-on-artists/\"><em>Portraits</em></a>, and, to coincide with his 90th birthday, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/landscapes-445290.html\"><em>Landscapes</em></a> (judiciously selected by Tom Overton for Verso), a fascinating series of encounters with the thinkers who have mattered to Berger, from Brecht and Walter Benjamin to Rosa Luxemburg. A marvellous miscellany of more recent work, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/confabulations.html\"><em>Confabulations</em></a>, has just been published by Penguin, and <a href=\"https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/a-jar-of-wild-flowers/forthcoming/\"><em>A Jar of Wild Flowers: Essays in Celebration of John Berger</em></a><em> </em>(including tributes from Ali Smith, Sally Potter and Julie Christie) is coming soon from Zed books.</p> <p>The homage continues on film in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/16/the-seasons-in-quincy-four-portraits-of-john-berger-review-tilda-swinton-berlin-2016\"><em>The Seasons in Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger</em></a>, shot during his late 80s \u2013 a collage of informal conversation and political discussion, with offerings by Tilda Swinton, the writer and producer Colin MacCabe and others. It was shot in the hamlet in Haute-Savoie, in the French Alps, where Berger lived for more than 40 years. These jostling admirers show not only that the man is greatly loved, but an intellectual indebtedness behind the wish to say thank you. Critic, novelist, poet, dramatist, artist, commentator \u2013 and, above all, storyteller \u2013 Berger was described by Susan Sontag as peerless in his ability to make \u201cattentiveness to the sensual world\u201d meet \u201cimperatives of conscience\u201d. His book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ways-of-seeing.html\"><em>Ways of Seeing</em></a>, and the 1972 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dtnvm\">BBC television series</a> based on it, changed the way at least two generations responded to art. And his writing since then \u2013 especially about migration \u2013 has changed the way many of us see the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Berger still has the ability to give himself the slip, to turn perception into an out-of-body experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berger now lives in Antony, a suburb seven miles outside Paris, where he stays with his old friend Nella Bielski, an actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/24/fiction.features1\">and writer</a> who grew up in the Soviet Union. They open the door together, and as we sit down to lunch, she turns to me and says: \u201cThe thing you have to understand about John is that he is not interested in talking about himself.\u201d While the chorus of approval gets louder on this side of the Channel, he is, unlikely as this might sound, barely aware of any fuss brewing.

It is of an ageless face and yet Melina is only 13. (Berger has three children \u2013 Katya, Jacob and Yves \u2013 and five grandchildren.) He props it next to us and we look at her, as if she had joined us for lunch. \u201cIf you ask me who I am,\u201d Berger says, \u201cI\u2019d like to see myself through her eyes, in the way she looks at me.\u201d Her stare is disconcertingly level. She looks, we agree, as if she knows more than she could possibly know or have seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cfafe60d160d6d1036e42899acf9b72b7c067218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfafe60d160d6d1036e42899acf9b72b7c067218/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"The painting of Berger's granddaughter, Melina, 13, by Jules Linglin\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The painting of his granddaughter, Melina, 13, by Jules Linglin, of which Berger says: \u2018If you ask me who I am, I\u2019d like to see myself through her eyes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jules Linglin/Kate Kellaway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are two things that are wonderful about this moment. The first is the reminder that Berger is as interested as ever in ways of seeing; that he still has the ability to give himself the slip, to turn perception into an out-of-body experience. And second, it is characteristic that he is keen to champion the young artist who painted his granddaughter. \u201cFetch me a piece of card from that side table,\u201d he says. He writes in his not-quite-steady, attractively looping hand: Jules Linglin. \u201cHe is going to be very well known one day,\u201d he declares, handing the card back to me.</p> <p>In spite of his wish to be seen through his granddaughter\u2019s eyes, it is Berger himself I now observe. He is smallish, but his face is big \u2013 handsomely hewn, with blue eyes and thick white hair. I have recently watched <em>Ways of Seeing</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4VX_9Kk\">on YouTube</a>, and it is extraordinary how commanding the four episodes still are. Berger had no time for ivory towers \u2013 his way of seeing was radical. Forty-four years ago he was a charismatic presence, looking into the camera with piercing eyes and a frequent frown, as if constantly on the edge of disagreeing with himself. The look was fitting because what the series did was to make people rethink. He never ducked difficulty: he described, for instance, how women, in traditional painting, were there to \u201cfeed an appetite, not to have any of their own\u201d. Unlike Kenneth Clark\u2019s patrician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/19/kenneth-clark-civilisation-bbc-review\"><em>Civilisation</em></a><em> </em>(1969), <em>Ways of Seeing</em> was never overbearing. In each episode, Berger sports the same groovy shirt with a geometric brown design on a cream background. His voice is clear and emphatic and fudges its Rs. His final words in the series are: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve shown, and what I\u2019ve said\u2026 must be judged against your own experience.\u201d That is what everything he has written asks us to do.</p> <p>For me, Berger will always be the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/to-the-wedding.html\"><em>To the Wedding</em></a> \u2013 a moving, unexpectedly affirmative novel about Aids, in which truth pursued fiction because he discovered only after he had started writing it that his daughter-in-law was HIV-positive. When I was a Booker judge in 1995, it was, out of 141 contenders, the novel I most wanted to win \u2013 although it possibly made for a quieter life that it didn\u2019t. Berger famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/09/lookingbackatthebookerjoh\">gave away half his Booker prize money</a> to the Black Panthers in 1972, when <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/g.html\"><em>G</em></a>, his postmodern novel about an Italian philanderer\u2019s political coming-of-age, secured the prize. A lifelong Marxist (although never a member of the Communist party), he disapproved of Booker McConnell\u2019s historical association with indentured labour in the Caribbean. The other half of the money went to funding Berger\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/seventh-man.html\"><em>A Seventh Man</em></a>, with the photographer <a href=\"http://www.jeanmohr.ch/image/oeuvre\">Jean Mohr</a>, about European migrant workers \u2013 a work he has since said is the one he would most like to survive him. Apparently, one of the Black Panthers went with him to the Booker ceremony and repeatedly advised him to \u201ckeep it cool\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm like the lookout guy on a boat who does small jobs, such as shovelling stuff into a boiler, but I\u2019m no navigator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And now Berger is looking at my proof copy of <em>Confabulations</em> \u2013 a miscellany of his essays and drawings (he went to the Chelsea School of Art as a young man, studying under Henry Moore, and taught there before being hired as the <em>New Statesman</em>\u2019s art critic). We consider his lively sketch of half a dozen topsy-turvy mushrooms. Underneath, in his hand, is written: \u201cSee you later, Omelette\u2026\u201d People forget that Berger is funny. And curious. And that he listens \u2013 how he listens. Over lunch, the small talk is of artichokes and an incredible Georgian dish involving walnuts, but this then leads Nella to talk about Berger\u2019s American wife, Beverly Bancroft (mother of Yves; the older children are from an earlier marriage), who died in 2013, and of her artistry as a gardener. This makes me think of the most moving scene in <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>, in which Berger urges Tilda Swinton\u2019s teenage twins to pick raspberries because Beverly loved them. Berger suggests the twins gather photos of Beverly \u2013 and they go ahead and make a sort of homemade shrine and eat bowlfuls of raspberries alongside it. \u201cYour pleasure will give her pleasure,\u201d Berger tells them. Towards the end of lunch, Nella whispers to me, in an aside, that she has nicknamed her Parisian house \u201cHotel Spinoza\u201d \u2013 after Berger\u2019s favourite 17th-century philosopher. His book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bento-s-sketchbook-268205.html\"><em>Bento\u2019s Sketchbook</em></a> (2011) was inspired by Spinoza, whose day job was as a lens grinder. Like his hero, Berger prefers not to distinguish between the physical and spiritual. Spinoza\u2019s vision, he now tells me, is that \u201call is indivisible\u201d.</p> <p>After lunch we move into his study, a den of paintings, a place of light, its windows thrown wide, looking on to trees. He tries to make himself comfortable on the white sofa, an arthritic back giving him trouble. As a writer, Berger has that rare and wonderful gift of being able to make complex thoughts simple. He once said, in a BBC interview with Jeremy Isaacs, that he likes, in all his work, to follow the advice of the photographer <a href=\"https://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL535353\">Robert Capa</a>: \u201cWhen the picture is not good enough, go closer\u2026\u201d His eye for detail remains unrivalled and consistently surprising (think of his irresistible observation that cows walk as if they were wearing high heels). Reading him is like standing at a window \u2013 perhaps a bit like the window of this study \u2013 with no one blocking the view. \u201cThe way I observe comes naturally to me as a curious person \u2013 I\u2019m like <em>la vigie</em> \u2013 the lookout guy on a boat who does small jobs, maybe such as shovelling stuff into a boiler, but I\u2019m no navigator \u2013 absolutely the opposite. I wander around the boat, find odd places \u2013 the masts, the gunwale \u2013 and then simply look out at the ocean. Being aware of travelling has nothing to do with being a navigator.\u201d</p> <p>Berger was born in Stoke Newington, north London. His father, Stanley, was a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who came from Trieste via Liverpool to London and was much affected by the first world war, in which he served as an infantry officer and was awarded the Military Cross. He loved painting and was self-taught (paternal conscience led him, when he found John reading Joyce\u2019s <em>Ulysses</em>, to confiscate the book, along with five others, and lock them up in his safe). In Colin MacCabe\u2019s film for <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>, Berger instructs Tilda Swinton (a friend for more than 20 years) on how to quarter and peel apples in the way his father used to do, and affectionately remembers how his father wanted him to be a lawyer, a doctor, an English gentleman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3b160689d23db595ce781fc9efe94527255ed87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b160689d23db595ce781fc9efe94527255ed87/0_0_928_523/500.jpg\" alt=\"Berger with Tilda Swinton in The Seasons in Quincy.\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berger with Tilda Swinton in<em> The Seasons in Quincy</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Berger\u2019s mother, Miriam, came from Bermondsey, south London (her father worked in the docks and looked after brewery dray horses). She had been a suffragette and, Berger has said, was a \u201cvery mysterious person, very secretive\u201d. But she was not secretive about her ambition that her son would one day become a writer. Berger prefers to avoid talking about his boarding school, St Edward\u2019s, Oxford, which he once described as \u201clunatic\u201d and with \u201csadism, torture, bullying\u2026 an absolutely monstrous place, a little totalitarian system\u201d. He was sent there aged six and ran away at 16. Was it at school he first understood that the world was unjust? \u201cI learnt even earlier,\u201d he replies, \u201cat about five.\u201d And he pauses and I wait. It is like watching a fisherman pulling on a line: \u201cMy mother \u2013 to make money to send me to school \u2013 made biscuits, sweets and chocolate to sell. I didn\u2019t see much of her as she was always in the kitchen, working. But once I was in the kitchen and a young man on a bicycle came in and asked for two bars of chocolate. She picked them up, told him the price and he said: \u2018Oh, forgive me, I\u2019ve not got this money, they\u2019re too expensive for me,\u2019 and walked out without any chocolate. And I was enormously struck by this incident. I did not judge. I did not judge my mother nor did I judge him for not having enough money.\u201d He pauses, \u201cI was just waiting for Karl Marx,\u201d and he laughs.</p> <p>In his essay Impertinence (in <em>Confabulations</em>), he describes the New Zealand governess (pre-school) who used to banish him into what she called \u201cthe Cry Cupboard\u201d whenever he wept. Sometimes his mother would come upstairs to see how he was doing and cheer him along with a box of her chocolate fudge. \u201cSchool, rather than confronting me with something, confirmed something I already felt because, from a very early age, I had this sense of harshness and the need for endurance.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This landscape was part of my energy, my body. I loved it not because it was a view \u2013 but because I participated in it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1944 he joined up, refusing a commission with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry, and became a lance corporal at a training camp. He preferred the company of working-class recruits, for whom he became a scribe, writing their letters home. In a sense, he has continued to do this all his life: telling other people\u2019s stories lest they vanish. In a conversation with Susan Sontag, he once said: \u201cA story is always a rescuing operation.\u201d And he has also said (in <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>): \u201cIf I\u2019m a storyteller it\u2019s because I listen. For me, a storyteller is like a <em>passeur</em> who gets contraband across a frontier.\u201d</p> <p>In his 1975 book <em>A Seventh Man</em>, about migration, the rescuing impulse is clear. Berger writes in the preface: \u201cTo outline the experience of the migrant worker and to relate this to what surrounds him \u2013 both physically and historically \u2013 is to grasp more surely the political reality of the world at this moment. The subject is European, its meaning is global. Its theme is unfreedom.\u201d When he considers today\u2019s refugee crisis \u2013 no longer confined to Europe \u2013 does he see the first world as suffering from a failure of imagination? There is another extended pause, like a ravine into which one might fall. Eventually he replies: \u201cWhat two different people have in common will always, in all cases, be larger than what differentiates them. And yet for dozens of different reasons, circumstances blind people to that.\u201d</p> <p>And what does he think about Brexit? He leans back on the sofa (we have now shifted from the overheated study into a cooler parlour, a sofa crawl in operation) and admits it has always been important to him to define himself as European. He then attempts to describe what he sees as the bigger picture: \u201cIt seems to me that we have to return, to recapitulate what globalisation meant, because it meant that capitalism, the world financial organisations, became speculative and ceased to be first and foremost productive, and politicians lost nearly all their power to take political decisions \u2013 I mean politicians in the traditional sense. Nations ceased to be what they were before.\u201d In Meanwhile (the last essay in <em>Landscapes</em>) he notes that the word \u201chorizon\u201d has slipped out of view in political discourse. And he adds, returning to Brexit, that he voted with his feet long ago, moving to France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"60577ec26b72ae2f91c7e80139b067e8bc9c5d36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60577ec26b72ae2f91c7e80139b067e8bc9c5d36/0_0_2184_2743/796.jpg\" alt=\"John Berger c1962, the year he moved to France.\" width=\"796\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Berger c1962, the year he moved to France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Keen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We talk about what it is for a person to adopt a foreign country as home, and about how it is possible to love a landscape like a familiar face. For Berger, that face is the Haute-Savoie. \u201cThis is the landscape I lived in for decades [he left only after Beverly died; his son Yves still lives there with his family]. It matters to me because during that time, I worked there like a peasant. OK, don\u2019t let\u2019s exaggerate. I didn\u2019t work as hard as they did but I worked pretty hard, doing exactly the same things as the peasants, working with them. This landscape was part of my energy, my body, my satisfaction and discomfort. I loved it not because it was a view \u2013 but because I participated in it.\u201d</p> <p>He explains: \u201cThe connection between the human condition and labour is frequently forgotten, and for me was always so important. At 16, I went down a coal mine in Derbyshire and spent a day on the coal face \u2013 just watching the miners. It had a profound effect.\u201d What did it make you feel? \u201cRespect,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cJust respect. There are two kinds. Respect to do with ceremony \u2013 what happens when you visit the House of Lords. And a completely different respect associated with danger.\u201d He says: \u201cThis is not a prescription for others, but when I look back on my life I think it\u2019s very significant I never went to a university. I refused to go. Lots of people were pushing me and I said, \u2018No. I don\u2019t want to\u2019, because those years at university form a whole way of thinking.\u201d And you feel free from that? \u201cYes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even at my old age, I\u2019m still capable of getting very angry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berger \u2013 fittingly, given his work with peasants \u2013 means shepherd in French. Do the French see him as one of their own? \u201cMy writing in France has not had a huge impact. The countries where I\u2019m most read are Spain, Latin American and until recently, oddly, Turkey\u2026 and Italy.\u201d Nor has he lived up to his surname, except \u201cI\u2019ve occasionally taken a ewe on heat in the back of my 2CV to meet a ram\u201d. I say we don\u2019t call that shepherding, we call that something else. He laughs. He is a man of action: until a few months ago he was (a most dashing octogenarian) still riding a motorbike. Nella tells me they hope it won\u2019t be long before he rides again \u2013 and swims. Berger is a keen swimmer and, in <em>Confabulations</em>, writes brilliantly about the democracy of swimming \u2013 people stripped of telltale trappings, doing their lengths. \u201cWhen you are swimming,\u201d he says, \u201cyou become almost weightless, and that weightlessness has something in common with thought.\u201d There is also a wonderful account in <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/11/22/john-berger-on-%E2%80%98bento%E2%80%99s-sketchbook%E2%80%99/\"><em>Bento\u2019s Sketchbook </em></a>of a friendship he strikes up with a Cambodian woman who shares the same Parisian swimming pool. She gives him a painting of a bird and, he maintains, teaches him something about homelessness.</p> <p>As he nudges closer to 90, Berger feels his own way of seeing has changed surprisingly little, although, he points out, technology has changed the way younger generations explore art. He admits, then, to his enthusiasm for texting: \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan for a long while because it\u2019s like whispers \u2013 and with that goes intimacy, secrecy, playfulness\u2026\u201d But there is nothing fixed about the way he sees. He believes one never sees the same picture twice: \u201cThe second time I saw the <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Grunewald_Isenheim1.jpg\">Gr\u00fcnewald altarpiece</a> was after a terrorist attack \u2013 it was the same painting yet I saw it differently.\u201d The importance of certain painters has shifted too. He reveres Modigliani less, admires Vel\u00e1zquez more: \u201cWhen one is young, one likes drama, excitation, bravura \u2013 Vel\u00e1zquez has none of this.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/12/john-berger-writing-is-an-off-shoot-of-something-deeper\">John Berger: \u2018Writing is an off-shoot of something deeper\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a writer, Berger has always had a gift for making absences present. Can he summon the people he has lost in his mind? \u201cYes, yes, yes\u2026 they are very present.\u201d I tell him how moved I was by his essay Krakow (in <em>Landscapes</em>), in which he remembers a New Zealand teacher, Ken, a huge influence on him. And his eyes fill as I speak. It was Ken who told him that whenever he could not sleep, he should \u201cimagine you are shuffling a pack of cards\u201d \u2013 advice he still follows. Ken also taught him the trick (not so useful now) of how to walk into a pub for a spot of underage drinking: \u201cDon\u2019t look back\u2026 don\u2019t doubt for a moment, just be surer of yourself than they are.\u201d And he advised against self-pity. \u201cWhenever I might have been filled with self-pity, I turned it into furious anger. Even at my old age, I\u2019m still capable of getting very angry.\u201d</p> <p>But Berger\u2019s greatest strength in old age is his ability to live in the present. \u201cI cultivated this early on \u2013 and this is the paradox \u2013 because it was an escape from prescriptions, prophecies, consequences and causes.\u201d The present moment is key to his thinking too. In <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, he suggests that paintings embody the present in which they were painted. Defining the secret of reading aloud well, he says it is \u201crefusing to look ahead, to be in the moment\u201d. And he says that a story puts its listener \u201cin an eternal present\u201d. He has also written about the circularity of time. Does he think that applies to an individual life? Is there, in old age, a way in which one starts to hold hands with one\u2019s younger self?</p> <p>\u201cTime is circular, and in relation to that portrait of Melina, that is exactly what I feel.\u201d He suggests I take a photo of the painting. We carry it into the sunlight, prop it against the back of a chair. I say the <em>Observer</em> will need a photograph to go with this interview and he asks with boyish mischief: \u201cCouldn\u2019t we use her instead?\u201d</p> <p>It is only after I get home that I realise I failed to ask him how he intends to spend his birthday. I text him and he rings straight back. \u201cListen,\u201d he says, \u201cI feel so grateful to have reached 90 \u2013 it is such an age \u2013 and to my friends for wanting to celebrate, but what I\u2019ve told them all is that what we ought to do on the day is be silent.

  "<p>This is what greets you when you arrive at a Trump rally: two 18-wheelers parked outside the sports stadium where the Republican nominee will be speaking, placed end-to-end so that nobody can miss them. The front truck, painted white, has \u201cThe Donald for President\u201d scrawled across its side, above the slogans: \u201cAll lives matter\u201d, \u201cBuild the wall\u201d, and \u201cKeep Mexican dope in Mexico\u201d.</p> <p>It is a relatively gentle introduction to Trumpworld, a scattering of antagonism for the gathering crowd.

After we have spent months watching the impossible happen, of hearing the defense of the indefensible, of observing American values \u2013 one after another \u00ad\u2013 fall like bowling pins, it\u2019s time to ask: what has this sometimes maddening, bizarre, gruesome, hilarious, shocking, scary Trump phenomenon been about? More urgently, once the pall of this most baffling of presidential elections has cleared and 8 November fades into the background, what will the Donald have left behind?</p> <p>Some of the answers to those questions come easily, shared freely by Trump\u2019s supporters as they wait in line. Conspiracy theories are one aspect of the destruction wrought by Hurricane Donald likely to be with us for a long time.</p> <p>Here\u2019s Vjekoslav Grgas, a Croatian American, standing dutifully in the non-VIP line. In five short minutes, he rattles off a litany of horror stories. Did you know that three men were assassinated at the Democratic national convention in July to cover up the fact that they were the source of the WikiLeaks dump of hacked Democratic emails? Or that the liberal financier George Soros bankrolled several US foreign policy disasters, and that Hillary Clinton personally pocketed 99% of the donations to the Clinton Foundation following the 2010 Haiti earthquake? In a rare note of discordance with the Republican nominee, he even adds that Trump was wrong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-video\">to finally admit</a> last month that Barack Obama is an American, as the US president\u2019s birth certificate was obviously Photoshopped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec3b4e951c427721a192bb9148bf263de64fa714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3b4e951c427721a192bb9148bf263de64fa714/0_324_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"supporters cheer at the rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Trump\u2019s going to say what needs to be said\u2019: supporters cheer at the rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other elements of the Trump phenomenon are more difficult to tease out. Phrases are thrown out<strong> </strong>from the line with such repetitive frequency that they take on the blandness of cliches. One of the VIP Bikers for Trump, John Hearl, is among many at the rally who says he likes the reality TV star because unlike career politicians, Trump \u201cspeaks his own mind\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s going to say what needs to be said, and if that offends somebody, well then, they just have to understand the goal of all this.\u201d</p> <p>Which is?</p> <p>\u201cAmerica first.\u201d</p> <p>A little further ahead in the VIP line stands Carole Urban, wearing a sequined hat in the colors of the American flag. She says she is also looking forward to hearing Trump speaking, because \u201che\u2019s down to our level. He\u2019s not like past presidents who prepare a beautiful speech but it\u2019s not coming from the heart. He speaks it like it is.\u201d</p> <p>Beautiful speeches from past presidents. Is she referring to Obama?</p> <p>She pulls her shoulders back and with a note of indignation says: \u201cWhen I first heard Obama I was elected, I thought he could improve our country. I voted for him in 2008. I was so disillusioned in him \u2013 after four years, he helped ruin this country.\u201d</p> <p>Was part of that disillusionment to do with Obama\u2019s \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d, as she puts it? <br></p> <p>She shrugs a second time. \u201cYes, I was angry about his oratory. The way he was speaking, it touched my soul, it was so beautiful. A black person, everyone says, but he\u2019s actually mulatto. I thought he could do a great job helping American people, but it didn\u2019t happen like that.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Urban about how, as a woman, she feels about Trump\u2019s self-confessed sexually predatory behavior, she gets indignant. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this being brought up. Words come out in the wrong way at times; you put your foot in your mouth. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump is remotely derogatory to women.\u201d</p> <p>To follow Urban\u2019s train of thought: Trump is loved by his supporters not just because of the content of what he says, such as his seemingly endless ability to insult anyone from <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/trump_mexico_not_sending_us_their_best_criminals_drug_dealers_and_rapists_are_crossing_border.html\">Mexicans</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/\">Muslims</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/\">African Americans</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a44629/donald-trump-insults-women/\">women</a>. It\u2019s also the way he says it. It\u2019s the language he uses: unscripted, unpolished, and not infrequently unintelligible. He is the antithesis of the fancy, considered Obama, with the Harvard law degree and the \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d.</p> <p>The contrast is worth exploring. Here is Obama speaking on the campaign trail at a similar end-game stage in the 2008 election: \u201cHope! That\u2019s what kept our parents going when times were tough. It\u2019s what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds and carve a new life for their families in America; what led those who couldn\u2019t vote to march and organize and stand for freedom, that led them to cry out: \u2018It may look dark tonight, but if I hold on to hope, tomorrow will be brighter.\u2019\u201d </p> <p></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwiVqCbizKg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AwiVqCbizKg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>And here is Trump speaking tonight at the rally, reproduced verbatim: \u201cBikers love me. I will see these bikers, oftentimes on Harleys, not always, but a lot of times. I feel so safe with these bikers. A lot of times they don\u2019t want to come inside, they just want to make sure I feel safe. I love you guys, I love you guys.\u201d</p> <p>Or this on his rival: \u201cHillary lied. No, no, no, she lied. She\u2019s a liar. And she lied and she lied. She lied. It\u2019s so important we vote in November so that we get rid of these liars, these incompetent people, the Hillary Clintons.\u201d</p> <p>So what if Trump\u2019s diction is less than perfect? There are no rules on how a would-be president should communicate with the people, nor are there minimum standards of rhetorical prowess for the White House.</p> <p>What seems apparent is that Trump has given his followers the license to emulate him in throwing caution to the wind and saying things that previously were considered unacceptable. Trump has also opened a new era in American politics in which it doesn\u2019t matter what you say or how you say it. Be as offensive as you like. Speak your own mind.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-poll-assuming-win-is-downright-dangerous\">Stop right there: assuming a Hillary Clinton victory is downright dangerous | Kate Aronoff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inside the sports stadium, the impact of the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s anti-oratory is all around us.

A third T-shirt design scattered among the crowd has the face of Bill Clinton superimposed on the famous 2008 rainbow-colored Obama poster, with the word Hope replaced by Rape.</p> <p>As the rally gets rowdier, whipped into a half-frenzy by the warm-up speakers, \u201cLock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\u201d chants fill thestadium. </p> <p>The former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani comes on to introduce the main speaker and immediately launches into a story about locker rooms, turning the candidate\u2019s excuse for why he bragged about grabbing \u201cpussy\u201d into a joke. Then he turns his comments on Clinton, adding: \u201cI\u2019m going to get down off the stage with you into the basket of deplorables. Because unlike Clinton, you speak the truth. You\u2019re for real, she\u2019s a phoney.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a disconnect between the ugly schoolyard name-calling coming from the speakers and the outward appearance of their audience. Yes, there are the usual smattering of patriotic followers in costume of the sort that frequent any Republican event: women robed in the Stars and Stripes; men posing as Uncle Sam with crooked top hats like wonky chimneys on their heads. But most Trump supporters wear the unassuming uniform of middle America: jeans, checked shirt and jacket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0163838c5d8c6f8dff5d3a88ff5cd89afaccabc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0163838c5d8c6f8dff5d3a88ff5cd89afaccabc3/0_111_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump supporters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Until Trump and his surrogates get to work on them, the thousands filling the arena come across as a genial bunch intent on enjoying themselves for the night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most, too, are in work, and their <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">median income</a> is in fact above the national average.

There are lots of them peppered around the stadium, from toddlers in diapers to wide-eyed teenagers taking it all in. </p> <p>\u201cI think Trump will bring back jobs,\u201d says Ben, aged 13. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll close the borders down to Mexicans and illegal immigrants so that less young people like me die of opioid addiction.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a hefty thought for a 13-year-old. Does Ben know of anyone who\u2019s died of a painkiller overdose? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know anyone personally.\u201d</p> <p>The crowd is at it again, raising a deafening cry of: \u201cLock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\u201d \u2013 a powerful civics class for a middle-schooler.</p> <p>Ben reacts to the chant: \u201cI think Clinton lied in front of federal Congress and continues to lie about her emails. She\u2019s unfit to be president.\u201d</p> <p>Trump enters the auditorium and the atmosphere rises to another level. Before he arrived it was already electric; now it\u2019s like one of those static balls that make your hair stand on end.</p> <p>The candidate launches into his routinely un-beautiful speech. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Crooked Hillary, what about the crooked media? CNN is a disgrace. CNN is a disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>A huge boo erupts from the stadium floor as the crowd turns towards the media compound where reporters and camera operators are penned in for the duration. Trump\u2019s invective has an immediate and chilling impact among the crowd. Men and women who only moments ago were pleasantly talking to us, sharing generously their reflections on the state of the nation, are now jabbing their fingers in our direction and spitting: \u201cCNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!\u201d The hatred is intimidating.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, folks, they are so dishonest,\u201d Trump continues. \u201cWithout the media Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t be elected dog-catcher.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses, strutting up and down the stage like Mick Jagger in a business suit.

  "<p>We are entering a second dark age.

There could be no clearer example of the extent to which we have lost our way than the abandonment of art history and archaeology.

The last option, a presumably deliberate literary irony, economically expresses the fatalistic worldview common to Anglo-Saxon poetry, which the Norman conquest subsequently supplanted with its dry Gallic insouciance.</p> <p>The question in question related to a humorous thinkpiece by the Brexit cheerleader and <em>Daily Telegraph</em> blogger Dan \u201cDan\u201d Hannananananan, who was named \u201c10th most influential person on the centre-right in the United Kingdom\u201d by the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> in 2009.</p> <p>This genuine chart, which really exists, found Dan \u201cDan\u201d Hannananananan only nine positions away from the coveted \u201cmost influential person on the centre-right in the United Kingdom\u201d trophy, a small mirror on a stick that can be slid into the public\u2019s brains through their ears to reflect what people are really thinking but dare not say, because of political correctness gone mad and Gary Lineker\u2019s leftwing thought&#xa0;police.</p> <p>But by 2011, Dan \u201cDan\u201d Hannananananan had fallen 28 places to be merely the 38th most influential person on the centre-right in the United Kingdom, like some kind of Enoch Powell-admiring elevator tumbling down the broken lift shaft of centre-right influence.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Dan \u201cDan\u201d Hannananananan\u2019s role in delivering the pro-Brexit result in the recent national anti-immigration referendum will surely see him zoom up to the top of the \u201cmost influential person on the centre-right in the United&#xa0;Kingdom\u201d&#xa0;chart this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71880bf2dc61db9a938057ce2ff32805fde204f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71880bf2dc61db9a938057ce2ff32805fde204f8/0_0_1884_2665/707.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of a dead canary in a birdcage.\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most awards ceremonies are interminable, but the \u201cmost influential person on the centre-right in the United Kingdom\u201d event is one I\u2019d love to attend, if only to see Dan \u201cDan\u201d Hannananananan navigate the complexities of the finger buffet with the same decorum with which he steered a course through the national anti-immigration referendum and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge\" title=\"\">\u00a3350m-a-week NHS funding</a> vote.</p> <p>Dan \u201cDan\u201d Hannananananan\u2019s <em>Daily Telegraph</em> column of earlier this month, entitled <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/14/the-norman-conquest-was-a-disaster-for-england-we-should-celebra/\" title=\"\">\u201cThe Norman Conquest Was a Disaster for England.

  "<p>Leonie Orton is the youngest sister of the playwright Joe Orton (he was born in 1933, and she in 1944). They grew up on a Leicester council estate; their father, Bill, worked as a gardener, and their mother, Elsie, worked as a factory machinist,&nbsp;and then as a char. But while Joe was keen to better himself and eventually won a place at Rada, Leonie remained in Leicester, where she also worked in a factory, married and had two daughters. In London, Joe lived with Kenneth Halliwell, whom he had met at Rada, in a tiny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/30/halliwell-orton-art-collage-library-books\" title=\"\">Islington bedsit</a>. The relationship was tortured and complex, and Halliwell, jealous of Orton\u2019s success and fearful he might be abandoned, murdered him, and killed himself, in 1967. Joe kept all Leonie\u2019s teenage letters to him, and they are now in the <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/find/specialcollections/specialcollections/joe-orton-collection\" title=\"\">Orton collection</a> at Leicester University. Leonie has written a memoir, <em>I Had It&nbsp;in Me</em>.</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to write your story after all these years?</strong><br>When John Lahr wrote <em>Prick Up Your Ears</em> [in 1978], it irked me. I was hurt. It\u2019s a very good biography, but I didn\u2019t know his Joe Orton, and I struggled to understand how he, a Californian, had done it. He never met my brother. Joe said: \u201cI\u2019m from the gutter, and don\u2019t you ever forget it because I won\u2019t.\u201d I shared that gutter. I wanted to show where he came from, the awful poverty and deprivation. It was stultifying. Our family was so dysfunctional. It was dreadful. Everything that was bad about the British class system applied to&nbsp;us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a51fac07fa65730103997a16cb80c444977f26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a51fac07fa65730103997a16cb80c444977f26/162_86_3303_2143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Orton,photographed outside his Islington home at the height of his fame, 1966\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Orton, photographed outside his Islington home at the height of his fame, 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elam/Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You and Joe had a bond in a family not noted for getting along. Why was that? </strong><br>Very often the oldest sibling, and the youngest, do have a connection. I hero-worshipped him, and I think he knew that. We had the same feelings about our parents, a detachment. Elsie [their mother] was horrible, though I think that was all born out of frustration and not having any money. Like most women of her time and class, her only way out was to marry. But she and my dad weren\u2019t at all happy. She loved to humiliate him. Like Joe, she liked an audience. That wonderful line in <em>What the Butler Saw</em>, when Mrs Prentice says: \u201cMy uterine contractions have been bogus for some time,\u201d I can hear my mother in that: it\u2019s the same rhythm. My father, on the other hand, was this mild-mannered, insipid man. He was everything Joe hated, and there are characters like him in all his plays. I think Joe kept in contact with his family, not out of love, but because he needed to touch base with his roots. That\u2019s where his dialogue came from.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Joe threw me a lifeline, even if it did take me many years to realise it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You write that the family had no idea Joe was gay until after his death. Is this true, or did you only see what you wanted to?</strong><br>It sounds stupid now, but I really didn\u2019t know. In the early 60s, it just wasn\u2019t talked about. I thought Kenneth Halliwell was just a flatmate. Having said that, perhaps my mother had an inkling. \u201cWhat do you want to live with a bald-headed man for?\u201d she asked him. But I wasn\u2019t making the connections. When I read the diaries [edited by Lahr, and published in 1986], I was shocked. In the toilets with a dwarf and all that! [Orton was promiscuous, and keen on cottaging.] I thought, no, it can\u2019t be true. But he did have this desire to shock, and perhaps they\u2019re part of that. It was another thing he got from our mother. Her behaviour often made me cringe \u2013 like the time I let a debt collector into the kitchen, and she was peeing into the washing-up bowl.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27d2efb1d012d982d0ed475a33430e84211906b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27d2efb1d012d982d0ed475a33430e84211906b9/130_668_1945_1227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonie Orton, photographed in Leicester, circa 1962\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leonie Orton, photographed in Leicester, circa 1962.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Leonie Orton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>It must have been terrible to lose Joe. But he left you a great gift, didn\u2019t he?</strong><br>Yes. He threw me a lifeline, even if it did take me many years to realise it. I was working in a hosiery factory, a dead-end job. But then the money from his estate started to come in. At first, I used it to indulge my material side. But that was so unfulfilling; it didn\u2019t relieve my sense of inferiority. I knew I had to do something else. So I got educated [she took O-levels, studied at the Open University, and got a job as a library assistant at the University of Leicester], and I got more involved with the estate [she took over as its administrator in 2004]. It has been very satisfying. I used to ask my other brother [Douglas]: doesn\u2019t it bother you that you don\u2019t understand Joe\u2019s work? He would say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m a plumber\u201d, and I would think, \u201cWell, why&nbsp;don\u2019t&nbsp;you get up off your arse and try?\u201d I hope I understand Joe\u2019s work myself, now \u2013 even <em>What the Butler Saw</em>, with all its stylised&nbsp;language.</p> <p><strong>Joe\u2019s diaries end on 1 August 1967, suddenly, with&nbsp;a&nbsp;hyphen, and some believe pages were lost, or even removed. Are you still hopeful they will turn&nbsp;up? And that, if they do, they will answer certain questions (in his suicide note, Halliwell wrote that the latter part of the diaries would explain everything)? </strong><br>Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if they did? I\u2019d like to think they are out there somewhere. It would help to know more. I don\u2019t want to be too dramatic, but I do think: why? All I can do is liken it to the situation of an artist who paints something, and then decides it\u2019s not what he wants it to be, and slashes it. Kenneth saw his relationship with Joe a bit like that. He felt he had created him, so he could bloody well destroy him, too.</p> <h2><strong>An extract from Leonie Orton\u2019s I Had It in Me</strong></h2> <p><strong>In October 1964, Leonie married George Barnett, a toolmaker. They spent their four-day honeymoon at a London hotel, and Joe (known to his family as John) bought them tickets to see Frankie Howerd in <em>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</em>. They were also invited to have tea with Joe and his boyfriend, Kenneth Halliwell, at their bedsit in Noel Road, Islington.</strong><br>It was a strange tea we had with them that day. There was no table in their small room, which was made even smaller by the collage of illustration plates that were pasted floor to ceiling on the back wall. These were the ones they\u2019d removed from library books and contributed to their prison sentences. The two chairs which George and I occupied appeared to be the only ones they had. While we ate our plate of cucumber sandwiches Joe sat on the floor and Kenneth perched nervously on the edge of one of their twin beds. When Kenneth brought out the cups of tea, it ended up as a sort of juggling act, balancing the sandwiches on our knee while we placed the teacups on the floor: Kenneth ate nothing, sipping at his tea and barely speaking, and then only to Joe.</p> <p>And then there was the cake. Joe appeared from the kitchenette holding aloft a plate in the middle of which sat a battenberg. He was parading in front of us, holding the plate like an exhibit at an auction. Turning the plate around he began to elucidate on its wonderful symmetrical qualities: the pink and yellowness of the sponge and the precision of the marzipan. They both agreed it was as perfect as a cake could be. To me it was just an ordinary factory-produced Lyons battenberg, but they were discussing it like it was a work of art.</p> <p>The memory of that afternoon puzzled me. It seemed staged, as if we were performers in a Wilde play. I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. Were they sending us up because we were philistines? Joe had never been pretentious towards me. Quite the reverse was true. Sensing my vulnerability he\u2019d always been protective towards me. Like the time I\u2019d gone with him to the New Arts theatre to see <em>Entertaining Mr Sloane</em>. Sitting next to him in the stalls afterwards, he asked what I thought of the play. I wanted to say something intelligent but I just said: \u201cIt made me laugh.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as it made you laugh.\u201d So perhaps the cake wasn\u2019t a send-up, just a tease. What captivated me about Joe was his supreme confidence. I loved being around him.</p> <p><strong>In December 1966, Elsie, Leonie and Joe\u2019s mother, died at home in Leicester. Neither of them felt any grief for her. She had been an indifferent, sometimes cruel parent. Joe had been as dutiful a son as she was a mother.</strong><br>On 29 December, Joe arrived in Leicester for the funeral. In his diary for that day he recorded: \u201cI had a bit of quick sex in a derelict house with a labourer I picked up.\u201d Later that afternoon six of us lined up at the door of the chapel of rest where Mam\u2019s corpse was laid out. Joe was intrigued by Mam\u2019s outfit. She was wearing a long white shift dress and a white satin quilted robe with gold lapels and cuffs held together by a thick gold cord complete with tassels. They\u2019d made her face up: rouge on the cheeks, red lipstick and blue eyeshadow. She would have loved all this elaborate stuff, I think to myself. I can see her now, getting ready to go to the works Christmas party. She\u2019d borrowed a gold lam\u00e9 dress and her bulges were almost kept in place by her new pink, boned corset. She couldn\u2019t afford to buy any gold shoes so had painted a pair of black court shoes with gold modelling paint. When the paint dried, the shoes were rigid, causing her to walk stiffly. During the evening the paint began to crack and left behind a trail of gold dust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce3ef28386664978b0c655365cc96b0ac47e9c3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce3ef28386664978b0c655365cc96b0ac47e9c3a/0_226_2826_1696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Orton with Dudley Sutton and Madge Ryan who played Mr Sloane and Kath in Orton\u2019s first play, Entertaining Mr Sloane, which opened in London\u2019s West End in 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Orton with Dudley Sutton and Madge Ryan who played Mr Sloane and Kath in Orton\u2019s first play, Entertaining Mr Sloane, which opened in London\u2019s West End in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMam would have loved the posh dressing gown,\u201d I said. Joe said he thought it was only for show and that they wouldn\u2019t bury her in it. He was bending over her: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like Mum without her glasses.\u201d I noted that since living in London he referred to Mam as \u201cmum\u201d. Joe touched her hand, commenting on how cold it was. Lifting it he asked if anyone wanted the cheap marcasite ring she still had on. We all declined. Walking round to the other side of the coffin he noticed a brown stain on the white headrest. He tilted her head to one side to investigate further. He thought it was probably embalming fluid that was leaking out. On the way back, an argument broke out as Marilyn [Leonie\u2019s older sister] wanted to know who\u2019d had the slippers she\u2019d bought Mam for Christmas. No one owned up to taking them. Joe told her it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt\u2019s all right for you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty.\u201d</p> <p><strong>On 9 August 1967, Kenneth Halliwell attacked Joe Orton at their Islington bedsit, hitting his head with a hammer nine times. He then swallowed 22 Nembutals, washed down with a can of grapefruit juice. Halliwell died first. </strong><br>The next time I saw my brother Joe was when he came to Leicester to see a production of <em>Entertaining Mr Sloane</em> at the Phoenix theatre. He arrived on 1 August 1967. I cooked a meal for him and Dad. I told him how awful the birthing process had been [Leonie had recently had a daughter, Lois] and how pleased I was to have left hospital with a live baby. I asked him if he wanted to hold her, and he did. He noted how small she was. On the evening of 2 August, he went to the Phoenix theatre. The following day I put Lois in her pram and walked to Dad\u2019s house where I\u2019d arranged to see Joe before he caught his train back to London. We sat in the kitchen discussing Dad. Joe said Dad had scalded his hand making tea when he missed the teapot, and he shouldn\u2019t live on his own. \u201cHe can\u2019t see properly, and I don\u2019t want him living with me,\u201d I said. Joe nodded in agreement: \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d I agreed to make some inquiries. We walked down Trenant Road together. He pushed the pram. As we parted he kissed me. I said something like: \u201cHave a safe journey back.\u201d He told me to write to him: \u201cI\u2019ll always answer your letters, you know,\u201d he said. I watched him as he walked down Stonesby Avenue to catch his bus. He turned and we waved to one another. I never saw him again.</p> <p>George [her husband] and I returned home the following Wednesday evening after visiting his parents. As we walked up the path to the back door, our neighbours, Michael and Edna Johnson, appeared. While Michael spoke to George, Edna drew me to one side, commenting on how pretty Lois was. When George told me to give Lois to him, I instantly knew something wasn\u2019t right. We went inside the house. \u201cJohn\u2019s dead,\u201d he said. At first, I didn\u2019t make the connection with Joe. I assumed he was referring to our other neighbour, John Marshall. I said: \u201cOh no, what will Elizabeth (my neighbour\u2019s wife) do?\u201d George said: \u201cNo, not John next door; your John, Joe.\u201d I didn\u2019t break down at what George had just said; it seemed too baffling, not possible. How? When? Are you sure? \u201cIt\u2019s just been on the telly, the six o\u2019clock news,\u201d George said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible. They tell the family first, don\u2019t they?\u201d I was trying to think who to contact to find out if it was true when Dougie [her brother] pulled up outside. He, too, had heard it on the news: \u201cIt\u2019s our John, all right. Ken\u2019s done him in. I rang the Leicester police and they gave me a number for the Islington police.\u201d Dougie left with a promise to let me know the details when he had them. He\u2019d been asked to go to London the next day to identify Joe\u2019s body. I wanted to go with him, but he thought I\u2019d be too distressed. I thought he shouldn\u2019t go on his own, and George offered to go with him.</p> <p>I waited anxiously for George to return from London but he couldn\u2019t answer any of my questions, saying only that Dougie identified Joe. George wasn\u2019t allowed into the mortuary room. \u201cHe must have told you something,\u201d I pressed. \u201cAll he said was he had no top to his head.\u201d All he said! All he said! I needed to speak to Dougie. He came to see us on Friday morning. He asked me if I\u2019d seen the papers. \u201cOnly the <em>Daily Mirror</em>. It says Ken\u2019s killed him and then killed himself.\u201d Dougie looked straight at me: \u201cKen murdered John. He took a hammer to his head and then took some pills and done himself in. That\u2019s what happened\u2026 You know what they\u2019re saying about John and Ken, don\u2019t you?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIn the [<em>Daily</em>] <em>Sketch</em> they reckon they\u2019re homos.\u201d This was a revelation to the family. I could hardly believe it. John, homosexual? \u201cDo you think it\u2019s true?\u201d I asked. Dougie appeared embarrassed. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s true,\u201d I puzzled. \u201cBecause after leaving home, he only ever lived with Kenneth.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c0b32498cfcc3957e2573f5e53c7637a989c262\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c0b32498cfcc3957e2573f5e53c7637a989c262/0_379_3017_3771/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Orton outside the Lyceum Theatre, New York.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Orton outside the Lyceum Theatre, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin G Brooks Abipp/\u00a9 Orton Estate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The funeral was arranged for Friday 18 August at Golders Green crematorium in London. I arranged for a friend to look after Lois and travelled there in a yellow Ford Anglia driven by our Auntie Lucy. When we arrived at the crematorium, the attendant asked: \u201cAre you the 2.15, or the 2.30?\u201d We were about to answer when a woman stepped forward wearing a white suit with an enormous white fox fur collar. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, proffering her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Peggy Ramsay, Joe\u2019s agent.\u201d I was a little shocked at the white suit. We didn\u2019t wear white for funerals. We were all in dour mourning shades of grey, black and purple. \u201cI\u2019m sorry there\u2019s a lot of press here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve no control over them. To them, this is considered a fashionable funeral.\u201d</p> <p>As we approached, I heard people inside chatting, but as we came in, this ceased. Peggy led us down to the front seats. We sat waiting for the ceremony to begin. Dad, confused, had to be reminded to take his cap off. He sat wringing his hands, wanting a running commentary on what was happening. Had they brought in the coffin yet? What was that strange music? Do you think there\u2019s a toilet here? All this was audible at least four rows back. I told him to shut up and stop showing us up. As the coffin was carried in \u2013 it was draped in purple velvet with a huge spray of red roses on top \u2013 the mourners remained seated. The pall bearers were friends [of Joe\u2019s] from the Royal Court theatre. The music was a recording of A Day in the Life from <em>Sergeant Pepper</em> with all the psychedelic noise at the end ineptly obliterated. It wasn\u2019t a good recording. It spluttered and restarted several times. The first line of the song is about reading the news and a lucky man who makes the grade. I had read the news. The <em>Daily Mirror</em>\u2019s headline ran: \u201cAuthor of Hit Play Murdered By Friend.\u201d</p> <p>After the coffin had been placed on the conveyor rollers, a man I didn\u2019t recognise but now know was Harold Pinter, stepped up to the lectern. He read the poem Nox Est Perpetua by Marion Lochhead. Donald Pleasence then got up. This man I recognised. He seemed tense, checked his flies, a quirky half smile on his face. I thought he looked exactly like the character he played in <em>The Great Escape</em>. Joe said to me once that many actors don\u2019t act, they just play themselves. He unfolded a sheet of paper and read <a href=\"http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Life16a.html\" title=\"\">Hilarium Memoriam JO,</a> a poem written by his wife, Josephine Martin Crombie.</p> <p>After Pleasence stepped down we were given a few minutes in silent contemplation. I\u2019m little again. Joe is holding my hand and we\u2019re at the gate of Marriott Road infant school. He\u2019s smiling down at me: \u201cOff you go, then.\u201d I look at the purple draped box in front of me. I never knew this sabre-toothed playwright the critics talk about, or the promiscuous homosexual. The celebrity these people are gathered here to mourn, this Joe Orton, I didn\u2019t know him. It\u2019s the other person, my brother John, I shall miss. He was one of the only people to show me any real kindness. He was my hero.</p> <p>Faintly, those first quiet, soft notes of Edward Elgar\u2019s Nimrod began to fill the now silent crematorium. I rummaged in the sleeve of my coat, trying to find my handkerchief. As I wiped away tears, my sister gave me a comforting nudge. The coffin started to move but it faltered and juddered like a car on a bad hill start. There was an awful moment when I thought the mechanism had broken down. Finally, the rollers moved the coffin towards the small trapdoor. The double curtains dropped down and the show was over.</p> <p>We were escorted out by Ramsay. \u201cOh dear, how awful, the recording of the Beatles\u2019 song was so poor and then the coffin grinding to a halt. Still, Joe would have loved all that,\u201d she said. Then, gesturing to a quadrangle area: \u201cThere are a lot of flowers I think you should look at.\u201d As we walked towards where the flowers were displayed, Pinter was leaving. He nodded at us and said: \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. He was a marvellous writer.\u201d \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d my dad asked. \u201cHe said, Dad, that John was a good writer,\u201d I said, to which Dad mindlessly replied: \u201cYes, he was.\u201d This remark was typical of where we came from. Pretending to be in the know when we couldn\u2019t tell a pigeon from a pelican. The flowers, mostly white roses and carnations, had cards attached. One read: \u201cTo darling Joe from the cast of <em>Loot</em>.\u201d The card on our flowers read: \u201cFrom all in Leicester.\u201d I sidled up to Dougie. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a proper message on our flowers?\u201d He looked at me as if I was criticising him: \u201cI told Peggy that John wouldn\u2019t have wanted any flowers and she said she\u2019d take care of it all, so I let \u2019er.\u201d Later, she would refer to us as \u201cJoe\u2019s little family in Leicester\u201d. As we were leaving, Peggy said: \u201cJoe was very well respected, you know.\u201d I wanted to say adamantly: \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d But I didn\u2019t dare. Only then my sister interjected: \u201cWe\u2019re off a council estate in Leicester. Me and Leonie work in hosiery factories, Mam was a cleaner, Dad was a gardener and our Doug\u2019s a plumber. We\u2019ve got no idea where our John gorrit from, have we, Leonie?\u201d I nodded in agreement.

  "<p>Bruce Springsteen exists at that rarefied level of fame where you get to move like a Dalek, without ever actually having to touch anything. When he is out in public, at least \u2013 when he is being the Springsteen who is Brooooooce, the Springsteen who is the Boss, rather than the one who\u2019s been married for 25 years and has three kids \u2013 no obstacles stand in his way. No door is left unopened, no person steps out in front of him, and if you find yourself in his orbit, you can\u2019t help but find the gravitational pull of stardom yanking you into your position.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen and experienced this a couple of times. In 2010, when he attended a screening of the documentary about him, <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4de878485ffee\"><em>The Promise</em></a>, at BFI Southbank in London, a friend and I were walking down the red carpet towards the cinema when there was a stir around us; we felt it before we noticed the faces lining the barriers turning in one direction. Behind us, Springsteen had alighted from a people carrier. We panicked \u2013 We\u2019re not meant to be here! Where do we go? \u2013 and made ourselves as small and invisible at the edge of the carpet as we could while he ambled past and the energy followed behind. I don\u2019t remember how the doors opened, but I\u2019m pretty sure he didn\u2019t have to lift a finger.</p> <p>Then backstage at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, this past June. Springsteen was just finishing his final number \u2013 an acoustic version of his wonderful 1975 redemption song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5kXnq5IjdU\">Thunder Road</a>. We were in the access tunnel at the side of the stage, where a fleet of black luxury cars lined up, windows tinted, engines ticking over, waiting for him and the band to leave the stage, to be whisked from the stadium before the house lights have flashed on, while tens of thousands are still finishing their drinks and working out where the nearest exit is. It is, doubtless, the same wherever he plays.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5kXnq5IjdU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x5kXnq5IjdU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5kXnq5IjdU\">Watch a young Bruce Springsteen perform Thunder Road</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The 67-year-old Bruce Springsteen who enters the room at his favoured London luxury hotel \u2013 door opened by someone else, naturally, and it took three people to wait with me for him to enter \u2013 has skin the colour of wealth and clothes so casual they could only be expensive: a close-fitting jacket, a slightly scoop-necked T-shirt, and jeans whose left leg is flecked with white paint, as if he\u2019s just been touching up the cornicing in the corridors. You half wonder if someone splattered the paint on for him, just to keep things looking blue collar.</p> <p>He\u2019s here promoting his autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/born-to-run-memoir-bruce-springsteen-review\"><em>Born to Run</em></a>. Before London, he\u2019d been on a nine-date book tour of US cities, meeting his flock, opening \u2013 touchingly \u2013 with an <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7525558/bruce-springsteen-born-to-run-book-signing-freehold-new-jersey\">appearance</a> in his home town of Freehold, New Jersey (pop: 12,052), to which people travelled from across the east coast. Even that turned into a major operation: the <em>Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/27/bruce-springsteen-book-new-jersey-born-to-run\">reported</a> that at least eight police officers were on duty around the branch of Barnes and Noble, with around twice that number of private security guards.</p> <p>Springsteen estimates he has scrawled his signature on 17,000 copies of the book. Perhaps surprisingly, he\u2019s rather enjoyed the experience. \u201cYou meet the fans \u2013 only for 10 seconds, but you meet them one by one,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they have an opportunity: what\u2019s the one thing you always wanted to say over the 40 years of the relationship we\u2019ve had? I actually found it quite moving. Always enjoyed that part. I used to love to drift around, bump into people, see what their lives were like, wander into their lives for a few moments then drift back out. It appealed to the transient nature of my personality. I liked the idea of being here and then being gone, this little spirit moving through the world.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of days before we meet, he opens the European leg of his promo jaunt with an event in front of an invited audience of journalists at the ICA in London, where he notes that when the fans have met him, one of the commonest responses has been: \u201cYou\u2019re shorter than I expected.\u201d Here, too, the reverence is striking. When questions are opened to the floor, someone identifying himself as \u201cEddie from Ireland\u201d tells Springsteen: \u201cSuch is the affection that the people of Ireland have for you, that if you ran for president of Ireland in the morning, you\u2019d be elected.\u201d When the event winds up, a throng of middle-aged men gathers at the front of the stage to get their copies of <em>Born to Run</em> signed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Trump\u2019s case, the facade is easy to see through, and what you see is a bundle of anxiety, fragility and insecurity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a pretty decent book, in a genre \u2013 the rock autobiography \u2013 replete with stinkers. (But then, you\u2019d hope it would be a pretty decent book given that Springsteen was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/05/bruce-springsteens-born-to-run-races-to-top-of-book-charts\">reportedly paid $10m</a> to write it.) It deserves to have topped the bestseller lists on both sides of the Atlantic, for its honesty about Springsteen\u2019s difficult childhood, his troubled relationship with his father, his struggles with depression, and his unyielding faith in the redemptive power of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. He writes about the first time depression struck, in the early 1980s, in a way that resonates powerfully: he is on a road trip with a friend, stopping at a small-town fair, when, \u201cFrom nowhere, a despair overcomes me; I feel an envy of these men and women and their late summer ritual, the small pleasures that bind them and this town together. Now, for all I know these folks may hate this one-dog dump and each other\u2019s guts and be screwing one another\u2019s husbands and wives like rabbits. Why wouldn\u2019t they? But right now, all I can think of is that I want to be amongst them, of them, and I can\u2019t. I can only watch.\u201d</p> <p>That depression still haunts him, fended off by performing \u2013 in the book he talks of being \u201ccrushed between 60 and 62, good for a year, and out again from 63 to 64\u201d \u2013 and I want to ask what his favoured antidepressant is, whether Sertraline (Zoloft in the States) performed the miracles for him it did for me. But there doesn\u2019t really seem to be a good way to ask about a hero\u2019s pill regimen.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It\u2019s less than a month, when we speak, before the US elections, and Springsteen is getting increasingly confident that Donald Trump won\u2019t win. He\u2019s no less scathing about the Republican candidate for that confidence, though. We talk about the contrast between the American ideal of masculinity \u2013 generous, confident, empathetic, determined; the one you think of when you imagine the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d who fought in the second world war \u2013 and the one Trump presents. He laughs at the difference. \u201cIn Trump\u2019s case, the facade is easy to see through, and what you see is a bundle of anxiety, fragility and insecurity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the thinnest possible mask of masculinity. And it wouldn\u2019t fool anybody from the Greatest Generation.\u201d There\u2019s a faint hesitation around his use of those words, as if acknowledging that not everyone who fought in the war, including his father, was necessarily great. \u201cIt\u2019s such a thin costume that for me it doesn\u2019t hold for a moment. But there have been quite a few people he has attracted along the way, so I suppose the bluster works to a certain degree. He\u2019s really quite an embarrassment if you\u2019re from the USA. It\u2019s simply the most rigid and thinnest veil of masculinity over a mess.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JygWoIeW224\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JygWoIeW224?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JygWoIeW224\">Watch Bruce Springsteen campaign for Barack Obama in 2012.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Springsteen notes that he\u2019s been asked about Trump a lot as he\u2019s promoted his book. And, despite a reputation for political engagement, he\u2019s evidently a little tired of it. In fact, he\u2019s been relatively quiet this election. Though he appeared at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/nov/06/bruce-springsteen-barack-obama-video\">campaign events for both Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/03/uselections2004.arts\">John Kerry</a>, he hasn\u2019t stumped for Hillary Clinton. His most notable piece of activism this year came in April when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/08/bruce-springsteen-cancels-north-carolina-concert-lgbt-discrimination-law\">pulled out of a show in North Carolina</a> in protest at the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom law\u201d, dictating which public toilets transgender people could use: \u201cTo my mind, it\u2019s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognising the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress,\u201d he wrote on his website at the time.</p> <p>His politics are simple, and basically non-partisan. When he\u2019s used his voice it has tended to be to support specific causes \u2013 his tours have supported food banks in cities where he\u2019s played; he went on Amnesty International\u2019s Human Rights Now! tour in 1988; he donated \u00a316,000 to Durham miners during the 1985 miners\u2019 strike. In song, he has returned repeatedly \u2013 not just in Born in the USA \u2013 to the plight of America\u2019s Vietnam veterans.</p> <p>He believes in fairness, people being treated decently, the right to a job, medical treatment, education, decent housing, childcare, and open government. He once surprised an interviewer by observing: \u201cTo me, these are all conservative ideas\u2026 Economic stability. Health. That\u2019s not remotely radical.\u201d</p> <p>Arguably the biggest influence on his politics was his manager, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Landau\">Jon Landau</a>, the former music writer whom he met when he was studying a gig review pinned up outside a Boston club before his appearance in April 1974. Landau, the review\u2019s writer, sidled up and asked the young musician what he thought. Thus began a friendship that transformed into a professional relationship, and something more: in <em>Born to Run</em>, Springsteen speaks of him being \u201cthe Clark to my Lewis\u201d. It\u2019s not so much that Landau told Springsteen what to think, more that he guided him to the books and films that might provoke him to think.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mother was decent, compassionate, strong, wilful. The best part of me picked up a lot of those characteristics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the binds of that, though, is the number of heartland American fans \u2013 the ones who are voting Trump \u2013 who believe Springsteen would think like them if only, as one contributor to the <a href=\"http://www.backstreets.com\">Backstreets fansite</a> recently suggested, he hadn\u2019t been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d into liberalism by Landau and others in his inner circle. On the other hand, there are those who think it outrageous that someone whose songs display an extraordinary empathy for ordinary people should dare to have homes in New Jersey, Florida and Los Angeles, and charge \u00a3100 per ticket to see him (the guarantee he demands from promoters for live shows is reputed to be among the largest in music; certainly, I received no reply from Landau last year when I wrote offering a guaranteed \u00a3700 and a lift down from London in my Ford Focus if Springsteen fancied playing a solo set at Ramsgate Music Hall).</p> <p>For Springsteen, politics seems to be about the way you live your life as much as anything. It\u2019s about being decent. About being fair to others. Being a good man. So what does being a good man entail?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big question,\u201d</p> <p>It is.</p> <p>\u201cI guess, really\u2026 I probably learned the best answers to that from my mother. My mother was basically decent, compassionate, strong, wilful. She insisted on creating a world where she could make her children feel as safe as possible, even though she certainly had her faults in that area. But she was consistent. You could count on her. Day after day after day. And she was very strong. The best part of me picked up a lot of those characteristics and I struggle to live up to them today.

He spent a chunk of it in the early 1950s living in Freehold with a paternal grandmother who loved him too much, compensating for the death of her daughter in 1927 (\u201cIt was very emotionally incestuous and a lot of parental roles got crossed,\u201d he told the writer Peter Ames Carlin); school was cruel, his father Doug \u2013 consumed by an often silent rage against the world, and against the son who mystified him \u2013 crueller still, emotionally at least.</p> <p><em>Born to Run</em> paints a picture of a childhood that is semi-feral, where Springsteen might refuse to go to school, and his grandmother would back him up. \u201cI think I was a little unusual in that I went into rock\u2019n\u2019roll music to create order out of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cMy younger life felt rather chaotic, so I was in search of some stability, actually, some order.\u201d</p> <p>As a kid, he felt invisible. That stopped when he started playing guitar. \u201cSuddenly I was able to make a very loud noise, and a noise that was not so easy to ignore,\u201d he says. \u201cI had my little rock\u2019n\u2019roll band and we were playing to a small gym full of dancers and their friends, and they immediately looked at you as a presence in their lives.\u201d</p> <p>When he was 19 his parents moved to California, and he was free to pursue music, to become \u2013 as he would say on stage years later \u2013 a \u201cprisoner\u2026 a prisoner of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d.</p> <p>Politics started entering Springsteen\u2019s music, though far from explicitly, with his fourth album, <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>, in 1978. That was when his music ceased to be the myth-making epics of his first three albums, and he started writing instead about ordinary people and their struggles. He wasn\u2019t informed by reading political tracts. \u201cI just referred to my experiences growing up \u2013 my parents\u2019 lives, my sister\u2019s life.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVQUeCi9V0s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HVQUeCi9V0s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVQUeCi9V0s\">Watch a trailer for the documentary Springsteen &amp; I</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>His parents had struggled to make ends meet, his mother working as a legal secretary, his father in a succession of blue-collar jobs. His sister had married in her teens, and she and her husband\u2019s travails inspired his masterly song <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-bruce-springsteen-songs-of-all-time-20140116/the-river-19691231\">The River</a>, about a couple trying to face up to the wedge that joblessness drives into relationships. \u201cI was surrounded by people who were youthful but living very complicated adult lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were having kids at young ages and trying to build a work life and a home life that was very adult. It was very easy to draw upon. It wasn\u2019t a stretch or a strain.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The songs about ordinary lives \u2013 combined with Springsteen\u2019s revelatory, ecstatic live performances \u2013 built the bond with his audience that has lasted more than 40 years, and itself became the subject of an extraordinarily moving film in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVQUeCi9V0s\"><em>Springsteen &amp; I</em></a>. I don\u2019t think he takes that relationship for granted. He understands that people want a piece of him for themselves: at that BFI Southbank event in 2010, Springsteen came to the bar afterwards; while his entourage sat in the corner, talking to one another, he perched on the back of a sofa facing the room. A receiving line of people queueing for a photo and autograph formed, and he stayed until everyone had their moment (my photo was out of focus; I got the autograph for my sister).</p> <p>People think they know Springsteen. They have an image of Bob Dylan (inscrutable), Neil Young (irascible), Paul McCartney (wearingly cheerful; Springsteen laughs when I use the old <em>Smash Hits</em> name of Fab Wacky Macca Thumbs Aloft). But they can imagine watching sports in a bar with Springsteen, which perhaps accounts for why people get a bit overexcited \u2013 I do not excuse myself from this \u2013 at the prospect of meeting him (fan accounts of encounters almost always dwell, approvingly, on what an ordinary guy he is. Even if he is shorter than expected).</p> <p>They think they know Springsteen because, these days, he\u2019s as much an idea, an ideal, as a person.</p> <p>\u201cSure, that\u2019s true,\u201d he says, of that notion. \u201cYou bring with you an entire philosophy, a certain code of living, I suppose. It\u2019s something you pursue. My heroes were people like Frank Sinatra, Hank Williams, Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan. These were all people who brought their entire philosophy along with them, created a world that would engulf you and give you you, assist you in different ways of living, different ways of presenting yourself. Those were the artists that always interested me. They always seemed to carry a realisation of what being a musician might mean, could mean, the possibilities of what being a musician could be. That was something I was at least semiconscious of trying to create.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e630be2f6f38efbccde3f958ea494014bd92523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e630be2f6f38efbccde3f958ea494014bd92523/0_0_3000_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Springsteen performing with his wife, Patti Scialfa, in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Springsteen performing with his wife, Patti Scialfa, in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KMazur/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And when did he realise he had become an idea in the minds of his public?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. If you\u2019re doing it right, it\u2019s a byproduct of all your actions and all your choices and what you\u2019ve created.\u201d</p> <p>It should be noted at this point that Springsteen appears to know exactly what he thinks about every aspect of his life and art and how they interact. I guess that\u2019s inevitable. First, he\u2019s just written a 500-page book about those subjects; second, he\u2019s been in therapy for decades; third, he and Landau based their entire relationship on talking at exhaustive length about all this stuff. But, for an interviewer, it\u2019s a bit odd. The most fascinating moments in interviews usually come when you catch a subject by surprise and you can see them deciding what they think about something. With Springsteen, it feels more like he\u2019s searching through his mental hard drive for the relevant file.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My life was changed in an instant by something that people thought was  junk \u2013 pop music records</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say his answers are not fascinating (they are) or cursory (they very much are not). When asked what he means when he says his covenant with his audience depends on honesty, he replies without pause, without any errs or urrms, in a single perfect paragraph, that requires not one piece of tidying in the transcription: \u201cI guess we come out and deliver the straight dope to our crowd as best we can. It\u2019s coming on stage with the idea: OK, well the stakes that are involved this evening are quite high. I don\u2019t know exactly who\u2019s in the crowd. But I know that my life was changed in an instant by something that people thought was purely junk \u2013 pop music records. And you can change someone\u2019s life in three minutes with the right song. I still believe that to this day. You can bend the course of their development, what they think is important, of how vital and alive they feel. You can contextualise very, very difficult experiences. Songs are pretty good at that. So all these are the stakes that are laid out on the table when you come out at night. And I still take those stakes seriously after all that time, if not more so now, as the light grows slightly dimmer. I come out believing there\u2019s no tomorrow night, there wasn\u2019t last night, there\u2019s just tonight. And I have built up the skills to be able to provide, under the right conditions, a certain transcendent evening, hopefully an evening you\u2019ll remember when you go home. Not that you\u2019ll just remember it was a good concert, but you\u2019ll remember the possibilities the evening laid out in front of you, as far as where you could take your life, or how you\u2019re thinking about your friends, or your wife or your girlfriend, or your best pal, or your job, your work, what you want to do with your life. These are all things, I believe, that music can accommodate and can provide service in. That\u2019s what we try to deliver.\u201d</p> <p>I email that paragraph to a Springsteen obsessive friend, who <a href=\"https://www.burgersandbruce.com\">blogs</a> about both Springsteen and burgers. She writes back: \u201cIt sounds silly, and I try to explain to people, but going to Springsteen shows has shaped a lot of changes in my life. I went to South Africa for a week on my own for four concerts, felt revived, like I could achieve anything. So I left my job and tried to get into journalism, something I\u2019d wanted to do since I was 10. And that\u2019s why I feel like I have to go to Australia [to see Springsteen next year], too, because I need to find that direction again. It\u2019s a funny way to live your life, seeking these highs, living the lows, but ultimately I think I\u2019m better off for it. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without his music in my life.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_91hNV6vuBY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_91hNV6vuBY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_91hNV6vuBY\">Watch the video for Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Tougher Than the Rest</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I ask Springsteen if he ever looks at fansites and messageboards.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d (I bet he does.

They should be grateful!</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t reply. He just laughs long and hard, his head back, his eyes creasing.</p> <p>***</p> <p>On 5 June this year, as the sun set over Wembley Stadium, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band struck up the sombre opening chords of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_91hNV6vuBY\">Tougher Than the Rest</a>, the 1987 single about the difficulties of adult love that marked his return after <em>Born in the USA</em> had made him the world\u2019s biggest rock star. Stepping up to the front of the stage to duet with him was Patti Scialfa, a member of the E Street Band since 1984, and his second wife \u2013 his first marriage, to Julianne Phillips, ended quickly (in <em>Born to Run</em>, Springsteen admits he was wholly unready for it). Three days after performing what might as well be their theme song, Scialfa and Springsteen marked their 25th wedding anniversary.</p> <p>Her presence changed not just Springsteen\u2019s life but his work, too. The E Street Band stopped being an all-male preserve, a gang, forcing a change in their behaviour and attitudes. \u201cI think women are in general a good influence on growing up, on growing into your manhood,\u201d he says, delicately.</p> <p>And then when they had children \u2013 two sons, Evan and Sam, born in 1990 and 1994, and a daughter, Jessica, in 1991 \u2013 his life was altered even more profoundly. \u201cIf I was going to chop my life into sections,\u201d he says, \u201cit would be before the children and after the children, certainly. Just changed my entire worldview. Changed the way I looked at myself. Changed the way I looked at my job. Gave me an entirely separate identity away from my music, which I found to be very fulfilling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d26f822bbbee5d56059c7351a96d50cba028a296\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26f822bbbee5d56059c7351a96d50cba028a296/0_0_689_1024/673.jpg\" alt=\"Springsteen in concert in 1984\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Springsteen performing in 1984, the year Born in the USA took him to new commercial heights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Images Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before he had children, Springsteen had assumed that whatever he was working on was what everyone around him should be concentrating on. He recalls his bafflement when Jon Landau had his first child, and would suddenly start leaving recording sessions at 6pm, to go and bathe his baby daughter. \u201cI remember thinking\u2026\u201d he adopts a puzzled tone, \u201cYou gotta go home and bathe your daughter? We\u2019re doing A, B, C or D, which I happen to think is the most important thing in the world right now. But of course it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>Having children made Springsteen realise that his work wasn\u2019t his life, it was a substitute for life. \u201cI realised that previously I\u2019d expanded my work life so that I\u2019d have something to do during the day, and into the evening. Without it, what am I gonna do? Go home, sit in a chair and watch TV? So I\u2019d expanded the time it took me to do my job. Once the kids came along, I realised, I could squeeze my previous 18 hours of work day into six or eight, without any problems whatsoever. I realised the song is always going to be there \u2013 there\u2019s always going to be a song in your heart or in your head \u2013 but kids, they\u2019re there and then they\u2019re gone. And when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re <em>gone</em>. Once I realised that, I found a tremendous freedom from the tyranny of my own mind.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I still have pride in what I do. I still believe in its power. I believe in my ability to transfer its power to you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You couldn\u2019t say that Springsteen has slowed down, though, especially now the kids are gone. This summer\u2019s tour of European and US stadiums saw him playing some of his longest ever shows, breaking the four-hour barrier \u2013 with no intermissions, unlike his late-70s marathons \u2013 on occasion. Springsteen says he has no problems finding the energy to play them, but it\u2019s not so easy for some of his bandmates. Before Springsteen arrives, his co-manager <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6406640/barbara-carr-interview-bruce-springsteen-landau-management\">Barbara Carr</a> mentions that <a href=\"http://maxweinberg.com\">Max Weinberg</a>, the 65-year-old drummer, spends all his time between shows sequestered in his hotel room, the windows blacked out, the gaps between door and frame filled to block out all noise, simply recuperating from the previous gig.</p> <p>That\u2019s the price the band must pay in order to deliver what Springsteen wants: \u201cI come out on stage to deliver to you the greatest band in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have great pride in what I do. I still believe in its power. I believe in my ability to transfer its power to you. That\u2019s never changed. One of the things our band was very good at communicating was that sense of joy, which I think makes us somewhat unique. Rock bands try to project a lot of different things: intensity, mystery, sexuality, cool. Not a lot of rock bands concentrate on joy, and I got that from my relatives on the Italian side \u2013 they lived it and they passed it down to me.\u201d</p> <p>The ambition that drove him to chase perfection 40 years ago \u2013 when he would spend hours shouting \u201cStick!\u201d at Weinberg in the studio, insisting he somehow find a way to play his snare without the sound of stick hitting the skin being audible \u2013 is still present.</p> <p>I ask if, for all his testimonies to the simple power of playing rock\u2019n\u2019roll, and how he says he\u2019s happy pitching up for an impromptu set at a local bar with a pick-up band, whether he would have been content if he\u2019d ended up precisely as popular as his friends and contemporaries Southside Johnny and Joe Grushecky, blue-collar rockers who never transcended the clubs. \u201cI would probably be an old, disgruntled entertainer,\u201d he says, then chuckles at the very notion that he might not have conquered the world. \u201cI was shooting for the whole show. But I certainly would have made my peace with it. Any time you make your living as a musician, you\u2019re way ahead of the game. You\u2019re <em>way</em> ahead of the game. I always thought: Gee, I\u2019m making a living scratching on a piece of wood. I can\u2019t complain too much.\u201d</p> <p>In 1975, when he was promoting the <em>Born to Run</em> album, there was a story Springsteen used to tell interviewers. While he was recording the album in New York, he was staying in a grotty outpost of Holiday Inn, in one of Manhattan\u2019s less salubrious districts. In his room was a mirror, which hung crooked. Every morning he would dutifully straighten the mirror. And when he returned to his room, the mirror would be askew again. And so, once more, he\u2019d correct it. And again it would slip off centre.</p> <p>It is, I suggest, a perfect metaphor for a man driven, even when the reasons for his drive, his desperation, might seem unclear to those around him. He smiles. And, rather unexpectedly, quotes Immanuel Kant back at me: \u201cOut of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.\u201d</p> <p>And then the door opens, and he glides away, no obstacles in his path.</p> <p><em>Born to Run is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/born-to-run-464799.html\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316.40</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://play.spotify.com/user/guardianmusic/playlist/0tUxgJGl8R45UCt9EH4xDL\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:0tUxgJGl8R45UCt9EH4xDL\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Bruce\u2019s backpages: the songs that define Springsteen</h2> <p><strong>Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)</strong><br><strong>1973</strong><br>A showstopping, Van Morrisonesque epic that\u2019s still a highlight of Springsteen\u2019s live shows, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYHGh6lmSbo\">Rosalita</a> sprawls and swerves and swings, irresistibly.

Play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxuThNgl3YA\">Born to Run</a> and it just allows more people in. I\u2019ll see a 15-year-old kid singing every word, and I\u2019ll see a grandma too!

I never wanted to have to come out on stage and pretend. Of course, it\u2019s all pretending, I suppose. But I wanted to feel comfortable in my own skin.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The River</strong><br><strong>1980</strong><br>In growing up, Springsteen says, \u201cyou have to come face to face with a lot of your weaknesses and the things you do poorly, so that you\u2019re able to assess the landscape and find out what are the righteous paths you can travel down, and what are the roads that are just going to lead you to a dead end. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utVR3EgQkHs\">The River</a>, of course, is the song I wrote about that specific idea.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Born in the USA</strong><br><strong>1982</strong><br>The acoustic version recorded at the time of the Nebraska album allows none of the ambiguity of the stadium-crushing version released two years later.

  "<p>I\u2019m old enough to remember a life in which you could confidently expect your skill for guessing passwords to be redundant by about the age of nine. That was when your mate down the road finally overcame his love of spy games and his obsessive desire not to allow you past his front door or into his garden shed without you first establishing his favourite crisp flavour. Unfortunately, however, it seems that mate, who subsequently spent his lunch hours in the school\u2019s windowless computer room, up to his knees in punch cards, has long since taken over the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/20/banks-online-security-is-failing-customers-says-which\">Banks' online security is failing customers, says Which?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week, I again found myself in that familiar circle of hell reserved for tired and impatient and forgetful people very close to a deadline. I had already spent way too long trying to remember that week\u2019s combination of password and user name in order to enter a Gmail account \u2013 my Gmail account \u2013 which I was unaccountably excluded from and to which I needed access in order to open a document that I had to rewrite. Having finally come up with the password \u2013 complete with recent mutations of ampersands and exclamation marks and upper and lower case letters and barnacles of numeric additions (first phone number? gym locker combo?) once created on a cheerful whim and now half-forgotten at painful leisure \u2013 I was faced with an unexpected conundrum. Six blurred photographs of street scenes flashed up on my screen along with this unwarranted question: \u201cWhich of these images contains a shopfront?\u201d</p> <p>Google\u2019s virtual jobsworth of a security guard clearly wanted to know who exactly it was dealing with (and to collect some more free data for its picture-recognition software). Was I a robot mind myself, intent on hoovering up barnacled passwords? Or was I indeed a tired and impatient and forgetful human being very close to a deadline? In the past, I guess, one or two goes at a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/24/captcha-graffiti-tests-if_n_584016.html\" title=\"\">Captcha graffiti</a> might have sufficed, but as machine intelligence has become smarter, a more nuanced capacity was apparently required to establish my human credentials. We might not be good for much these days in Google\u2019s eyes, but we can certainly recognise a shopfront when we see one.</p> <p>I peered at the photographs on the screen, as if they were exhibits in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/20/william-eggleston-portraits-review-momentous-trivial-marvellous\" title=\"\">William Eggleston</a> show. Some of them were straightforward enough, but one or two undeniably gave me pause. In the background of one picture in particular some warehouse type buildings clearly had floor-to-ceiling glazing but no obvious signage. What to do? Surely the creators of this test wouldn\u2019t expect this level of pictorial analysis \u2013 or perhaps that was exactly what they required? If I looked really hard at a certain angle I thought I could make out some shadowy furniture in the window of the warehouse in question. But still it looked more like some kind of out-of-town storage facility than a conventional shop. Taking my life in my hands, I plumped for the \u201cx\u201d indicating \u201cno\u201d and pressed enter. Another six images flashed up, no less complex in their composition than the first set. And again the question: \u201cWhich of these images contains a shopfront?\u201d And so the morning ebbed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even for the man who is credited with creating the 'user name and password' protocol, the tool has become a curse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A couple of years ago, I visited the headquarters of Google in Palo Alto and talked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/19/google-search-knowledge-graph-singhal-interview\" title=\"\">Amit Singhal, </a>then head of search, about his vision for the future of our interaction with our uncanny machines. He suggested that the ultimate goal was really something like what you saw in the <em>Star Trek</em> episodes he grew up watching in a village in India. He imagined a near future in which the interface between man and computer would be entirely intuitive and transparent.</p> <p>\u201cThe endgame of this is we want to make it always as natural a thought process as possible,\u201d Singhal said. \u201cWe are maniacally focusing on the user to reduce every possible friction point between them, their thoughts and the information they want to find.\u201d I thought of that conversation when I was at San Francisco airport later that day, trying to summon a booking confirmation on my phone and faced with the need to first answer the following questions that might have been posed by my mate up the road: \u201cWho was your favourite teacher at school?\u201d and \u201cWhat was the first album you bought?\u201d Frictionless wasn\u2019t the first word that came to mind.</p> <p>In a recent survey of European workers using IT in their jobs, it was suggested that they spend about 36 minutes a day on \u201clogin events\u201d. A number that prompts the thought: they must have got lucky. Over the past decade or two of our digital lives, each of us has built up an average legacy of more than 100 sites and apps requiring passwords for access. As the fraudsters and hackers have got more skilled, so the bar for entry has been set ever higher. The recent added complication that on a \u201cpassword change event\u201d you cannot choose a password you have used in the past 12 months is another cruel blow to our garbled private mnemonics. In the past year, 55% of people admit to abandoning a login due to a forgotten password and about the same number suggested they had given up on paying for something they wanted to buy online because of the complications of the authentication&#xa0;process.</p> <p>Even for the man who is credited with creating the \u201cuser name and password\u201d protocol, the tool has become a curse. That man is an emeritus professor of MIT, Fernando Corbat\u00f3, now aged 90. In the early 60s, Corbat\u00f3 was in charge of a massive prototype time-sharing computer at the university called CTSS. The computer was the pioneer of many of the features of digital technology we have come to love \u2013 email, instant messaging \u2013 and one that we do not. Because of the shared nature of CTSS it was decided that researchers should have their own accounts so that their work did not overlap. A simple name and password code was devised to create a degree of privacy.</p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/05/21/the-man-behind-the-first-computer-password-its-become-a-nightmare/\" title=\"\">Corbat\u00f3 gave an interview</a> to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in which he acknowledged that he had inadvertently made a \u201csorry that password has not been recognised\u201d monster. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s become a kind of a nightmare with the world wide web,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can possibly remember all the passwords that are issued or set up. That leaves people with two choices. Either you maintain a crib sheet, a mild no-no, or you use some sort of program as a password manager.\u201d</p> <p>What did Mr Corbat\u00f3 do? the <em>WSJ</em> wondered.</p> <p>\u201cI have to confess, I used to use a crib sheet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m guarding any great secrets. Three typed pages.&#xa0;Probably 150 passwords over the&#xa0;years.\u201d</p> <p>This 50-year-old technology has long been showing its age \u2013 despite the levels of complexity there are major password breaches reported weekly \u2013 but it has proved hard to replace. Currently, there are many companies competing to create a new form of universal open sesame that will make all those password reminders redundant. Google, Facebook and Apple are inevitably leading this effort, though many businesses are reluctant to hand over their authentication processes to the data-loving giant, which gives an opportunity to innovative companies with a focus only on security.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gigya.com/\" title=\"\">Gigya</a>, based in Palo Alto, provides a platform that manages 1.4bn user identities globally for customers including banks, retailers and the BBC. Most of the login processes they manage are still password-based, but more and more use a form of \u201csocial registration\u201d \u2013 \u201cCan we use your Facebook or Google details to find out who you are?\u201d \u2013 and some use biometric gateways: fingerprints, facial and voice recognition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/04/gmail-yahoo-email-password-hack-hold-security\">Hacker collects 272m email addresses and passwords, some from Gmail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Lack, director of sales, expects this latter category to grow exponentially in the next five years. In its somewhat polemical report on the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.gigya.com/resource/whitepaper/death-of-the-password/\" title=\"\">death of the password</a>\u201d (a demise predicted more often than that of the English novel), Gigya suggested that \u201cmore than 770m biometric-enabled applications will be downloaded each year by 2019, as compared with 6m in&#xa0;2015\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe do all hope the password dies quite soon,\u201d Lack says. \u201cAnd the research supports the fact that most consumers hope that too \u2013 52% would rather have biometric security.\u201d (And, as we all now know, 52% these days means that the people have spoken in unprecedented numbers: biometric means biometric). \u201cA few banks are starting to use it,\u201d Lack says. \u201cHSBC and First Direct are allowing touch ID to log into your account and also some voice recognition. But for the better part we are still using complex&#xa0;passwords.\u201d</p> <p>Where does the resistance lie?</p> <p>\u201cI think security is the drag anchor,\u201d Lack suggests. \u201cWith most of our customers there is usually a security team that is extremely anxious about adopting new technology. The irony is that, as we know, passwords are far from secure now. The average user has fewer than three passwords and those can very often be easily guessed. They use them on average across 120 online accounts. If a password is guessed on one, then effectively a hacker can completely unlock your digital life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17dd2187c2a0eb0c8bdc79f85e8b7537b220df20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17dd2187c2a0eb0c8bdc79f85e8b7537b220df20/0_473_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hand reaches for a login password\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Every year millions of internet passwords are stolen or hacked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Brunner/Getty Images/Imagebroker RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A couple of recent changes may accelerate the march of biometrics. The new<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/finance/payments/framework/index_en.htm\" title=\"\"> European directive on payment services mandates </a>that any online payment will require two-factor authentication (usually password plus SMS code), though lobbyists for retailers are currently challenging that. The other engine of change is the fact that two years ago the Apple touch recognition interface was made available to anyone who wants to use it. The first adopters have been banks because they have huge costs on call centres, specifically for password resets. \u201cTouch is anyway far more secure than anything that has gone before,\u201d Lack argues. \u201cWe expect all banks to adopt biometrics in the next couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>The other advance is in using network effects for identity management \u2013 a pooling of your identity data: \u201cOn the horizon is the capacity that when security is breached in one place the network immediately knows about it,\u201d Lack says. \u201cIt\u2019s like an immune response. Where one customer detects that I have had three failed password attempts it notifies everyone else in the cloud and says this user needs to step up authentication or have their account locked. That\u2019s a massive benefit for security teams. That will drag them toward cloud-based security and biometric authentication.\u201d</p> <p>It does sound like a major step forward for security teams, if somewhat less so for users who will presumably suddenly be shut out from their online lives, although perhaps only until they have swiped a finger.</p> <p>The company <a href=\"https://www.threatmetrix.com/\" title=\"\">ThreatMetrix</a> has been working in this latter area for a decade and 30,000 websites and apps use its technology, which is invisible to the customer. Its solutions director, Stephen Moody, says: \u201cThe challenge is that you can\u2019t really have a central store of biometric data because of the privacy implications. It needs to remain anonymous. In our view, the key additional security measure you need is what we call \u2018ongoing behavioural analysis\u2019, which secures all the weak points in registration.\u201d</p> <p>To this end, ThreatMetrix has built an anonymised network called the \u201cdigital identity network\u201d, which already sits on websites and mobile apps and is enabled by cookies. This network monitors every account transaction you make, anonymously. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who you are but we tokenise various aspects of your behaviour and we correlate that together,\u201d Moody says.</p> <p>What kind of aspects of behaviour?</p> <p>\u201cSimple things. For example, when I go about the internet I use several devices. Maybe a couple of laptops, two phones, and I tend to use these machines to connect to the internet in different ways and from different locations. I have a VPN at work, I have Sky broadband at home. So over time I have a clear pattern of behaviour. Do I tend to have flash-enabled or is it turned off? The system looks at all that and correlates it with my different email addresses for example, work and home, the credit cards I have associated with those accounts and so on. Every time we see an event, we are saying, \u2018Does this interaction look consistent with what we know of this person\u2019s behaviour? Do you usually log on to your bank account in this way from this location?\u2019 If you do, you get a positive trust score. If not, there will be an alert.\u201d Over time, your anonymous security profile will only get stronger, Moody suggests, making it easier and easier to know for sure it is you doing what you are doing.</p> <p>Phil Dunkelberger is the CEO of a company called <a href=\"https://www.noknok.com/\" title=\"\">Nok Nok</a>. Speaking on the phone from California, he inevitably asks me: \u201cIf I say Nok Nok, you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I reply dutifully.</p> <p>Nok Nok has added an extra twist to these future scenarios. It is Dunkelberger\u2019s belief that your phone will increasingly become your gateway to much of the internet. If you have it on your person and you are biometrically logged in, that will be enough to enable forms of access without password issues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cbdfdde134ab6d0ada1510b3ce107e84442422a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbdfdde134ab6d0ada1510b3ce107e84442422a6/51_0_702_878/400.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Fernando Corbato\u0301, father of the password.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Fernando Corbato\u0301, father of the password.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of the companies we work with allows you to use your phone to open the electronic lock as you move inside the perimeter of the building they have \u2018geo-fenced\u2019. You don\u2019t have to log in to anything, as long as you have your phone with you. It logs you in to machines, the assembly line. You have a strong authenticator. The biometric is the phone itself. If at any point the system suggests it doesn\u2019t think it is you, it can prompt you to swipe your finger. It\u2019s like keeping your front door keys with you.\u201d</p> <p>The other most requested service Nok Nok has is for face or \u201cselfie recognition\u201d, says Dunkelberger, \u201cpartly because the whole world is selfie mad\u201d. The technology has overcome the teething problem of people bypassing the security test by simply holding up a photograph of a face for recognition access. \u201cWe have this thing we call liveness,\u201d Dunkelberger says. \u201cYou are asked to blink your eyes and nod your head and the software can read that. It works well in good lighting. It\u2019s more challenging in a shadowy area, but the cameras are getting better. That is coming. Yesterday on the east coast I was in five places that were asking, \u2018When can we have picture modality?\u2019\u201d The answer, he says, was soon.</p> <p>In the meantime, we are left with the last knockings of passwords that accumulate their unusual characters by the day.

  "<p>It\u2019s that time of year again. Apple has released its results for the fiscal quarter ended 24 September 2016 and we are immediately plunged into \u201cHas Apple peaked?\u201d speculation. How come? Well, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results.html\" title=\"\">the company posted</a> quarterly revenue of $46.9bn and net income of $9bn. Not bad, eh? Ah, yes, but not if you\u2019re a Wall Street analyst, because these numbers compare to revenue of $51.5bn and net income of $11.1bn in the same quarter the year before. And \u2013 shock, horror! \u2013 the company\u2019s gross margin was only 38% compared to 39.9% a year ago. The numbers are <em>down</em>, in other words.</p> <p>Cue fevered speculation about the fate of the company. The numbers, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/10/25/ask-matt-has-apple-peaked/92742092/\" title=\"\">burbled one analyst</a>, show \u201cthe danger of being a one-trick pony when everyone already owns a pony. The company\u2019s reliance on the smartphone, which is now a mature and saturated market in the developed world, is starting to create a growth problem for Apple. Breaking through will be a challenge, reminding investors Apple\u2019s fundamentals and stock price have&#xa0;peaked.\u201d</p> <p>Pause for a reality check: Apple has cash reserves of $237.6bn, up $32bn from last year. At $622bn (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL\" title=\"\">at 26 October 2016</a>), it is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization\" title=\"\">the most valuable company in the world</a>. For comparison, Exxon Mobil is worth a mere $361bn (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=XOM\" title=\"\">at 26 October 2016</a>). In the quarter under discussion, <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/25/earnings-4q-2016\" title=\"\">Apple sold</a> 45.5m iPhones, 9.3m iPads and 4.9m Mac (desktop and laptop) computers. By any reasonable standard, this is the record of a truly formidable corporation. But because 2016 marks the first full-year revenue decline for Apple since 2001, the Wall Street guys are in a lather.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/oct/26/imagination-technologies-falls-after-apple-results\">Imagination Technologies falls after Apple results</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This neuroticism tells us two useful things. The first is that capitalism is an inherently unstable system: like a Ponzi scheme, it has to keep growing. The pressure for continual growth is particularly fierce on tech companies, because investors have become accustomed to exponential rates of growth in such outfits. Apple gets off a bit lighter than companies such as Google and Facebook because it actually makes real things \u2013 phones, tablets, computers \u2013 which require vast engineering and manufacturing&#xa0;resources.</p> <p>Just consider: Apple manufactures about a million iPhones a day, every one of which is sculpted to <a href=\"http://atomicdelights.com/blog/why-your-next-iphone-wont-be-ceramic\" title=\"\">10 micron tolerances</a> from a single block of aluminium, as is every Mac, iPad and Apple Watch. This explains why Apple is the world\u2019s largest owner of CNC (computer numerical control) milling machines and swiss-style lathes. It also explains why Apple can\u2019t grow at the rate that Facebook can add users. Scaling up with software is easy \u2013 you just add more servers. Scaling up with physical manufacturing is much harder&#xa0;to do.</p> <p>The other inference to be drawn from the neuroticism about Apple\u2019s results is that there is something about the company that causes perfectly sane people \u2013 analysts and investors, as well as customers and tech bloggers \u2013 to lose their marbles. There is a whole blogging ecosystem devoted to whispers, rumours and theories about every aspect of Apple\u2019s activities, an&#xa0;ecosystem that provides an army of what Lenin would have called \u201cuseful idiots\u201d for the company. An illustration was <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-7-will-be-boring-2016-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">the prediction</a> that the iPhone&#xa0;7 was going to be boring. \u201cIf early leaks are to be believed,\u201d it raved, \u201cand they\u2019re too numerous and too consistent to not believe a lot of what\u2019s floating around out there, then this year\u2019s iPhone 7 won\u2019t be a major departure from last year\u2019s iPhone 6s.\u201d Then Apple came out with the dual-camera iPhone 7s, which was anything but boring \u2013 at least to affluent photographers \u2013 thereby exceeding the depressed expectation.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just tech bloggers who are in thrall to the Apple brand. So, too, is a sovereign state, namely the Republic of Ireland. Recently, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\" title=\"\">EU ordered Apple to pay the republic</a> \u20ac13bn in back taxes after the European commission ruled that the company had enjoyed illegal tax breaks from the government over many years. For a small country, \u20ac13bn is a lot of dosh \u2013 it would probably keep the cash-starved Irish health service going for a year. Apple is, naturally, going to appeal against the ruling. But \u2013 guess what? \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/irish-government-appeal-against-apple-13bn-tax-bill-european-commission\" title=\"\">so is the Irish government</a>: it has declared its intention to stand shoulder to shoulder with the company and argue that it doesn\u2019t want the money. It seems that the EU ruling \u201cthreatens the integrity of Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax regime and could jeopardise inflows of foreign direct investment\u201d.</p> <p>So, in the networked world, exercising sovereignty comes down to being nice to Apple. Note to Brexiters: this might be relevant to you.</p>",
  "<p>After a faltering first scene or two, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/05/theatre4\">Tony Kushner</a>\u2019s new play becomes one of the most absorbing dramas on the London stage. <em>The Intelligent Homosexual\u2019s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures</em>, or<em> iHo</em><strong>, </strong>is a giant, fiercely argued investigation of American family life and leftwing politics. The title tips its hat to Bernard Shaw. The profession of its paterfamilias \u2013 he is a retired longshoreman \u2013 nods at Arthur Miller\u2019s <em>A View From the Bridge</em>. Debates race through the dialogue: forensic, but firmly rooted in character. They touch on Italian anarcho-communists, assisted dying, trade unions, political and personal betrayal, the sexual puritanism of the Communist party. Michael Boyd\u2019s well-paced production rings with the tangled disputatiousness of a family.</p> <p>It is a lively point of Kushner\u2019s that politics is as much a family legacy as property. Designer Tom Piper hints at this with one of his trademark staircases, which dominates the stage like a coil of DNA.

  "<p>Judging from her introduction to <em>Jane Austen: The Secret Radical</em>, it seems fair to say that Helena Kelly is not a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/11/how-social-media-helped-jane-austen-banknotes-caroline-criado-perez\" title=\"\">the forthcoming Jane Austen \u00a310 note.</a> The \u201cidealised picture\u201d chosen by the bank looks \u201cfar less grumpy\u201d than the \u201cunfinished sketch it\u2019s based on\u201d. The background is a stately home \u201cwhere Jane didn\u2019t live\u201d and the selected quotation \u2013 \u201cI declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!\u201d \u2013 is \u201cspoken by a character who shortly afterwards yawns and throws her book aside\u201d.</p> <p>I also have mixed feelings about this banknote. It was not, as Kelly asserts, a simple matter of the Bank of England celebrating the bicentenary of Austen\u2019s death. Rather, it was the culmination <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/jul/04/women-bank-notes-bank-england\" title=\"\">of a hard-fought campaign</a> that I started when the bank announced that the only female historical figure on our banknotes was being replaced with Winston Churchill. And so when the bank produced this mocked-up note, part of me was delighted. We had won. But another part of me was, like Kelly, frustrated by yet another representation of Austen that fed the beast that enables presumably intelligent people to describe Austen with a straight face as \u201cthe 19th-century version of Barbara&#xa0;Cartland\u201d.</p> <p>It is this beast that Kelly tackles in a meticulously researched book that is, at its heart, a stern telling-off of us as readers. \u201cWe\u2019re perfectly willing to accept that writers like Wordsworth were fully engaged with everything that was happening and to find the references in their work, even when they\u2019re veiled or allusive,\u201d she admonishes. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t been willing to do that with Jane\u2019s work.\u201d With Austen, we do not skim further than the surface.</p> <p>Sometimes, we don\u2019t even skim as far as that, content to revel at the level of what Kelly calls \u201cthe unknown knowns \u2013 things we don\u2019t actually know, but think we do.\u201d The things we think we know about Austen based on countless twee tea towels and throbbing film adaptations, the things an audience member was presumably thinking of when she stood up at a Margaret Atwood event I attended recently and thanked the author for \u201csaving me from having to read Jane Austen\u201d. She hasn\u2019t read Jane Austen. But she knows her, as indeed we all do.</p> <p>Well, as Kelly says: \u201cWe know wrong.\u201d We have to try a little harder. After all, in a letter to her sister Austen herself explains: \u201cI do not write for such dull Elves As have not a great deal of Ingenuity themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Austen was writing at a time of intense political turmoil. Threats from abroad (wars with France and America; the French Revolution) made for a country on alert for threats from within, where \u201cany criticism of the status quo was seen as disloyal and dangerous\u201d. Britain became \u201cmore and more like a totalitarian state, with all the unpleasant habits totalitarian states acquire\u201d. Habeas corpus was suspended; the meaning of treason was expanded to include \u201cthinking, writing, printing, reading\u201d. Kelly tells us of carpenters imprisoned for reciting doggerel and schoolmasters imprisoned for distributing leaflets. \u201cThere can hardly have been a thinking person in Britain who didn\u2019t understand what was intended \u2013 to terrify writers and publishers into policing themselves.\u201d</p> <p>In this climate, where it \u201cwas expected that letters would be opened and read by the authorities [\u2026 and] that publishers would shy away from anything which challenged societal norms too openly\u201d, conservative writers flourished, while most others of a radical bent responded by turning to nature (think pre-political career Wordsworth), or to the past and/or abroad (think the gothic novel). Austen was unique as a novelist of this period in writing \u201cnovels which were set more or less in the present day, and more or less in the real world\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/jane-austen-feminist-pride-prejudice-curtis-sittenfeld\">Was Jane Austen a feminist? The answer is in her stories | Curtis Sittenfeld</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is therefore not to be wondered at that Austen may have hidden her radical politics under the surface of a seemingly more \u201cfrothy confection\u201d, although, as Kelly points out, to view marriage as a frivolous topic in an 18th- or 19th-century novel is shamefully ahistorical. \u201cMarriage as Jane knew it involved a woman giving up everything to her husband \u2013 her money, her body, her very existence as a legal adult. Husbands could beat their wives, rape them, imprison them, take their children away, all within the bounds of the law.\u201d And that is before we even get on to the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth that were implicit in any marriage plot at a time where \u201calmost every family had a tale of maternal death to tell\u201d.</p> <p>Through a combination of beautifully precise close readings alongside Austen\u2019s biographical, literary and historical context, Kelly shows us that the novels were about nothing more or less than the burning political questions of the day. Contrary to Churchill\u2019s infamous assertion that her characters led \u201ccalm&#xa0;lives\u201d free from worry \u201cabout the French Revolution or the crashing&#xa0;struggle of the Napoleonic Wars\u201d, Kelly reveals an oeuvre steeped in the anxiety and fear of war. She shows us that despite those who \u201cstubbornly insist that despite using the word enclosure, Jane doesn\u2019t really&#xa0;mean it\u201d, at least two of Austen\u2019s&#xa0;novels (<em>Mansfield Park</em> and <em>Emma</em>) were engaged with the effects of the Enclosure Acts and their attendant dangers of poverty and&#xa0;misery.</p> <p>And although Kelly doesn\u2019t mention&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/25/society.politics\" title=\"\">Edward Said\u2019s thesis </a>that <em>Mansfield Park</em> glorified slavery, she nevertheless shows it up as the nonsense it is by relentlessly tracking down each and every hint Austen drops, until she can show that the novel is so heavily littered with stabs at both slavery itself and the Church of England\u2019s complicity in the trade, that for them to be unintended would be a \u201ctruly impossible number of coincidences\u201d. It is notable that, alone of her novels, <em>Mansfield Park</em> was never reviewed on publication; if we miss the significance of Austen\u2019s most openly radical and anti-establishment novel, it seems clear&#xa0;that her intended audience&#xa0;did&#xa0;not.</p> <p>It is a shame that Kelly doesn\u2019t leave much room for Austen\u2019s bitingly funny letters and juvenilia, both of which can leave no reader in doubt of Austen\u2019s disposition toward the satirical, the radical and, more often than not, the grotesque. I was also not sold on Kelly\u2019s decision to open each chapter with a short fictional section based on Austen\u2019s letters. Her justification (Austen\u2019s assertion that it is in fiction that one will find \u201cthe most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties\u201d) was convincing, but I found the approach grating. Austen is one of the greatest writers ever to have lived \u2013 if we are to read fiction, I would rather have read her own words. Or perhaps this would have been the place for some letter extracts.</p> <p>But these are minor complaints in an otherwise deeply welcome book.

  "<p>Ed Atherton knows he has a fight on his hands every time he renews his annual motor insurance.

That he wants to cover a six-year-old VW Passat \u2013 a \u201cbog standard family car\u201d \u2013 should mean that his premium is unremarkable. The problem Atherton and his wife Jenny have is that they live in Salford, Manchester.

This isn\u2019t just a problem for drivers: households in high-crime areas also face higher household insurance premiums, while those in flood-prone districts struggle to get cover at all, turning certain postcodes into insurance blackspots.</p> <p>Atherton admits that his area has its problems \u2013 but they are nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests.

  "<p>A utility item with baffling instructions and a name you can\u2019t pronounce\u2026 It can only be a new product from Ikea. This is the <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/ikea-family-products/bicycle-bicycle-accessories/sladda-bicycle-grey-art-30326733/\">Sladda</a> (which means to \u2018skid sideways\u2019 in Swedish) and you can now add it to your kitchen units and wonky stools as you check out of your nearest blue warehouse. </p> <p>It comes flat-packed with its own Allen key and little spanner. As we have come to expect, the instructions have no words just lots of little pictures. It should take about an hour to assemble, but a leg falling off your sofa is very different to a wheel coming loose, so don\u2019t rush it. Reading through various comments it seems people have taken up to five hours to piece it together. Be very clear: this is a flat-pack bike not a folding bike. There\u2019s no question of popping it up and down for each journey like a large and cheap Brompton.</p> <p>The Sladda is a nicely designed bike. It has a frictionless silicon belt drive rather than a chain, which has a 10-year warranty and should be good for 15,000km. The frame itself is guaranteed for 25 years (or until you forget to padlock it to the railings outside your flat). To ride it feels pleasantly smooth. The belt it almost silent. Front disc brakes massively increase your stopping power in the wet. It is unisex and comes in two sizes, but only one colour \u2013 a sort of lifeless grey. There are lots of accessories to add if you wish \u2013 everything from baskets, guards and lights to a snazzy kiddie trailer.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly a decent enough bike, but at \u00a3450 it\u2019s quite pricey.

The team at <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/\">Wiggle</a> offer some advice on how to stay safe, dry and comfortable on your evening commute. <br><strong>Light up the night</strong>: ensure that you can see and that you can be seen from any direction. White on the front, red on the back. Carry a spare set of lights.<br><strong>Reflect on it:</strong> at night and in low light, it\u2019s high quality reflectivity rather than colour that really makes you stand out on the road. Look for garments with Scotchlite reflective prints and logos, like on the new <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.com/dhb-flashlight/\">dhb Flashlight collection</a>.<br><strong>Don\u2019t sweat it:</strong> avoid heavy clothing and choose a good quality breathable jacket, such as the <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-flashlight-highline-waterproof-jacket/\">dhb Highline waterproof jacket</a>, which will keep you warm and dry. <br><strong>Routemaster:</strong> check your winter route for good lighting and adjust if necessary. It\u2019s better to extend your journey if it means you are on safer roads.<br><strong>Roll with it:</strong> don\u2019t get caught out with a puncture on a cold night. Consider changing your tyres to something more robust, such as the <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/continental-grand-prix-4-season-folding-road-tyre/\">Continental Grand Prix 4 Season.</a><br><strong>Don\u2019t get in a fix:</strong> even with robust tyres punctures can occur. Carry two inner tubes just in case, which can save fiddly fixes by the roadside or consider using self healing tubes, such as the <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/slime-self-healing-road-inner-tube-1/\">Slime Smart Tube</a>.<br><strong>Be on guard</strong>: a simple fix of attaching a <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/lifeline-essential-narrow-road-clip-on-rear-mudguard/\">rear mudguard</a> to your bike can keep you dryer and cleaner for longer.<br><strong>Don\u2019t get in a flap:</strong> wear fitted clothing that won\u2019t obscure lights or get caught in wheels.<br><strong>Fuel up:</strong> riding in the cold and wet demands more energy than on a warm day. Make sure you\u2019re adequately fuelled and carry some food with you.<br><strong>Clean up:</strong> ensure your bike is in tip-top condition to prevent breakdowns. Keep it clean and get a regular service.<br></p> <p><em>Email Martin at </em><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\"><em>martin.love@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\"><em>@MartinLove166</em></a><br></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p>",

A gentle scroll reveals a clip of a rotisserie chicken rotating, a lecture on quantum physics, and a documentary about tupperware. Which, of course, I\u2019ve been all over for years. Check my laptop history for two-hour YouTube videos teaching you how to paint autumn trees, or for the hair braiding tutorials by a woman who sounds like she\u2019s had a recent death in the family, or the sleeping cats, or the bad nail art videos which end with an almost tearful smile to camera that makes you want to reach into the screen and tell the Japanese teenager that everything will be OK, you promise.</p> <p>With the right videos and a confident lug of procrastination, one can relax not only the brain, but the jelly around it, too \u2013 the viscous memories of getting things wrong, the sense that you will never be good enough. Half an hour into a grouting film and your anxiety about the relationship with your stepdad will be anaesthetised and shrunk to the shape of a small ball of putty, which can be evenly and pleasingly smoothed into a gap between shower tiles.</p> <p>The world is finally catching on to my longheld belief that it is rubbish to have responsibilities and energy and much better instead to curl up and watch <em>Seinfeld;</em> that comfort should be the end goal of work, love, family, fashion, food, rather than a footnote.

It\u2019s toast, alas. Burned toast. But is it enough to echo Brian Leveson\u2019s verdict that failure to come together must be \u201ca sad indictment of the inability of the press to put commercial interest to one side\u201d?

Nobody\u2019s arguing with that, or with the millions in legal retribution that follow. But don\u2019t let other key players off scot free. The police had, and still have, a lot to answer for \u2013 especially after their single Operation Elveden \u201csuccess\u201d went Bun-shaped last week.</p> <p>But frailty is there on all sides. Brian Leveson didn\u2019t understand the first thing about the internet; and that shows. The politicians didn\u2019t embrace his words as holy writ, either. He wanted Ofcom to do the recognition panel act, putting it in charge of all broadcasting, including the BBC; all telecommunications, including sawing Vodafone off at the knees; and all newspapers and their news websites.</p> <p>That was a botch, one compounded as No 10 and parliament got involved in cross-party stitch-ups. Hacked Off, blazing vitriolically away, didn\u2019t help one jot. And we need to acknowledge, here, now, where this wandering, rutted track has led us.</p> <p>David Cameron is history. So is the compromise that Oliver Letwin patched together one long night in 2013. Mr Letwin is a humble backbencher who buys his own pizzas these days. Brian Leveson is busy elsewhere, president of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/queens-bench-division-of-the-high-court\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s bench division</a>. And the royal charter that occupies most current thought is the one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/03/after-brexit-politicians-bbc-royal-charter\" title=\"\">foisted on the BBC</a> in the name of \u201cindependent\u201d broadcasting. If anyone had written four years ago that the tainted fruit of this inquiry would be a \u201crecognised regulator\u201d funded almost entirely by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/mosley\" title=\"\">Max Mosley</a>, hollow laughs would have turned to guffaws.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"708ab3cb44b16034ee2c4890ea7a05bc392488e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/708ab3cb44b16034ee2c4890ea7a05bc392488e1/100_35_1648_989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Bradley, the culture secretary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, has responsibility for press regulation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the problem is that it isn\u2019t all over yet. Just the reverse. Karen Bradley, our newish culture secretary in loco Theresa, isn\u2019t minded to activate section 40 just yet. But she might if there\u2019s another outcry over some egregious shock-horror reporting \u2013 or, worse, a repeat of the national security revels that dogged Snowden coverage. She, and those who follow her, can choose. Our government, if it so wishes, has a lock-hold on the press, a way of turning free to corralled by fiat.</p> <p>That\u2019s no happy solution. Nor for an Impress pottering along until Mr Mosley\u2019s beneficence runs dry, its mere existence, in one stalwart\u2019s words, just enough to \u201ckeep Ipso honest\u201d. Nor is there anything particularly joyful about the \u00a33m of government money provided to sustain the tiny Press Recognition Panel until patience and prospects run out at the end of next year.</p> <p>None of this is a victory for one side or the other. Everything about it portends more stalemate to come. Which ought, at last, to mean a little fresh thinking. Ipso, if you look hard at the detail, has made a pretty good stab at improving voluntary regulation. Set the Ipso and Impress editorial codes side by side and no one can see much difference. Apply those codes to current cases and there\u2019s no obvious gap either. The problem for Ipso isn\u2019t performance but perception, as Sir Joseph Pilling, former permanent secretary for Northern Ireland and chairman of the report on human sexuality for the House of Bishops, wrote the other day in his <a href=\"https://www.ipso.co.uk/media/1278/ipso_review_online.pdf\" title=\"\">external review</a> of Ipso\u2019s first two years.</p> <p>\u201c[It] is an uphill task for Ipso to prove that it deserves to be trusted as independent regulator. Decisions made by those in charge of the PCC led to its demise and a collapse in public trust. This is only compounded by the fact that Ipso is funded, and was established, by the industry. In these circumstances, it is no easy task to gain the public\u2019s trust.\u201d</p> <p>In short, no matter how stringently a former judge such as Sir Alan Moses and his Ipso team perform their regulatory duties, they\u2019re still there to be sniped at \u2013 in principle as well as in practice.</p> <p>But are such perceptions set in stone? Could there be movement on this central point, the possibility of Ipso collecting its money direct from those it regulates (with an independent finance interlocutor on hand to ensure fair play)? If there is, many objections \u2013 including some of those of current outsiders \u2013 drop away. Impress could also ask itself searching questions. Are we a help or a hindrance to things we believe in? Have we any real future, apart from lingering while more Max money is spent? Recognition gives us a little clout, but no decisive power.</p> <p>It\u2019s a mistake to think of Impress as some jerry-built Trojan horse. Jonathan Heawood, its founder and driver, is a human rights campaigner of note. He didn\u2019t set out to start a front organisation. He doesn\u2019t need and shouldn\u2019t want to spend months and unproductive years playing prime spoiler on the Fleet Street block. There ought to be room for beneficial rapprochement here. Both sides, for instance, are bent on providing an arbitration service. Ipso is exploring possibilities with a professional arbitrator. Room for co-operation and comparison.</p> <p>Maybe Mosley wouldn\u2019t want a peace treaty. Maybe \u2013 nay, certainly \u2013 Hacked Off will keep banging away as though it were 2007 all over again. But hyperbole and hysteria from the trenches are wearing out their welcome. And MPs, too, have a moment for pause. They can plough forward with their own riffs on Leveson, as the House of Lords did recently when it overturned government whips and passed an amendment to the investigatory powers bill, proposed by Baroness Hollins, that allows people suing a newspaper over phone-hacking to claim their costs of their action from the publisher in question: section 40\u2019s little brother.</p> <p>More Murdoch bashing! Jolly good show! But the effect of the amendment means that a claimant could come to any publisher and state that they believe the only way that it could have sourced a story was by hacking their phone. The publisher \u2013 any publisher, no Murdoch limitation here \u2013 would have to make a nightmare decision: do you reveal the source of your story, or make clear that you have a source but will not reveal them at all costs?</p> <p>The Hollins amendment \u2013 if upheld <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/investigatorypowers.html\" title=\"\">when the Common votes on it</a> in a few days \u2013 means that claimants will be able to use the clause to force journalists to prove a negative, and then pay the costs of the claimant for having done so. Which, inevitably, means less protection for sources, <em>Observer</em> or <em>Sun</em> (whatever the Impress code says about protecting&#xa0;them).</p> <p>It\u2019s the old game of unintended consequences. It also shows the peril of piecemeal tinkering on freedom\u2019s turf. And the alternative for our legislators seems ever clearer, and more necessary. They could stand back and mothball section 40 while negotiating space develops. They could \u2013 very sensibly \u2013 encourage a dramatically revamped regulatory regime that fits the internet age. They could also seek a fresh, more collegiate start.</p> <p>For let\u2019s be clear where Impress recognition left us last week. Stuck with stereotypes and delusions. Believing that a \u201cfree press\u201d can be inflicted by political blackmail, or law. Arguing that the great and good regulatory classes \u2013 legal eagles, NHS administrators, media academics, charity directors and professional regulators of anything going \u2013 are somehow the voice of Britain in this age of non-metropolitan disenchantment. All of them and all of us up a blind alley, promising only more of the same.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t make sense any longer. Blanket bitterness stuck in a time warp. Most editors, like most politicians with a soup\u00e7on of perspective, would know what to say about such impasses. Time to dismantle the barricades. Time to move on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/11/phone-hacking-victims-win-house-of-lords-support-over-legal-costs\">Phone-hacking victims win House of Lords support over legal costs</a> </p> </aside>",
