  "<p>US military personnel serving at the UK\u2019s RAF bases are helping to identify targets for drone strikes, according to their job specifications.</p> <p>Human rights groups have seized on the descriptions of the roles as proof of the UK\u2019s part in the covert US drone programme, which some critics claim is in breach of international law.</p> <p>One job advertised at RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire was for an \u201call source analyst\u201d, in support of US operations in Africa. The suitable candidate will \u201cperform a variety of advanced targeting operations ... in support of employment of GPS guided weapons, weaponeering and collateral estimation, as well as utilizing the tools required for advanced targeting\u201d.</p> <p>The CV of a US military analyst, uploaded to a recruitment site, states that he was an MQ-9 Reaper ISR Mission Intelligence Coordinator at Molesworth. The MQ-9 is the US\u2019s chief strike drone, capable of firing Hellfire missiles and dropping laser-guided GBU 12 Paveway II bombs.</p> <p>Molesworth has also been recruiting \u201cfull motion video analysts\u201d to study footage taken by drones and other surveillance craft in order to identify potential targets. The consultancy giant Booz Allen Hamilton is advertising for a \u201cmaritime multi-level targeting analyst\u201d at the same base. The job involves providing \u201ccomprehensive assessments... of intelligence data\u201d to \u201csupport the client targeting cycle in order to answer intelligence questions and provide recommendations for further action or collection\u201d.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence insists that the US does not operate drones from the UK. A senior MoD source said: \u201cDespite the continuing conspiracy theories and associated hype in the media, the reality is that there are no US Remotely Piloted Air System support facilities operating anywhere in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>But the human rights group <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Reprieve</a> said that the job specifications indicated UK complicity in the US drone programme. \u201cSimply to say that drones are not flown from the UK is missing the point, if it is personnel on British soil that are at the top of the so-called \u2018kill chain\u2019 and British agencies who are feeding targets into those lists,\u201d said Jennifer Gibson, staff attorney at Reprieve. \u201cThe British government has questions to answer over its own involvement in this secret war.\u201d</p> <p>The US air force last year reportedly floated the idea of establishing a drone operations centre at RAF Lakenheath, subject to British approval. The move would prove controversial. The US recently gave the German government an assurance that \u201ckill\u201d commands for drones were no longer being sent via its Ramstein base amid mounting controversy over the legality of the programme.</p> <p>Staff from RAF Molesworth will be absorbed into RAF Croughton, near Milton Keynes, chosen as the site for a new $300m US intelligence-gathering hub known as the Joint Analysis Centre that is expected to play an important role in future US drone operations focused on Africa and the Middle East.</p> <p>Plans filed with the local council reveal that the four-year renovation project at the base, due to start next year, will see the construction of seven new buildings and the renovation of several existing ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95144f1444a3a9342af0747f5b518f8aa93a0e42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95144f1444a3a9342af0747f5b518f8aa93a0e42/331_594_4021_2413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A radar dome at RAF Croughton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A radar dome at RAF Croughton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boasting a fitness centre, shop, accommodation block, post office, nursery and school, hundreds of personnel will live on-site, while others will be housed nearby.</p> <p>Around a third of all US military communications in Europe already pass through Croughton, which has a direct cable link to GCHQ, the intelligence services\u2019 giant listening hub at Cheltenham. A high-speed fibre-optic line connects the base to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, from where the US flies drones that target terrorist groups in Somalia.</p> <p>Paul Mobbs, a close observer<a href=\"http://www.fraw.org.uk/croughtonwatch/index.shtml\" title=\"\"> of Croughton, who contributes to the Free Range Activism</a> website, said: \u201cCroughton is becoming a hub which will receive content from across Europe and North Africa and near Middle East, and then slice and dice it for use by intelligence agencies. At the same time its communications capacity is being enhanced to tie in to other intelligence centres.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Cole, editor of the website <a href=\"https://dronewars.net\" title=\"\">Drone Wars, believes</a> the US military\u2019s need to process massive amounts of data, sucked up by its rapidly expanding surveillance programme, lies behind Croughton\u2019s transformation. \u201cYou need a huge amount of bandwidth,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThey distribute it around so it\u2019s not a case of huge amounts all going to one place. And it\u2019s secure \u2013 it can\u2019t be knocked out in one place.\u201d</p> <p>Critics say the US drone programme is taking place on British soil without sufficient oversight. \u201cThere is no oversight, no accountability,\u201d said Lindis Percy, co-ordinator of the Campaign for the Accountability of American Airbases.</p> <p>\u201cThe United States Visiting Force is present in the UK at the invitation of the British government,\u201d an MoD spokesman explained. \u201cThere are no circumstances under which UK military assets, including those bases made available to the US, could be used operationally by the US without the agreement of Her Majesty\u2019s government.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A couple who have been living together for the past six years will this week demand the right to a civil partnership, arguing that they face discrimination under the present law, which gives gay couples the option of marriage or a civil partnership but denies the latter to heterosexual couples.</p> <p>Earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/29/heterosexual-couple-civil-partnership-high-court-battle-lose\" title=\"\">the high court ruled against a legal challenge</a> to the Civil Partnership Act 2004 by Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan. On Wednesday their appeal against that ruling will be heard in the high court, with judgment expected to be reserved. The couple say they are prepared to take their case to the supreme court and the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.</p> <p>\u201cA civil partnership would reflect who we are,\u201d Keidan told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s a modern social contract that doesn\u2019t have the associations of marriage but would give the protection that we and other cohabiting couples crave.\u201d</p> <p>The act states that civil partnerships that provide legal rights and obligations to couples regarding children, property and pensions would be available to \u201ctwo people of the same sex\u201d. It was passed in 2004 in response to demands from gay rights campaigners for legal recognition for unions between same-sex couples. Then in 2013 same-sex marriage was legalised, giving gay couples the option of marriage or a civil partnership. The latter continues to be denied to heterosexual couples.</p> <p>There are almost three million opposite sex couples living together in the UK, and almost four in 10 have dependent children, according to the <a href=\"http://equalcivilpartnerships.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Equal Civil Partnerships</a> campaign. Although many people believe that people in \u201ccommon law marriages\u201d have rights over children and property protection, there is no such provision in law. \u201cThe fastest growing families in the UK are people who choose not to get married,\u201d said Keidan, who has a 17-month-old daughter, Eden, with Steinfeld. \u201cIt would be a really straightforward thing for the government to extend civil partnerships to couples like us.\u201d</p> <p>Steinfeld added: \u201cFor many people, marriage is a very meaningful way to express their love. But there are also many reasons why people don\u2019t want to get married. It\u2019s not for the government to dictate, but to ensure that couples are legally protected.\u201d</p> <p>The couple have made wills, but will not have automatic rights to pensions or couples\u2019 inheritance tax allowances. Their legal battle has been funded by their own savings, donations from philanthropic organisations and crowdfunding which raised \u00a335,000. They are being represented in the court of appeal by lawyers acting on a <em>pro bono</em> basis.</p> <p>At the high court hearing in January, the government argued that changing legislation would be \u201ccostly and complex\u201d, and that following same-sex marriage legislation, civil partnerships may be phased out or abolished in the future. Following the ruling, a government spokesperson said that the \u201ccurrent regime of marriage and civil partnership does not disadvantage opposite sex couples\u201d.</p> <p>Steinfeld said it was untenable for the government to maintain the \u201cunfair status quo\u201d. The arguments regarding costs were shortsighted, she added. \u201cThe costs of changing the law pale into insignificance compared to the costs of dealing with the consequences of relationship breakdown where there is no legal protection.\u201d</p> <p>She and Keidan said there was growing support for a change in the law. More than 70,000 people have signed an online petition, and Conservative MP Tim Loughton has introduced a private member\u2019s bill in parliament.</p> <p>The only place in the British Isles where civil partnerships are available to different sex couples is the Isle of Man. After homosexuality was decriminalised on the island in the 1990s, a new law came into force earlier this year permitting marriage and civil partnerships to all couples.</p> <p>Adeline Cosson and Kieran Hodgson became the first opposite-sex couple in the UK to enter into a civil partnership earlier this month, swiftly followed by Claire Beale and Martin Loat, who travelled from London for their ceremony. The Isle of Man is a crown dependency, but not part of the UK.After the new law was passed, Peter Tatchell, a campaigner for marriage equality, said: \u201cTheir new legislation is even more progressive than the UK. Instead of segregated marriage laws for gay and straight couples, they have a single civil marriage law that applies to everyone regardless of sexual orientation.</p> <p>\u201cThe Isle of Man has also opened up civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples; in contrast to the ban that exists in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These changes catapult the Isle of Man to the forefront of legal equality for straight and gay couples.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>What is it about producing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\">medical male contraception</a> that seems so uniquely difficult? Why is it that decades have passed since the female pill became freely available and still the \u201cmale pill\u201d is dangled as some tantalising hope that it\u2019s going to happen, soon, one day, in the future\u2026 just not right now?</p> <p>A male contraceptive jab has been shown to be \u201calmost\u201d as effective as the female pill and better than condoms. It would work by lowering sperm count and it wouldn\u2019t have to remain as a jab \u2013 it could be a gel or a pill. The trial had to be halted because of side-effects (acne, depression, increased libido). If some women rolled their eyes at this point, who could blame them? Since the introduction of the female pill, the wide range of side-effects has always seemed less an invitation to decline the chemicals, more a shrugging warning about what to expect.</p> <p>If the truth, or at least the perception, is that men are more squeamish about taking chemical contraception, there are other concerns. Similar to most female forms of contraception, the male jab would be just about stopping pregnancy and wouldn\u2019t act as any kind of barrier against STDs. So it (especially) couldn\u2019t be used alone in casual encounters.</p> <p>Responsible sexually active people would still have to load up with two, maybe more, forms of contraception/protection. Then, there\u2019s the other less tangible, but no less pressing issue of trust between men and women or, more precisely, the distinct lack of contraceptive-reproductive trust that has always existed between the sexes.</p> <p>Is this the omnipresent background hum of contraceptive disharmony \u2013 that too often, men and women simply don\u2019t trust each other? In the blissful utopian vision, people, however casually entwined, tell the truth, do the right thing, take full responsibility for their sexual-reproductive health. Back in the real world, too often this morphs into a hot mess of paranoia, suspicion, accusation and counter-accusation.</p> <p>On the one hand, there are men who, still today, seem embroiled in paranoid fantasies about procreative entrapment \u2013 all those \u201cdesperate\u201d women getting pregnant accidentally on purpose. How many more times? While women like this must exist (everything exists), it\u2019s unlikely that, these days, there are great hordes of them willing to resort to malevolent subterfuge to have children with men who are anything from indifferent, cold and uninvolved to angry, insulting and accusatory.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the lack of female trust towards men \u2013 the feeling that women (the ones who must after all deal with pregnancy) couldn\u2019t entrust such an important matter to men, who may lie in the moment to get sex. Rightly or wrongly, many women feel that they\u2019ve secured front-row seats for the human theatre of men who will say and do anything to get laid and that the prospect of unplanned pregnancy is too high a gamble to take.</p> <p>So there it is \u2013 the relentless howl of distrust between the sexes, echoing down the years. The men who think that women are conniving to become pregnant. The women who suspect men will say anything to get sex.</p> <p>Only the humble condom (that physical and, crucially, visible barrier) has ever come anywhere close to calming anxieties on both sides. And while my attitude used to be if you don\u2019t trust them, don\u2019t sleep with them, the world persists in being more complicated and darker than that.</p> <p>So much so that, even when it finally exists, the long-awaited male pill could only hope to stop pregnancy and remove the chemical burden from women. No small matters indeed, but a male pill would still encounter the same problem as the female version, in that it\u2019s \u201cinvisible\u201d and requires trusting the other person implicitly. When the sexes simply don\u2019t trust each other, where is the \u201cpill\u201d for that?</p> <h2>Halloween is supposed to be scary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdaa56dfc43967ae3a7da920bee5633a648b0de9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdaa56dfc43967ae3a7da920bee5633a648b0de9/0_137_4098_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Isn\u2019t Halloween supposed to be about people emulating the thing they fear most?\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Isn\u2019t Halloween supposed to be about people emulating the thing they fear most?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I admire Katie Piper, TV presenter, campaigner and survivor of a vicious acid attack organised by an ex-partner in 2008.

That seems to be the deal with modern Halloween \u2013 it isn\u2019t just kids covered in sheets, demanding sweets with menaces. To my mind, the disfiguring make-up, from fake scars, burns and dangling eyeballs, seems no more naff than the idea of \u201csexy Halloween\u201d, with adults parading about in their \u201cslutty witch\u201d or \u201chorny vampire\u201d outfits. In my book, this is about as sexy as all that vicars-and-tarts rubbish.</p> <p>Of course, people shouldn\u2019t mock those with real-life disfigurements, but is that what is happening here? Are the formal environs of TV, cinema and theatre the only spheres permitted to portray horror and injury or are ordinary people allowed to play dress-up, too? Moreover, isn\u2019t Halloween supposed to be about people emulating the thing they fear most: old-school ghouls, monsters, zombies or, indeed, somebody who has been mutilated?</p> <p>In part, this comes across as light-hearted, quasi-cinematic dressing up, employing cheap-as-chips special effects for the most \u201cterrifying\u201d look. In a more profound way, in these image-obsessed times, far from mocking people such as Piper, this could just be about people taking up an annual opportunity to address their own deepest fears.</p> <h2>Money can\u2019t buy you love, only a Lennon letter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65ddbfe679dd28544b4d8647017391553eca3e22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65ddbfe679dd28544b4d8647017391553eca3e22/0_222_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What am I bid for John Lennon\u2019s letter?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What am I bid for John Lennon\u2019s letter?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Beatles Story/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A 1969 letter <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-37787297\">written by John Lennon to the Queen</a>, explaining why he was returning his MBE, ended up tucked inside a record sleeve among a bargain lot of vinyl records at a car-boot sale.

  "<p>Take back control, cried the Brexit campaigners, from the dark forces of the EU and open Britain up to a glorious future in which it can embrace the world. It was a seductive cry, but was a lie from top to bottom. The EU did not stop Britain\u2019s embrace of the world; instead, it was and is a crucial bridge to it. While Brexit campaigners\u2019 rhetoric may be of global openness, their actions betoken retreat. It is not from the left that we have to fear an Orwellian dystopia in which words are manipulated, never to mean what they purport to mean, but from rightwing Leavers.</p> <p>This is nowhere clearer than in the intense threat now facing British universities, one of the UK\u2019s great national and international assets. Universities, dedicated to learning, teaching and research, are indispensable building blocks of any civilisation. But they are also increasingly important economic institutions. A university in a 21st-century British city plays a similar role to a cathedral in a medieval city \u2013 as a magnet of economic and cultural activity. Universities are a source of employment, collaborators with companies and public agencies, and, by attracting so many young people, a mainspring of vitality and rich urban life. (Full declaration: I am principal of Hertford College, Oxford University.)</p> <p>For Brexiters and Ukippers, however, universities have a dark side. They involve themselves with \u2013 dread word \u2013 foreigners. Universities, in the right\u2019s universe, are anti-British fifth columnists. They will insist on welcoming students and researchers from the EU and the rest of the world, in part because they believe in the intellectual vitality that comes with having diverse student and research communities and in part because they need the cash. University tuition fees in 2013-14 totalled \u00a313.7bn. Because foreign students pay fees two or three times higher than the \u00a39,000 maximum set for English students, overseas students contribute more than a third of that total. On top, they spend on accommodation, leisure and sustenance. In every university town in Britain, they are a brilliant economic, social and cultural asset, indispensable to the viability and vitality of the university, while boosting local economies.</p> <p>Britain has been good at attracting international students because we have two priceless advantages. We have great universities and we teach courses and award degrees in our native tongue \u2013 English \u2013 which is now the lingua franca. Tens of thousands of Chinese students come to Britain every year not to settle here and steal British jobs, but because they want to learn to speak English and obtain the vital credential of a degree won in England \u2013 and then go home.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">Home Office insists on counting foreign students as immigrants</a>. Part of the wide perception that immigration is out of control, from which Nigel Farage built his anti-EU case, is because of this statistical quirk. Thus, last year net migration totalled 336,000. But 169,000 of those were students (netting out incoming students from British students leaving to study abroad). Exclude them and suddenly the net migration total looks back in control \u2013 167,000. Toughen up the permit regime for non-EU migrants and David Cameron could have hit his target of net migration in the tens of thousands and Farage and co would have lost a crucial platform in their anti EU hyperbole.</p> <p>Home Office resistance to this statistical redefinition, led by Theresa May as home secretary and continuing now as prime minister, is because some students do stay in Britain after winning their degrees; on this view, higher education has become a backdoor means of avoiding immigration controls. Too few incoming students seem to be leaving, although nobody can know for certain whether this is true. EU students have the right to stay but they only constitute a quarter of all foreign students. Because Britain invests scant resources in policing its student visa regime, the only evidence on students\u2019 leaving is the hit-and-miss system of sampling travellers at British ports and airports. Of course there has been cheating and some bogus degree courses, but not an industrial scale and now largely closed down. I find it hard to believe that there is an army of up to half-a-million Asian ex-students in their mid to late 20s whose student visas have expired now working in Britain\u2019s black economy. But on that supposition the prime minister and Home Office refuse to budge. Students must count as immigrants and vital ammunition is given to xenophobes and Eurosceptics.</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is concerned that for these dubious reasons universities are going to be required to cut their international student numbers dramatically with severe consequences for their viability, foreign exchange earnings and Britain\u2019s reputation for openness. He observed mildly 10 days ago that it would be good to test public opinion to see if public objections to foreign students were so ferocious as to justify the policy of counting them as immigrants. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">Number 10 slapped him down</a>. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who, as London mayor, spoke out strongly in favour of international students, has gone mute as foreign secretary. He proclaims openness to the globe rather than Europe, but it is a conviction that does not involve risking his career and new reputation as Europhobe in chief. What he does is to enable closure.</p> <p>Britain cannot escape its history, its language or the opportunities and challenges afforded by globalisation. In our globalising times, <a href=\"http://institutions.ukcisa.org.uk//info-for-universities-colleges--schools/policy-research--statistics/research--statistics/international-students-in-uk-he/\" title=\"\">China sends approximately 90,000 students a year to Britain, India 18,500, Malaysia 17,000, Hong Kong 16,000 and Singapore, Thailand and Pakistan some 7,000 each.</a> We should be proud that such numbers of students from these seven countries alone want to study here. Australia, Canada and the US will jump at the chance to host them as we turn them away, terrified they are all wannabe immigrants. Really? It is a savage indictment of our new public culture. I have lost count of the number of international students worried if they are wanted, whether they should apply for graduate studies and scared of the way the atmosphere around them is becoming more hostile.</p> <p>Not one single Leave minister in the government speaks out for them, their cause or the international role of our universities despite their protestations of embracing the globe \u2013 that falls to Remainers such as Hammond or the universities minister, Jo Johnson. The Leavers are charlatans. I, for one, want my country back.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.league.org.uk/our-campaigns/fox-hunting/is-hunting-cruel?gclid=CKz01uK-_s8CFYIV0wod2-oFRQ\">League Against Cruel Sports</a>\u2019 decision to offer rewards of up to \u00a35,000 for information leading to the prosecution of people involved in dog fighting has been attacked by its former chairman who says it will reward criminals.</p> <p>Having piloted the scheme in Bedfordshire, the league is rolling the scheme out in Birmingham as part of a strategy to collect intelligence on the underground \u201csport\u201d that anecdotal evidence suggests is on the increase. By building up a picture, it hopes to persuade MPs of the need to tighten the law on dog fighting.</p> <p>Prosecutions, currently under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, carry a maximum penalty of 51 weeks in jail. The charity says that despite being banned almost 200 years ago, a dog fight takes place every day of the year in the UK as the \u201csport\u201d moves into urban areas where criminal gangs bet on the fights.</p> <p>But John Cooper, QC, who chaired the league between 1996 and 2012 and was then its president until last year, has criticised the decision. \u201cDog fighters may be criminals who engage in a host of peripheral criminal activities, including violence, drug dealing and gang-related intimidation,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe clandestine culture of dog fighting and its nexus with other crimes makes it highly likely that those who can give significant evidence, which will lead to conviction, will be involved in the criminal world. It is extremely inappropriate for charitable money to be paid to such individuals, who will, without doubt, use that money to further their own criminal purpose.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement to the <em>Observer</em>, the league said any rewards would be appropriately risk-assessed in line with its charitable objectives. \u201cOffering rewards for information is a tactic not out of keeping with recognised professional practices and one the charity has used in previous years to glean information relating to illegal hunting and dog fighting, including while John Cooper was president,\u201d it said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/27/animal-welfare-water-thirsty-pigs-dogs\">I'm on trial for giving water to thirsty pigs.

It has also been thought to serve as a deterrent, as criminals may feel at more risk of exposure. It is incorrect to assume that everyone who provides information relating to a criminal act will be a criminal, as any experienced barrister such as John Cooper or any judge who has heard an ex-parte application in relation to the use of informant information should be acutely aware.\u201d</p> <p>A report <a href=\"http://www.league.org.uk/~/media/Files/LACS/Publications/Betrayal-of-Trust-Report.pdf\">by the league published last year suggested </a>that some organised dog fights can last for up to five hours. The dogs\u2019 owners often take the animal out of town to seek medical attention or use DIY kits sold over the internet to avoid alerting authorities.</p> <p>It also found that prohibited dogs were being bred and sold for substantial sums of money. Some were subject to brutal training techniques including body or head slamming. There was evidence that pet cats and dogs were being stolen to be used as live training\u2019 bait\u2019.</p> <p>Cooper, who said he was not entitled to attend trust meetings as president and therefore had no idea the league had offered such incentives, warned the measure could backfire. \u201cAs a criminal barrister and QC of more than 30 years standing, it is known practice for rival criminal gangs to inform upon each other, with the sole purpose of putting their rivals out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cBy offering a financial inducement to them to do so simply funds the next dog fighting ring and surely is an inappropriate use of charitable funds.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Islamic State\u2019s doctrine of survival is based on a simple notion: defeat on the&#xa0;battlefield must always leave behind the seeds for a comeback. Whether the operation to retake Mosul will be the beginning of the end for Isis or the beginning of a new cycle hinges largely on understanding this basic fact.</p> <p>The security and political vacuum in Mosul will be the likely seed that could enable an Isis regeneration. Unless the government in Iraq allows a situation in which local Sunnis fill the void, a new cycle is almost certain. That much seems to be accepted by Iraqi and American planners directly involved in the effort to dislodge Isis from its most populous and prestigious stronghold. The current strategy stipulates that Shia and Kurdish militias will not fight inside the city, a way to reduce local concerns about political ambitions.</p> <p>The question, though, is who will fill the void? Can the government in Baghdad empower a Sunni alternative to isolate Isis? Even if Baghdad has the desire and the ability to do so, who is this alternative?</p> <p>The northern parts of Iraq stretching from Anbar to Nineveh are a microcosm of the problems that plagued the country for a decade. Isis was able to emerge out of the ashes in 2014 but the country is significantly more fractured today than when the group was driven out of the urban centres in 2007. Deeper wounds have opened over the past two years and many sectarian, ethnic and political stakeholders are vying for influence in this particular region of Iraq.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Iraq is significantly more fractured today than when Isis was driven out of the urban centres in 2007</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet there is cause for guarded optimism amid today\u2019s bleak landscape. The battle for Mosul is so far led by professional Iraqi forces, which include thousands of local Sunni fighters keen to retake their areas from Isis. New dynamics have emerged since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/10/iraq-sunni-insurgents-islamic-militants-seize-control-mosul\" title=\"\">Isis seized Mosul more than two years ago</a>. Some of the changes present historic opportunities for the government in Baghdad to redraw the social contract, while others will serve as disrupters to any such effort.</p> <p>These changes include the reconfiguration of the Sunni divide in the country into three broad categories. The first includes the insiders who have worked closely with pro-government forces battling Isis in their areas. They tend to focus on rebuilding their own homes and see merits in a government presence that prevents the return of a vile militia that caused the destruction.</p> <p>Second are the politicians already part of the government in Baghdad. They have little leverage over their communities, but some believe in pushing for change through political engagement. The politicians\u2019 ability to fill the void in Sunni areas is minimal. They are often busy fighting each other rather than working together to help their communities.</p> <p>Political rejectionists form the third category. They dismiss the existing political order as inherently disadvantageous to Sunnis. They perceive the government in Baghdad as beholden to Iran, and the only way out is an overhaul of Iraqi politics. Any Iranian influence in the country is viewed with profound suspicion. When Isis took over a third of Iraq in 2014, some of this group welcomed the insurgents but many gambled on the development to reverse the political situation in the country for ever.</p> <p>Rejectionists might not have direct influence in their communities, but they have the ability to undermine any Sunni political engagement. Similarly, many Shia politicians and militants believe that they should be exempted from any outreach effort. Even politicians in Baghdad who have called for an end to the old game of authoritarian and sectarian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nouri-al-maliki\" title=\"\">Nouri al-Maliki</a>, the former prime minister, indicated that Baghdad has no place for such individuals after they have lost their bet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/islamic-state-atrocities-reported-around-mosul-says-un\">Isis kills dozens in strongholds around Mosul to quell uprising</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conflict between the rejectionists and Baghdad will likely worsen, unless the current thinking of both sides changes. But the common denominator between the three Sunni categories is local governance. The ability of Sunnis to govern their localities will resolve, with time, much of the political stagnation in the country. <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2015/03/23/isis-the-unintended-consequences-of-the-us-led-war-on-iraq/\" title=\"\">Maliki, whose policies directly enabled the rise of Isis in 2014</a>, opposed the empowerment of local actors to rule their areas.</p> <p>Today the stakes are even higher than before.

  "<p>I had been showing my son\u2019s Japanese in-laws around Highgate cemetery, telling them what a doughty collection of fascinating minds and souls had the pleasure of each other\u2019s company here. Yet afterwards I was struck with unexpected melancholy, as it hit me what a lonely thing it is to live out eternity far from the human interactions most of us have with family and friends while we are alive, and that lying in a chill grave alongside the commonest of beings or the greatest intellects was no consolation.</p> <p>What I would like, I announced to my son and daughter-in-law, is to have my ashes kept in some container \u2013 nothing flash, a box will do \u2013 in the home we share and which my son intends to keep. I could be an ethereal presence among the family, listening in to the quotidian chatter and arguments, privy to all that the keepers of the family DNA say and do. At which my daughter-in-law gave me a beautiful smile and said that was fine with her. In Japan, they keep the ashes of their loved ones in a shrine at home so that relatives can hold loving rituals, have a chat or even seek comfort from remembered wisdom of their elders, and she would happily do the same for me. My son nodded: \u201cIf it\u2019s what you want, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p> <p>The effect of being told that I can go on being with my family has given me a startling amount of comfort and made me feel infinitely less fearful of being dead than I had when I envisaged being tucked away in some burial ground.</p> <p>Of course, it is not what everyone would want, but several people I have told about it have said that they, too, would like to be a part of the lives of their nearest and dearest and perhaps that we could design our containers\u2026</p> <p>So I was mightily upset at the pope (and thus far I\u2019ve had a soft spot for him) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/vatican-bans-catholics-cremation-ashes-loved-ones-home\" title=\"\">saying that people should not keep the ashes</a> of their dead at home, nor, I suppose, at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/26/burial-mounds-comeback-21st-century-britain\" title=\"\">Sacred Stones burial mound in Cambridgeshire</a>, which opened last week and is described as a \u201csacred space in a secular world\u201d by one person wanting to buy a niche. Presumably, if we are not buried in a sacred place, we sacrifice God\u2019s protection.</p> <p>But like an increasing number of people, I do not have a faith led by a God holding out the possibility of eternal caring surveillance, nor belief in a higher force that will whisk me off to Elysian delights after my corporeal exit from the world. So far as I am concerned, death means death and, with it, nothingness.</p> <p>And herein lies the crisis of our time, as a huge swath of us edges ever closer to the inevitability of a death that offers no comforting afterlife. We are terrified at the idea of that finality, of losing control over our lives and place in this world. In our culture where the defining mantras are self-help, self-improvement and demonstrating that you can defeat nature\u2019s pattern of diminishing us as we age, death is the greatest insult and how often you hear of people angry until the end.</p> <p>So it is certainly worth raging against ageism and the grim prejudices in our society that mean we torment body and soul in our efforts to deny the ageing process. But to be raging against the dying of the light, if it means we are in a state of rage at what we cannot prevent and because what comes afterwards seems so devoid of comfort, is a pitiful way to go.</p> <p>Yet there are real signs of a healthy shift, if not a groundswell, with people writing interestingly and intensely subjectively about death as fact or fiction; TV programmes, still admittedly hooked into reality lifestyle, run programmes on <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/flashy-funerals\" title=\"\">the types of funeral to be had</a> so that we can be involved in designing the way we will be seen off.</p> <p><a href=\"http://deathcafe.com/\" title=\"\">The Death Cafe movement</a>, developed by Jon Underwood and Sue Barsky Reid, began in 2011 and has held cafes in England and 37 other countries. Its objective is \u201cto increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their (finite) lives\u201d, with no defined objectives or themes, just group-directed discussion over tea and cake.</p> <p>The most eloquent and compelling argument for making death a subject we can discuss without embarrassment or discomfort with family, friends, children,doctors, carers is made by Atul Gawande in his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/22/being-mortal-medicine-what-matters-atul-gawande-review\" title=\"\"><em>Being Mortal: Illness, Medicine And What Matters in the End</em></a>. He explores humane, client-centred models of residential care, ways of involving our elderly in society in a fulfilling lifestyle until the end; the health and spiritual benefits that living as extended family may bring. Gawande has seen how terminal patients choosing quality of life over quantity \u2013 choosing not to have more invasive treatments despite this meaning less time to live \u2013 can be surprisingly happy.</p> <p>As a surgeon and public health researcher, he knows that: \u201cMortality can be a treacherous subject \u2026 For many, such talk, no matter how carefully framed, raises the spectre of a society readying itself to sacrifice its sick and aged. But what if the sick and aged are already being sacrificed \u2013 victims of our refusal to accept the inexorability of our life cycle?\u201d</p> <p>Accept it we will be forced to do, so surely the very best we can do is get talking and make clear how we want our end to be: whether it is, as in the Netherlands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/11/assisted-dying-dutch-end-of-life-netherlands-unbearable-suffering\" title=\"\">the possibility of calling in the doctor </a>when life has become unbearable suffering; to being cared for, whatever the risks, in our own home; to gorge ourselves on hand-rolled chocolates and a litre of Remy Martin if we wish; to have the comfort of a pet for someone alone; or to choose the famous kindness of hospice care, so that we may cast off this mortal coil in the best way possible.</p> <p>If our final wish to end up at home on the mantelpiece is granted, I\u2019ll thank the pope to keep his disapproval to himself.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May appeals to a stereotype that has a deep grip on the English psyche. Sober and commonsensical, she behaves with the moral seriousness we expect from a vicar\u2019s daughter. She may be a little clunky, but what a relief it is to have a straightforward leader from the heart of the country after the flash, poll-driven phonies of the past.</p> <p>I am not saying her public image is all a pretence. No focus group told her to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/theresa-may-pledges-33m-boost-for-fight-against-slavery-in-britain\">campaign against the modern slave trade</a> when she was home secretary. There were few Tory votes in stopping the police targeting young black men, either. But the dominant side of Theresa May is more superficial than David Cameron and more dishonest than Tony Blair. It is a tribute to the power of cliches to stop us seeing what is in front of our noses, that so few have noticed that the only reason she\u2019s prime minister is that she put ambition before principle.</p> <p>Last week, Downing Street spin doctors were trying and failing to downplay the importance of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\">secret speech she gave to Goldman Sachs</a> on 26 May, which was leaked to Nick Hopkins and Rowena Mason of the <em>Guardian</em>. In private, May was unequivocal. \u201cThe economic arguments are clear,\u201d she told the bankers. Companies would leave the UK if the UK left the EU. In public, however, she made just one speech during the referendum campaign. You forgot it the moment you heard it. May never mentioned the danger of companies fleeing. Her economic case, such as it was, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/04/theresa-mays-speech-on-brexit-full-text.html\">came down to a flaccid, pseudo-impartial argument</a> that \u201cthere are risks in staying as well as leaving\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5929j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836072\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May's private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e2c3de4b0c146d58914f8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\">Theresa May\u2019s private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As an orator, May was hopeless. As a politician on the make, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\">she was close to perfect.</a> When Craig Oliver, Cameron\u2019s former chief of communications, wondered if she was secretly an \u201cenemy agent\u201d for the Leave side, he was being too Machiavellian. May was just making the smart move. She kept her views about the economic consequences of Brexit quiet, so that the Conservative right would accept her as leader if Cameron lost.</p> <p>Failing to state your honest opinion on the most important decision Britain has taken in decades may seem cowardly enough. But the consequences of May\u2019s pretence do not stop with one referendum.</p> <p>Her manoeuvres have forced her into a position where she must make arguments she cannot possibly believe, on behalf of causes she cannot possibly believe in. Her behaviour shows that, far from \u201ctaking back control\u201d, Brexit is depriving us of the ability to take decisions, giving privileges to the special interests the Leave campaign claimed it was fighting against, and imposing burdens on the taxpayer far greater than the mythical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\">\u00a3350 million a week</a> that Vote Leave said we sent to Brussels.</p> <p>Example: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37766708\">May opposed</a> a new runway for Heathrow. Maybe she was just thinking about her constituents whose peace will be wrecked. Maybe she was worried about cramming an expanded airport into a dangerously overcrowded corner of London. The point, post-Brexit, is surely that the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37766708\">environmental or logistical arguments </a>no longer matter. As her government admitted, May had to approve Heathrow <a href=\"http://time.com/4544082/heathrow-expansion-third-runway-brexit/\">to prove to sceptical markets</a> that she had a \u201ccommitment to keeping the UK open for business now and in the future\u201d.</p> <p>Her objections to the Hinkley Point nuclear power station were just as reasonable. Chinese investment threatened handing control of a part of our energy supply to a potentially hostile foreign power. As pertinently, Hinkley\u2019s proposed reactor is fantastically expensive and next to impossible to build. (A forerunner in Finland is nine years behind schedule and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a31b76ae-ec2a-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4\">\u20ac5.2bn over budget</a>.)</p> <p>When May called in the decision to go ahead with Hinkley, she looked like the proud prime minister of the newly independent nation that Vote Leave promised us. Until, that is, Xinhua, the official news agency of the Chinese Communist party, explained Britain\u2019s new place in the world. \u201cA kingdom striving to pull itself out of the Brexit aftermath\u201d could not afford to \u201cdeter possible investors from China\u201d, <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-08/01/c_135554972.htm\">it warned</a>.

I won\u2019t go on about how a 52-48 vote was hardly the people speaking as one. Instead, you should understand her by looking at how, after abandoning her beliefs, May refused to level with the public and confront them with the hard choices ahead. Rather than speak plainly, she has embraced the Leave campaign\u2019s big lie that <a href=\"http://www.open-britain.co.uk/leave_campaigners_try_to_drop_their_false_promises\">Brexit will be painless</a>.</p> <p>To maintain the illusion, her ministers scramble in secret meetings to cut deals with special interests. Whatever <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/27/no-10-denies-sweetheart-deal-with-nissan\">bribes they have offered Nissan</a> will only be the start. Farmers, the City and corporations with muscle will all want taxpayers\u2019 money to compensate them for their losses. The bill will be picked up by small businesses, which cannot afford lobbyists and, of course, by the taxpayers, who will fund the right\u2019s illusion that we can have Brexit without pain.</p> <p>As I said, May had the reputation as a reforming home secretary and some of that reputation was deserved. But as she presides over an upsurge in racial violence and the gobby resurgence of ignorant-and-proud-of-it nationalism, it\u2019s worth remembering another moment in her time at the Home Office, which shows how willing she is to live with lies.</p> <p>You can trace the origins of today\u2019s yobfest to 2013, when the right manufactured a pseudo scandal about \u201chealth tourists\u201d exploiting the dear old NHS. Pressed by the BBC to say how much money thieving foreigners were stealing from the health service, May could not give an honest reply, for the Royal College of GPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/12/theresa-may-health-tourism-facts\">had already explained </a>that the supposed \u201cproblem barely existed\u201d.</p> <p>May did not care. The perception that there was a scandal mattered more to her than the reality that there was none. The electorate had the \u201cfeeling that people who are here illegally were accessing services\u201d, she said, so she must maintain the pretence.</p> <p>Now she is a prime minister of pretences, running a government where feelings matter more than fact. She pretends that we should leave the EU, even though she knows we should remain a member of the single market. She offers us the illusion that we are taking back control, even as we lose our freedom to act. She cuts deals in secret, in the hope that the public will never realise that her land of make-believe is an expensive place to live.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, during his ill-fated campaign to become mayor of London, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vViUKsJ42ZM\">Zac Goldsmith was interviewed</a> at an event celebrating India\u2019s Bollywood cinema. With his silver-grey hair and silver-grey eyes, his lofty height and patrician diffidence, he looked every inch like a man aching to be sitting at his favourite Mayfair eatery, but instead finding himself having to savour the uncertain offerings of some high street tandoori takeaway.</p> <p>He declared himself a \u201cBollywood fan\u201d, saying that he lapped up anything with a Bollywood theme. The interviewer then asked him about his favourite Bollywood films and actors. Suddenly speechless, the 41-year-old old Etonian\u2019s baffled expression suggested he\u2019d just been asked to describe Euclid\u2019s theorem \u2013 in Greek.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to give you one,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a favourite.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t exactly a deciding moment in the election, but it was the most graphic of a series of encounters that left the impression that Goldsmith was not born to get down with the people. In the event, the Back Zac ticket cracked.</p> <p>After a campaign targeting his Labour opponent\u2019s Muslim background and connections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/top-conservatives-condemn-zac-goldsmiths-disgusting-mayoral-campaign\">so stubbornly that it was accused of racism,</a> and even Goldsmith\u2019s sister, Jemima, said she was saddened by its tone, Sadiq Khan walked away with the mayoralty and Goldsmith withdrew to his Richmond Park constituency.</p> <p>But although he is a long way from being a natural in the spotlight, Goldsmith was never going to disappear into the constituency rigmarole of, for example, <a href=\"http://www.zacgoldsmith.com/barclays-to-retain-cashpoint-at-barnes-branch/\">saving a cashpoint in Barnes</a> from being closed. There\u2019s too much history and celebrity in his family, too much ease and speed in his progress to settle for the sleepy backwaters of life in a safe Tory seat.</p> <p>And lo, last week, Goldsmith announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/zac-goldsmith-quits-as-mp-over-doomed-heathrow-expansion-decision\">he was resigning</a> his seat, thus triggering a byelection, after the government said that it was going ahead with the plan to build a third runway at Heathrow.

So he is as good as his word. But not all observers are impressed. Some noted that the government has a very small majority, Theresa May is enduring a difficult period after the Brexit vote and the last thing she or the Tory party need is a byelection.</p> <p>They conclude that the move is less about principle than privilege. Writing in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> the political columnist <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3872680/Betrayal-pure-vanity-PETER-OBORNE-says-race-shame-Tory-MP-Zac-Goldsmith-s-decision-quit-Heathrow-moral-crusade-pure-self-indulgence-rich-man-turned-dud-politician.html\">Peter Oborne suggested </a>that Goldsmith represented a familiar type from London\u2019s centres of inherited wealth, of \u201cnone too bright\u201d men who lead \u201cagreeable but empty lives\u201d. \u201cTo put it brutally,\u201d wrote Oborne, \u201che\u2019s placed his own vanity above loyalty to his colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Whether this is true, Goldsmith is the owner of a demeanour that doesn\u2019t exactly express collegiate solidarity. Or as Oborne puts it, in characteristically blunt style, he \u201cgives the impression he\u2019s bestowing a favour on his fellow MPs by joining them in the Commons\u201d.</p> <p>Of course, if you\u2019re the beneficiary of a \u00a3300m Swiss trust fund, courtesy of a father, James Goldsmith, who built a ruthless reputation and a billion-pound fortune from corporate raiding, if you\u2019re blessed with dashing good looks and you\u2019re not much intimidated, as most MPs are, by the thought of losing your job, then you\u2019re probably not going to win any House of Commons popularity contests.</p> <p>A common complaint about modern MPs is that they have never had any job outside politics. They leave university, become political researchers, special advisers and, next thing, they\u2019re an MP deciding how the country should be run. But Goldsmith\u2019s story makes that standard model of progress look like a tale of epic struggle and sacrifice out in the big bad world.</p> <p>He was kicked out of Eton for possession of cannabis that, he insists, was not his. He did a crammer and then travelled around the world, staying in Ladakh in the Himalayas for six months, an experience that helped inspire his ecological thinking. In 1997, he got a job as reviews editor at the <em>Ecologist</em> magazine, which just happened to be edited, owned and published by his uncle, Edward Goldsmith. A year later, aged 23, he became its unpaid editor-in-chief. He then set about turning it into a less academic magazine, upping the circulation in the process.</p> <p>By 25, he was married with a child. His first wife was Sheherazade Bentley, herself the daughter of the renowned asset-stripper John Bentley and the Colombian actress and socialite Viviane Ventura. These were the years when Goldsmith developed an alternative organic image, in a multimillionaire kind of way.</p> <p>The Tory party, itself in the middle of an image overhaul, took note and made him deputy chair of its quality of life policy group, which produced a whole mass of greenish recommendations that David Cameron bought into when in opposition and then largely junked in power.</p> <p>By 2010, Goldsmith had been handed the safe seat of Richmond Park, near to where he grew up. His marriage was over, having produced three children, and he\u2019d taken up with Alice Rothschild, who \u2013 deep breath \u2013 is the daughter of a Guinness and a Rothschild, and the sister of Goldsmith\u2019s brother\u2019s wife, Kate, who later took off with a rapper.</p> <p>All very aristocratic. And, let\u2019s face it, not your typical tale of Westminster bed-hopping. That\u2019s the thing about Goldsmith. For all his protestations of normality or, rather, humility, he mixes and marries in an exclusive social circle of the ultra-wealthy.</p> <p>And with that kind of wealth and influence, team-playing is a discipline for the drones. The political columnist Matthew Parris called Goldsmith a \u201cgold-plated loose cannon\u201d and now, as of last week, the cannonball has been fired.</p> <p>But where, exactly, is it heading? Towards the Tory party? Heathrow? Goldsmith\u2019s career? All are possible, indeed probable, destinations. With an opposition in terminal disarray, only an act of sabotage or an early Brexit can threaten the government\u2019s comfortable lead in the polls. Fortunately for the Labour party, the Tories have their own self-destructive streak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f55e5661ac4eda6ea29772e4b8120dded07f0e56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f55e5661ac4eda6ea29772e4b8120dded07f0e56/0_55_2040_1224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Goldsmith, leader of the Referendum party, the forerunner of Ukip, and Zac\u2019s father.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Goldsmith, leader of the Referendum party, the forerunner of Ukip, and Zac\u2019s father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacqueline Arzt/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a sense, the pickle the country and the political class now finds itself in started with the Goldsmith\u2019s family\u2019s taste for rogue individualism. It was Zac\u2019s father, the billionaire, Tory supporting James Goldsmith, who in 1994 set up the Referendum party to campaign to get Britain out of the EU. The elder Goldsmith was from a Franco-German background and lived much of the time on the continent, but he was passionately against his fellow Britons enjoying the same freedom of movement.</p> <p>Although the Referendum party died along with James Goldsmith in 1997, it gave momentum to the surviving anti-European party, Ukip. And slowly Ukip made enough inroads into Tory support that Cameron was panicked into calling a referendum. Zac has called his father \u201cthe man who saved Britain\u201d.</p> <p>The rest is history, or a shaky future, but one small footnote of the resulting replacement of Cameron by May is the green light for Heathrow expansion.</p> <p>The arguments for and against that decision could fill a library, but Goldsmith clearly sees himself as the green hero of the hour. Just as the father, once a keen Tory supporter, turned his back on the party to fund an anti-European party, so has the son abandoned the Conservatives to stand as an independent. Polls suggest that he\u2019s the favourite to win.</p> <p>\u201cIf I see something that is wrong,\u201d Goldsmith told one interviewer during the mayoral campaign, \u201cI just want to do something about it and change it. It was probably drilled into me as a child, although I don\u2019t remember it being drilled into me as a child.\u201d</p> <p>It could be said that both Goldsmith senior and junior made principled stands, but equally they can be seen as acts of devil-may-care arrogance that comes with huge wealth. If so, the Tory party only has itself to blame. Attracted to the power and glamour of money, it promoted someone who was always likely to walk off if the decision went against him.</p> <p>Byelections are funny things. They can change the conversation, the sense of what is possible. Just as 20 years ago James Goldsmith set in train the movement that did for David Cameron, so might his son trigger the start of the demise of his successor, Theresa May.</p> <p>With its multi-generational plot, power plays and attractive cast, it\u2019s a story that has all the drama of a Bollywood film. Just don\u2019t ask Goldsmith who should star in it.</p> <h2>THE GOLDSMITH FILE<br></h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>Frank Zacharias Robin Goldsmith, 20 January 1975 in London.

  "<p>When the SNP finally wakes up and realises that it had better fire the starting gun soon on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/nicola-sturgeon-second-scottish-referendum-likely-in-event-of-hard-brexit\" title=\"\"> second independence referendum</a>, it will be faced immediately with some decisions that will have a significant bearing on the final outcome.</p> <p>The first one will be to determine who decides what goes into the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-affairs-committee-quizzed-by-mps-over-brexit-as-pound-falls-again-politics-live\" title=\"\">white paper on independence</a>. This must be followed quickly by a decision on how significant a role the party itself will play during the campaign.</p> <p>The SNP, which has already been in power for nine years, is set fair for at least another decade. This is why those who have spun their tales for it for a few years are highly prized by the corporate community: not only have they gained experience in how decisions are taken but they can lead their new paymasters directly to the front doors of ministers, in the secure knowledge that the person sitting behind the desk will not belong to a different party.</p> <p>In the last two years, several of the SNP\u2019s most able advisers and strategists have walked into highly paid jobs with companies keen to maintain some connection with the party. If you want to see them in action, secure a small personal loan from the bank to pay the entrance fee to the SNP\u2019s next massive party convention. In the hall set aside for the purposes of allowing corporations to sell you their products, you will soon see how busy is the bridge between the SNP\u2019s back office and the private sector.</p> <p>It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that by the time the SNP finally leaves office, around 20 years will have elapsed. A chap could grow accustomed to snapping his fingers and making things happen during a 20-year administration. Why would he want to jeopardise it by sailing in the choppy waters of the constitution? In this place, danger lurks everywhere.</p> <p>To lose two referendums in a row would lead to disillusionment among the 100,000 new members and a possible return to apathy or apathy\u2019s little brother: the Labour party in Scotland. To actually win the next one is virtually to consign your party to the history books, with a note of thanks for helping us over the line. Who needs all that uncertainty when you can have a ball for a few more years, getting people to do as you ask and embellishing your CV?</p> <p>I\u2019m sure, though, that once it realises that, in an affluent country that isn\u2019t actually being physically occupied by a hostile foreign foe, enthusiasm for self-determination is a fragile and capricious thing: it won\u2019t last for ever. This concerns those of us who would prefer that they get off their arses and grasp the moment at a time when the rest of the UK is turning in on itself and on the verge of committing the biggest act of economic self-immolation in European political history.</p> <p>What concerns some of us more is the prospect of the SNP once more leading the independence movement from the front and brooking very little opposition over tactics and authorship of the second white paper. The SNP, you see, is fast becoming the Yes movement\u2019s weakest link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/27/scottish-nhs-failing-demand-watchdog-audit-scotland-nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">Its mismanagement of the NHS</a> has been evident for many years, as is its excuse that Scotland has an ageing population. Well, there\u2019s one way of solving that: get people to drink and smoke more and take bobbies off the street. Isn\u2019t having an ageing population a desired socioeconomic outcome?</p> <p>But it is its spiteful little illiberal interventions that hint at something distasteful with the SNP; that, underneath all the lofty rhetoric about fairness and equality that lets it win elections and hang on to power, there is a reactionary core.</p> <p>Despite saying all the right things about the spread of betting shops in deprived areas, <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14795757.SNP_ministers_facing_conference_demand_to_resurrect_ditched_clampdown_on_betting_shops/\" title=\"\">the party curiously backed away from giving local authorities powers</a> to prevent the big betting companies buy up empty shops. Sure enough, there was a stall at the SNP conference the other week where you could get a selfie with the Scottish Cup courtesy of\u2026 the Association of British Bookmakers.</p> <p>The party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/10/heathrow-third-runway-expansion-scottish-government\" title=\"\">backing of a third runway at Heathrow</a> was another puzzle. Why would a party with a commitment to making Scotland the greenest wee country on the planet want to have anything remotely to do with a project that will pollute everything in its path and very likely be in breach of EU regulations on noise and air pollution? <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871\" title=\"\">If the SNP\u2019s fabled 56</a>(-ish) at Westminster are not too busy <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3384774/Hypocrisy-SNP-MP-630-000-property-empire-Nationalist-snaps-former-council-homes-makes-fortune-rental-income-despite-opposing-sale-social-housing.html\" title=\"\">collecting rents on their second and third properties </a>they will find that they will be required to ensure that Theresa May gets her way on this.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the fight for justice for miners falsely convicted of wrongdoing by a politically motivated police force during the 1984/85 miners\u2019 strike goes on. Many of these men were deliberately targeted on the orders of the Tories because of trade union activity and subsequently blacklisted and unable to find work because of the stain of conviction. Again, curiously, <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/snp-mp-calls-for-rethink-on-miners-strike-inquiry-1-3914268\" title=\"\">the SNP has refused to pardon </a>these men or mount a public inquiry into the conduct of the police.</p> <p>In the wake of the SNP\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/gay-men-convicted-under-outdated-scottish-laws-to-get-full-pardon\" title=\"\">plans to pardon men </a>convicted of same-sex sexual offences under outdated legislation, the Labour MSP Neil Findlay has written to the justice secretary, Michael Matheson, requesting that wrongly convicted miners receive a similar act of compassion. I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath, though.</p> <p>If the Labour party in Scotland <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/whatever-happened-labour-winning-back-scotland\" title=\"\">wasn\u2019t still starring in its own grim pantomime</a>, it would be exposing the reactionary nature of the SNP much more effectively than it does. My fear is that the SNP\u2019s essential conservatism will be laid bare during a second referendum. I\u2019d like to see the SNP take a back seat next time and then disappear when independence is gained and a government with an authentic commitment to social justice is installed.</p>",

Television programmes that focused on the subject received extra publicity in the tabloids, while the callousness of government policies and the valuable work done by immigrants in the economy were ignored.</p> <p>Rather than focus on true-to-life drama that might have enlightened viewers, the BBC, frightened by Tory politicians\u2019 threats to its very existence, concentrated its dramatic output on inaccurate historical soap operas, that falsified the view of our past.</p> <p>Add to this the government\u2019s appalling attitude towards those escaping from wars, torture and extreme poverty, its concentration of investment in the south, the obvious electoral wheeze of Osborne that was the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, the policy of selling weapons to dictatorships regardless of their intended use and you get a society where fairness is nonexistent and that looks backwards to a fictitious glorious past.</p> <p>When a politician emerges who promises change based on ethical policies, and who doesn\u2019t treat the voters like mugs, he is not only attacked by the rightwing media, but by the newspapers leaning to the left, which for some reason see him as too different from the Tories to win an election.</p> <p>Is it any wonder not only that the lies of politicians led to Brexit, but that Britain is in danger of being \u201cswept along by a dangerous politics of hate\u201d?<br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong><br>Liverpool</p> <p>Your editorial puts its finger on a dangerous pulse, a darkening situation that could easily spiral into something a lot worse. It is a pity therefore that it repeated current rhetorical pieties with the claim that \u201cthe referendum resulted in a popular mandate that cannot be ignored\u201d.</p> <p>If it were true that 52% voted Leave it might have a point. In fact, 37.5% of the electorate voted Leave. This is not by any stretch of a clear mathematical mind a popular mandate.</p> <p>Leaving aside constitutional matters about the status of referendums, what we have is a minority mandate based on a parody of the first-past-the-post system of our elections to parliament. Surely referendums should determine the popular majority will on a different basis to this, as happened in Scotland in 1979. If the referendum was a union ballot for strike action, the result would be declared invalid under current Tory trade union legislation. In this light, Tory pieties about respecting the will of the people are obviously hypocritical and inconsistent. There is no need to piously respect minority opinion in this way. When will a newspaper editorial be brave enough to follow this logic to its appropriate conclusion?<br><strong>Peter Seddon</strong><br>Brighton</p> <p>The woman who felt the \u201cnasty party\u201d image was electoral poison now sees toxic rhetoric as a winner. The referendum was an electoral ploy intended to enhance David Cameron\u2019s power base and his place in history. Theresa May\u2019s honeymoon blandishments are now exposed as duplicitous and meaningless. By the next election, with the ruinous extent of Brexit damage felt, not just by the few but by the many she publicly courted, she might regret giving full rein to her personal ambitions.

  "<p>If it looks and sounds like a scandal, is it really a scandal?</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\">latest Clinton email flap</a> has all the trappings of one. With evasive answers, shady characters and FBI investigations, there must be something going on. Right?</p> <p>Rather like Saddam\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, we may not know what\u2019s hidden or where, but it sure looks like the Clintons have been hiding something.</p> <p>Sadly, this reasoning is enough for most Republican voters and a good chunk of independents. It may be enough to depress support among Democrats just at the moment the party needs to drive a high turnout among voters.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not at all clear what the FBI is talking about in terms of Clinton emails. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-fbi-clinton-email-probe-20161028-story.html\">Some reports</a> suggest they are neither to nor from Clinton herself, in which case we have just consumed a giant nothing-burger. After all, we already know that the FBI has no idea whether the emails amount to anything of any significance.</p> <p>This raises the obvious question: what on earth was the FBI director thinking when he dropped his letter on Friday making it crystal clear that he knew nothing? As a rule, law enforcement agencies generally don\u2019t publicize the fact that they are clueless.</p> <p>Beyond James Comey\u2019s extraordinary intervention in the late stages of a presidential election, his letter raises another, more familiar question about the Clintons: why do they attract pseudo-scandals with such alarming ease and frequency?</p> <p>From the Clinton foundation to the private email server, from Benghazi to Weiner, from Whitewater to Monica, the list is as long as it is utterly spurious. Whatever crumbs of wrongdoing there may be, they don\u2019t amount to something worthy of Watergate, or even the myriad gate-suffixed scandals since. Questionable behavior is not the same as criminal or even impeachable conduct.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59nxm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851168\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5814032ae4b0219a00d39cc9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\">Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps the pseudo-scandals say more about the Clinton haters than they do about the Clintons themselves. But it remains true that there is a remarkable contrast between the clouds that hang over the Clintons and those over the Obamas.</p> <p>Barack Obama has not exactly luxuriated in eight years of hate-free politics. The haters have thrown their best at him: questioning his citizenship and suggesting he secret sympathies for Isis. They even accused him of wanting to pull the plug on <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/grassley-warns-of-government-pulling-plug-on-grandma/\">grandma</a>.</p> <p>And yet there have been no pseudo-scandals about his personal life, his friends and donors, or even open microphone moments. As a candidate he was accused of palling around with terrorists, cutting a sweetheart deal for his home, and following the lead of an anti-American preacher. Inside the White House, not so much. The integrity and self-discipline over the last eight years has almost driven the scandal-mongers out of business.</p> <p>All that\u2019s left are the obvious problems posed by a radical Islamist from Kenya looking to foment a socialist revolution from the Oval Office. Given that he has only two months left in the White House, Obama needs to speed up his secret plans or else he\u2019ll turn into an even greater disappointment to the rightwing nuts.</p> <p>The good news for the scandal-mongers is the next Clinton administration appears to be just around the corner. House Republicans are already prepping their subpoenas in case they can launch another <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\">several dozen investigations</a> into the newly elected President Clinton.</p> <p>In that context, it doesn\u2019t much matter whether the FBI\u2019s Clinton emails amount to anything more than political gossip. The Hunting of Hillary has only just begun.</p> <p>What does matter is the impact on voters in these final frenetic days of the 2016 election. Recent polling suggests that most voters have already made up their minds about whether Clinton is honest and trustworthy: they don\u2019t believe her. To be sure, they also think the same about Donald Trump, albeit in slightly lower numbers.</p> <p>But those poll numbers mean that the email pseudo-scandal is unlikely to change anyone\u2019s mind about the candidate. In the same way, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Bill Clinton\u2019s money-making schemes at the Clinton Foundation will affect his wife\u2019s honesty numbers.</p> <p>For many voters, this email story comes too late. More than 12m votes have already been cast across the country in early voting, representing around 10% of the likely total votes in this election.</p> <p>In any case, the polls were already tightening, as Republicans inevitably rally to their candidate, no matter how catastrophically compromised he is with the voting demographic commonly known as \u201cwomen\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s post-debate highs were unlikely to hold. In fact, numerous studies have shown that elections tend to end where the polls stand <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/11/12426346/trump-polls-today\">two weeks after the conventions</a>, despite all the fluctuations back and forth. That suggests this election will end up as a race in the mid-single digits as a margin of victory for Clinton.</p> <p>Of course we don\u2019t know what the FBI emails may yet uncover, and we certainly don\u2019t know what turnout will look like on election day.</p> <p>But we do know that the closing days of a presidential election are anxious times. Campaign staffers are exhausted and fear failure. The media is desperate for one more fix of adrenaline, one more turn of the story to upend the likely outcome. Supporters on both sides become obsessive consumers of any snippet of information that might tip the balance.</p> <p>Into this gasoline-soaked period, the FBI director just threw a burning match and walked away. But the dumpster fire was already raging in this shocking election, and the voters who find the whole scene disgusting will likely stay away.</p> <p>Never mind the emails. This election was already in flames.</p>",
  "<p>In the back room of a pub in Kentish Town, a group of middle-class Londoners are perched on velvet-covered stools, eating hummus and talking about property. On the wall, above a pile of empty beer kegs, a slide presentation is in progress. A video of Airbnb\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQN9Uflzp9I\">advert</a> shows smiling hosts opening their front doors and declaring their support for Sadiq Khan\u2019s post-Brexit \u201cLondon is open\u201d campaign.</p> <p>The audience of Airbnb hosts are there after receiving individual invitations from the company to a \u201chome sharers\u201d meet-up \u2013 a concept largely unfamiliar to the slightly bemused crowd. Jonathan, an enthusiastic Californian Airbnb employee, who was recently seconded to London to set up the clubs, is happy to explain: \u201cHomesharing clubs are simply a way of organising this into something \u2026 that has a unified voice \u2026 then actually takes actions as a collective,\u201d he says, in a less than clear answer.</p> <p>More simply, homesharing clubs are advocacy groups made up of Airbnb hosts \u2013 loose, informal lobbying groups that push the company\u2019s agenda to politicians. The clubs are part of a what is fast becoming a concerted fightback by Airbnb, the website founded in 2008 when three college friends rented out air mattresses in their San Francisco flat as a way of making money, to become one of the biggest online travel brands in the world.</p> <p>But its phenomenal growth is proving to be its greatest liability. Authorities in cities around the world fear the impact it is having on their communities and are now seeking to arrest Airbnb\u2019s near unfettered expansion.</p> <p>The latest in a series of attempts around the world to curb its growth came earlier this month when <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-21/n-y-governor-cuomo-signs-bill-to-fine-illegal-airbnb-hosts\">New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill</a> that will fine tenants or landlords who let out unoccupied flatsfor less than 30 days.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Dublin, the owners of one flat have recently been prohibited from using it as an Airbnb let without planning permission, raising the prospect of copycat actions elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/airbnb-rent-unaffordable-elizabeth-warren-neighborhoods\">Airbnb is driving up the rent in your urban neighborhood | Alexander Zaitchik</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/01/berlin-authorities-taking-stand-against-airbnb-rental-boom\">In Berlin,</a> people who let more than half of their flat short-term without obtaining permission from the city council now risk a fine of \u20ac100,000. And in London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/10/airbnb-to-be-legalised-in-london\">a 90-day rule was introduced last year</a> under which no property can be rented out on Airbnb, or any similar service, for more than three months a year without planning permission.</p> <p>So how is Airbnb responding? In New York the company has filed a lawsuit in the US federal court. But at a wider level the company is now supporting efforts to prevent these types of actions from taking place in the first place. And the best way to do this, Airbnb thinks, is to get its millions of hosts to rise up on its behalf.</p> <p>Last year the company announced plans for 2016 to create homesharing clubs in 100 cities around the world. The aim, it said, was to form \u201ca powerful people-to-people based political advocacy bloc\u201d.</p> <p>The bulk of the clubs are in North America, with a couple in Australia, South America and Asia, and an increasing number in Europe. In Britain, however, the number of clubs is negligible, even though there are more than 40,000 listings on Airbnb. The company is concentrating its efforts on building this UK base. Meetings, such as the one at the Abbey Tavern in Kentish Town, have been happening all over London as Airbnb seeks to build a grassroots campaign to fight the threat of greater regulation and more restrictive policies.</p> <p>The hosts at the Kentish Town meeting are told that, earlier this year in Berlin, Airbnb \u201cdropped the ball\u201d after the city\u2019s ruling on short-term lets \u2013 the suggestion being that it did not want this to happen again elsewhere. As a result of that ruling, the <a href=\"https://www.airbnbaction.com/berlin/\">Berlin Home Sharers Club</a> was created and started lobbying to try to change what it saw to be an unfair policy. In London, the 90-day rule may itself not be onerous compared to other cities, but there are growing calls for further regulations .</p> <p>Airbnb\u2019s Jonathan steers clear of telling the group that they should lobby for change. \u201cOn the one hand, would Airbnb like to see homesharing groups set up all over Europe? Absolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cWould it share in their interests? Absolutely. But whether those sharing clubs decide that their only interest is to share electricians and plumbers or to take political action is completely up to them,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The next slide focuses on Barcelona, a city where, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/07/airbnb-fined-illegal-tourist-lets-barcelona-catalonia\">Airbnb was fined \u20ac30,000</a> for breaching tourism laws. Later, another slide listing \u201cwrite to your MP\u201d as a suggested activity is shown. \u201cWriting letters to local newspapers and selected officials is obviously something that we would want to see concerned hosts do, but only if it applies to them and if they\u2019re motivated to do so,\u201d Jonathan says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/13/airbnb-cities-urge-government-crackdown-elizabeth-warren\">Lawmakers join Elizabeth Warren's call for US to 'step in' on illegal Airbnb hotels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chris Lehane, Airbnb\u2019s head of global policy and communications, said the clubs act as \u201ca voice against the powerful\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese folks absolutely should have the capacity to go out there and represent themselves, and we\u2019ve been clear that we want to provide that support and provide some of the infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can be an incredibly effective advocacy tool. I think we\u2019ve been pretty transparent and open about that.\u201d</p> <p>The networks of host groups, which in effect lobby on behalf of the company, are an illustration of how far Airbnb has grown since its inception in 2007. Back then, founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia could not afford the rent on their San Francisco flat and so put three airbeds on the floor and charged $80 a piece for their first guests.<br></p> <p>Even by the rapid standards of growth in the tech industry, the company has expanded very quickly. It is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/22/airbnb-valuation-500-million-funding-round\">valued at $30bn</a>, and claims two million property listings in 191 countries. That valuation puts the worth of the Californian firm at more than Hilton Hotels.</p> <p>Wouter Geerts, an analyst for Euromonitor International, says this rapid growth has led to the \u201ccorporatisation\u201d of Airbnb, with more listings from other hospitality companies and people with multiple properties. \u201cThat might be hotels or estate agents, serviced apartment providers. They all look at Airbnb and think \u2018actually what is stopping us putting these properties on Airbnb as well and making extra money?\u2019. And of course there are more and more stories about landlords that push out long-term tenants because they can make more money through Airbnb,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One of the most frequent criticisms of Airbnb has come from the hospitality industry, which has complained of the differences in regulation that hoteliers have to operate under, compared to Airbnb. But the organisation that acts as the voice of this industry in the UK says it is not just about them. \u201cMany councils in London have expressed their concerns recently,\u201d says Ufi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association. \u201cMuch of that is because the sharing economy \u2013 and in particular we are talking about the unlawful professional landlords, the pseudo-landlords operating illegally \u2013 has put a huge strain on rental prices.\u201d</p> <p>Increasing levels of hostility to Airbnb have also started to come from the neighbours of those who let their homes through the website. Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/09/beware-pitfalls-airbnb-rental-plansbreaching-leases-mortgages\">a property court in London ruled</a> that homeowners whose leases say that their homes can be used only as a private residence cannot rent out their properties as short-term lets. The case came after the neighbours of Slovakian interior designer Iveta Nemcova informed the freeholder of the building that she was listing her flat in north London on Airbnb. As a result, Airbnb hosts have been warned that they could be in breach of the terms of their mortgages and building insurance policies.</p> <p>One homeowner who spoke to the <em>Observer</em> said that the ground-floor flat in her building had been rented out on Airbnb by a tenant without the knowledge of the owner. As a result, the house insurance of the whole building was potentially invalidated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/06/the-airbnb-effect-amsterdam-fairbnb-property-prices-communities\">The 'Airbnb effect': is it real, and what is it doing to a city like Amsterdam?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In London, Westminster City Council is investigating 1,200 properties alleged to be let in excess of the 90-night limit. Enforcement notices have so far only been issued against two. \u201cIn practical terms it is a real challenge for us to gather evidence to prove that individuals are letting properties for over 90 nights,\u201d a council spokesman said.</p> <p>The scrutiny that Airbnb faces from both users and policymakers around the world comes after the site\u2019s runaway growth. John O\u2019Neill, director of the Centre for Hospitality Real Estate Strategy at Pennsylvania State University, estimates that the number of hosts has doubled in the last year with revenue up 60%. With that growth has come an ecosystem of support companies, typically property management firms that submit the advert for the property onto the website and then may manage guests arriving and leaving, dropping off and collecting keys, for example.</p> <p>The exact effects of this growth on the hotel industry are unclear. The British Hospitality Association said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d to say there had been an impact on the demand for its members\u2019 services as a result of Airbnb \u2013 and instead the association focuses its criticism on the effect on housing. Airbnb says that its growth has been a reflection of how people live, and describes the attacks from the hotel industry as \u201cdisappointing but not surprising\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/29/airbnb-europe-managing-director-olivier-gremillon-london-house-prices\">rejecting claims that it has a negative effect on the housing market</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHomesharing puts money into the pockets of regular people and spreads guests and benefits to more communities and businesses,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cCountless cities around the world have introduced clear home-sharing rules, and we will continue to be good partners to policymakers and work together on progressive measures to promote responsible homesharing.\u201d The vast majority of hosts follow the rules, it said.</p> <p>Where the Airbnb debate goes next, after such a period of rapid growth, is unclear. Some hotel companies, instead of continuing to fight Airbnb, have chosen to join it. \u201cThe larger hotel chains are moving away from trying to combat Airbnb. Initially there were some kneejerk reactions of \u2018we have to lobby against this, we don\u2019t exactly know what\u2019s happening, they are not regulated well\u2019. Most of the companies have moved on from that now and they have started to realise certain potentials that it brings,\u201d said Geerts. \u201cThere is this movement of looking at short-term rentals not as a negative, but more as a positive, and seeing the changing demands of consumers.\u201d</p> <p>This was illustrated in April when French hotels group Accor, said to be Europe\u2019s largest hotelier by room numbers, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-onefinestay-m-a-accorhotels-idUSKCN0X20BG\">paid \u00a3118m to acquire Onefinestay</a>, which offers short-term lets on expensive homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/22/airbnb-valuation-500-million-funding-round\">Airbnb raises at least $500m in new funding at $30bn valuation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Neill estimates that there are 70 lobbyists working for Airbnb in the US, trying to get favourable legislation passed to benefit the company. \u201cMost hoteliers I speak with have accepted Airbnb\u2019s existence and growth. Their concerns have more to do with levelling the playing field between hotels and Airbnb operators, because Airbnb has so many unfair competitive advantages relative to hotels,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others have said that regulators need to be fair in how they set out the rules that Airbnb and other similar companies must adhere to. Robert Vaughan, an economist with accountancy firm PwC, said there was a huge variation in those affected \u2013 from someone renting out their sofa, to landlords with multiple properties \u2013 and there is a difficulty in applying the same rules to all of them.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill says that while Airbnb may continue to grow, it will not have the free rein it had previously. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a free-for-all of unregulated growth as there has been in the past,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>Back at the meeting </strong>in Kentish Town, the night ends with a positive response to the homesharing clubs idea. \u201cWe need to write a letter,\u201d suggests one host. \u201cWe should meet every three months,\u201d suggests another. As the meeting draws to a close, nearly everyone agrees on the need for a club. Jonathan jumps in again: \u201cI do want to stress that there are other sorts of flavours to home-sharing clubs,\u201d he says, launching into a description of a collective bedsheet-washing initiative, but few are listening. As the meeting ends, the group are asked to put their hands up if they want a local club. Nearly every hand goes up.<br></p> <p><em>The Observer reporter who attended the Kentish Town meeting is an Airbnb host</em><br></p> <p><strong>Growing concern around the world</strong><br></p> <h2>BARCELONA</h2> <p>Authorities in the Catalan capital recently stepped up their campaign against homes illegally rented out to tourists using homesharing websites. Hundreds of listings were ordered to be removed, and Airbnb and another online rental firm, Homeaway, faced fines of \u20ac60,000 each.<br></p> <p>Homeowners who want to rent out properties to tourists must apply for a licence, and a team of 20 inspectors has been set up to find those who do not adhere to the rules. The city\u2019s mayor, Ada Colau, who took office in 2015, stopped the granting of new tourist licences for homes and hotels. She has blamed the rise in Airbnb popularity for growing tensions between residents and rowdy tourists.</p> <p>The number of people using Airbnb in Barcelona tripled to 900,000 in the three years to 2015.</p> <h2>REYKJAVIK</h2> <p>The 1,600 short-term property lets in Iceland\u2019s capital have to operate under strict rules introduced in June. The legislation allows residents to let their property for 90 days a year before they must pay business tax. The move comes as Iceland\u2019s population of 332,000 is set to welcome 1.6 million visitors this year \u2013 a 29% increase on last year \u2013 drawn by the glaciers, fjords, lava fields, hot springs, hiking trails and midnight sun.<br></p> <p>The move is one of a series aimed at controlling the rapid rise in visitor numbers, including <em>Game of Thrones</em> fans travelling to the filming locations of the television drama. One report estimated there was a 124% increase in Airbnb rentals in one year as residents cashed in on the popularity of the country, with more than 100 flats available on the capital\u2019s main street alone.</p> <h2>MOSCOW</h2> <p>Airbnb said last year that the Russian capital was one of its fastest-growing markets, fuelled by high inflation and low incomes. Activity doubled in one year, driven by an increase of single rooms in apartments, which were being listed for short-terms lets in an attempt by many homeowners to make ends meet, given the country\u2019s economic problems.<br></p> <p>The growing interest in Moscow on Airbnb brought it into the top 10 most popular cities by bookings on the website at a time when there was no sign of legislative regulation to restrict use of the service. The sharp increase came at the same time as falling wages, which were down 8.8% in the first half of last year. The average price of a private room for a night in the city is \u00a327, and \u00a345 for an entire home, according to the site.</p> <h2>LISBON</h2> <p>The city has bucked the trend of some of its European neighbours, and instead worked to make it easier for short-term rentals to operate. Hosts are required to register their properties as short-term rentals but there is no limit on the number of nights per year that they can operate.<br></p> <p>Mayor Fernando Medina has said people should not be scared of the new tourism dynamic and wants the city to be able to take in more tourists, in turn reducing the number of empty buildings in Lisbon. Tourism is seen as an important part of Portugal\u2019s economic recovery. Airbnb listings in the greater Lisbon area have almost tripled in the past three years.</p> <h2>SAN FRANCISCO</h2> <p>Although the city is home to Airbnb\u2019s HQ, it also operates strict rules for hosts, who have to register with authorities. If Airbnb advertises an unregistered property it can be fined $1,000 a day for each listing. One action group has posted \u201cwanted\u201d flyers. The crime? \u201cAirbnbing our community\u201d and \u201cdestroying affordable housing for immigrant, minority, and low-income families\u201d. Resident groups have campaigned against Airbnb and there have been reports of tenants being evicted so landlords can list on the site. Last year Airbnb successfully campaigned against Proposition F, or the \u201cAirbnb initiative\u201d, planned legislation that would have reduced the number of days owners can rent their properties. Airbnb\u2019s victory was helped by its grassroots homesharing club, which voted in large numbers against the law.<br></p>",

That is why I have invested an initial \u00a314m at 10 of our most challenging prisons, and shortly I will be publishing a white paper outlining the much needed reform across the prison estate to 2020 and beyond.\u201d</p> <p>But Crook said the crisis merited a more urgent response. \u201cLegislation will be introduced some time next year, by which time 100 people will have taken their own lives. She [Truss] has to do something now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s deeply distressing that this sort of thing is still happening almost 10 years after the Corston inquiry,\u201d said Ben Summerskill, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance, who pointed out that half of all prisoners return to jail after release. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf we had any other industry in the country where half the products got returned to the factory, ministers would have acted decades ago,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton exhibited the touch and confidence that defines a multiple Formula One world champion in Mexico City on Saturday night, amid the maelstrom of a tense championship fight with his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.</p> <p>A consummate lap in Q3 topped a dominant session in which Hamilton pushed to the limit of the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez and claimed pole for the Mexican Grand Prix, beating Rosberg by two-tenths of a second.</p> <p>Hamilton had been faster than his team-mate in all three practice sessions and was so again through Q1 and Q2. His first run in the final shootout with a time of 1min 18.704sec confirmed that form and was enough. Rosberg pushed but he was more than five-tenths back on every lap but his last.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/mercedes-f1-team-member-robbed-at-gunpoint-mexican-grand-prix\">Mercedes F1 team member robbed at gunpoint before Mexican Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hamilton, however, strung together a sequence of improving runs that came together on his penultimate hot lap, a performance which he acknowledged had been tricky. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough trying to pull out perfect laps when it matters,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely very challenging.\u201d</p> <p>The Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo were in third and fourth and the two Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel were in sixth and seventh, with an impressive fifth for the Force India of Nico Hulkenberg.</p> <p>Hamilton\u2019s 10th pole of the season could not have been more timely as his battle with Rosberg reaches the endgame and he is now in a position to narrow the 26-point gap. Rosberg will still take the title should he finish second to a Hamilton win in the remaining three meetings but the world champion needs to force the fight to the wire. It is crucial he has a clean getaway, an issue that has compromised his season as much as mechanical problems.</p> <p>Should he hold the place on the 800m run, the longest of the season, to turn one, he will be able to dictate the race and crucially have the first call on pit-stop strategy. He will also be in clean air \u2013 the best place for the Mercedes \u2013 and where he needs to be, since he cannot afford a DNF. His retirement and a Rosberg victory would mean the German claims the title here.</p> <p>Confident following his win in Austin and having dialled-in the car, he did everything required of him but only the first part of the business of keeping his title hopes alive.</p> <p>The two Williams of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa were in eighth and ninth with Carlos Sainz Jr putting in a strong run to place his Toro Rosso in tenth.</p> <p>Rosberg had left it late to secure a front row place and there was, briefly, a real danger that the consistency and determination he has shown all season, during which he has put his car on the front row, before penalties, for every race, was going to come apart. He was five-tenths down on his team-mate in Q1, six-tenths in Q2 and five again on the first hot laps of the final session.</p> <p>His last run was hooked-up well however and it finally narrowed the gap. For the race though, Hamilton\u2019s control and obvious ease with the circuit is already to his advantage. His time in Q2 was second-fastest only to Verstappen despite having to slow when coming up behind a weaving Vettel on the exit of the Stadium.</p> <p>Rosberg had needed to push because the competition have found some speed in the thin air of Mexico City and both the Red Bulls and the Ferraris had shown good pace early in the session. Verstappen in particular had another confident run. He has mastered the single-lap discipline well this year, with this second-row slot adding to his third places at Silverstone and Malaysia, fourth at Hungary, Germany, Singapore, the US and Barcelona, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/max-verstappen-youngest-winner-f1-history-spanish-gran-prix\" title=\"\">the race he went on to win for his debut F1 victory</a>.</p> <p>Both Mercedes drivers have the advantage of starting on the more durable soft tyres having set their fastest time in Q2 on the harder compound. Hamilton noted that the track had rubbered-in considerably over the weekend and lap times, already well up on last year, are expected to drop further on Sunday, with top speeds going into the braking zone on the entrance to turn one likely to exceed 227mph.</p> <p>There was disappointment for the local fans when Sergio P\u00e9rez could put his Force India only into 12th, splitting the two McLarens of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. The Renault of Kevin Magnussen was in 14th ahead of Sauber\u2019s Marcus Ericsson. Pascal Wehrlein had another creditable performance to put his Manor into Q2 and finish in 16th place, well ahead of his team-mate.</p> <p>Mexico\u2019s second driver, Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez, span his Haas on his final quick lap and was knocked out of Q1 in 17th place. Toro Rosso\u2019s Daniil Kvyat was 18th, the Sauber of Felipe Nasr in 19th and the second Manor of Esteban Ocon in 20th. Romain Grosjean in the second Haas had a battery problem and will start from 21st. Britain\u2019s Jolyon Palmer will start his Renault from the pit lane after he cracked his chassis on one of the sausage kerbs in final practice and could not take part in qualifying.</p>",
  "<p>Lisbon\u2019s 25 April bridge, a naggingly familiar span of red metal suspended between the Tagus and a bright blue October sky, has long borne a symbolic weight to rival the tonnage of cars and trains that passes over it every day.</p> <p>When it was completed, 50 years ago, the bridge was named after Portugal\u2019s dictator, Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar. In 1974, four years after his death, it was rebaptised to commemorate the day on which the Carnation revolution erupted to unshackle the country from almost half a century of authoritarian rule.</p> <p>Today the Ponte 25 de Abril, with its useful and more than passing resemblance to the Golden Gate bridge, is being invoked to represent yet another shift in the capital\u2019s long and turbulent history \u2013 as it tries to reinvent itself as Europe\u2019s leading tech hub.</p> <p>Even if the comparisons with San Francisco are fanciful \u2013 and, frankly, extend little beyond the fact that each has a red bridge, hills and good surfing \u2013 Lisbon has moved significantly closer to fulfilling its ambitions by winning the race to host this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://websummit.net/\">Web Summit</a>.</p> <p>The event, held in Dublin for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/08/dublin-web-summit-things-learned-tinder-drones-apps\">past seven years,</a> has been described as \u201cGlastonbury for geeks\u201d or, to the more serious minded, \u201cDavos for geeks\u201d. But however gleefully geeky the conference may be, it is also a lucrative and highly influential affair.</p> <p>The Lisbon conference will see up to 50,000 people descending on the city to meet, network and listen to speakers ranging from the founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tinder\">Tinder</a> to the director general of the World Trade Organisation, and from the technology chief of Facebook to the footballer-cum-investor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ronaldinho\">Ronaldinho</a>.</p> <p>Web Summit 2016, which runs from 7-10 November, is estimated to be worth \u20ac200m (\u00a3180m) to Lisbon\u2019s economy. Equally, if not more, valuable is the boost it will give the city\u2019s reputation.</p> <p>Cheap rents, a thriving cultural scene, ludicrous levels of sunshine and a high quality of life may have drawn young talent from all over the world over the past few years, but the country is still overshadowed by the 2007-2009 financial crisis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/10/portuguese-mps-force-minority-government-to-quit-over-austerity\">recent political upheaval</a>, and economic growth has been slower than expected.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that the government is not averse to the San Francisco comparisons. Manuel Caldeira Cabral, Portugal\u2019s economy minister, spent Wednesday afternoon listening to the concerns of dozens of young startups at an event in the Electricity Museum, which overlooks the Ponte 25 de Abril. He smiles at the parallels.</p> <p>\u201cI think California is sunny and it has a bridge just like ours,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea we want to promote is that we also have an economy based on knowledge and an entrepreneurial community that is growing.\u201d</p> <p>While the government is building financial instruments to boost the startup scene and attracting companies from the UK, US, Netherlands and Germany, said Caldeira Cabral, Lisbon was playing a key role in the country\u2019s economic regeneration.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re attracting them for a lot of reasons: because we have a financing system, a very competitive fiscal setting for startups; but also because of the lifestyle and quality of life that entrepreneurs find here.\u201d</p> <p>Like many of her compatriots, Ridhi Kantelal, a 26-year-old entrepreneur, had left Portugal to study and work abroad. But a visit to a hardware hackathon in her home town persuaded her to leave her job as a strategy consultant in London and return home and build <a href=\"https://www.noxidity.com/\">Noxidity</a>, a startup that uses smart sensors to predict the corrosion of industrial machinery.</p> <p>\u201cI realised how much great tech talent there is,\u201d she said. \u201cNormally in London at a hackathon, out of 50 people, you\u2019d get 10 developers and the rest would be business people. Here, out of those 50, only two would be from a business background and one of them would have an engineering background. Everyone else would be an engineer.\u201d <br></p> <p>She says Lisbon\u2019s appeal extends beyond its human capital. \u201cEveryone speaks English, there\u2019s great tech talent, and the cost of living is so much cheaper than London. On what I was paying for rent in London, I can live here and afford one or two trips to London every month. The weather is nice, the food is nice and the people are nice.\u201d</p> <p>But it is not only returning exiles who are being drawn to Lisbon. Former Downing Street adviser and tech entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/04/london-so-wretched-so-many-want-to-live-here\">Rohan Silva,</a> who now runs the creative space and cultural venue <a href=\"https://secondhome.io/\">Second Home</a>, has succumbed to Lisbon\u2019s charms so entirely that he is opening a Lisbon branch in December.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can get up from your desk at lunchtime and be at the beach in 15 minutes \u2013 that\u2019s much more LA than San Francisco</p> <footer> <cite>Rohan Silva</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The epiphany came, as such things often do, at 4am after a long night\u2019s drinking last summer. \u201cIt was just a very human response of, \u2018Wow! This place is really cool. You can stay out all night and drink without any hassle.\u2019 The creative scene is just great.</p> <p>\u201cWhat it really reminded me of, without sounding very old, was 2010 when I started the Tech City initiative \u2013 for the same reason. There was this little scene emerging and it just felt incredibly vibrant and really interesting, and that something big could happen. \u201d</p> <p>He takes issue with the San Francisco comparisons, which he dismisses as \u201crubbish\u201d and a little myopic. \u201cLisbon is way, way more interesting than San Francisco because it\u2019s not a one-industry town. I think the parallel is much more LA, actually, in terms of lifestyle and vibe.\u201d</p> <p>To underline the point, Silva says that members of Second Home in Lisbon will enjoy the services of a beaten-up old VW camper van that will whisk them from their offices to their surfboards. \u201cYou can get up from your desk at lunchtime and be at the beach in 15 minutes \u2013 and that\u2019s much more LA than slightly nerdy San Francisco.\u201d</p> <p>He contrasts Lisbon\u2019s creative and technological ascendancy with London, where young people are thwarted by the high cost of living, the lack of housing and the erosion of the city\u2019s nightlife. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to be a 23-year-old graphic designer or a 25-year-old coder and live in the kind of places where people want to live in London.

It\u2019s none of those: this is Portugal and this is Lisbon.\u201d</p> <p>For him, the city\u2019s resurgence is part of a long tradition of building international ties, a tradition interrupted by dictatorship, revolution and, more recently, by economic crisis. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe have a 500-year history of dealing with different cultures and different people: you\u2019ll find Portuguese-speaking countries on all continents and Portuguese citizens living on all continents,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve been doing \u2013 and doing well \u2013 since the 16th century. And we\u2019re doing it again with startups and entrepreneurship.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the startup people who gathered on Wednesday to talk to the government welcome its efforts to build the tech economy but feel more could be done. Joana Rafael of <a href=\"https://www.f6s.com/senseitech\">Sensei</a>, an analytics startup, says Portugal\u2019s archaic and bureaucratic labour legislation needs to be overhauled, and tax breaks offered to entrepreneurs.</p> <p>\u201cAs a startup, it would be good to get benefits when you hire highly qualified human resources in terms of social security and salary taxation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are investing in creating a product that has no revenue for the first stages of its development, so that would be an awesome support instead of just relying on public funding.\u201d</p> <p>Francisco Mendes, who was unemployed during the economic crisis, is now the co-founder of <a href=\"https://beeverycreative.com/\">Beeverycreative</a>, which makes small, low-price desktop 3D printers. He is cautiously optimistic that, with the right support, Lisbon and Portugal could be on the verge of a profound transformation.</p> <p>\u201cWe are quite small but there\u2019s energy and new thinking and new technology here and it\u2019s really happening,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are not Silicon Valley in size, but maybe in dynamism we\u2019re like it was 20 or 30 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Lisbon\u2019s hilly, cobbled streets retain their shabby charm and the paint is still peeling from many of its old and beautiful buildings. But the cranes swinging through the skies above are beacons of change.</p> <p>Kantelal\u2019s optimism is tempered by realism, a quiet patriotism, and an eye on the future. \u201cI don\u2019t think Lisbon will be San Francisco.

Comey stood accused of betraying the bureau\u2019s political neutrality, and came under growing pressure to make public everything he knows.</p> <p>The latest twist in a topsy turvy election arrived on Friday afternoon, when Comey said in a letter to Congress the FBI would review whether there was any classified information in new \u201cemails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation\u201d. In a <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/memo-press-what-comeys-letter-does-and-doesnt-mean\">carefully worded letter</a>, the director said he wanted to \u201csupplement my previous testimony\u201d about the original Clinton email investigation, which he told Congress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">had closed this summer</a>, and said: \u201cThe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta said: \u201cBy providing selective information, he\u2019s allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts. </p> <p>\u201cWhat little Comey has told us makes it hard to understand why this step was warranted at all.\u201d</p> <p>It is \u201centirely possible\u201d that the emails are duplicates of those already studied by the FBI in its earlier investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state, Podesta told reporters on a conference call, adding that Clinton would not be distracted in the final days of the campaign. </p> <p>In July, the FBI closed that investigation. Comey said at the time that Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal with their email practices.</p> <p>\u201cDirector Comey was the one who decided to take this unprecedented step,\u201d Podesta said, \u201cwe now learn, against the advice of senior justice department officials who told him it was against longstanding department policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p> <p>\u201cDirector Comey was the one that wrote a letter that was light on facts, heavy on innuendo, knowing full well what Republicans in Congress would do with it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s now up to him, who owes the public answers to the questions that are now on the table, and we\u2019re calling on him to come forward and give those answers to the American public.\u201d</p> <p>Law enforcement sources speaking anonymously told news outlets the new emails came from devices belonging to Anthony Weiner, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/anthony-weiner-sexually-explicit-messages-teen-daily-mail\"> disgraced former congressman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/huma-abedin-anthony-weiner-hillary-clinton\">estranged husband of Huma Abedin</a>, one of Clinton\u2019s closest aides. Agents uncovered the emails during an investigation into whether Weiner sent sexually explicit text messages to a teenage girl.<br></p> <p>Podesta said Abedin had fully cooperated with the FBI investigation from the start. \u201cShe\u2019s been fully cooperative. We of course stand behind her.\u201d<br></p> <p>Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said: \u201cThe more information that comes out, the more overblown this entire situation seems to be. That in turn has raised more questions about director Comey from his colleagues in law enforcement circles, to take this extraordinary step just 11 days out from a presidential election.\u201d</p> <p>Mook highlighted <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-officials-warned-fbi-that-comeys-decision-to-update-congress-was-not-consistent-with-department-policy/2016/10/29/cb179254-9de7-11e6-b3c9-f662adaa0048_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_clintonfbi1030-1142am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory\">a \u201cstartling\u201d Washington Post report</a> that senior officials in the justice department had warned Comey not to go public but he ignored their advice.

He too said it created more questions than answers.</p> <p>\u201cCongress and the public deserve more context to properly assess what evidence the FBI has discovered and what it plans to do with it,\u201d Grassley said.</p> <p>Some analysts speculated that Comey felt caught in a bind: if he waited until after the election, or if the new review leaked through back channels, he would have been accused of a cover-up. In an internal email sent to FBI employees, he said he was concerned about balance: the need to inform Congress and the American people versus the danger of a misleading impression about emails.</p> <p>\u201cIn trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Early voting is under way in 37 states, nearly 17m votes have been cast, and Clinton has a healthy lead in most polls. \u201cI think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails,\u201d she said at her press conference. \u201cAnd now they are choosing a president.\u201d</p> <p>Though his own campaign has been plagued by one scandal after another, Trump has regularly berated Clinton over the emails, and his supporters at rallies frequently chant: \u201cLock her up!

  "<p>On a day when all three of the Premier League\u2019s pacesetters flexed their attacking muscles, Liverpool relied on their own lust for goals to turn a potentially awkward contest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/29/crystal-palace-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">into a celebration of blistering intent</a>.</p> <p>Crystal Palace contributed to a captivating encounter, twice pegging back Liverpool as they endeavoured to contain the surges from the away team \u2013 no mean feat \u2013 but J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team were in one of those moods where they ooze goals. Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino showcased bewitching skills. Sadio Man\u00e9 should have helped himself to a strike or two himself. There was so much forward momentum it was not unreasonable to forget they even had Daniel Sturridge back waiting in those familiar wings.</p> <p>As it was, the selection comprised a team goal based on slick passing, two set pieces and a sumptuous lob. All very tasty from Klopp\u2019s perspective. He might well wonder about eradicating some of the defensive wobbles. But that is a poser for another day. Playing like this, Liverpool can be confident that if the opposition score, they will simply outscore them. They extended their dazzling run, picking up their sixth win from their last seven Premier League games and had verve to burn.</p> <p>\u201cSorry for this boring performance,\u201d Klopp quipped at the end of it all. Then he acknowledged that while the inherent characteristics of his team help them to overcome defensive deficiencies he would sooner have a little more cool control. \u201cWe cannot strike back every day, but we are good enough to find a solution in situations like this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut since I am at Liverpool I am happy with the character of my boys.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/29/crystal-palace-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">Crystal Palace v Liverpool: Premier League - live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It still seems unfeasibly early to be stoking up a title-chase narrative before Halloween, but such is the bunched-up nature at the top, all eyes turned to Liverpool after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/sunderland-arsenal-premier-league-match-report-olivier-giroud-alexis-sanchez\">Arsenal</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/west-bromwich-albion-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City</a> swept to three emphatically won points earlier in the day. What ensued, in a helter-skelter match, was extraordinary. Goals always seemed likely given the encouragement Klopp gives his forwards to raid in a high-energy pack coupled with Crystal Palace\u2019s clean sheet allergy this season.</p> <p>From the 16th to the 21st minute it rained goals. Liverpool went ahead when the vibrant Coutinho\u2019s scooped pass fell to Alberto Moreno, who hooked the ball back across goal. Emre Can arrived unmarked and his shot ricocheted in.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/29/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-crystal-palace\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59q6n\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2853491\"            data-video-name=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp: \u201cI am happy with the character of my boys\u201d \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581508a0e4b08d944ba4c0dc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161029JurgenKlopp_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846485&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846485&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/29/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-crystal-palace\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: \u201cI am happy with the character of my boys\u201d</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps some of smoke from the firecrackers hurled from the away end got in Dejan Lovren\u2019s eye, as there was no obvious explanation for the undercooked back pass which gifted Palace a route back into the game. James McArthur was on hand to score with a clever header, nudging the ball instinctively over the onrushing Loris Karius.</p> <p>The irresistible law of making up for painful mistakes ensured Lovren took centre stage again three minutes later. When Liverpool won a corner he was on point to beat his marker Scott Dann, thumping his team back into the lead with a header.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho sent to stands as Manchester United are held by Burnley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liverpool\u2019s threat bubbled constantly. The thirst for goals throughout the team is obvious and there could have been more as Firmino\u2019s attempt was blocked by Joel Ward, Moreno struck a post and Man\u00e9 scooped over with a free shot.</p> <p>In the spirit of the goal glut, Palace responded. Christian Benteke glanced the ball to Wilfried Zaha, whose inviting cross was met by none other than McArthur. Having already patted his head in astonishment after his first goal, he was at it again after nipping ahead of Lovren to steer in another equaliser.</p> <p>The heading contest was far from over. The crowd were almost confounded by disbelief as yet another looked goalbound \u2013 this time from Coutinho \u2013 only for Steve Mandanda to scramble the ball superbly on to the frame of the goal.</p> <p>It came as no surprise when Liverpool duly did the deed again. Just before half\u2011time Coutinho delivered a corner for Jo\u00ebl Matip to meet with full power. Pardew lamented that the game was \u201ca bit too open for us against a side as good as they are\u201d, which was an honest enough appraisal.</p> <p>Coutinho was at the heart of so much that was positive about Liverpool. Klopp rightly enthused about how much effort he puts in: \u201cHe is 24. His work rate is outstanding. You cannot be a genius every day so you have to be a proper football player. That is how the boys are.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/sunderland-arsenal-premier-league-match-report-olivier-giroud-alexis-sanchez\">Olivier Giroud and Alexis S\u00e1nchez at the double as Arsenal ease past Sunderland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Palace returned after the restart intent on coming back into it again. Benteke was dominant (Klopp intriguingly described his performance as \u201cwarm\u201d), taking aim at Karius\u2019s goal on a number of occasions. Zaha looked plaintively at the referee as he bid for a couple of penalties but Andre Marriner was unmoved. Pardew gave a diplomatic answer when quizzed about Zaha\u2019s appeals but was steadfast in defending his player\u2019s need to avoid an obstacle at speed.</p> <p>After one of the penalty shouts, the game swung suddenly, brilliantly, down to the other end. Jordan Henderson spotted Firmino\u2019s run and found him with a superb forward pass. The Brazilian lobbed Mandanda with beautiful precision. The shirt twirling celebration was worth it.</p>",

In 1980 he moved into the ranks of the IRA and started feeding information to British intelligence services. His cover was blown in 1982 when police used information he supplied to recover a machine gun. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Two years later, Gilmour became the focal point of one of the so-called \u201cshow trials\u201d of the early 1980s in Northern Ireland. The series of high-profile, large-scale trials saw dozens of suspected terrorists charged and tried based on evidence from individual spies known as \u201csupergrasses\u201d.</p> <p>At the time, there was widespread belief within republican communities that the trials were based on evidence from witnesses who had been offered deals and cash incentives by the British to spur them into spying.</p> <p>In 1984 Gilmour was the only witness in a trial of 31 suspected republican terrorists \u2013 a trial that became notorious when the then lord chief justice dismissed the informer\u2019s evidence as \u201cunworthy of belief\u201d.

Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, he said: \u201cIt is disgraceful that Ray died in these circumstances. He spent years begging MI5 for financial and psychological help. Instead they turned their backs on him. He was a broken man, a wreck of a human being, and they left him to die in the gutter.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Chris Hughton taught his former side a harsh lesson in the realities of the Championship as Brighton picked off a fragile visiting side and left Alex Neil ruing the worst defeat in his short managerial career.</p> <p>What had been billed as a tight encounter between evenly matched rivals ended up as a rout. Goals from Lewis Dunk and Anthony Knockaert complemented a Glenn Murray hat-trick and left home fans believing they can improve on last season\u2019s third-place finish. Norwich, who led the league 13 days ago, ended the day confronting each other in heated dressing room exchanges.</p> <p>Hughton spent two seasons in charge at Carrow Road, where his reputation as a safety-first coach never endeared him to the home support despite keeping them in the Premier League in the 2012-13 season before relegation the following campaign.

Irrespective of the opposition these days don\u2019t happen too often.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2016/oct/29/football-league-your-thoughts-fulham-hit-five-to-hand-huddersfield-reality-check\">Football League your thoughts: Fulham hit five to hand Huddersfield reality check</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hughton was full of praise for Murray, the striker who made his return to the club in the summer. He opened the scoring in the sixth minute, capitalising on sloppy play from Norwich\u2019s goalkeeper, Michael McGovern, but for Hughton it was his second goal, a firm header to finish a counterattack on the hour, that decided the match. \u201cGlenn is a proven striker at this level,\u201d he said. \u201cHe scores goals. He worked very hard, the first goal being a great example of that. It was a great opportunist goal. But the second goal was crucial. We were up against a very talented team, but they opened up more at 2-0 and we exploited the spaces.\u201d</p> <p>Murray\u2019s second goal was followed four minutes later by another header, this time from the impressive Dunk, who buried Knockaert\u2019s corner. Murray claimed his hat-trick in the 73rd minute, pouncing on another of the visitors\u2019 many mistakes to toe poke beyond McGovern. Knockaert completed a comprehensive thrashing when he dinked the ball home with six minutes remaining.</p> <p>While Norwich were in the game at half time, the manner in which they threw it away in the second half poses serious questions about their ability to bounce back to the Premier League at the first attempt. Individual errors characterised their descent from the Premier League and they have not mended their ways this term, ironically perhaps a consequence of Neil\u2019s commitment to playing attacking football. But the current Championship manager of the month is now under real pressure to keep his job.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say I feel let down and some of them will feel like they\u2019ve let themselves down,\u201d Neil said about his players. \u201cThey\u2019ve not got anywhere near enough to their standards. It\u2019s the worst result of my career and all I can really do is apologise to the fans.\u201d</p> <p>The 35-year-old denied that some of his squad are not up for the fight in the Championship. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case but I think they thought the game was over.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the second goal, that\u2019s where the frustration comes in. We have to act as top professionals. There was more said after the match today than what I normally do. Sometimes I don\u2019t think you think clearly after the match but that certainly changed today. They had words with each other and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p>",

The Australian ran towards the home 22, looking around for support, but opted to pass long rather than short and Adam Thompstone was unable to hold on. Leicester conceded a free-kick at the subsequent scrum, lost a lineout on their own throw after Sarries kicked to touch and were soon lining up under their own posts after Jamie George\u2019s run off the ball created the space for Chris Wyles to score in the corner.</p> <p>Saracens\u2019 second try came after 23 when Owen Williams, standing near his own line, kicked weakly down field. The home side had not been afraid to put the ball dead when there was no opportunity to roll it into space, but the Leicester fly\u2011half seemed wedded to a gameplan as he gave Alex Goode ample time to launch a counterattack. Mako Vunipola gave the move impetus and when the ball was moved right, Goode came into the line at pace and although his pass to Sean Maitland lacked accuracy, the wing had time to pick up and twist out of JP Pietersen\u2019s tackle to score.</p> <p>It was Maitland\u2019s fourth try of the season, evidence that Chris Ashton may not be missed. The Scotland international is more purposeful and alert than he was at London Irish last season, finishing moves smartly.</p> <p>Leicester had purpose but they were too loose and their kicking strategy, which seemed to be designed to take play out of their half, lacked thought. Their evolution from route one to all-encompassing has been trying: while they are more creative, they have become vulnerable defensively, conceding 17 tries in five away matches this season.</p> <p>They took play through 17 phases before Williams\u2019s 14th-minute penalty that made it 7-3, but they struggled in the scrum, penalised five times even though Saracens were without their two second-rows and had to conscript a flanker, Michael Rhodes, to fill in, and lost four of their lineouts with the hosts looking to put the thrower Tom Youngs under pressure from the outset.</p> <p>The Tigers set out to win the physical battle, but there was the sight, and sound, of Rhodes thundering into Pietersen, Mako Vunipola flattening his England colleague Ellis Genge, a first quarter replacement for Marcos Ayerza who did not return after a head injury assessment, and Ben Youngs found himself driven back 15 metres by Billy Vunipola.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/harlequins-worcester-premiership-match-report\">Harlequins enjoy routine win as Worcester\u2019s Ben Te\u2019o catches the eye</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was how the most successful team in the Premiership\u2019s history used to overwhelm opponents, but Leicester are among the pack chasing Saracens, and from some way behind.</p> <p>Saracens led 17-3 at the interval with Farrell supplementing his wings\u2019 two tries with a penalty, although he hit the post just before the break. When Billy Vunipola scored his side\u2019s third try after brother Mako won a penalty that Sarries turned into a lineout, it looked all over.</p> <p>One feature that has not changed with Leicester is their determination, down but never out. They brought Freddie Burns off the bench, not to replace Williams but give them a second fly-half and a more creative hue.

  "<p>This was the opening group game for England and New Zealand but it was easily the most important and how the Kiwis\u2019 celebrations at full-time showed it. Victory here and one win from the final two games would almost certainly be enough to progress to the final.</p> <p>Defeat? The fearsome prospect of having to beat Australia in the group stage \u2013 as well as Scotland \u2013 to stand a chance of making it to Anfield. That is the daunting task that awaits Wayne Bennett and England after another case of so near yet so far.</p> <p>Three years ago, as England seemed certain to qualify for the World Cup final, Shaun Johnson broke hearts with a last-gasp try that eliminated the hosts in spectacular fashion. Here, the deja vu was almost too painful to bear as once again Johnson proved to be the scourge of the English with another masterful performance, culminating in the decisive drop goal that went a long way to guiding the Kiwis to the final in three weeks\u2019 time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/sam-burgess-england-four-nations-new-zealand\">Sam Burgess insists England can still win Four Nations despite loss to Kiwis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For large parts of an absorbing Test, England appeared in control and seemed the better of the two sides. However, their inability to score points when it mattered proved to be their downfall \u2013 and they were made to pay as the fine margins of international rugby league were once again brutally exposed.</p> <p>It has been two decades since England last defeated Australia in a competitive match and that record will now have to end for the hosts to make the Four Nations final next month in Liverpool.</p> <p>Not even the return of Sam Burgess to the national side could inspire England enough to get over the line. The captain showed promise in his first game back in an England shirt since his return to rugby league, but on another frustrating afternoon, and although the margins continue to remain fine, the results remain frustratingly the same.</p> <p>The Bennett era had started routinely enough; some early indiscipline from the Kiwis afforded England two chances at goal they would not waste as two penalties from Gareth Widdop put the hosts into an early 4-0 lead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/australia-scotland-four-nations-match-report\">Australia open Four Nations with comfortable victory over Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>New Zealand looked somewhat fragile in the opening quarter with little end product and had some enterprising play from England paid off, the remainder of the first half, and indeed the game as a whole, could have been a different story. Ryan Hall found himself in space on the wing as England scrambled the ball left, but not far enough; Jermaine McGillvary was held up over the line before James Graham\u2019s try was ruled out by the video referee for a double movement.</p> <p>The fact they emerged from such a period of domination with those two penalties proved crucial, as it allowed New Zealand to mount a fightback. They hit back with a penalty of their own from Jordan Kahu on the half-hour and when Widdop\u2019s kick-off sailed out on the full it immediately put pressure on the hosts again.</p> <p>The pressure told five minutes from the interval when, having forced back-to-back sets on the England line, some slick handling from Johnson freed Jordan Rapana for an open run to the corner. Although Kahu missed the conversion, the Kiwis were well worth their two-point lead at the break.</p> <p>Half-time appeared to come at an opportune moment for England but the visitors would extend their lead two minutes after the break when, with the hosts pressing, Johnson picked off a stray Widdop pass to race 80 yards and touch down.</p> <p>With Kahu\u2019s kick opening up a two-score lead, it felt like a telling moment: but the drama was only just beginning. Within six minutes England had made amends for that Johnson try as Elliott Whitehead put McGillvary over in the corner but New Zealand rallied again, extending their lead once more when Rapana evaded some sloppy defending to claim his second.</p> <p>However, Kahu\u2019s missed conversion gave England a glimmer of hope and when Widdop converted Hall\u2019s magnificent touchline try \u2013 his 29th in 29 games for the national side \u2013 on the hour, the game was level at 16-16 with a thrilling final quarter in prospect.</p> <p>It became increasingly apparent that a drop goal may well settle the contest, and the Kiwis wasted little time in going ahead again when Johnson kicked a one-pointer with 15 minutes remaining. England scrambled, fought and attempted to level \u2013 or even win \u2013 the match in the closing stages, but they had no answer.</p> <p>Victory in Coventry next Saturday against Scotland is now essential but it is what lies beyond that will prove to be the greater challenge for England.</p>",
  "<p>The dry spell is over \u2013 in more ways than one. Manchester City had not won since Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s last goal, away against Swansea City on 24 September, but seven games later the Argentina striker found the net twice in the first half to catapult Pep Guardiola\u2019s team past an uninspiring West Bromwich Albion and back to the top of the table, where Arsenal had momentarily displaced them earlier in the afternoon.</p> <p>Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, who looks increasingly comfortable, capped a terrific individual showing with two goals late on in what was perhaps City\u2019s most dominant performance under Guardiola.</p> <p>That comes with a caveat, though, because their opponents were plagued by hesitancy to such an extent that their own fans chided them sarcastically before half-time with a chant of \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ball\u201d when they had managed half a dozen successful passes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/tottenham-hotspur-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester\u2019s Ahmed Musa strikes to frustrate blunt Tottenham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much had been said about Guardiola\u2019s longest spell without a victory but this response was emphatic, no matter the welcoming nature of their hosts.

That Ben Foster had managed the same amount of touches as both wingers, Chris Brunt and James McClean, by the interval spoke volumes for the level of control exerted by City in the opening 45 minutes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t push up,\u201d Guardiola said, \u201cso we had time to think about it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/watford-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">Watford burst Hull City\u2019s hopes thanks to Michael Dawson\u2019s late own goal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ag\u00fcero\u2019s first arrived in the 19th minute following an exquisite through ball from G\u00fcndogan. The striker composed himself before rifling low past Foster from a tight angle in a slick, almost effortless move that made the West Brom back four appear mannequin-like.</p> <p>The hosts\u2019 attempt to protect a clean sheet was understandable but their dismal response to falling behind was to concede even more of the ball. G\u00fcndogan, alongside David Silva in the centre of a four-man line of attacking midfielders, seemed to enjoy every moment.</p> <p>Tony Pulis, who signed a new contract on Friday much to the frustration of a substantial portion of Albion supporters, had sought to stifle City\u2019s midfield by pairing Darren Fletcher with Jonny Evans but G\u00fcndogan and Silva found continuous joy.</p> <p>Indeed, West Brom\u2019s marking for Ag\u00fcero\u2019s second was the opposite of stifling. Neither Jonas Olsson nor Gareth McAuley were alert enough to intercept a loose ball on the edge of the area, allowing Ag\u00fcero time to take possession, turn and send a stunning effort into the top-right corner from the penalty arc. His finish was immaculate but the 28-year-old should never have been allowed the opportunity in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cThey were too good for us, had too much quality,\u201d said the Albion assistant manager, Dave Kemp, who was sent by Pulis to address the media. \u201cThe players we\u2019re playing against are top drawer. They\u2019re not coming down from the job centre. They\u2019re very, very good.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho sent to stands as Manchester United are held by Burnley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Albion did grow into the game briefly when Jonathan Leko and James Morrison were sprung from the bench 10 minutes after half-time \u2013 the latter came on for Fletcher, who was harshly jeered off \u2013 but their end product remained so limited. Even when they finally made Claudio Bravo work it was bread and butter for the goalkeeper, who smothered a low, tame free-kick from Brunt.</p> <p>City continued to threaten on a regular basis. Nolito, who was booked for lashing out at Craig Dawson in the first half, accidentally obstructed a pair of goal-bound efforts from Silva and G\u00fcndogan, while Raheem Sterling, turning in another lively performance on the right, shot over following a botched Allan Nyom clearance.</p> <p>Foster denied Ag\u00fcero a tap-in for his hat-trick in the 72nd minute when getting his leg in front of a Kevin De&#xa0;Bruyne cross. The Belgian, sufferer of a calf twinge against Southampton last week, was introduced for the final quarter \u2013 another boost for Guardiola before Barcelona visit the Etihad.</p> <p>Ag\u00fcero unselfishly turned architect for G\u00fcndogan\u2019s first goal, jigging along the edge of the area before his lofted through-ball was deflected by McAuley into the German\u2019s path. Unmarked, and with time on his hands, G\u00fcndogan finished low past Foster for his second goal in a City shirt.</p> <p>His third followed in the final minute, a simple tap-in from De Bruyne\u2019s cross from on the left, though Albion already looked to have thrown in the towel. \u201cHe has so much quality,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe is really good with the ball, especially when attacking one on one with defenders.\u201d</p>",

The list goes on. Last week\u2019s 4-0 humiliation at Chelsea was just that; a deeply un-Mourinho like performance from a manager who has yet to fully re-mould his team in his image. United were rubbish at Stamford Bridge; it was Mourinho\u2019s heaviest defeat for six years.</p> <p>But United beat City 1-0 in midweek in the League Cup, and showed signs of improvement in doing so.

In the meantime, here\u2019s Jos\u00e9 on why Henrikh Mkhitaryan needs a little more time:</em></p> <p>The United manager explained: \u201cHe\u2019s not injured. Sometimes I confuse the meaning \u2018fit\u2019 in the English language. Sometimes you have the view that fit means you are not injured, sometimes fit is great condition and ready to compete. That is a different thing for me. In Portugal we use different words for different situations. Micky is not injured. He is training with the team 100% with no limitation in terms of his fitness related injuries.</p> <p>\u201cI think it takes time. Some players, their profile is adapted to come and play, some others they need more time to feel the intensity and the aggression, the game without the ball, the competitiveness. Many times players come from different countries. The style of football is different and the reality is different in terms of competitiveness. There\u2019s no other country where it doesn\u2019t matter the team you play against, you have to play at the highest level or if you don\u2019t you have no chance. Micky needs time to become the top player he can be.\u201d</p> <p>Mkhitaryan was named player of the year in the Bundesliga last season and Mourinho cited Willian and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda as examples of attacking midfielders who have flourished in his teams following difficult starts, at Chelsea and Real Madrid respectively.</p> <p>\u201cI think it will work out for sure,\u201d he added of the Armenian. \u201cI don\u2019t like to speak about players from other clubs but I don\u2019t think they will be upset with me \u2013 Willian, when he arrived at Chelsea, had problems to play. He went through a process, a difficult few months and then after he became a top player. The next season he became absolutely phenomenal and still is.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Di Mar\u00eda arrived at Real Madrid he also had to learn a lot about his game and a new reality. Sometimes it happens \u2013 sometimes with defenders but it\u2019s easier for defenders. For attacking players sometimes they arrive and go straight to success. Other times it takes a little more time. In Mikhi\u2019s case the process was interrupted by an injury that kept him out for about a month. To be out for a month in this process and then be fit but not fit to play you have to go through a process of getting match fitness and then you need competitive level to do it.

Sedition is notoriously hard to prove and the charge has been leveled only a handful of times since the founding of the republic for that reason. In the Oregon case, one juror said he would have had no problem convicting the defendants of trespassing but the conspiracy charge, which carries much stiffer penalties, was a stretch.</p> <p>In an age of anti-establishment anger, jurors also appear to have been swayed by the sheer confidence of the prosecuting attorneys. </p> <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/10/juror_4_prosecutors_in_oregon.html\">air of triumphalism</a> that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us,\u201d juror four wrote to the Oregonian newspaper, \u201cnor was it warranted given their burden of proof.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Pitcavage of the Anti-Defamation League, one of America\u2019s foremost authorities on rightwing extremism, said he could only imagine that courtroom dynamics along these lines had undone what had otherwise seemed like a very strong government case. </p> <p>\u201cI was hardly alone in thinking that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mere fact that many of the standoff defendants entered into plea deals rather than go to trial suggests that they and their attorneys also felt the government had a very strong case.\u201d</p> <p>There was similar incredulity at the not guilty verdicts in Fort Smith in 1988, as analysts pondered how the government could possibly lose a case against leaders and foot soldiers of the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nations, among other organizations, some of whom had previously been proven to have robbed banks and armored trucks, killed people, and openly called for the violent overthrow of the government.</p> <p>On that occasion, the jury\u2019s sympathy for the defendants was clear. One female juror started up a romance with defendant David Lane, previously convicted of murdering a talk-radio host in Denver. Another female juror ended up marrying David McGuire, charged with plotting to kill an FBI agent and a federal judge.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t help that the judge dispensed with standard jury selection and hand-picked an all-white panel over the objections of the prosecution. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/reaction-bundy-brothers-found-not-guilty-oregon-militia-standoff-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59k5c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849079\"            data-video-name=\"Reaction after Bundy brothers found not guilty in Oregon militia standoff \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58133036e4b0219a00d3993b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028bundy_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028bundy.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028bundy_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/reaction-bundy-brothers-found-not-guilty-oregon-militia-standoff-video\">Reaction after Bundy brothers found not guilty in Oregon militia standoff</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cIf we\u2019d had good jury selection, I think we would have won the case,\u201d the FBI agent targeted for assassination, Jack Knox, said in an interview years later. \u201cThe judge \u2026 was dredging right at the bottom of the barrel.\u201d</p> <p>Another former FBI agent with extensive experience of the radical far right, Danny Coulson, did not exclude the possibility of similar sympathies being at play in the Oregon case \u2013 on the side of law enforcement as much as the jury.

  "<p>By the time the final whistle blew the ground was more than half empty. For many, the pain of watching Sunderland stumble yet again must have been simply too much but those early leavers missed out on some exquisite football from Arsenal and Alexis S\u00e1nchez in particular.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/29/sunderland-arsenal-premier-league-live\">Sunderland 1-4 Arsenal: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side continue playing as beguilingly as this there can be few complaints should they be crowned champions next spring. By then Sunderland \u2013 who have registered a record-equalling worst start to a Premier League campaign after collecting only two points from 10 games \u2013 will probably be relegated but, although wretched, this proved far from their worst display.</p> <p>David Moyes\u2019s players worked hard enough, at one point pulling the score back to 1-1. It was just that they were embarrassingly outclassed, not to mention ripped apart by three visiting goals in eight devastating second-half minutes. The manager, though, looked for positives. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a difficult afternoon until the last 15 or 20 minutes. I didn\u2019t think we collapsed \u2013 we did enough not to be beaten by that amount of goals. We\u2019d grown into the game.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was that every time Sunderland upped the tempo, Arsenal elevated it higher as their hosts struggled to fathom the subtle sophistication of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s often deep\u2011lying attacking performance during a chastening afternoon in which both he and the inspired substitute Olivier Giroud scored twice.</p> <p>Sunderland had started quite well with Wahbi Khazri \u2013 a disappointment so far this season but integral to the avoidance of relegation last spring \u2013 offering brief cause for optimism. There was the cute dummy the Tunisia winger sold Mohamed Elneny, a couple of clever balls creating half-chances to the overlapping Billy Jones and Jermain Defoe, and a free-kick curved fractionally wide of a post.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08d5faf934db1b40b5f5120d06e67756fe606841\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08d5faf934db1b40b5f5120d06e67756fe606841/0_103_3127_1876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal\u2019s Alexis S\u00e1nchez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal\u2019s Alexis S\u00e1nchez celebrates opening the scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By then, though, Jack Rodwell had startled Arsenal by clattering into Francis Coquelin and Wenger\u2019s players were beginning to raise their game. Such formidable resolve swiftly began rendering Sunderland\u2019s positive beginning a cruel chimera. By half-time they had failed to direct a shot on target or win a corner.</p> <p>Meanwhile Wenger\u2019s team were hitting their stride, highlighted as S\u00e1nchez\u2019s beautifully angled pass dropped for Mesut \u00d6zil. When the playmaker\u2019s first touch proved true, local hearts were in mouths but \u00d6zil\u2019s second \u2013 a shot placed conveniently close to Jordan Pickford \u2013 suggested he was mortal after all.</p> <p>It should have served as a warning to Lamine Kon\u00e9 and his fellow defenders but Kon\u00e9 was found wanting when, at the end of a bewitching Arsenal attack adorned by 22 passes, Alex Oxlade\u2011Chamberlain sashayed past the bewildered Duncan Watmore and crossed for S\u00e1nchez to head in from eight yards. Momentarily frozen, Kon\u00e9 paid the price for standing off.</p> <p>Although Defoe had a volley rightly disallowed for offside against Khazri, the London club had assumed control. They could have gone further ahead had Alex Iwobi not bent his shot marginally wide after a one-two with Kieran Gibbs, while bookings for Khazri, Didier Ndong and Steven Pienaar offered evidence of Sunderland\u2019s struggle to contain the visitors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/28/premier-league-vulnerabilities-big-six-manchester-city-united-arsenal-tottenham-chelsea-liverpool\">Premier League vulnerabilities add to the intrigue among a putative Big Six | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moyes\u2019s mission was further complicated by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s habit of dropping deep, Wenger\u2019s supposed lone striker often taking up \u00d6zil\u2019s No10 role. Small wonder Kon\u00e9\u2019s marking sometimes seemed confused. His department became even more disconnected when John O\u2019Shea hobbled off to be replaced by the less reliable Papy Djilobodji, who was soon booked for a foul on S\u00e1nchez.</p> <p>Sunderland rallied , finally forcing their guests to do some defending. Nonetheless Arsenal were furious not to be awarded a penalty when Kon\u00e9 felled S\u00e1nchez in the area. A few minutes later, Sunderland earned a spot-kick of their own after Petr Cech sent the accelerating Watmore sprawling. After the goalkeeper \u2013 careful to avoid potential dismissal by keeping his hands close to his body \u2013 was booked, Defoe scored from the spot but a most inspired substitution on Wenger\u2019s part ensured it would be a strictly temporary respite.</p> <p>On for Iwobi, Giroud scored with his first touch, volleying Gibbs\u2019s cross past Pickford after another buildup featuring S\u00e1nchez. He then swiftly scored again, outmanoeuvring Djilobodji before heading in an \u00d6zil corner. S\u00e1nchez claimed the fourth from close range. All that remained was for Sunderland to be booed off \u2013 and Kon\u00e9 to swap shirts with \u00d6zil.</p> <p>Although Sunderland\u2019s next two games at Bournemouth and at home to Hull City could yet prove pivotal, there remains no appetite on the part of Ellis Short, the owner, and Martin Bain, the chief executive, for sacking their seventh manager in five years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m experienced,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep doing what I do.\u201d</p> <p>A rather happier Wenger was delighted to not only see S\u00e1nchez excel in his unique but highly effective deep\u2011lying interpretation of the lone\u2011striker role but also to watch Giroud impose himself after stepping off the bench.</p> <p>\u201cS\u00e1nchez is doing extremely well and Giroud is mentally strong,\u201d Arsenal\u2019s manager said. \u201cEvery time Olivier is questioned he gives you the right answer on the pitch. I admire him for that.\u201d</p> <p>Delighted with his side\u2019s \u201cresolve\u201d, he praised his players\u2019 reaction to Jermain Defoe\u2019s equalising penalty. \u201cWe had a great response,\u201d he said. \u201cThis team wants to play well together.\u201d</p>",

And it looks like he will: on current form, they\u2019ll be relegated by February. Yet there is some hope, perverse as it sounds, in the manner of their defeats. Most have been by one goal, often a very late goal. They aren\u2019t a total shambles. </p> <p>That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that they have two points from nine games, and there is already a significant danger that a false start will become a false season. If they lose today, they will equal the worst start to a Premier League season, made by Manchester City in 1995-96.</p> <p>A narrow defeat is the likeliest outcome against an Arsenal side who have recovered well from the rank humiliation of losing a football match on the opening weekend of the season.

  "<h2>Army of eights</h2> <p>If there is something that characterises this England side, it is the bowling pin nature of their batting contributions: little up top, a lot lower down. The numbers show as much: this year, England\u2019s sixth-wicket average is their highest (over 80), with the seventh, averaging over 50, their next best. Not for the first time, they were bailed out again by weighty contributions down the order, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/england-bangladesh-second-test-match-report\" title=\"\">Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid put on 99 for the ninth wicket</a> \u2013 the highest English partnership for that wicket in Asia. Instead of a tail, England had Zafar Ansari at number eight \u2013 who has opened the batting for Surrey \u2013 followed by Woakes (nine first-class hundreds) and Rashid (10). As cricket writer Dave Tickner pointed out, given the value of having a strong batsman at number eight, \u201cit must surely count as cheating of some sort for England to have three of them\u201d. While their army of eights haven\u2019t quite sorted the spin department, it has given England the level of insurance with the bat that no other Test side can match. <strong>VE</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/england-bangladesh-second-test-match-report\">Ben Stokes and Zafar Ansari help England hang on against Bangladesh</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Second of Mehedi</h2> <p>Long before Mehedi Hasan was a Test cricketer, he outlined his ambitions to \u201clead Bangladesh from the front\u201d in a 15-year career that, he hopes, will culminate with him becoming the best all-rounder in the world. If those declarations raised a smirk then, they certainly don\u2019t jar as much now. After marking his debut in Chittagong with a five-wicket haul, he became the first Bangladeshi to follow that with another five-for in his second Test. Conditions have been in his favour, but he has bowled with the control and nous of a spinner older than his 19 years. Fittingly, it was Mehedi who would break the ninth-wicket partnership, removing Woakes with his fourth delivery with the new ball. <strong>VE</strong></p> <h2>DRS has eroded faith in umpires</h2> <p>Back in the early days of DRS the standard line was that it was there to eliminate \u201cthe howler\u201d, aka the kind of decision from the umpires that Nasser Hussain might have got in the late 90s. Back then, no one foresaw that it might invent a new kind of howler: the one seen in the 25th over of England\u2019s innings. Joe Root propped forward and pushed Shakib Al-Hasan\u2019s delivery back to the bowler off the middle of the lower half of his bat and the fervent appeal from Mushfiqur Rahman behind the stumps frankly seemed bizarre. Still, the man behind the stumps, who couldn\u2019t see the shot, opted for the review despite Shakib\u2019s curbed enthusiasm. With a record number of decisions having been overturned in the first Test, this showed how far the players\u2019 faith in the umpires has fallen. <strong>DL</strong></p> <h2>England need to work out their batting order</h2> <p>It was a surprise, when Johnny Bairstow was dismissed, to see Zafar Ansari walking out at No8 ahead of Chris Woakes, never mind that Bairstow is far too low in the order at seven. Ansari is a competent enough county batsman, with three hundreds to his name and a respectable average \u2013 for an all-rounder \u2013 of 31. He is, however, a young man, on Test debut, sent out with his team 114 for six and in danger of collapsing against the lowest-ranked Test team (Zimbabwe don\u2019t count). It is strange that England placed so little faith in Chris Woakes \u2013 Test average 33 and arguably England\u2019s most in-form player \u2013 that he was stuffed down at No9 \u2026 where, almost inevitably, he played exactly the innings needed to grind England out of a hole and towards Bangladesh\u2019s 220. <strong>DL</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/29/bangladesh-england-second-test-day-two-live\">Bangladesh v England: second Test, day two \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Steven Finn remains a problem for England</h2> <p>That eyebrows were raised when Alastair Cook opened the bowling with Steven Finn in Bangladesh\u2019s second innings says enough. The Middlesex bowler is, clearly, an enormously talented cricketer and has performed well for England in the past. But with that talent and that height, England fans still cling to the hope that he can be their terrifying 90mph-plus totem. However performances such as in this match, which can be kindly described as anodyne, are far too common from Finn and he has never performed consistently in international cricket. Finn is 27 and should be at the peak of his powers; instead he looks increasingly like a wasted talent. <strong>DL</strong></p>",
  "<p>We are often told that in earlier times all cultures had a concept of the afterlife \u2013 that \u201ceverybody\u201d believed in some form of life after death, be it a journey over a river to a dark land, an eternity of hellfire and torment, a paradise with angels and ambrosia, or a reunion with loved ones. We have created many metaphors to carry us across the Styx. Some cultures believed, and believe, in rebirth and the migration of souls. In 21st-century Christian countries, orthodox religious services still routinely profess faith in the resurrection of the body. Painting and poetry and mythology offer us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/24/ten-best-visions-hill-literature\">visions of heaven and hell</a>, some horrific, and some, like Stanley Spencer\u2019s, reassuring and comforting. But I\u2019ve always suspected that most of us, even in the pious, priest-dominated Middle Ages, didn\u2019t really believe what we said we believed. Most of us knew that when we were dead, we were gone. We went nowhere. We ceased to be. That\u2019s what we didn\u2019t like about death \u2013 not fear of hell, but fear of nothingness.</p> <p>This is, historically, anthropologically, a heretical position to hold, and when I try to argue it I am usually shouted down. I\u2019ve got no historical imagination, I am told. Things were different then, scholars insist. Human nature was different then.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/21/rachel-cooke-shelf-life-anita-brookner\">Anita Brookner\u2019s rare and welcome take on old age</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And maybe it was. Even in my lifetime, I have known a few people of faith, true believers, who would certainly have gone to heaven, if there were one. More than a century ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/14/love-letters-barrett-browning-valentines\">Robert Browning</a> may well have expected to meet his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the hereafter, as he wrote in his great death-defying poem <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43773\">\u201cProspice\u201d</a>, one of the first works I ever learnt by heart. \u201cO thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee again, and with God be the rest!\u201d Their lives together on Earth had been so miraculous that one miracle more would not have been surprising.</p> <p>The delusion of an afterlife also seems to have a grim hold on modern-day martyrs, if we can believe all that we are told. But that\u2019s another story, another subject, and so alien to most of us that it is hard to contemplate.</p> <p>I would contend that in the largely secular west we now live in a post-religious era, where true faith in survival after death, pleasant or unpleasant, is restricted to a small minority. That\u2019s not a contentious position, but it leaves the rest of us to struggle with the meaning of death, as we can no longer see it as a staging post to somewhere else, or as a great adventure, or even, in the alleged last words of Henry James, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/james/jnote.htm\">as \u201cthe distinguished thing\u201d</a>. Death is becoming less and less distinguished.</p> <p>One of the problems with death in our time is that it becomes increasingly avoidable, or at least postponable. We are materialists, and we don\u2019t believe in the soul. There is no ghost in the machine. We find medical solutions to medical problems, we dutifully take our statins, and our financial advisers and their actuaries declare that our life expectancy is increasing day by day, hour by hour. This is meant to be a good thing, like the ever-rising price of property, but on one level we all know it is not. When more good news about longevity is proclaimed on radio bulletins, there is usually a curiously sombre note of foreboding in the announcer\u2019s voice. For it is not a sustainable trajectory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5545a526241e1654f6af18501fb8f1d3201dbe5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5545a526241e1654f6af18501fb8f1d3201dbe5c/269_536_5347_3208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A production of Gulliver\u2019s Travels: After Jonathan Swift by Radu Stanca National Theatre of Sibiu, Romania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A production of <em>Gulliver\u2019s Travels: After Jonathan Swift</em> by Radu Stanca National Theatre of Sibiu, Romania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Popular science and even academic conferences discuss the possibilities of human beings living for hundreds of years or longer, but some of us remember the terrible fate of Jonathan Swift\u2019s immortal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/14/death-end-of-life-care-differently-bma-report\">struldbrugs</a> on the island of Luggnagg, in <em>Gulliver\u2019s Travels</em>, condemned to live on with diminished faculties into extreme old age. Swift does not mince his words: his immortals (of whom the women are of course more \u201chorrible\u201d than the men) \u201chad not only the follies and infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the dreadful prospect of never dying. They were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of friendship, and dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their grand-children. Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions \u2026 they forget the common appellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are their nearest friends and relations. For the same reason, they never can amuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve to carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end \u2026\u201d He might have been describing the inmates of a 21st-century care home for the elderly.</p> <p>Even those egomaniac plutocrats who have had their heads or their body parts frozen in hope of the discovery of techniques to revive them in a distant future must have some doubts about the quality of life they can expect when they are brought back from the icebox. Oh, the boredom of immortality! The dullness of a death in life, frozen through aeons in a test tube! The ghastly awakening! The gruesome pseudo-science of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/20/cryonics-death-insurance-policies\">cryonics</a> is, of course, speculative, but that hasn\u2019t stopped a few hundred people going for it already, with more queueing up behind them. As we know from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/29/never-let-me-go-kazuo-ishiguro\">Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s poignant novel, <em>Never Let Me Go</em></a>, some people will stop at nothing in their efforts to extend their lifespan. Awareness of our mortality is Ishiguro\u2019s subject. We can trust him on that.</p> <p>Through our own mortal ingenuity, we are reaching a historical phase when we are beginning to fear old age and longevity more than we fear death. We can no longer look forward to the possibility of a sudden, unexpected, merciful release, or falling asleep in bed while reading a book (as my mother did), or ceasing on the midnight with no pain. Nor can we make plans to celebrate our departure as a grand culmination of our life\u2019s endeavours, with a gracious and grateful and possibly public farewell. That\u2019s because we know that officious folk are going to strive to keep us alive for as long as they possibly can, until we can no longer enjoy anything. Just to prove that they can.</p> <p>A bureaucracy of cruelty and fear, with diminishing returns, surrounds end-of-life care and possible pathways to the grave. It will drag us back from the brink, again and again if we\u2019re not careful, until life has become so intolerable and undignified that we pray to be gone.</p> <p>I sometimes ask myself, as I approach <a href=\"http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=hamlet&amp;Act=3&amp;Scene=1&amp;Scope=scene\">the bourn from which no traveller returns</a>, if I am afraid of death. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being afraid to die. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/sep/16/education.arts\">Dr Johnson</a>, that generous spirit and devout but tormented Christian, was greatly afraid. But I can more or less honestly say that I\u2019m not. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think about it \u2013 I think about it every day, as I have done ever since I first had children, those hostages to fortune. But I don\u2019t waste what time is left to me worrying about it. What I do worry about is living.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ae80af2fd90570931ac467188c4d87d1ddb638a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ae80af2fd90570931ac467188c4d87d1ddb638a/0_191_3216_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in the 2010 film of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s Never Let Me Go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in the 2010 film of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s <em>Never Let Me Go.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 FoxSearch/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How long do we want to live? This is not a simple question. The brain-freezers and person-cloners and perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/01/mark-zuckerberg-daughter-charity-internet-reaction\">Zuckerbergs</a> would presumably reply \u201cfor ever\u201d, which is a very stupid answer, as Swift pointed out long ago. But if you don\u2019t glibly say \u201cfor ever\u201d, what kind of term are you going to allot yourself? I went to a philosophy conference at Nuffield College in Oxford recently, at which questions of ageing were being addressed, with special reference to public policy on pension distribution and intergenerational justice. We were asked to adjudicate between various scenarios involving, for example, short and painful lives, or longer active lives ending in later years of protracted illness and incapacity. How should goods be distributed and wealth taxed in the future, in view of the evolving demographic of an ageing population? We were asked to consider the age at which we would opt to die, had we the choice, and it was suggested that these days we would think 70 too young, 80 about right, and 100 too old.</p> <p>The most startling moment came in a Q&amp;A session, when a normal, healthy looking middle-aged woman volunteered the information that she had been given a life expectancy of 100. Apparently this is now not unusual. She did not seem wholly happy about it, understandably: the prospect seemed more of a burden than a blessing. She did not want to be a struldbrug. Maybe in some circles it is normal to have one\u2019s life expectancy tested before, say, downsizing one\u2019s housing requirements or adjusting one\u2019s annuity. I can see the practicality of that. And I remember, bizarrely, a GP saying to my aunt: \u201cI can guarantee you until you\u2019re 90, but not much after that.\u201d GPs aren\u2019t often so forthcoming. And the doctor was right: my aunt lived on, independently, in her own much-loved though increasingly untidy home, then spent two unhappy years in care, and died aged 92.</p> <p>Not long ago, in 2014, I was asked to take part in a debate about the optimum age to die, which had been proposed as 75 by bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel in a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/\">provocative article</a> in the Atlantic. I remember the slight sense of shock when I opened this invitation in my BlackBerry as I sat innocently unaware in a Little Chef just off the A303 in Somerset. I knew why I\u2019d been asked: I\u2019d recently published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/02/die-with-dignity-margaret-drabble\">piece in favour of the right to assisted dying</a> (which Emanuel, perhaps surprisingly, opposes) and I was, at that date, precisely 75 years old. Time for me to go, obviously, other people were thinking. I declined, instantly: I didn\u2019t want to engage with this topic at all. And then I went back to the enjoyment of my cholesterol-packed, statin-moderated indulgence of scampi and chips. From big questions to small pleasures. That\u2019s how we keep going.</p> <p>I\u2019ve thought a good deal since then about the question of the fixed term. Emanuel didn\u2019t say you had to sign off at 75, he merely recommended that after that date you should refuse intrusive or expensive medical aid aimed to extend your life. You shouldn\u2019t use up other people\u2019s resources. (I have some sympathy with this position.) The novelist Anthony Trollope went much further, in his satirical novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/14/david-lodge-rereading-anthony-trollope\"><em>The Fixed Period</em></a>, set in 1980, and published in 1882, in the last year of his life: in this he invents a utopian (or dystopian) antipodean island society which has recently passed a law decreeing that, for the common good, euthanasia will be compulsory for all its citizens between the ages of 67 and 68. Naturally the inhabitants of Britannula, as they draw near that marker, become decreasingly convinced of the merits of the law, and all ends as one might expect. It\u2019s a grim little novel, and it depressed me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every day we read or hear distressing testimony from those who have had to make painful life-or-death decisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We should never be made to know, by external factors, the exact date of our death. It is too much knowledge to bear. The state should never impose a fixed death. It has not the right. Trollope\u2019s Britannula was as opposed to capital punishment as I am and, unlike Britain at the time, had abolished it: clearly the concept of a fixed period of life and of a state death sentence were some-how connected in Trollope\u2019s mind, and both seemed to him to be wrong. It should not be possible for some human beings to say to another human being \u201con such a day you shall die\u201d. We may choose our own date, and we may take ourselves to Dignitas in Switzerland to keep faith with it, but it may not be chosen for us. Autonomy in death is a basic human right.</p> <p>I don\u2019t mean to make light of the newly created ethical difficulties facing doctors, paramedics, bishops and legislators. The problems are real. Every day we read or hear distressing testimony from those who have had to make painful life-or-death decisions about removing pacemakers or turning off life-support machines. The issues are usually explored with scrupulous care, and we can hear them discussed in depth on Joan Bakewell\u2019s Radio 4 series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jul/14/inside-ethics-committee-review\"><em>Inside the Ethics Committee</em></a>. This doesn\u2019t prevent cruel miscarriages of justice, caused more often by bureaucratic and legal confusion than by bigotry or self-protection. We are in unmapped terrain.</p> <p>Bakewell, in her early 80s, personifies the cheering possibility of a useful and happy old age. But not everybody can grow old as successfully as she has, and remain articulate, beautiful, energetic, adventurous. More of us will dwindle away, and succumb to dementia, incontinence, loss of mobility and chronic or acute pain. Our bodies become our enemies, in the long run, and do not want us to go on for ever. There will come a point when we won\u2019t like looking in the mirror any more. We don\u2019t like to admit that there is anything repulsive about extreme old age, but I can remember, if I am honest, that as a child I found the spectacle of some of the very old alarming and frightening. We don\u2019t want to be kept alive as a memento mori to others. Let\u2019s go before that happens.</p> <p>But let\u2019s end on the brighter side of death. Many people have fun organising their own funerals or memorials, and of course you can\u2019t have a funeral unless you pay the price of dying first. Some I know have planned (and even paid for) everything in advance \u2013 the casket, the churchyard or the woodland plot, the hymns, the music. They have seized control. I haven\u2019t got that far, but I\u2019ve made it clear I want to be cremated, not buried in the cold earth. I wouldn\u2019t mind a sea burial, as the thought of being devoured underwater is strangely attractive to me, but I think it\u2019s hard to arrange, and I won\u2019t want to be a nuisance. I\u2019d like everyone to sing one of my favourite hymns, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.hymnary.org/text/turn_back_o_man_forswear_thy_foolish_way\">Turn back, O man, foreswear thy foolish ways</a>\u201d, because it is full of an indestructible hope of a better world, even though I won\u2019t be there to see it. But most of all, what really cheers me up is the thought that my grandson Danny has promised to sing at my funeral.</p> <p>I smile every time I think of this. I don\u2019t mind what he sings; in fact I don\u2019t mind whether he breaks his promise and doesn\u2019t sing at all, as I won\u2019t know about it, will I? If he happens to be in Australia at the time and doesn\u2019t want to fly back, that will be all right with me. But the idea of it, here and now, is wonderful to me. None of the Drabbles on my side of the family can sing at all, we are hopelessly unmusical, but he has a truly beautiful voice, with the help of which he and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/28/oxford-students-a-cappella-cover-draws-praise-shakira\"><em>a cappella</em> choir</a> reached the 2011 semi-finals of <em>Britain\u2019s Got Talent</em>.

It is the resistible force against the movable object.</p> <p>Cleveland, for a few golden hours, also felt like something of an antidote to, or at least a refuge from, arguably the most divisive and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/world/americas/united-states-trump-clinton.html\">poisonous presidential election campaign</a> ever. It is oddly reassuring to discover that there is still a place in the US not transfixed by Clinton\u2019s reckless emails or Trump\u2019s 3am tweets. Here sports comes first, politics nowhere. A baseball cap is still a baseball cap, not a marketing prop for making America great again.</p> <p>Thom Majka, a sales rep who keeps his Indians cap on through every game for good luck, said: \u201cThese fans couldn\u2019t care less about the election. Every day it gets nastier and uglier, not even talking about the issues. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have something as easy as playing a baseball game. It\u2019s like taking a shower: you\u2019re all cleaned up.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic and Republican nominees have historically high unpopularity ratings. Their contest has been extraordinary rancorous, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\">including a tense debate</a> in which Clinton castigated Trump over allegations of sexual assault and Trump threatened to jail his opponent. The blowhard billionaire\u2019s appeal to authoritarianism and cries of rigging have led some to fear an existential threat to the republic.</p> <p>But baseball, as American as jazz, as regular as the seasons, goes on. It is the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">storied and soulful of US sports</a>. It survived the second world war when Franklin D Roosevelt declared: \u201cI honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going.\u201d After reaching the World Series at last, Cubs manager Joe Maddon watched the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams and wept. While pro football is by far more popular, baseball is cultural bedrock, a social safety valve for a fractured nation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09a78ca96f21c3ef5ff778e4b1087f5a05539d93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09a78ca96f21c3ef5ff778e4b1087f5a05539d93/0_62_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indians fans gather outside the gates before game 1 of the World Series.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indians fans gather outside the gates before game 1 of the World Series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cleveland feels this more acutely than most. Three months ago its basketball arena, cheek-by-jowl with the baseball park, hosted Trump\u2019s coronation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-speech-republican-national-convention\">dark vision</a> at the Republican national convention. Where in July the strongman claimed that only he can fix the system, and delegates chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d, this week the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2013 led by the Hillary Clinton-endorsing superstar LeBron James \u2013 received their championship rings after ending the city\u2019s 52-year sporting championship famine. </p> <p>Where in July political hacks crowded bars and restaurants on nearby East 4th Street, this week sports fans erupted at every Indians run they saw on multiple TV screens.<br></p> <p>Where in July street vendors sold hats and T-shirts with slogans such as \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d and \u201cLife\u2019s a bitch, don\u2019t vote for one\u201d, this week the merchandise says \u201cHard working town Cleveland\u201d, \u201cLand of champions\u201d, \u201cC*town don\u2019t back down\u201d and \u201cI liked Cleveland before it was cool\u201d. And where in July party delegates walked behind high steel fences separating them from potential civil unrest and thousands of police, this week Clinton and Trump supporters rubbed shoulders, recalled learning the sport in corner parks and backyards, and went to the ballgame together. </p> <p>Cubs fan Joe Wiegand, 51, from Maniton, Colorado, mused: \u201cBaseball is a wonderful distraction from the workaday world and the issues at hand. It brings people together. It\u2019s an important election and this is just a game but this is not only once in a lifetime, it\u2019s once in three lifetimes. There\u2019ll be another election in four years.\u201d</p> <p>Wiegand had come to add to the joviality of the proceedings outside the Indians\u2019 Progressive Field (the name honours an insurance company, it has nothing to do with liberal politics). He bills himself as the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.teddyrooseveltshow.com/\">world\u2019s premiere Theodore Roosevelt reprisor</a>\u201d and was dressed for the part, including a \u201c1908 / Cubs\u201d sign attached to his top hat \u2013 referring to a year when Roosevelt was in the White House and the Cubs last won the World Series (the Indians need only go back as far as Harry Truman). </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are long suffering but always hopeful</p> <footer> <cite>Joe Wiegand, Cubs fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are long suffering but always hopeful,\u201d Wiegand said. \u201cThat optimistic statement: \u2018Just wait till next year.\u2019 We believe in the Cubs. There\u2019s a great sense of relief and celebration just being in the World Series. And I think we will win the World Series.\u201d</p> <p>As he spoke, Wiegand was greeted by old acquaintances: Cubs fan Wendy Menard, 56, and her partner Chris Frampton, 57, an Indians supporter. The couple, both financial advisers, recalled being nine or 10 years old when they attended their first baseball games. Frampton said: \u201cAs much as following Cleveland has been difficult for a long time, I\u2019m an Indians fan and always have been.\u201d</p> <p>Menard added: \u201cIt\u2019s in your blood. Cut me and it\u2019s blue.\u201d</p> <p>And how about the election? \u201cWhat election?\u201d Frampton shot back.</p> <p>The Indians\u2019 comprehensive 6-0 victory in game 1 on Tuesday, with pitcher Corey Kluber dominant, was celebrated by fans driving the streets blasting horns and high-fiving each other. The mood was more subdued on Wednesday as Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta took control over four hours in a raw 43F (6C); a crowd watching the game on two giants screens outside the park ebbed away into the night. A small plane flew overhead trailing a banner that said: \u201cTrump tried to buy and move the Indians.\u201d</p> <p>The Cubs, whose home, Wrigley Field, is one of the great cathedrals of American sport, seem to have most of the country rooting for them. They have been striving and falling short for more than a century. Author Rich Cohen <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/opinion/the-cubs-reach-the-promised-land-now-what.html\">wrote in the New York Times: </a>\u201cFor as long as anyone remembers, following the Cubs has meant embracing futility, choosing the losers over the winners, seeing the romance in failure.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201clovable losers\u201d have suffered a legendary curse ever since a tavern owner, barred from a World Series game in 1945 because he was trying to bring in a <a href=\"http://www.billygoattavern.com/\">malodorous goat</a>, proclaimed that they would never win the title again. But inspired by Cubs fan Bill Murray\u2019s film Ghostbusters, some fans have paraded the slogan \u201cI ain\u2019t afraid of no goat\u201d and this year the team have carried all before them. Barack Obama has expressed hopes for a Cubs victory despite being a supporter of city rivals the Chicago White Sox.</p> <p>Cleveland, meanwhile, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/cleveland-republican-national-convention-lebron-james\">relishing its moment in the sun</a>. It is one of America\u2019s poorest and most racially segregated big cities; only Detroit fared worse from the trauma of industrial decline. It has had to live down nicknames such as \u201cthe mistake on the lake\u201d while its river was so badly polluted that it caught fire in 1969.

When all the jobs left, that\u2019s what everyone clung to: our sports team.\u201d</p> <p>Majka, 63, whose daughter Stephanie favours the Cubs, agreed. \u201cCleveland is not a city people flock to as a major metropolitan area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 70s, 80s and 90s have been tough years and that\u2019s why people hold on to their sports teams. Things in Cleveland are consistent. They put up with tough winters and losing sports franchises. They keep on coming back, hoping tomorrow will be a better day.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in Cleveland are hard-working and good-hearted and have their hearts broken thousands of times. To have the baseball after what happened in June with the basketball \u2013 two tremendous events in one year \u2013 was worth the wait.

Majka says he intends to vote for Trump because he wants change from the career politicians who run America. But if he was forced to choose between picking the winner of the election or the World Series? \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the Indians.\u201d</p> <p>Most fans would make the same decision in the view of <a href=\"http://history.case.edu/faculty/john-grabowski/\">John Grabowski</a>, who teaches a sports history course at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \u201cThe election has been a long, brutal process and people are much more interested in the World Series,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is pushing the campaign off the front of the news locally.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The election has been a long, brutal process and people are much more interested in the World Series</p> <footer> <cite>John Grabowski, Case Western Reserve University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Grabowski cautioned against notions of baseball as morally pure escapism, noting the sport\u2019s own history of \u201cchicanery and trickery\u201d, but added: \u201cNonetheless it\u2019s linked to what America is supposed to be about \u2013 the field of dreams.

  "<p>The film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight</a> is extraordinary for many reasons, but to me it is most so for two. First, it considers black boys to be precious, at a time when news stories perpetually make it seem as if the United States considers them to be utterly expendable. Second, it acknowledges the effects that the stalking ghosts of premature death and incarceration have upon gay black masculinity \u2013 and it manages to do so without ever diminishing the lives full of complex humanity that black gay men still manage to have in America while navigating that reality.</p> <p>So often, gay lives in America are coded as white, and the forces that shape the lives of queer people of color \u2013 say, how immigration affects being Chicano and gay in Calfornia, or how police surveillance affects being black and gay in the New York \u2013 are ignored, as gay identity is usually swept up into whiteness. Moonlight eschews this reductivism entirely, brilliantly portraying in a lyrical story how love and connection attempt to take hold. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight review \u2013 devastating drama is vital portrait of black gay masculinity in America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that there are about <a href=\"https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2015%2F04%2F20%2Fupshot%2Fmissing-black-men.html%3F_r%3D1\">a million and a half black men disappeared</a> from American society by early death and incarceration is not a side issue to black gay men. It\u2019s certainly no side issue to Chiron, Moonlight\u2019s hero, who successfully seeks out a father figure, Juan (Mahershala Ali), only to lose him to an early death. And yet, Moonlight also shows how creative and brilliant black humanity is at being so much more than its pain. Director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/15/why-i-love-barry-jenkins-bim-adewunmi\">Barry Jenkins </a>doesn\u2019t dwell on Juan\u2019s death as much as he does on the beauty of his embrace of Chiron in his arms in the sea, on his smile, on his joyful proclamation that you can find black people wherever you go in the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9NJj12tJzqc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another gift Jenkins gives not just to American cinema, but to American culture, is that he depicts black boyhood as something worthy of rooting for to succeed. It is not especially difficult to make white boyhood precious. In the 2014 movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/19/boyhood-selma-american-sniper-race-part-one\">Boyhood</a>, director Richard Linklater encouraged the audience to hold as precious and unique Mason, a banal and totally average white American child who existed in an imaginary nearly all-white Texas. Mason and his friend engage in petty vandalism, and also drink and drive \u2013 and yet, Mason, \u201cno angel\u201d, was excused and held dear in a way a black child never would be. </p> <p>Lately, I have been thinking a lot about a <a href=\"http://news.yale.edu/2016/09/27/implicit-bias-may-help-explain-high-preschool-expulsion-rates-black-children\">Yale study</a> where pre-school teachers were asked to watch videos of very young children to look for signs of trouble, and eye-tracking software revealed their eyes went for the black boys first and watched them the most. And why wouldn\u2019t they? As consumers of non-fiction media in America, we are always being told that black boys are suspicious and that violence against them is justifiable. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/its-impossible-to-be-vulnerable-how-moonlight-reflects-being-a-black-gay-man-in-the-us\">\u2018It\u2019s impossible to be vulnerable\u2019: how Moonlight reflects being a black gay man in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same week Moonlight opened, a sign commemorating <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/22/us/mississippi-emmett-till-sign-bullets/\">Emmett Till, murdered for whistling at a white woman,</a> was riddled with bullet holes \u2013 a 14-year-old still considered suspect, six decades after being lynched. But white boys, like Boyhood\u2019s Mason, are considered innocent by default.

Jenkins and the actor who plays \u201cLittle\u201d Chiron, Alex R Hibbert, are extraordinarily effective at melting your heart. We root for Little Chiron and his watchful eyes, whether he is avoiding bullies or tepidly checking out his friends as they compare penises. When he poured boiling water into the tub, my heart was in my throat that he could be hurt.</p> <p>But what is more extraordinary, perhaps, is that Jenkins continues to retain our sympathies as Chiron develops into a less passive and more complex person </p> <p>The breadth of Moonlight\u2019s ambitions, and the deft way it deals with complexity is captured at the end of its second chapter, when something happens that chilled me both times I\u2019ve seen it. Chiron (now portrayed by Ashton Sanders) approaches Terrel, a bully who had ordered Chiron\u2019s friend Kevin to beat Chiron up, and smashes a chair over his head. The scene is stunning, not just as a surprise act of revenge from a character whom the audience has experienced as sensitive and sweet, but of how visually reminiscent it is of something that happened in real life. In 2015, a black man named <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://mic.com/articles/147556/what-bayna-el-amin-s-assault-case-says-about-racism-in-the-lgbtq-community#.gRCkNzilQ\">Bayna El-Amin </a>smashed a chair over a white gay couple in a BBQ restaurant in New York\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood.</p> <p>When a video of the attack went viral without context, it led to calls for an investigation into whether the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2015/06/report-accused-fugitive-in-chelsea.html\">\u201cthug\u201d</a> El-Amin had committed a hate crime against the white gay men. But the story was more complex. El-Amin identified as queer in some way, and claimed that the act was in retribution for a fight started by the white gay men he hit with the chair.</p> <p>Gay advocacy groups were interested in the case when it could have been about two white gay men hit by a straight black man, but lost interest when it turned out to be about a black queer man hitting back against white gay men who had started a fight. In different ways, the fictive, slight Chiron and the real life, brawny El-Amin show that it is possible to be black, gay and able to exact revenge against the person who is causing you pain by hitting them with a chair. These narratives muddle a clean victim-perpetrator narrative, do not go well for anyone involved, and are so human.</p> <p>The person I saw Moonlight with (another queer person of color) cheered aloud when Chiron hit Kevin, then sighed when the police showed up, because he knew Chiron\u2019s decision to defend himself was going to cost him dearly. (It also cost El-Amin, who was sentenced to <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/crime/2016/9/15/nine-year-sentence-man-convicted-chair-attack-nyc-restaurant\">nine years</a>.) By the end of the scene, we don\u2019t know for how long Chiron is going away for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ac7729663077f00fc54124c3a9497a6bbbc0d93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ac7729663077f00fc54124c3a9497a6bbbc0d93/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heart-melting: Alex Hibbert as little Chirone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heart-melting: Alex Hibbert as little Chiron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend, courtesy of A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Moonlight\u2019s third and final chapter, we do know that Chiron has gone away for some time (during which he meets someone who has now put him out on the block to sell drugs); that his friend Kevin was also incarcerated; that his father figure has died prematurely, and that his mother, Paula (Naomie Harris) lives under some kind of supervised control in a rehab center. When Chiron reconnects with Kevin, he is still on parole, and the experiences of confinement have heavily affected everyone \u2013 especially Paula, who is so broken by it she chooses to stay in the rehab center when she could leave because she can\u2019t survive outside.</p> <p>Even in the film\u2019s uplifting moments, it is depressing that everyone in Chiron\u2019s life is either dead or living under some form of state surveillance. Jenkins deals with this deftly, without being heavy-handed or dismissive, and makes the characters no less worthy of our support.</p> <p>The first time I saw Moonlight, I was worried that it could create a dangerous takeaway message: that if black gay men want to lead full lives, they should try to escape from the violence of other black men and into the arms of whiteness. A reading of the film to that point could be saying that Chiron\u2019s precious boyhood could not be trusted to other black boys and men and might better be nurtured elsewhere. </p> <p>As the 1989 film <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/pov/tonguesuntied/\">Tongues Untied</a> \u2013 still so relevant today \u2013 points out, it is common for black gay men to internalize a fear of one another and to buy into a push that we ought to flee into the arms of a white gay man. Like worshipping a Brad Pitt-like portrait of Jesus Christ in church, it is easy for black gay men to internalize society\u2019s pressure to idealize white men and believe that salvation can be had by being closer to whiteness. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64a659145a70e5a7df73b5b480ca26f03db5b585\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64a659145a70e5a7df73b5b480ca26f03db5b585/0_0_5640_3760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Hibbert and Mahershala Ali as Juan: a model of gay acceptance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Hibbert and Mahershala Ali as Juan: a model of gay acceptance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend, courtesy of A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the shootings of mostly Latino queer people at the Pulse nightclub, I have consciously been trying to spend time in queer communities of color, meeting likeminded folks who also desire queerness in skin that looks like theirs. But even among us, it has been sad to learn how often black gay men tell me that out in the world, those like them won\u2019t give them the acknowledging head nod on the street. Brothers have also shared their sadness that they think black gay men won\u2019t date them because they\u2019re waiting for a white boyfriend. So the first time I saw Moonlight, I worried the bullying Chiron received could fit into a flight towards white narrative.</p> <p>But on a second viewing, my fears were allayed for three main reasons. First and most obviously, Chiron doesn\u2019t flee into the arms of a white man, but to his friend Kevin. (Significantly though, like Juan\u2019s partner Teresa, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae\">Janelle Mon\u00e1e</a>, Kevin is also light-skinned, teasingly calls Chiron \u201cblack\u201d and only acted under the orders of the dark-skinned Terrel.) Second, Juan, Chiron\u2019s father figure in the first chapter, lovingly deflects any sense of shame little Chiron could feel when he asks what a \u201cfaggot\u201d is and whether he is one. Juan embodies some of the hardest masculinity in the film and is also a model of gay acceptance, slaying the canard that black people are more homophobic than white people.</p> <p>Finally, Moonlight is an all-black world, devoid of respectability politics. While it tells the story of ambiguous sexuality, it does so with unambiguous blackness and without shame. When stories eschew the white gaze and exist entirely inside of blackness, the protagonists and antagonists are all black. When Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage faces oppression from other black opponents and not from white people, this is not a denial of white supremacy. Similarly, seeing black kids beat each other up in Moonlight is not a call to abandon black masculinity as insufficient to cope with black homosexuality, but to wrestle with the reality of black gay men in its totality.</p>",
  "<p>At 9.48am on Thursday 21 July this year, Dean Evans sent his stepfather, Steve Howell, a text message. \u201cAlright?\u201d it read. \u201cJust letting you know I\u2019m OK.\u201d It was the first time Howell had heard from the 22-year-old in nearly a month. But then, he was in Syria, on the frontline in the war against Isis, and his mobile signal was patchy at best. \u201cI was just relieved to hear he was well,\u201d Howell says. But that night, Evans became the second British citizen killed in Syria while fighting Isis.</p> <p>Evans\u2019s final hours weren\u2019t spent in a military-grade tank with RAF air cover or advanced medical support; he was fighting with a multinational group of ill-equipped militiamen loyal to the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) of Syrian Kurdistan, a guerrilla group in which officers are elected by troops, and men and women fight side by side. A dairy farmer from Warminster, Wiltshire, Evans had smuggled himself into Syria on his own, having been recruited by Kurdish activists on Facebook. He had no proper body armour, and fought with a black-market rocket launcher that could jam at any moment. </p> <p>Evans was one of an estimated 40 Britons who have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight Isis since August 2014. To date, none has been prosecuted for doing so, although the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/90/contents\">Foreign Enlistment Act 1870</a> makes it illegal for any Briton to join a foreign army at war with a state at peace with the UK. More young British men continue to travel there, offering their lives to what might be considered someone else\u2019s war.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Howell is comforted by a single image: that Evans fell in a uniform. It didn\u2019t matter which one. \u201cAll Dean ever wanted was to be a soldier,\u201d he says. \u201cHis country wouldn\u2019t let him, so he sought a way to get a uniform\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cEven if it killed him.\u201d</p> <p>Howell is sitting on the sofa with his wife, Tracey, in the living room of their home in a picturesque market town near Warminster. A tough but affable man, he spent 20 years as a firefighter, and is heavily tattooed and stocky. It\u2019s a week since he learned of Evans\u2019s death, and already the room looks like an improvised shrine. Framed photographs of Dean cover almost every surface \u2013 buried in sand on a beach aged eight; in his army cadet gear aged 12; posing with the local football team aged 14. Most, though, show him cuddling his mum, Joanne. He looks slight and sweet and happy in all the pictures. All except one: at his mother\u2019s funeral, aged 17 and a half. \u201cHe was never the same after her death,\u201d Howell says.</p> <p>Evans was born on 7 October 1993, into a military family, in a military town. He was a small, skinny child who suffered with asthma and eczema. His mother split from his father, a British army soldier, when he was six, and met Howell two years later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"523bda61367f2c2f8407fb072f819115c32ec50c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/523bda61367f2c2f8407fb072f819115c32ec50c/0_0_636_1176/541.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Evans, aged about 12.\" width=\"541\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Evans, aged about 12.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Steve and Tracey Howell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was at around the age of six that Evans began playing soldiers in the garden, and a boyish fascination soon grew into full-blown obsession. \u201cWe\u2019d put on uniforms and make dens every day,\u201d says his best friend, Jake, 23. \u201cDean loved everything about the military and outdoor survival. He collected warfare books, kept a second world war medal collection under his bed and owned all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/03/ray-mears-q-and-a\">Ray Mears</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/30/bear-grylls-acrobatic-show-endeavour-tour\">Bear Grylls</a> DVDs. He was the only kid I knew who watched war documentaries for fun.\u201d</p> <p>The moment he turned 12, Steve and Joanne enrolled Evans in Warminster cadets. Wilderness training, weapon skills, tactics, tracking: he couldn\u2019t learn quickly enough. \u201cHe was so proud to put on that uniform,\u201d Howell says, holding Evans\u2019s cherished cadet epaulets. \u201cIt made him feel invincible. He\u2019d spend whole weekends in the garden, always in uniform, practising survival skills.\u201d He remembers once when, aged 13, Evans tried to camp the night outside. \u201cHe lasted until 2am, when he got hungry,\u201d Howell chuckles. \u201cWe only know because he set off the smoke alarm trying to cook toast. Joanne got up and made him a cheese sandwich.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He'd spend weekends practising survival skills</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everything changed in June 2011, after his mother\u2019s death. \u201cIt was an undiagnosed heart condition,\u201d Howell says. \u201cShe died in my arms in seven seconds.\u201d Evans had to be pulled off a cadets training weekend on Salisbury Plain so Howell could break the news. \u201cThe worst part was that he never got to say cheerio. It was the only time I ever saw him cry. It was as if his guiding light had gone out. She always told him, \u2018Deanie, you were born to wear a uniform. If your heart says be a soldier, follow it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Three months later, before his 18th birthday, Evans travelled to Salisbury Army Careers Centre to sign up. It did not go well. \u201cThe recruiter was obnoxious,\u201d Howell says. \u201cHe said, \u2018They won\u2019t take you, boy \u2013 you\u2019ve got asthma.\u2019\u201d Evans said it was only mild and that he\u2019d been a cadet, to which the recruiter sniffed, \u201cNah, that\u2019s boys\u2019 games.\u201d</p> <p>The knockback was devastating, made worse when three of his closest friends from the cadets were accepted. In July 2012, Evans thought he\u2019d found a solution: the <a href=\"http://en.legion-etrangere.com/\">French Foreign Legion</a>. He flew to France for a three-week trial. Steve and Tracey drove to Gatwick to pick him up afterwards. \u201cHe was heartbroken,\u201d Tracey says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to talk about it. All he\u2019d say was that he\u2019d failed the medical because of his asthma.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c120368cface617873afc3a1ad5b34bd3870f679\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c120368cface617873afc3a1ad5b34bd3870f679/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Howell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The army recruiter was obnoxious.

He enrolled on a farming course at Warminster College, got his driving licence and bought a secondhand Ford Focus. Then, in early 2015, three years after his Foreign Legion disappointment, Evans told Howell he was thinking of travelling around Germany and Poland to see the war graves, the Berlin Wall and Auschwitz. Howell thought it a good idea: \u201cI knew he was into all that, and he wasn\u2019t a troublesome lad. Why would I be suspicious?\u201d</p> <p>He left on the morning of 8 March. Despite having made Evans promise to text when he landed, Howell heard nothing for four days. He was worried. Then his phone bleeped. He can still recite the message verbatim. \u201cHi Steve, it\u2019s Dean,\u201d it read. \u201cJust to let you know I\u2019m in Syria. I joined YPG. I was always going to do this all along. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Evans arrived in Syria on 14 March 2015. Police analysis of his laptop would later reveal he had contacted the YPG through its Facebook page, where they pledge to \u201cwage war against all forms of fascism and capitalist hegemony that try to enslave people and destroy nature\u201d.</p> <p>He flew from London to D\u00fcsseldorf, then to Berlin and on to Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq. There, he was picked up by Kurdish rebels and smuggled through the desert into Syria. YPG commanders placed him in the Lions of Rojava brigade, a unit comprising mostly foreign volunteers, and gave him a nom de guerre: G\u00eevara Rojava, inspired by Che Guevara.</p> <p>The moment he arrived, Evans knew he\u2019d found his war. Burned-out cars, buildings colandered by bullets: it was like a film set. He\u2019d never been to war, let alone shot at someone in anger. But the men around him were his age and united by common purpose, much like the boys he\u2019d trained with in the cadets. \u201cBack home you have a lot of worries, about cars, money, social things, but here it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/13/dean-carl-evans-interview-isis-syria\">a reporter in Syria that April</a>. \u201cHere you just have one goal that\u2019s shared through everyone: defeating Daesh.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa9a3bd29711642dcdc3e71d33f80921c417ebda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa9a3bd29711642dcdc3e71d33f80921c417ebda/0_257_1917_1150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photographer Uygar \u00d6nder \u015eim\u015fek spent 12 days in Syria with Evans, on the right, and other YPG fighters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographer Uygar \u00d6nder \u015eim\u015fek spent 12 days in Syria with Evans, on the right, and other YPG fighters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uygar Onder Simsek</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paid only in food, Evans spent the next three months fighting alongside Kurds, eastern Europeans, Americans and other nationalities in the besieged city of Tal Tamr, near the Turkish border. That April, a Turkish photographer, Uygar \u00d6nder \u015eim\u015fek, spent 12 days with Evans\u2019s unit, working on a story about the YPG. \u201cWhen I arrived, both the YPG and Isis had dug in, their lines about 300m apart,\u201d he says. \u201cMost days were calm, so they\u2019d eat, talk, have tea, play chess, read, cook, listen to music, clean their guns and do regular guard duties. But at night a lot was happening \u2013 unexpected attacks, shooting mortars. Snipers on both sides worked around the clock. They hardly ever slept. There was no electricity or running water. Sometimes they\u2019d risk enemy snipers and run into a house in no man\u2019s land just to take a warm shower.\u201d</p> <p>Like the others, \u015eim\u015fek describes Evans as a quiet soldier who observed more than he spoke. \u201cHe seemed like a calm, nice person \u2013 with a Kalashnikov,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Evans would later tell Tracey about his life in Syria (Howell couldn\u2019t bear to ask): scavenging for edible food in deserted shops, seeing comrades blown up, dysentery, decomposing bodies, desert heat, flies, long days, sleepless nights, fear. He also talked of all the new friends he\u2019d made. He never talked about the killing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Snipers on both sides worked all night and hardly slept. Dean seemed a calm, nice person \u2013 with a Kalashnikov</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was an especially bloody phase of the war, and Evans had distinguished himself amid the violence, rising from infantryman to sniper to rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) gunner. \u201cEven when fighters with an actual military background cowered under fire, he\u2019d put his head above the trench to shoot,\u201d Arges Artiaga, a Spanish former soldier in both his national army and the French Foreign Legion, tells me over Skype from Spain. \u201cHe was there to destroy Isis, that was his passion, and he never deviated from that.\u201d Artiaga remembers one night when Evans had a particularly crippling bout of dysentery. \u201cYet when I ordered him to go to hospital, he refused and stayed on post until his shift ended.\u201d</p> <p>Heval Serdar, a Dutch fighter who asked to be known only by his nom de guerre, was Evans\u2019s best friend during that time in Syria. Now back home, he talks fondly of Evans, recalling his love of energy drinks in battle, his \u201cdry British humour\u201d, how he could quote entire chunks of his favourite TV show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/may/18/iprefertheamericanversion\">the US Office</a>. He was always telling people to \u201cchill\u201d. \u201cWe were like brothers,\u201d he says on the phone from Holland, \u201cbut we never talked about home. After all this time together, you know what we mostly talked about? Computer games. Though I always got a feeling Dean was looking for answers. Then again, wasn\u2019t everybody out there?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fd7464c5d82bc55f4b95bbb1d145c26fd859ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fd7464c5d82bc55f4b95bbb1d145c26fd859ef1/0_46_383_469/383.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Evans with his stepfather, Steve, and mother, Joanne, in 2008\" width=\"383\" height=\"469\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Evans with his stepfather, Steve, and mother, Joanne, in 2008. Joanne died when Dean was 17.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Steve and Tracey Howell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Months passed, and Howell waited. He and Tracey were assigned a case worker from special branch, but they say he seemed to know less than they did. \u201cHe had more questions for us than we did for him,\u201d Howell remembers. A team from Wiltshire police searched Evans\u2019s bedroom and seized his laptop and bank details. \u201cThey wanted to know who Dean had gone to join,\u201d Howell says. \u201cThey wanted to know if he\u2019d been radicalised.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in May 2015, Howell received a text: \u201cCan I come home?\u201d Evans arrived back in Wiltshire on 26 June. Howell says he was detained by police at the airport for about nine hours. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very happy about that,\u201d Howell says, \u201cbut said he had nothing to hide and told them what they wanted to know.\u201d</p> <p>Their lives together resumed. \u201cHe told us all that he wasn\u2019t going back after what he\u2019d seen,\u201d Howell says. \u201cHe got his job back on the farm and was talking about buying land in Australia. We thought he\u2019d got it out of his system.\u201d Looking back, though, there were signs that Evans would return. \u201cWhenever Isis was mentioned on TV, his face would change colour, like it turned his blood,\u201d Tracey says. \u201cIt was like he became a different person whenever Isis came up.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d practise his Kurdish, too,\u201d Jake says. \u201cIt was when he started saving his money again that I realised he wouldn\u2019t be home long.\u201d </p> <p>They noticed that Evans now wore a pendant, green with a red star. \u201cHe said they were the colours of the Kurdish Women\u2019s Protection Unit [YPJ],\u201d says his friend Elly, 23, who was at primary school with him. \u201cHe said a female soldier he knew in Syria had given it to him, and that he wanted to go back to see if she was OK. He never had a girlfriend at home, so to get emotionally attached to a woman would have been a big deal for him.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the war in Syria was entering a bloody new phase. The Kurds, backed by US airstrikes, were gaining ground and confidence. They had flushed Isis from large swaths of Syria\u2019s north and were heading for the city of Manbij, a strategic outpost key to severing Isis\u2019s last supply line from Turkey. Evans never lost touch with his friends in the YPG, and he kept finding out that more were dying. \u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t just stand by while his friends were being killed,\u201d Jake says. \u201cTo him, they\u2019d become like family.\u201d</p> <p>When Evans went back to Syria on 28 January this year, he told the police he was planning to go. The police tell me that they gave Evans \u201cstrong advice\u201d not to, and told him that the Foreign Office cannot offer consular service to UK nationals who travel to Syria. Still, he wanted to leave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75695db87fa33ed507667b9a1012c71b58bf3464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75695db87fa33ed507667b9a1012c71b58bf3464/0_228_1917_1150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tal Tamr, in Syria, where Evans spent three months.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He was there to destroy Isis, and he never deviated from that\u2019: Tal Tamr, in Syria, where Evans spent three months.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uygar Onder Simsek</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This time, Howell gave him a lift to the airport. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him going without us clearing the air,\u201d he says. \u201cI just had a terrible feeling it would be the last time I\u2019d see him.\u201d They hugged, which Howell says they\u2019d never done before \u2013 \u201cHe thought hugs were a sign of weakness\u201d \u2013 and Evans handed him a letter. It was a will. It said: \u201cI, Dean Evans, leave this letter with my stepdad, Steve Howell, as I get ready to leave for Syria. I am going back to Syria to rejoin my brothers and sisters of the YPG\u2026 After watching Steve break after my mum died, I have decided to write down my thoughts and wishes. If I am killed in Syria, it is my wish that I stay in Syria with my brothers and sisters of the YPG who are my friends. I want my name added to my mum\u2019s headstone. Steve has been my dad for 13 years and I know he will do what I have asked him to do. I leave everything to him.\u201d As he handed his stepfather the envelope, Howell asked if he was afraid of dying. \u201cNo,\u201d Evans replied. \u201cI\u2019d much rather live a short, exciting life than a long, boring one.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI know that when I die, I will walk straight into the arms of my mum.\u201d Six months later, he was dead.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Their mission on the night Evans died was the same as it had been for 38 days: to drive Isis from Manbij. Freeman Stevenson, a 22-year-old American fighter in Dean\u2019s battalion, tells me that spirits were high at the pre-battle briefing. \u201cAll the guys were going through the usual banter \u2013 \u2018See you in hell\u2019, \u2018You\u2019re gonna get shot tonight\u2019, \u2018You\u2019re gonna get blown up\u2019 \u2013 you know, soldier stuff, like when actors tell each other to break legs.\u201d</p> <p>Evans was typically quiet. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it, I was scared,\u201d Stevenson says, speaking on the phone from the frontline near Manbij in August. \u201cBut then Dean, with his hands in his pockets, piped up, \u2018Guys, stop saying that. Everyone\u2019s going to be fine.\u2019 It was the last I saw of him. A few hours later, he was killed.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson didn\u2019t see Dean fall, but heard what happened from those who did. \u201cDean\u2019s unit was pinned behind a wall on a city street. Bullets were flying, men were screaming; it was chaos. They had to keep moving.\u201d</p> <p>A Kurdish soldier ran to a building and kicked open the door. \u201cIt was booby-trapped,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cHe got a blast of shrapnel in the face and went down.\u201d Dean dropped his rocket launcher and grenade bag, and ran into no man\u2019s land with a Kurdish female fighter named Er\u00een.</p> <p>It was a 30m dash across open ground. When they reached the man, he was glued to the ground by fear. There was an argument, confusion. But the man wouldn\u2019t budge. That\u2019s when an Isis rocket streaked out of a window above. \u201cIt exploded right between Dean and Er\u00een, engulfing them in smoke,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cWhen it cleared, both were dead. Incredibly, the guy they ran out to get made it back alive. They\u2019d stayed out there a moment too long.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He wanted to see if a female soldier he knew in Syria was OK. He didn't have a girlfriend at home so it was a big deal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the Kurdish forces, Evans had found a purpose that the British army denied him and that farming couldn\u2019t give him: the war in Syria offered him a chance to do something meaningful with his life. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about killing people,\u201d Howell says. \u201cIt was about putting himself between innocent people and terror.\u201d</p> <p>More than that, Howell thinks, it filled a void. \u201cAfter losing his mum, Dean felt so lost and alone, but when he put on a uniform, he felt whole. He felt people would look at him and respect the fact that he was doing something he believed in. Why not?\u201d Then he adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018What a waste of a life.\u2019 It\u2019s not a waste of a life. He died fighting for a cause he wholeheartedly believed in. Without people like Dean, people wouldn\u2019t be able to live like they do today. They are fighting for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-five days after Dean\u2019s death, Manbij was finally liberated. It was one of the costliest battles of the war so far: up to 400 YPG fighters, including six foreign volunteers, were killed and many more wounded. \u201cThey locked 4,000 Isis fighters inside the city and offered them an ultimatum: surrender or die,\u201d Macer Gifford, a 29-year-old British volunteer who was there, told me in a London bar last month. \u201cTheir commanders wouldn\u2019t allow civilians to leave or their fighters to surrender, so they fought to the death.\u201d</p> <p>Evans, he says, was one of the first casualties of a shift in the power balance. \u201cThe fight has stepped up a gear since Manbij,\u201d he says. \u201cThe violence there was a test for what Aleppo already is and Raqqa will be \u2013 brutal. Each building becomes a fortress, each street a sniper\u2019s alley. Isis use human shields. Cities are very difficult to get back.\u201d</p> <p>Once it was rare for a foreign volunteer to die; now, Gifford says, an average of six are killed and 10 wounded in a single operation. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more aggressive, more violent as Isis enters its death throes.\u201d This has not stemmed the flow of foreign volunteers offering their lives to the fight. \u201cI stopped at a YPG training camp on my way home in August, and I met a lot of Brits,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cFor people like me who grew up post-9/11, this is our Churchillian moment. We want to fight back against Islamic fascism, protect innocent people and fight for democracy. We want to come home with a sense of fulfilment.\u201d</p> <p>But fulfilment isn\u2019t always what fighters describe when they return from war. A few weeks after I spoke to Heval Serdar, Evans\u2019s Dutch friend from his first trip to Syria, he phoned me from Holland. He wanted to talk. \u201cI feel tremendous guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cI left Dean to die.

  "<h2><strong>John Carpenter</strong> <br></h2> <p><em><strong>Seventies fright auteur, synth soundtrack pioneer<br></strong></em>How we scare people with film hasn\u2019t changed particularly. Horror is a very adaptable genre: the subject matter has evolved as society evolves, and as styles change. But what frightens us is essential. We\u2019re all born afraid, and we are all afraid of the same things. That\u2019s what makes horror such a powerful genre. Everybody\u2019s afraid of death, disfigurement, loss of a loved one\u2026 in any culture. I\u2019m scared by everything. Even badasses get scared, that\u2019s why they become badasses. I still find the idea of being followed scary. I think everybody does. A couple of times people have followed me but it never turned out to be as serious as what was portrayed in [my film] Halloween.</p> <p>Horror really works when you\u2019re young. It challenges you. When you get old you\u2019re a little bit more aware of real-life horror, and real-life horror is a vision of hell. Right now in America there\u2019s a lot of crazy fear about this election we\u2019re having and the state of our country. It\u2019s terribly divided. There\u2019s a lot of fear going around about the outsider, about the other. This happens during hard times and I think it arises from the recession. Somebody has to be blamed. Trump could be ripe for a horror monster but he\u2019s sort of buffoonish, as opposed to being scary. It\u2019s our response [to him]; it\u2019s <em>us</em> that scares me; the people that follow him blindly. Human beings, and what they\u2019re capable of, are the scariest things of all.<br><em><a href=\"http://victoriawarehouse.com/whats-on-manchester/john-carpenter-release-the-bats-uk-tour/\">John Carpenter plays Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, Sat</a>; <a href=\"http://www.troxy.co.uk/event/release-bats/\">The Troxy, E1, 31 Oct &amp; 1 Nov</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Alice Lowe</strong> </h2> <p><em><strong>Star of Sightseers and writer-director of upcoming serial-killer film Prevenge</strong></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/03/alice-lowe-on-my-radar-grimes-neil-gaiman\">On my radar: Alice Lowe\u2019s cultural highlights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m a sucker for ghost stories. My theory is that when we see the surreal, paranormal and supernatural on film, it represents insanity. Our fear that if everything goes crazy, it means that we have, and there\u2019s no escape then from horror. It\u2019s everywhere. The best example I can think of is Michael Hordern in [1968 BBC drama] Whistle And I\u2019ll Come To You. He\u2019s this pompous, rational know-it-all, but by the end is a gibbering idiot with his thumb in his mouth. It\u2019s the fear of rationality and structure collapsing. I once had a dream that ghosts were laying siege to my family and bombing us with pins.

I am unsettled by all the great cinematic uses of people or shapes with their backs to us. From the little hooded figure in Don\u2019t Look Now, turning to reveal itself to be a serial-killing dwarf; to the end of The Blair Witch Project with Mike standing in the corner of the room. It is the expectation of the turn, and what it will reveal that is so unsettling. It\u2019s not confined to dark Venetian alleyways or spooky old houses, either. Killer Bob in Twin Peaks, creeping towards us over a sofa in broad daylight, is one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact I think most of what David Lynch does is pretty terrifying. Just watch Lost Highway. A waking nightmare.</p> <p><strong>Steve Pemberton:</strong> I am terrified of cows. It\u2019s the size of them obviously, and the fact that they could easily crush you to death just by leaning against you. The word \u2018bovine\u2019 is enough to bring me out in a sweat with its sickly combination of size and stupidity. Then there\u2019s the liquid black eyes filled with unknowable intent and the big teeth like grinding stones ready to turn your bones to dust. And when one cow turns to look at you, alone in a vast field, and the rest of the herd stop chewing and all slowly look up and stare before lumbering towards you with some evil intent... and that\u2019s before you factor in the flies and the shit-matted hides.

Especially if I\u2019m alone at night, even though I know that they can haunt me. I tend to freak myself out when I\u2019m lying in bed alone in darkness. Only last night I woke up with a panic, thinking someone is in bed because I felt the duvet moved. After sitting up in fear, I realised that one end of the duvet fell off the bed, pulling the whole thing down<em> </em>and that is why it moved. Oh, silly me! Another time, when I was in Amman for the filming of Under The Shadow. I think I was exhausted and stressed. I slept awkwardly on my left arm and it went numb. I woke up in the middle of the night, touching my numb left hand with my right hand and jumping out of bed with a yelp, thinking \u201cTHERE IS A HAND IN MY BED!\u201d and ran out of my room screaming as loud as I possibly could, with my numb hand flapping a long. It took me a few seconds to register that it was my own hand that scared me!</p> <p>What\u2019s truly terrifying is when you sense a strangeness in something that is seemingly ordinary. I have a distinct memory of this lamp that my mum got from my grandmother \u2013 as a child I always thought it looked like a scary face that was constantly staring at me. Or when you are on your own and you sense a presence but you look around and there is nobody in the room. Fear is a primal instinct, alarming you about a possible threat. So I always think it\u2019s fascinating and bizarre that your mind sometimes tricks you to panic for no logical reason. Or maybe it\u2019s a sixth sense and in those situations we are being warned about something that is beyond our understanding.

Big studio films usually pull their punches but these talented young newcomers have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Finding new ways to scare people is what every good horror director dreams about and I\u2019ve been seeing terrific new films, many directed by women: The Babadook, Good Night, Mommy and Honeymoon, to name a few. I\u2019m extremely easy to scare if I sense that the director is talented and will stop at nothing to freak me out. And I\u2019ve discovered that most people who make horror films are the same way. I was at a film festival screening of Reservoir Dogs in the early 90s when the film broke, just as Michael Madsen was about to cut off the cop\u2019s ear, and I found myself in the men\u2019s room standing next to Wes Craven at the urinals. \u201cI\u2019m not going back in there,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut Wes, it\u2019s only a movie,\u201d I couldn\u2019t help telling him. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s too real,\u201d he replied before he took off.</p> <h2><strong>Faris Badwan</strong> <br></h2> <p><em><strong>Frontman of ghoulish garage rockers the Horrors and otherworldly duo Cat\u2019s Eyes</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"109f3e36ce2714251d62c2fbb525aa96c9ce4234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/109f3e36ce2714251d62c2fbb525aa96c9ce4234/0_418_2796_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faris Badwan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faris Badwan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cannibal Holocaust. Not so much blurring the lines between fiction and reality as removing the lines altogether and mashing the two sides into one gory soup, it remains harder to stomach than pretty much anything released since. It provokes a feeling only matched by the hyper-reality of the \u201ctrue gore\u201d Mexican Cartel videos found in the darkest recesses of the net. As with those clips, the viewer is an uneasy voyeur, compelled to keep watching, as I discovered the first time I saw it, while house-sitting for a gore-obsessed friend.</p> <p>While admittedly gratuitous in its depiction of sexual violence and real, inexcusable, animal cruelty, it would be short-sighted and too easy to dismiss this film as exploitation horror. In essence CH is a multi-layered scathing social commentary, inspired in part by Italian press coverage of the Red Brigade terrorist organisation. After noticing a pattern in the media\u2019s willingness to disregard journalistic integrity in favour of graphic violence, Deodato decided to create a film that drew on their savagery. \u201cWho are the real cannibals?\u201d asks main character Harold Monroe, and in the end the camera itself turns out to be the feature\u2019s main cannibalising presence. Cannibal Holocaust is both a touchstone for real/fake found-footage horror and brilliant social satire. It is also disgusting; why is this surprising? The turtle-beheading scene in particular renders it unforgettable in the worst sense of the word, and the prospect of another viewing makes me want to vomit. I now own it on DVD after finding a copy in Notting Hill Music &amp; Video Exchange and it sits on the shelf next to the Mexican curse candle.<br><em><a href=\"http://theborderlinelondon.com/\">The Horrors DJ at The Borderline, WC1, Saturday 29 October</a>; <br><a href=\"http://www.songkick.com/artists/3903446-cats-eyes\">Cat\u2019s Eyes are touring to 6 November</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Roger Corman</strong> <br></h2> <p><em><strong>B-movie master</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6801de324d47db20d55289c0be288c7afdf24384\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6801de324d47db20d55289c0be288c7afdf24384/0_939_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Corman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roger Corman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Will/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While I have made many creature films over the years \u2013 from Crab Monsters to Dinocrocs \u2013 nothing scares me quite like the depravity of man.

I feel like we\u2019re all going to start building bunkers and fallout shelters again. But I try not to let the geopolitical landscape or the constant barrage of newsreel carnage interfere with my craft or what I love about the film-going experience. Jump-scares will always be more of a technical feat of timing and misdirection. And creating cinematic tension has less to do with referencing current events than it does building a believable world with relatable characters that ups the stakes and heightens the experience. </p> <p>Beyond the blood and guts and ghosts, there is no tension without emotional investment by the audience. Real life is scarier simply because it exposes us to mortal danger. The best horror doesn\u2019t necessarily need to stem from real-life events, but it needs to tap into the mechanics of how we\u2019re scared in real life. So the task of the horror filmmaker is to somehow access and stimulate the involuntary response audiences have to true danger. Personally, I like to keep a safe distance from horrific, real-life events \u2018ripped from the headlines\u2019. Awareness of such events can creep into the fictional world and pollute the filmgoers\u2019 experience. The last thing I want to think about when eating popcorn and watching an atmospheric horror film is the brutality and injustice of the real world.

No-one really expects to be scared in a theatre, for how can theatre compete with the special effects of recorded media? The answer, I believe, is that by using very simple effects, some technical, like sound and lighting, and some which simply pay tribute to and the acting skill of the performers, one encourages audiences to use their own imaginations, and it becomes surprisingly possible to entice audiences into scaring themselves. I would say, however, that Roman Polanski\u2019s film Repulsion had a huge effect on me. I watched it in the late 60s and chain-smoked throughout. The notion of a beautiful, vulnerable young woman, played by Catherine Deneuve, who elicits our sympathy, provokes our protective instincts and then turns out to be a insane killer, I found really disturbing. Because she is insane, there is no way she will see that the wholesome boyfriend who has come to save her is actually her friend, and will batter him to death. And when her sleazy landlord tries to get friendly, and three minutes earlier we have seen her pick up a cut-throat razor\u2026 Notions of a safe haven that is penetrated and thus no longer secure are explored here.<br><em><a href=\"http://thewomaninblack.com/\">The Woman In Black is at The Fortune Theatre, WC1 and on UK tour <br>until 10 June 2017</a></em></p> <h2>Alan Jones</h2> <p><strong><em>Critic and curator of horror festival Frightfest</em></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/aug/19/frightfest-film-festival-2014-preview-films-margins\">FrightFest: where the horror genre is still twitching</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Psycho is still pretty terrifying.

Whether that is Ray Winstone in Scum attacking another inmate with a bag of pool balls, or the artist Chris Burden having someone shoot him in the arm on camera, or watching Hidden by Michael Haneke. The less sensational and the more mundane then the weirder it is. Films without manipulative music, films shot in real time, films shot with real grit and dirt where you can\u2019t tell the filmmaker\u2019s agenda. Look at The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The reason that is disturbing is because it feels so innocent and raw. It doesn\u2019t use tricks or fast pacing to scare. It hangs around, and cuts slowly and awkwardly and it goes on too long. That gives it a sadistic gratuitous feel.</p> <p>Of course if a film feels like it could really happen then it\u2019s scary. Look at Deliverance with Burt Reynolds. A rafting trip goes horribly wrong in a weird backwater with some local streetcast oddbods inflicting the damage. Totally believable. Totally upsetting. What\u2019s scary in 2016?

That <em>is</em> scary.</p> <h2><strong>Matthew Holness</strong> <br></h2> <p><em><strong>Comedian and actor, best known as fictional horror novelist Garth Marenghi</strong></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/jan/26/television\">Garth Marenghi: 'I hereby vow never to work in TV again'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Threads, the 1984 TV drama about a nuclear attack on the UK \u2013 I still find it extremely difficult to watch, especially in the current political climate. As a drama it\u2019s brutal, devoid of cliche and unflinching in its depiction of human frailty and savagery. It\u2019s the kind of drama that needs to be made now, to remind us of what we\u2019re again heading towards. I think there\u2019s always been a genuine need to shock audiences, to remind them of the horrors of reality. I remember lying in bed as a child and experiencing deep anxiety at the sound of the news headlines drifting up from the downstairs TV. A fear of the wider world is always a preoccupation for children, no matter how hard adults try to shield them from it. But adults seem to have grown used to being passive consumers of information, with a sense of entitlement and expectation. The most frightening thing in our country right now is the lack of basic human empathy. There aren\u2019t many horror films or stories that truly frighten me anymore, but each ping of a fresh news update on my mobile invariably does the trick.<br><em>Matt Holness\u2019s Halloween, part of Comedy Shorts, is on Sky On Demand</em></p> <h2><strong>Charlie Lyne</strong> <br></h2> <p><em><strong>Writer and director of horror doc Fear Itself</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9611c63cd34958b256bc79f6d82291b47fda1cf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9611c63cd34958b256bc79f6d82291b47fda1cf2/0_189_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Lyne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Lyne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am so terrified by the notion of eternal nothingness that I can be made to fear everything from cartoonish zombies (how absurd they render the possibility of an afterlife!) to ageless vampires (how cruelly they emphasise the brevity of the human lifespan!) and even darkness itself.

  "<p>Walk past the 110 electric guitars filed on shelves like a library archive, and the dozens of keyboards swaddled in dust, and the ancient amps that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/smiths\">the Smiths</a> used at their first gigs, and you eventually come to a toilet cubicle, slap bang in the middle of the room. It looks as if it has briefly parked itself there while waiting for a more suitable home.</p> <p>When you go in, things become even stranger \u2013 pop\u2019s equivalent of the Tardis. The walls are lined with a series of gold and silver discs: Mind Bomb by The The, Ignore the Ignorant by the Cribs, Talking With The Taxman About Poetry by Billy Bragg, all of them awarded to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnnymarr\">Johnny Marr</a>. In the corner of the loo, there is a trophy for <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/blogs/the-big-picture/johnny-marr-the-making-of-a-godlike-genius-774472\">\u201cgodlike genius\u201d</a>, presented to the guitarist in 2013 by the music magazine NME. It\u2019s a reminder that Marr\u2019s career didn\u2019t end with the Smiths.</p> <p>But 29 years since their demise, it\u2019s still the Smiths most people want to hear about. The band more or less invented indie, as Marr is quick to remind me. Their tunes (by Marr) were as delicate as their lyrics (by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/morrissey\">Morrissey</a>) were morose. They became known as pop\u2019s supreme miserabilists (not least because of songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjPhzgxe3L0\">Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now</a>) but it was a brand of miserabilism that was romantic and funny. (In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-cD4oLk_D0\">There Is A Light That Never Goes Out</a>, Morrissey sings: \u201cAnd if a double-decker bus/Crashes into us/To die by your side/Is such a heavenly way to die.\u201d) Between 1983 and 1987, they had 15 hits. Songs such as This Charming Man, William It Was Really Nothing and Big Mouth Strikes Again weren\u2019t just classic pop, they were perfectly formed short stories.</p> <p>Ever since the Smiths split, Marr has been reluctant to talk about the band and his relationship with Morrissey. Like Paul McCartney and the Beatles, he was blamed for being the one to walk away, and felt he was never quite forgiven. But at the age of 52, enjoying a successful solo career, Marr has just written a memoir, Set The Boy Free. He thinks it\u2019s time to put the record straight.</p> <p>We meet in his studio, a converted warehouse just outside Manchester. Marr is in skinny jeans and a polka-dot shirt, looking fit and clear-eyed. He says he loves the title of his book because it sounds like a famous song. But it isn\u2019t \u2013 it just came to him. As a little boy (and he was tiny, growing up) it was music that set him free from the mundanities of everyday life. He was brought up in a working-class family in Ardwick Green, Manchester, by Irish Catholic parents who were also mad about music. His father, \u201ca strong, brooding presence\u201d, laid gas pipes in the road; his mother, one of 14 children, cleaned at a hospital.</p> <p>There was nothing unhappy about his childhood, but there was something stultifying about suburbia. \u201cI was looking for something \u2013 transcendence.\u201d He looks embarrassed. \u201cThat sounds a bit pretentious, but common transcendence that everybody can relate to. I really like the word free. It has a sense of energy, and idealism, which I\u2019ve always felt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ef2bee5ce4763f387d432c7a376ee7d6eb7bd51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ef2bee5ce4763f387d432c7a376ee7d6eb7bd51/138_37_1247_1021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrissey and Johnny Marr of the Smiths standing by the side of a van in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"819\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the road with Morrissey in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was a bright boy, and went to grammar school. Like all guitarists, he says, he was good at English and art. But beyond that he didn\u2019t care much for academic work. He was obsessed with music: girl groups the Shangri-Las and the Shirelles, glam rockers T-Rex and Roxy Music, and most of all with guitarists.</p> <p>By the age of 13, he was playing in bands with people four years older. \u201cFashion, culture, rebellion, drinking, girls: I was learning so much, doing 16-year-old stuff. It felt like an apprenticeship for the only thing I was going to do \u2013 be a rock guitar player.\u201d Marr was already a star in the making, obsessed with mod haircuts and Crombie coats, spending every spare minute perfecting his guitar technique. He was a talented footballer and had a trial with Manchester City, the team he supported. But nothing could compete with his passion for music. Football fell by the wayside.</p> <p>Marr says he couldn\u2019t stand the strutting braggadocio of \u201ccock rock\u201d. His guitar heroes (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Gallagher\">Rory Gallagher</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/keithrichards\">Keith Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nile-rodgers\">Nile Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.clashmusic.com/features/the-stooges-james-williamson-interview\">James Williamson</a> from the Stooges) didn\u2019t want to steal the show. So, rather than playing lead guitar, he devised a new way of playing for himself \u2013 using the rhythm guitar to replicate a whole band or orchestra. The technique was influenced by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6467441.stm\">Phil Spector\u2019s \u201cwall of sound\u201d</a> and refined over the years in the studio. It often involved numerous guitar overdubs, and Marr referred to it as the Guitarchestra.</p> <p>When he got the idea for the Smiths, which he formed at 19, it was already his fifth serious band. This time he knew he didn\u2019t want to front it. \u201cThe few occasions I had to stand in front of a bunch of local kids at youth clubs, it was terrifying.\u201d As far as Marr was concerned, all the great bands were based on a partnership: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney\">Lennon and McCartney</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagger/Richards\">Jagger and Richards</a>. That\u2019s where Steven Morrissey came in.</p> <p>Marr was looking for a singer for his new band. One night he watched a South Bank Show on the great songwriting team <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Leiber_and_Mike_Stoller\">Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller</a>. Leiber said he had heard that Stoller wrote songs, liked the sound of him, found out where he lived and knocked on the stranger\u2019s door. Marr decided that that\u2019s what he would do; he had been told Morrissey was a good vocalist, so he would find out where he lived and knock on his door.</p> <p>They talked about music, and listened to Morrissey\u2019s rare Tamla 45s. Marr raved about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBRhh1wehN4\">Dusty Springfield\u2019s Little By Little</a>; Morrissey played him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RLcw2bpOoU&amp;list=RD2RLcw2bpOoU\">Sandie Shaw\u2019s Message Understood</a>. When Marr left, Morrissey gave him some of his typed lyrics. After that, they were inseparable. \u201cEverything that was obsessive, excessive and poetic, all the big visions I carried around inside me, were also in him. The love of pop culture, and the pure dedication, was mirrored in my partner. I\u2019ve never seen it in anyone else before, and never in exactly the same way since. And the desperation. He was looking for someone like me and I was looking for someone like him. And we liked each other straight away. We really liked each other.\u201d</p> <p>What was the desperation? \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t going to happen for us, all that unfulfilled ambition was a hell of a lot to carry around. We weren\u2019t the sort of people who at 28 were going to be able to say, \u2018I was in a band; it didn\u2019t work out. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working in an estate agent.\u2019 The two of us knew that we were too into it to survive that.\u201d</p> <p>Were they as intense as each other? \u201cIn different ways, yeah. Mine comes out in physicality, exuberance. My mother used to say I\u2019m a cross between really intense and really laid-back.\u201d</p> <p>Marr says his relationship with Morrissey was as close as is possible without being lovers. Was he in love with Morrissey? \u201cNo, because I was in love with Angie [his then girlfriend, now wife], but we definitely loved each other. I think we all did.\u201d His old school friend <a href=\"http://www.andyrourke.com/\">Andy Rourke</a> (who had played in his first band, the Paris Valentinos) joined on bass, and <a href=\"http://www.mikejoyce.com/\">Mike Joyce</a> became their drummer. The four became good friends, but Marr says it was always clear that he and Morrissey were the leaders.</p> <p>The second Morrissey lyric Marr put to music was the ghoulish <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DH0_b3F1c\">Suffer Little Children</a>, about the victims of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady (\u201cLesley Ann, with your pretty white beads/Oh John, you\u2019ll never be a man/And you\u2019ll never see your home again/Oh Manchester, so much to answer for\u201d). Didn\u2019t the words spook him? Well, at the time, he says, they were so besotted with each other, the lyrics were secondary. \u201cIt was, \u2018We like each other. You look good, I look good. I write music, you write lyrics. We\u2019re gonna do this.\u2019\u201d He smiles. \u201cWhen I saw, in the first songwriting session, my new group had a song about the Moors murderers, it was very much, <em>\u2018Fucking hell!</em>\u2019 But I went on instinct.\u201d</p> <p>Did he always think of the Smiths as his? \u201cIn a way that is protective, I did, yes. I wasn\u2019t old enough to be paternal, but it was kind of paternal.\u201d Marr looked like a young Keith Richards \u2013 and had the swagger. Morrissey was famously introverted, so Marr was marketed as the arrogant one. While he says he was 90% true to that image, there was always 10% that was terrified.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe6cce46732369d82b07579cfa7576483db7653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe6cce46732369d82b07579cfa7576483db7653/302_0_4138_5820/711.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr playing his guitar\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The only thing I was going to do was be a rock guitar player\u2019: Marr in his studio. Photograph: Sophia Spring for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Spring/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Smiths were always political, not in the campaigning way of Billy Bragg or Paul Weller, but in their frame of reference \u2013 the writings of Oscar Wilde, Irish Catholic life, their album titles (Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead), the daily grind of life. Growing up in working-class Manchester, Marr says, being political was instinctive. \u201cIt was just part of your mindset, because you felt you were up against it, and the right wing was the minority but controlling everything. Somebody gave me <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/the-canon-arguments-for-socialism-by-tony-benn/414356.article\">Arguments For Socialism</a> by Tony Benn, and I discovered that what I just thought was decency was a political position. You look after people who are less fortunate, and anyone who does otherwise is just fucking ghastly. By definition, being an alternative musician back then, you were political.\u201d</p> <p>Did he and Morrissey have similar politics? \u201cYeah, we did back then.\u201d And now? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect so. Probably not.\u201d In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/03/morrissey-china-subspecies-racism\">Morrissey has made headlines</a> for suggesting that immigration is compromising British identity; he sued the NME (successfully) for defamation, releasing a statement that \u201cracism has no place in our society\u201d. In a 2010 interview with this magazine, he described the Chinese as a \u201csubspecies\u201d when it came to their treatment of animals. Marr prefers to talk about the days when Morrissey <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsq3H_6XuFA\">reserved his bile for Margaret Thatcher</a>.</p> <p>Success soon began to take its toll on the Smiths. Rourke had a heroin habit; Marr survived on a diet of cocaine and booze. His weight dropped to seven stone, but he didn\u2019t worry because all his heroes had been slight. \u201cGeorge Best was small, Marc Bolan was small, Bruce Lee was small. And they were cocky and hyper, so I related to that, and played up to it. When it got really unhealthy it was just part and parcel of being in the Smiths in 1986. I wasn\u2019t thinking, \u2018This is great.\u2019 I just never ate.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Marr looks fantastically healthy \u2013 slim but not skeletal. He is vegan, teetotal and has been drug-free for many years. Now he gets his high from long-distance running. We meet at lunch, and he\u2019s already been out for eight miles. The only thing that gives away his age is the mandatory jet-black rock star dyed hair. His eternal boyishness is reflected not only in the book\u2019s title, but also in his passion (for new guitars, new bands, new experiences), his nomadic sense of adventure (he recently spent five years living in Portland with Angie, while playing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/modestmouse\">Modest Mouse</a>), his curiosity (about everything).</p> <p>That optimism did briefly desert Marr when the Smiths split in 1987. In Set The Boy Free, he writes that the official version of him walking out on the band isn\u2019t quite right. Morrissey\u2019s behaviour was becoming more and more unreliable. Things came to a head, he says, when Morrissey refused to show up for the video shoot of the single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJRN76hxFz0\">Shoplifters Of The World Unite</a>, and ordered him to sack their latest manager, Ken Friedman (who had been introduced to the band by the singer and who Marr considered to be doing a good job). Marr says Morrissey assumed the guitarist would take on the role of unofficial manager, as he had for most of the band\u2019s existence. Even when the Smiths became successful, Marr acted as manager, booking vans and sorting all the finer detail. At the same time, he was being dictated to in the studio. Drummer Mike Joyce, who appeared to have taken on the role of spokesman for the other three, told Marr their next single would be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETJ-kOJrRow\">a cover</a> of Cilla Black\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJQWxFv_8_g\">Work Is A Four-Letter Word</a>. Marr wasn\u2019t pleased \u2013 but still, he insists, he didn\u2019t walk out. He stayed at home, making instrumental tracks in his recording studio.</p> <p>In July 1987 a story appeared in the press that Marr had left, accompanied by a new photo of the band taken by their press officer in which Marr was scowling while the other three Smiths smiled away. At that point, he felt he had no option but to walk.</p> <p>It sounds horribly stressful, I say. Yes, he says \u2013 not least the presumption that he would be the one to step in and manage the Smiths. \u201cIt\u2019s what split the band up. To this day I haven\u2019t met anyone who thinks a major rock group should be managed by the 23-year-old guitar player.\u201d So why did he agree to manage them in the first place? \u201cWell, because we were deemed unmanageable. When we fired managers, I always had to deal with it. When we got to the end of the band\u2019s life, it was put to me by my partner that he wouldn\u2019t work with the current manager and we had to go back to how it was. I wasn\u2019t prepared to do it, and so it became untenable. There was no way forward.\u201d For a moment, those tensions sound as raw as they did three decades ago. \u201cI was waiting for someone to fix it, and make it so it didn\u2019t have to happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"100ac098727a6e8d9b171871dfb8210c5cd3ef91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100ac098727a6e8d9b171871dfb8210c5cd3ef91/0_9_845_1114/759.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr with Angie, his wife, soon after they met in the late 70s\" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marr with his wife Angie in the late 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why were they so resistant to having a manager? \u201cA lot of it was to do with control.\u201d Does he feel he was\u2026? Marr finishes the sentence for me. \u201cForced out? Yes, that was the tangible public manifestation of all that.\u201d He stops, embarrassed by his words. \u201cWow! Check me out! It was the feeling of being tested, and my role in the band being untenable.\u201d He stops again. \u201cJust like any break-up, bad shit goes on.\u201d</p> <p>The day that he confirmed he was leaving, the other band members issued a statement wishing him luck and saying: \u201cOther guitarists are being considered to replace him.\u201d How did that make him feel? \u201cI literally thought it was a joke. It was the final nail in the coffin and it took me a long time to forgive them. It was pretty callous. But I don\u2019t hold it against anybody now. I absolutely don\u2019t.\u201d Within a week, the Smiths were in the studio with a new guitarist. They never completed any new material, though: by the time their final album, Strangeways Here We Come, was released in September 1987, they had announced their split.</p> <p>Angie was the constant throughout this time. They started going out at the age of 15, and <a href=\"http://www.johnnymarrplaysguitar.com/a-long-list-2/angie-marr/\">are still together</a>, with two grownup children. Did she ever fear she would lose him to Morrissey? \u201cNo, it was me and Angie first. We all had these very unusual, intense relationships that worked and brought great things.\u201d I say that Angie seems to be the glue in his story. \u201cWell, she\u2019s the person who\u2019s enabled me to be who I am and vice versa. She\u2019s completed me, and I\u2019ve completed her.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>What struck Marr most when writing his book is how young he was when the Smiths split. He wasn\u2019t yet 24, and his career with one of Britain\u2019s biggest bands was over. Looking back now, he says, there was an inevitability about it all. Even without the tensions, and even though he didn\u2019t want to leave, he was never going to be a lifer in a single band. For a while he became the most illustrious hired hand in the business, playing with Paul McCartney, the Pretenders and U2. He went on to have long-term relationships with a number of bands, including Matt Johnson\u2019s eternally innovative <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-the-mn0000566918\">The The</a> (the critically acclaimed album Dusk reached number two in the UK charts), alternative dance band <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_(band)\">Electronic</a> with Bernard Sumner (a handful of hit singles, including Getting Away With It and Get The Message), American rockers Modest Mouse (whose album We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank went into the US charts at number one), and English indie punks <a href=\"https://www.thecribs.com/\">the Cribs</a>. Marr says these collaborations all led to great friendships.</p> <p>Which band did he enjoy playing with most? \u201cModest Mouse,\u201d he says without a beat. More than the Smiths? \u201cYeah. People don\u2019t believe it when I say that. I love Modest Mouse so much because the chemistry of those guys was a real brotherhood. They were a great American band, and I really wanted to be in a great American band.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t see the rest of the Smiths for years after the split. In March 1989, Joyce and Rourke started legal proceedings against Marr and Morrissey, arguing they were equal partners in the band and each entitled to 25% of recording and performance royalties rather than the 10% they were getting (Marr and Morrissey each took 40%). Rourke settled out of court, but Joyce continued and in 1996 his case was heard. Joyce\u2019s barrister argued that Marr and Morrissey treated the drummer and bassist as \u201cmere session musicians, as readily replaceable as the parts in a lawnmower\u201d. After a bruising seven days in court, Judge Weeks found in Joyce\u2019s favour, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/devious-truculent-and-unreliable-1314122.html\">describing Morrissey as \u201cdevious, truculent and unreliable\u201d</a> and Marr as \u201cwilling to embroider his evidence to a point where he became less credible\u201d. He also described Marr as \u201cprobably the more intelligent of the four\u201d, while Rourke and Joyce were \u201cunintellectual\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the Smiths wanted to re-form it would make a hell of a lot of people very happy. We might even be better than before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Was Joyce justified in bringing the court case? \u201cMike had a right to do it. I don\u2019t think he should have done because we had an agreement. Looking back, I would have done things differently. I\u2019d make sure you don\u2019t move a muscle without a contract \u2013 for everybody\u2019s benefit. Young people aren\u2019t good at doing that kind of thing, and we had to pay the price for it.\u201d Would he still regard the 10% Joyce and Rourke were paid as a fair deal? \u201cI would be more generous,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a band of equals. Thirty-odd years later I think anyone can see that.\u201d What would be a fair percentage? He laughs. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019d wind up in court if I answered that.\u201d The question he most dislikes being asked is whether the Smiths will re-form. But it emerges that he and Morrissey were asking themselves the same question decades after the split, and that it almost did come to pass. In 2008, they met for the first time since the court case in a pub in south Manchester. \u201cThe conversation about re-forming came out of the blue. I didn\u2019t go there with that in mind. But there had been quite a few rumours about it, so naturally we discussed it. \u2018It could happen\u2026\u2019 \u2018How d\u2019you feel about it?\u2019 \u2018What if?\u2019 And off we went.\u201d Who was more keen? \u201cI think we were both as keen as each other.\u201d</p> <p>Had Morrissey changed \u2013 lost it, as people have suggested? Marr bursts out laughing. \u201cHahaha! Well, he hadn\u2019t <em>changed</em>. Joke! I felt I\u2019d changed when we met. I was teetotal, vegan and I\u2019d just run 10 miles \u2013 that\u2019s quite different from the person I was when I was last in the Smiths.\u201d Did Morrissey see a difference? \u201cI would think so, because I was in the pub not drinking. And he was knocking back the pints. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that he likes a drink; he\u2019s very pro-drinking. But I\u2019d changed quite a lot. I\u2019ve got about nine tattooos for a start.\u201d</p> <p>He shows me his favourite \u2013 a tattoo that says 45rpm. Why 45rpm rather than 33rpm? \u201cFaster, mate. Faster, shorter, better energy. I had my T-shirt on, so I think Morrissey noticed them, and he likes tattoos. So I was different, and I was fitter.\u201d</p> <p>Was Morrissey different? \u201cHe was more outgoing, more sure of himself. I\u2019m pleased for him. It was great \u2013 a really nice meeting.\u201d</p> <p>They left the pub, contemplating a Smiths reunion, spoke a few more times, then Marr went on tour with the Cribs, and didn\u2019t hear from Morrissey again.</p> <p>Does he thinks their friendship could be rekindled? \u201cI don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s run its course. I don\u2019t feel unfriendly in any way towards Morrissey \u2013 there\u2019s just no need for it. One of the things we had in common was that we lived for work, and we\u2019re too busy doing what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p> <p>So many people publish memoirs when they are on their uppers or want to settle scores, Marr says. But he has never been more content. He has made two solo albums in the past three years, and is enjoying learning the skills of being a frontman. His son Nile, 24, is a singer-songwriter who has performed with him; his 22-year-old daughter Sonny, who works in publishing, has sung backing vocals with him. Hearing them sing, he says, is the only thing that makes him \u201cblub like an idiot\u201d.</p> <p>He hopes the book will be cathartic, but he\u2019s not sure how exactly. Just talking to him, though, he already seems liberated. He recently remastered the Smiths back catalogue \u2013 the first time he\u2019d listened to it as a body of work. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk0BOK0EDFE\">Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me</a> is his favourite song.) He had always known it was good, but now he became fully aware of what they had achieved. Alongside his new solo work, he has started performing old Smiths songs for the first time since the band split up \u2013 occasionally joined on stage by bassist Rourke. He had always resisted the idea that he did his best work so young, but now accepts the Smiths will be his legacy.</p> <p>And it is a legacy he has become increasingly determined to defend. In 2010, then prime minister David Cameron chose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRP3LRcUFg\">This Charming Man</a> on Desert Island Discs, proclaiming himself a fan of the Smiths. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnny_marr/status/10237162679177216?lang=en-gb\">Marr responded on Twitter</a>: \u201cStop saying that you like the Smiths. No you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d Was he genuinely offended? \u201cYeah, I was pissed off by it, by the gall of thinking that me and my band were up for grabs. So I responded on behalf of all of us.\u201d Were the others offended as well? \u201cI think they just probably looked at it and went, \u2018Johnny\u2019s taken care of that.\u2019\u201d He pauses and grins. \u201cSo nothing changes very much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"881fada264dda953bf9aec248d7315ef44e231be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881fada264dda953bf9aec248d7315ef44e231be/78_55_2811_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr and Morrissey of the Smiths in a bathroom before going onstage in Belgium in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marr and Morrissey about to go onstage in Belgium in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2> \u2018For four days re-forming the Smiths was a very real prospect\u2019: <br></h2> <h2>an exclusive extract from Johnny Marr\u2019s new memoir</h2> <p>Unfortunately for the Smiths, I wasn\u2019t consulted when our catalogue was remastered for CDs in the 1990s. The albums sounded wrong, and I was determined to put things right. After a lot of struggle, I reached an agreement with Morrissey and Warners. I would master all the records again with a top engineer so our catalogue would be as it should be, once and for all. <br>When I analysed the records, I was struck by how good the band were, and how young. I recalled the exact intention and emotion that went into every note and word, and I texted Morrissey and Andy Rourke and said, \u201cYou can really hear the love in it.\u201d I got a nice reply from both of them.</p> <p>The negotiations with Warners meant that Morrissey and I were in a rare period of communication. One day in September 2008 we were only a couple of miles apart in south Manchester and arranged to meet up in a pub nearby. I was happy to see him \u2013 it was 10 years or more since we\u2019d last met. We caught up with personal news and family and reminisced a bit.</p> <p>Then our conversation turned to deeper things. Morrissey started to talk about how our relationship had become owned by the outside world, usually in a negative way. We had been defined by each other in most areas of our professional life. I appreciated him mentioning it, because it was true. <br></p> <p>The drinks kept coming and we sat talking for hours. We chatted, as we always did, about the records we loved, and eventually we moved on to \u201cthat subject\u201d. There had been rumours for years that the Smiths were about to re-form, and they were always untrue. I had never pursued any offer. <br></p> <p>Suddenly we were talking about the possibility of the band re-forming, and in that moment it seemed that with the right intention it could actually be done and might even be great. I would still work with the Cribs on our album, and Morrissey also had an album due out. We hung out for a while longer, and after even more orange juice (for me) and even more beer (for him) we hugged and said our goodbyes.</p> <p>I was genuinely pleased to be back in touch with Morrissey, and the Cribs and I talked about the possibility of me playing some shows with the Smiths. For four days it was a very real prospect. We would have to get someone new on drums, but if the Smiths wanted to re-form it would make a hell of a lot of people very happy, and with all our experience we might even be better than before. <br></p> <p>Morrissey and I continued our dialogue and planned to meet up again. I went to Mexico with the Cribs, and then suddenly there was radio silence. Our communication ended, and things went back to how they were and how I expect they always will be.</p> <p>I started working in the studio at unusual hours, around five or six in the morning. One day in 2010, on the way back from driving my daughter Sonny to school, I was thinking about how David Cameron had been saying that he was a fan of the Smiths. Anyone who was a fan would know we were against everything he and the Conservative party stood for. But if he wanted to say that he liked the Smiths, what could I do about it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"376fb2384d553d23e698643a5ae38c76917d2892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/376fb2384d553d23e698643a5ae38c76917d2892/68_0_1266_2000/633.jpg\" alt=\"A student in a Smiths T-shirt, protesting against tuition fee rises, in Parliament Square, London, in 2010\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A student protester in a Smiths T-shirt in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without thinking too much about it, I picked up my phone and tweeted, \u201cDavid Cameron, stop saying that you like the Smiths. No you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d Satisfied that I\u2019d made my protest, I went to take a nap.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, I was woken up by a call from Joe, my manager. \u201cThe Cameron thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Twitter business. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d While I\u2019d been asleep my tweet had been retweeted by thousands of people and picked up by the press all over the world. Cameron himself was called on to comment during prime minister\u2019s questions. With the government planning to increase university tuition fees, Labour MP Kerry McCarthy <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/the-smiths-appear-at-prime-ministers-questions\">stood up and said</a>: \u201cThe Smiths are, of course, the archetypal student band. If he wins tomorrow night\u2019s vote, what songs does he think the students will be listening to? Miserable Lie, I Don\u2019t Owe You Anything or Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now?\u201d</p> <p>Cameron took the opportunity to show his true indie cred: \u201cI expect that if I turned up, I probably wouldn\u2019t get This Charming Man.\u201d</p> <p>Good one. It was all very jolly and totally bizarre.</p> <p>When 50,000 demonstrators marched through London, I was proud to see the students call the politicians to account for their broken promises. Things came to a head in Parliament Square on the day the new laws were passed. The next day I was sent a photograph of a protester called Ellen Wood who was confronting the police in a Smiths T-shirt (pictured page 23). I stared at the photograph, her stance, the Houses of Parliament. The significance of her wearing the Smiths shirt made quite an impact on me. It occurred to me that, aside from the music we made, that picture could be the most powerful testament to the Smiths\u2019 legacy. <br></p> <p>The only other person I knew who might comprehend it the same way was Morrissey, and so I emailed him the picture. There\u2019d been no contact between us for a long time, but I got a reply within minutes. He hadn\u2019t seen the picture, and he was equally surprised and impressed. Our communication continued for a day or so, but although I felt I\u2019d created a moment of friendship, an air of disaffection and distrust remained between us. It was a shame.</p> <p> \u2022 This is an edited extract from Set The Boy Free by Johnny Marr, published by Century at \u00a320.

  "<p>When I moved to Britain in 1990, I was pretty happy with my new home. But there were two things I couldn\u2019t understand: first, why there were only four channels on TV (four! It was like living in a third-world country); second, why Britons were so obsessed with the second world war (that\u2019s right, it\u2019s not just the Germans who notice this). Britain and I have since compromised on the TV issue, because while you can still count the number of channels on one hand, at least we\u2019re united in the international language of streaming.</p> <p>But I have long since fathomed the war obsession. Countries forge their self-image on what they deem to be their greatest hour, and all who come after it live in its shadow. For more than 70 years, Britain has been able to think of itself as the plucky country that refused to betray the continent\u2019s neediest citizens, who fought against its basest sentiments and, in doing so, saved Europe. I\u2019ve occasionally wondered how different the national character would be if Britain had given into appeasement: would people be even more self-deprecating? Or would they instead try to style out their collective shame with arrogance and affected rudeness, comme les Fran\u00e7ais?</p> <p>These are merely hypothetical musings, of course, but I am fascinated by how a country\u2019s self-image affects the national character, particularly when this self-image starts to corrode. Perhaps that\u2019s not surprising, given that I come from America, a country that so prides itself on self-reliance that the prospect of more affordable healthcare is still viewed by many of those who need it most as a gateway to reds under the bed.</p> <p>One of my favourite novels is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/06/kazuo-ishiguro-the-remains-of-the-day-guardian-book-club\">The Remains Of The Day</a>, again unsurprisingly, given that it consists of an outsider\u2019s take on the British character (the author, Kazuo Ishiguro, was born in Japan). The turning point in that book comes when the British aristocrat, Lord Darlington, instructs his butler, Stevens, to fire two young Jewish maids, because, well, you know. This, Ishiguro shows but never says, is an example of how the British character can go so wrong, thinking it is upholding national values but in the process betraying morality.</p> <p>How different Lord Darlington was from one of my favourite film characters, Miss Price (Angela Lansbury) in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066817/\">Bedknobs And Broomsticks</a>, who pluckily takes in three child evacuees, even though she\u2019d only gone into town to collect her post. When I moved to Britain, Miss Price \u2013 singing her way up Portobello Road with three grubby kids in tow \u2013 pretty much summed up the British character for me. And given that my local train station for many years was Paddington, the landing spot of Britain\u2019s most famous refugee \u2013 welcomed in by the Brown family with only jars of marmalade to recommend him \u2013 this, for a long time, seemed pretty accurate. After all, as that book\u2019s author, Michael Bond, has said many times, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/jan/13/paddington-through-the-ages-michael-bond\">inspiration for his bear</a> came from his memory of child refugees during the war.</p> <p>A certain amount of idealisation is involved when it comes to defining a national character. Still, I think we can all agree that Britain\u2019s self-image is going to need some updating, because \u201cstout-hearted saviour of those in need\u201d just doesn\u2019t seem quite right for a country that completely flips its wig over the prospect of 70 child refugees. \u201cResidents of picturesque Devon village tell of their fury at \u2018bizarre\u2019 decision to send 70 young migrants there,\u201d bellowed <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3865588/Residents-picturesque-Devon-village-tell-fury-bizarre-decision-send-70-young-migrants-arrived-UK-jungle.html\">one recent headline</a>, suggesting the decision would be&#xa0;less bizarre if the \u201cyoung migrants\u201d \u2013 AKA child refugees \u2013 were sent somewhere less picturesque.

Last weekend Labour MP Chi Onwurah <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChiOnwurah/status/790510050594947072\">tweeted that someone had put up a mocking poster</a> in a communal kitchen in parliament, depicting a pensioner captioned as a child refugee. The Sun, David Davies and everyone else seeking adult faces among the child refugees claim they are merely trying to keep Britain \u201csafe\u201d for future generations; but if we\u2019re going to engage in this long-view thinking, how about looking at what kind of Britain we want our children to be defined by. There seems to be a lot of concern about the bad hombres exploiting \u201cthat famous British hospitality\u201d. I don\u2019t think we need worry about that for much longer.</p>",

Magnette and his socialist party are under pressure from the hard-left Maoist-leaning Workers\u2019 party of Belgium that is making inroads into Wallonia, a region of above-average unemployment. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"19d4db1e73593bb66d863a37ff888c0f96254fb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19d4db1e73593bb66d863a37ff888c0f96254fb7/0_161_4708_2826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Magnette (centre), Wallonia\u2019s leader, \u2018has put his Parti Socialiste back on the map\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Magnette (centre), Wallonia\u2019s leader, \u2018has put his Parti Socialiste back on the map\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Magnette, supported by centre-right Christian Democrats, has genuine objections to Ceta, says Dave Sinardet, professor at the Free University of Brussels. But his tactics also helped to put Wallonia\u2019s Parti Socialiste back on the map, \u201ccertainly among leftwing voters who have felt the PS was too pragmatic, too centrist and not a real leftwing party anymore\u201d. </p> <p>Meanwhile, according to one EU diplomat, EU leaders meeting at a summit last week expressed frustration that the Belgian prime minister, a liberal, could not do more to fix up a deal with the socialists in Wallonia.</p> <p>If it had not been Wallonia, it could have been somewhere else. German judges and Austrian MPs have raised concerns about Ceta in recent months; Romania and Bulgaria threatened to veto the treaty to secure visa-free travel to Canada for their citizens. The Dutch government warned on Friday that it may have to veto a trade deal with Ukraine following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/dutch-gear-up-for-the-other-eu-vote-giving-brussels-a-headache\">referendum that was seen as a vote against Europe</a>, rather than the specifics of the bilateral treaty.<br></p> <p>The drawn-out cliffhanger over Ceta and the Dutch problem over Ukraine have prompted recriminations about how the EU manages trade negotiations. Some say the commission blundered by allowing the member states a veto over trade agreements, instead of relying on the older method of a qualified-majority vote.</p> <p>The commission blames member state governments for not doing enough to sell trade deals to an increasingly sceptical public. Speaking before the Ceta crisis blew up, the EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u04e7m, said countries \u201care queuing up to negotiate with us\u201d, but were asking questions. \u201cIs it worth it? Is it worth negotiating with an EU that can\u2019t deliver? Member states have to put themselves into that question. Do we want trade agreements or not?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/26/wallonia-hard-brexit-belgian-wales-scotland\">The lesson from tiny Wallonia \u2013 there is a way to prevent hard Brexit | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a phrase that would be repeated by exasperated EU leaders, she said: \u201cIf we fail with Ceta, with Canada, the closest country to us all, the most European, one of the most democratic, least corrupt countries in the world \u2026 if we can\u2019t make a trade agreement with Canada, then who can we trade with?\u201d<br></p> <p>Brexit Britain is one answer, although probably not the country the commission has in mind, as it pursues trade deals with Japan and the US. The Conservative government wants to secure a trade agreement with the EU as soon as possible. </p> <p>Liam Fox, the secretary of state for international trade, this week called on the EU to agree a trade deal before the UK leaves the bloc. That would mean negotiating a trade agreement in parallel with the separate article 50 divorce procedure to disentangle the UK from the EU institutions. </p> <p>Such a rapid timetable leaves legal experts wincing. \u201cNegotiating both the withdrawal agreement and the framework is a herculean task,\u201d said Catrain. \u201cOn the withdrawal agreement [alone], even two years is very tight.\u201d<br></p> <p>She advises the British government to engage with EU member states and regional parliaments if they want a trade deal.</p> <p>The British government is wary of parallels with Canada, although a government source acknowledged that Ceta showed \u201cif we do end up in a world of an FTA [free trade agreement] outside the EU it isn\u2019t going to be terribly easy\u201d. But the source rejected \u201cslightly spurious analogies\u201d with Canada. \u201cFar from a free trade deal demolishing existing barriers, as with Canada, [the UK would be] in some ways erecting barriers that used not to be there, so it is a very different process.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, any trade deal with the UK would be closely watched by EU governments. During the Canadian negotiations, the commission had free rein to negotiate the fine points on protection of Roquefort cheese or competition for maritime services, with relatively little oversight from governments. Any Brexit trade deal will be political from day one. Each member state will fight for its own interests.</p> <p>The UK will need to meet the concerns of all EU countries, stresses Van der Loo. \u201cMember states are no longer reluctant to put their foot in the door and stop an agreement in order to gain what they want.\u201d </p>",

She isn\u2019t even the oddest contender in the party\u2019s current leadership race. Not by a long way. One candidate <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2016/10/man-who-accused-gay-donkey-trying-rape-his-horse-runs-ukip-leader\">who joined the race this week</a> was filmed in 2014 replying to an eye-wateringly homophobic question with an anecdote about the time he saw a donkey try to rape his horse. Deleted tweets by another rival <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/raheem-kassam-ukip-leadership-election-twitter-deleted_uk_580cf387e4b056572d82f392\">also surfaced this week</a>, including one in which he wished that someone would \u201ctape Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s mouth shut \u2026 and her legs, so she can\u2019t reproduce\u201d. All things being relative, it is therefore not unreasonable of Evans to cast herself as Ukip\u2019s poster girl for normality \u2013 the sage and sane choice to succeed Nigel Farage.</p> <p>So it feels fair to begin with her strong points. She was game enough to give her first big press interview to the Guardian, when the safer bet would have been a more obviously sympathetic paper. Most politicians are too wary of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/12/kitchen-miliband-photo-backfires-bbc-labour\">Ed \u201ctwo kitchens\u201d Miliband</a>-style debacle to allow an interview in their own home, so Evans\u2019 invitation to her flat in a south London suburb feels similarly spirited. But we are here on her sofa, I soon see, because even Ukip\u2019s most professional candidate does not have either the office facilities, or tactical training, of a backbench MP.</p> <p>A former BBC radio journalist who runs her own PR company, Evans looks and sounds a lot like middle England \u2013 or, as Andrew Marr put it to her on his show, Penelope Keith in The Good Life \u2013 and wants to reposition her party in that centre ground. She is, as she says many times, the \u201cmoderate, sensible\u201d face of Ukip. To date, Ukip\u2019s only unifying vision, beyond getting out of Europe, has been of a world without \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d, but anti-PC reforms Farage regarded as \u201ccommon sense\u201d are briskly ruled out by Evans.</p> <p>\u201cI actually really like the smoking ban!\u201d she exclaims with a tinkly laugh. \u201cSo I definitely disagree with Nigel on that one.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t dream of relaxing the drink-driving laws (\u201cNo, good God no, absolutely not\u201d) nor wage war on speed cameras (\u201cI am passionately anti-speeding\u201d). Not keen on gay marriage at first, she now finds it \u201ccharming\u201d, approves of gay couples adopting (\u201cGood parenting is what counts\u201d) and is delighted that bed-and-breakfast owners can no longer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/09/bed-and-breakfast-gay-couple-appeal\">turn away guests out of prejudice</a>. She did have a golliwog as a child, which she \u201cabsolutely loved,\u201d but later in life a black boyfriend \u201copened my eyes\u201d to this \u201cunacceptable stereotype\u201d, and now \u201cI totally see his point\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/23/suzanne-evans-declares-right-person-lead-ukip-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58zhk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2832644\"            data-video-name=\"Suzanne Evans declares herself \u2018the right person to lead Ukip\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580cc763e4b0582b9a8d5e1b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/23/161023EvansMarr_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/23/161023EvansMarr.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/23/161023EvansMarr_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/23/suzanne-evans-declares-right-person-lead-ukip-video\">Suzanne Evans declares herself \u2018the right person to lead Ukip\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her father died when she was six, leaving her penniless, working-class mother to raise her alone. Evans became a working single mother herself, after her brief and only marriage broke down, and raised her own daughter alone. There is nothing abstract or contrived about her emphatic feminism, and when she frames the case against multicultural Britain as a moral duty to protect ethnic-minority women from oppression, for once this argument doesn\u2019t sound like xenophobia disguised as feminism, but rings true. \u201cI will not stand by and see women in ethnic-minority communities treated worse than I am as a white, middle-class woman simply because they\u2019re in a different religion to me. It\u2019s unacceptable. Women\u2019s rights are women\u2019s rights. I don\u2019t care what class or background or culture you come from, you should have exactly the same rights as anyone else.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/26/nigel-farage-gets-his-life-back-sitcom-bbc\">Nigel Farage the sitcom: is Brexit\u2019s cheerleader beyond a joke?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like every Ukip politician I have met, Evans claims to have never heard a single racist word in her party. Unlike most, however, she appears genuinely disgusted, not just embarrassed, by ugly comments periodically reported in the press. \u201cThere have been times when I\u2019ve cringed, it\u2019s been dreadful. It\u2019s not nice, being out campaigning and being called a racist in the street. Or being spat on, or being abused. Changing that unfair reputation of Ukip is vital.\u201d</p> <p>Under her leadership, Evans would make the party \u201cfriendlier, more approachable, broaden our appeal \u2026 Do we want to trot along getting one MP into parliament every general election? Or do we want to put ourselves right at the heart of British politics, and do we want to succeed? If we want to be a party that actually wins elections, we need to do better. We can\u2019t have continuity Ukip. We need to have a big change that will bring in not just 4 million but 8 million voters. I\u2019m the candidate that will expand the party, and broaden our appeal, particularly to women, and make us dramatically more electable. With me as leader of Ukip, we can have a really strong alternative to the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>If I were a Labour MP in a deprived, northern, pro-Brexit town, I\u2019d be worried by now. Only Evans\u2019 leadership rivals may be as relieved to learn that her dangerously persuasive pitch begins to fall apart once she has delivered all her pre-prepared soundbites, but still cannot stop talking.</p> <p>At first the gaffes are fairly trivial; she designates a policy to the department of trade, which ceased to exist nearly 10 years ago. She might have meant the Department for International Trade, of course, but the error is only the least bizarre element of the whole proposal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f30d19cac02284173e36ac9d915fa3f04286b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f30d19cac02284173e36ac9d915fa3f04286b1/214_0_3882_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage with Evans in April 2015, with the Ukip manifesto she helped to write.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage with Evans in April 2015, presenting the Ukip manifesto she helped to write.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we fail to agree a trade deal with the EU, and WTO tariffs are the only solution, she says, \u201cWe\u2019ll be the ones that are quids in.\u201d Everyone agrees that tariffs would damage the EU more than us, because the EU sells more to us than it buys, so has more to lose when higher prices make everything harder to sell. But Evans must have confused this relative advantage with a notion that tariffs will actually make us better off. Because she goes on, \u201cWe can use that net benefit \u2013 that net profit, if you like \u2013 to support any businesses which find that the imposition of external tariffs is causing them a problem. We will have enough money in the pot to compensate them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/18/ukip-tories-labour-policy\">Ukip may be dead but its agenda is alive and well | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through what mechanism? \u201cYou would do it, you would do it through the mechanism of, er \u2013 the business department. You\u2019d just have to, you\u2019d just have to refund \u2013 they could make an application for support and it would come out of this pot. You\u2019d set up a pot. Somehow.\u201d</p> <p>A pot? \u201cYeah, well, I just think, if you look \u2013 I\u2019m not clear exactly how you\u2019d do it, I haven\u2019t really thought it through. You just \u2013 there would \u2013 we would have a net balance of payments, the country would be better off as a result of \u2013 it\u2019s not us that\u2019s going to lose out, it\u2019s the EU who\u2019s going to lose out. So we would have a greater income on the import tariffs that we put on the European Union. So you take those import tariffs and then you give them back to any business that\u2019s struggling and could prove there was any hardship as a result of being forced to adopt the WTO external tariff. Then I think there would arguably be a pot of money there that they could fall back on, if needs be. I don\u2019t see why that shouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p> <p>There is a very simple reason why it would not be possible: it is illegal under WTO rules. But even if it weren\u2019t, the logic of her scheme is baffling. If tariffs depress sales, it\u2019s difficult to see how they can simultaneously generate a big pot of new profit. If somehow they can, it\u2019s even harder to see how we can sell less than the EU yet be the side that\u2019s \u201cquids in\u201d, and harder still to see how so much money would be allowed to bypass the treasury for the department of business. \u201cSorry, I mean it would be the department of trade.\u201d She gives a shrill, uneasy laugh. \u201cYes, sorry! Department of trade, yes. I would have thought so, yeah.\u201d By now she looks almost as embarrassed as I do. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just floating an idea here.\u201d</p> <p>I suspect she hadn\u2019t intended to say much about her rival candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/22/ukip-donor-backs-former-nigel-farage-aide-as-party-leader\">Raheem Kassam</a>, either. Farage\u2019s close confidante and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/10/ukip-insider-raheem-kassam-we-had-to-lock-hq-doors-because-some-people-were-too-embarrassing-to-be-seen\">former chief of staff</a> edits the British version of Breitbart, a jaw-droppingly rightwing online newspaper that makes the Daily Mail look like the Morning Star.

Having insisted she doesn\u2019t want to talk about Kassam, because \u201cthere is no appetite in the country for his far-right views\u201d, she accuses him of inventing lies to smear her, \u201csticking the knife in right left and centre\u201d, and being \u201cincredibly sexist towards me\u201d.

Sorry, Nigel, but I have to call you out on this, it\u2019s simply not true.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what she would do about the migrant camp in Calais, her first answer sounds like the one she meant to give. Being \u201ccompletely unqualified\u201d to judge a refugee\u2019s age, she would delegate the task to a \u201cpanel of experts\u201d, and her agonised laments about the moral dilemma posed by the camp might have made her look compassionate, had she only been able to stop there. But she carries on talking, sabotaging any impression of compassion as her tone hardens, speculating that \u201cunaccompanied\u201d minors couldn\u2019t have got to Calais alone, so must have been left there by parents who would miraculously \u201cpop up\u201d and demand to be reunited once their child had made it to Britain. As for Calais\u2019 adults, \u201cYou try and break the rules, travel across six countries to get here, because you\u2019re trying your luck, and try to knock a few lorry drivers on the head and try to burst into Britain?

How did that happen?</strong></p> <p>Five months is a long time in education policy. The \u201ceducation for all\u201d bill, whose provisions were unveiled by the then chancellor George Osborne in his March&#xa0;budget, was quietly ditched on&#xa0;Thursday after some oblique remarks&#xa0;in <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2016-10-27/HLWS224/\" title=\"\">a written statement</a> by education secretary Justine Greening. It&#xa0;was a miserable end for Nicky Morgan\u2019s legacy as Greening\u2019s predecessor, and the termination of the David Cameron-Michael Gove era&#xa0;of educational policy-making.</p> <p><strong>Has this got anything to do with </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/grammarschools\" title=\"\"><strong>grammar schools</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>Not directly. In fact, Greening\u2019s statement, ostensibly announcing a new technical and further education bill, was blunt on that point: the current \u201cSchools that work for everyone\u201d consultation remains on track, \u201cincluding selective places for local areas that want them\u201d. But Labour detects signs that the government is having second thoughts about grammar schools, and in reality the consultation on selection is open until later in November, with a white paper to come early next year \u2013 and presumably another education bill will appear after that. Greening\u2019s move is a&#xa0;clearing of the decks: getting rid of the leftovers from the Morgan regime in order to press on with grammar schools and other higher priorities.</p> <p><strong>What has been lost with the demise of&#xa0;the bill?</strong></p> <p>Morgan\u2019s signature measure \u2013 that all state schools would be forced to become academies by 2022 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies\" title=\"\">had already been rowed back upon</a>. But Greening\u2019s non-announcement does kill off the government\u2019s stated determination to&#xa0;convert all schools into academies, even&#xa0;without a time frame. Greening\u2019s position is that \u201cour focus \u2026 is on encouraging schools to convert voluntarily\u201d. Among the provisions to go is one that required all schools in \u201cunderperforming\u201d local authorities to&#xa0;become academies. Another is the&#xa0;abolition of statutory places for parent-governors on the boards of maintained schools.</p> <p><strong>Where does this leave local authorities&#xa0;and the schools they will&#xa0;still be overseeing?</strong></p> <p>The old bill would effectively have ended the role of local authorities in schools (other than running admissions), placing school improvement in the hands of regional schools commissioners. The government has already budgeted cuts of \u00a3600m for local authority schools services next year. Now local authorities have been left in limbo: they still have school-improvement responsibilities, a&#xa0;large number of mainly primary schools to oversee, and no money to do it with. Naturally they are hoping the government will reverse the cuts and allow them to fund school improvement and other educational functions.</p> <p><strong>So why did the government wait so long to drop the bill?</strong></p> <p>It took the Department for Education this long to realise how much work it has in front of it. It has only recently completed taking responsibility for higher education from the old Department for Business Innovation and Science, a merger that brought with it another bill to pilot through parliament. Then there was the existing children and social work bill and, as of&#xa0;Thursday, the technical and further education bill, meaning that the DfE had three bills on the go. On top of that the department has the schools consultation \u2013 including the thorny issue of grammar schools \u2013 to prepare. Then there\u2019s the matter of a promised new schools funding formula, to replace the current byzantine system. It\u2019s a complicated issue that has already been delayed, with Greening last&#xa0;summer promising a DfE response by this autumn. That\u2019s not to mention the department\u2019s daily work of pushing along academies and free schools, and a&#xa0;plethora of other issues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/24/almost-third-of-teachers-quit-within-five-years-of-qualifying-figures\">Almost a third of teachers quit state sector within five years of qualifying</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Why are abrupt changes in policy so common at the moment?</strong></p> <p>That may have much to do with the post-Brexit change of government, with new ministers and leaders not committed to existing policies and able to ditch those that had proved to be unpopular or inconvenient \u2013 even those proposed in a Queen\u2019s speech. Greening has even dropped a&#xa0;2015 manifesto commitment that would have seen resits for children who underperformed in maths, and reading tests at the end of primary school. A&#xa0;controversial primary school spelling, punctuation and grammar test has also been put on hold after Greening called for the issue of primary school assessment to be retooled.</p> <p><strong>What other U-turns may be on the way?</strong></p> <p>The outlook for legislation allowing new grammar schools remains fraught: there appears to be little enthusiasm for it among Conservatives. Even if the SNP stays neutral, any new law could get blocked in the House of Lords. But one policy that could easily be dropped is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/24/new-gcse-rules-could-bring-down-pass-rate\" title=\"\">forced retakes</a> for pupils who fail to gain at least a C in maths and English GCSEs \u2013 another Gove-era legacy that is very unpopular among head teachers.</p>",

Somewhere beneath all this junk is my desk, and somewhere on that \u2013 maybe behind one of those dried-up tester pots of paint, or underneath yesterday\u2019s newspaper? \u2013 is a letter that&#xa0;needs signing. Somewhere.</p> <p>But it\u2019s fine because, according to the <a href=\"http://timharford.com/books/undercovereconomist/\" title=\"\">economist Tim Harford</a>, a tidy desk genuinely is a sign of a wasted life. Well, sort of. In his new book, <a href=\"http://timharford.com/books/messy/\" title=\"\">Messy</a>, he explores the eternal cliche that creativity springs from chaos and concludes that tidying up too much \u2013 either literally, or figuratively by creating overly rigid systems or ways of thinking \u2013 really is counterproductive. Take that, so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/06/decluttering-cant-save-us-from-the-consumerist-mess-weve-made\" title=\"\">decluttering experts</a>, with your endless guff about the right way to fold T-shirts!</p> <p>Tidiness often masks fragility, the book argues, and a nagging anxiety about things spiralling out of control (which may be why teenagers, who crave being out of control, so often choose to live in squalor).

Mess in the home is all too often just a form of disrespect for other people, in the same way that creative destruction in business can be code for \u201cmaximising profit by costing other people their jobs\u201d.</p> <p>The key here, perhaps, is to distinguish aimless or selfish mess from the more purposeful, creative kind children make when they\u2019re playing; sticking fat fingers in paint pots, spreading Lego rubble all over the carpet, breaking things up but only in order to put them together more satisfyingly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a part of me that shamelessly enjoys a thorough tidy, sort and file</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last week I was in Hull, which is frantically giving itself a facelift ahead of becoming next year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/14/hull-uk-city-of-culture-2017-rowan-moore\" title=\"\">City of Culture</a>.

  "<p>When Clare Budgen bought her first house in Ellesmere Port in 2009 for \u00a3155,000 the last thing on her mind was the lease. Taylor Wimpey, the developer, arranged the lease on a 999-year basis, so what could the then 22-year-old possibly have had to worry about?</p> <p>But just seven years later, when she looked into buying the freehold (to enable her to sell the home more easily in the future) she was astonished to find that, first, Taylor Wimpey had sold her freehold to another company, E&amp;J Estates, and, second, it wanted \u00a332,000.</p> <p>Paula Richmond is in a similar boat. In 2015, she bought a four-bed house built by Taylor Wimpey in 2011 for \u00a3122,000, thinking she had bagged a bargain. Again, the original <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/leasehold\">lease</a> was for 999 years and with 995 more years to go, it was the least of her concerns. At the time, she understood that buying the freehold would cost no more than \u00a32,000-\u00a33,000. But, like Clare, she has found that her lease has been sold to E&amp;J Estates by Taylor Wimpey and has been told by surveyors that she will have to pay up to \u00a340,000 for the freehold \u2013 one-third of the house\u2019s value. Paula can\u2019t afford it and says \u201cthe house is almost unsaleable\u201d, with solicitors warning potential buyers to stay away.</p> <p>Like thousands of others in England and Wales, buyers like Paula and Clare (not their real names) have been trapped by a controversial trend among developers to sell homes as leasehold when they previously would have been freehold. The buyers are given reassuringly long 999-year leases \u2013 usually it is leases of less than 60 years on flats that are a worry \u2013 but later find that buying the freehold is prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>One surveyor Guardian Money spoke to in Manchester said a client had just been forced to pay \u00a338,000 to buy the freehold on their recently built home, despite its long lease.</p> <p>The trap for unsuspecting buyers comes from the escalation in ground rent in the small print of long leases. Initially, it looks affordable. The developer gives the buyer a 999-year lease, with the ground rent set, in Paula\u2019s case, at \u00a3295 a year. The contract says the ground rent will double every 10 years. This may look innocuous \u2013 after all, most people move every seven to 10 years. But to the company that buys the freehold, the income is valuable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With ground rents at \u00a3295 doubling every 10 years, it\u2019s creating a lot of value in the leasehold</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time a 28-year-old buyer with a 30-year mortgage comes to the end of their loan term, they will have to pay \u00a32,360 a year in ground rent. And if they don\u2019t pay their home can be seized with no compensation. The companies that have bought up freeholds claim they have to be paid large amounts to compensate them for the loss of income.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, when a property had a 999-year lease there was almost no value in its reversion [to a freehold]. The ground rent was often just \u00a35, so the capital value of that was small,\u201d says the surveyor in Manchester, who wishes to remain anonymous. But now with ground rents at \u00a3295 doubling every 10 years, it\u2019s creating a lot of value in the leasehold. The maths isn\u2019t understood by those buying these houses. It\u2019s a significant problem and is catching out solicitors too.\u201d</p> <p>According to government figures, around 6,000 new houses were sold as leasehold last year. While in the past, homes on new-build estates were sold as freehold, Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Bellway now regularly sell estate houses as leasehold. At new developments currently for sale, we found a range of ground rents, with some doubling every 10 years and others rising at the level of the retail prices index (RPI), which makes them potentially less onerous, but still expensive.</p> <p>Justin Madders, MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston, whose constituency covers Clare\u2019s home, calls the situation \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d. He says: \u201cI have had a number of constituents contact me, saying they were aware at the time of purchase that the freehold was extra. However, they didn\u2019t know the original developer sold the leaseholds to private investors who have ruthlessly exploited the law to line their own pockets.</p> <p>\u201cThe prices they have been quoted to buy the freehold have rocketed beyond any reasonable sum people can afford. I have found constituents are unable to afford the fees being quoted and there are extortionate charges associated with obtaining permission to alter the property. Just over \u00a32,500 was quoted for permission just to build an extension.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8d1c99fa0c55bd01207e5f7739c98957d80d6f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8d1c99fa0c55bd01207e5f7739c98957d80d6f2/13_58_2391_3196/748.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Wimpey\u2019s Dale Moor View development in Rossendale\" width=\"748\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marketing material for Taylor Wimpey\u2019s Dale Moor View development in Rossendale, Lancashire, makes no mention of leasehold or ground rent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taylor Wimpey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is easy for buyers to miss the fact that the property is leasehold. For example, Persimmon\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.persimmonhomes.com/agusta-park-10463\">Agusta Park</a> development in Yeovil, Somerset, comprises two-, three- and four-bedroom homes, all leasehold. We could find no prominent mention on Persimmon\u2019s website, or in the brochure, that the homes were leasehold. When we rang posing as the friend of a potential buyer and asked for details about the lease, we were told it was for 999 years and the ground rent was \u00a3150, then \u00a3190. After some confusion, we were told the ground rent would go up every 10 years using a formula linked to the RPI.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a 1,000-year lease. If she lives to 100 there will still be another 900 years to go. It\u2019s virtually freehold,\u201d we were told. \u201cFlats are always sold as leasehold. Lots of [house] developments are going this way now. People are scared of change because it\u2019s something new. But it\u2019s virtually freehold.\u201d</p> <p>We asked if the freehold could be purchased. \u201cIt\u2019s not available at the outset, but can be bought within two years.\u201d We asked to be guided on the price of buying it. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea. We don\u2019t quote on the price of the freehold,\u201d was the response.</p> <p>Potential buyers allege they are not told about the leasehold until late in the process. \u201cWe were about to purchase a new house when we noticed that part of the communal charge for the upkeep of open spaces was for ground rent,\u201d says one Guardian Money reader, who alleges that at no stage was the word leasehold used by the salespeople, nor was it in any of the documentation signed.</p> <p>The reader says they pulled out of the purchase of the Persimmon home after seeing stories of housebuilders charging tens of thousands of pounds to purchase the freehold and large fees just to give permission to make alterations, such as installing a conservatory.</p> <h2>What the builders say</h2> <p>We asked the big developers why they are selling houses as leasehold. Persimmon says: \u201cPersimmon sells a mixture of both leasehold and \u00adfreehold properties. As Persimmon has acquired other \u00adcompanies over the decades, it has inherited the freehold reversions of leasehold properties sold by those businesses. There are around three million leaseholders in Britain. All Persimmon leasehold houses carry an extremely long \u00ad999-year lease and customers are informed at \u00adpurchase what type of property they are buying.\u201d</p> <p>It refused to provide details of the typical ground rents charged or how much it earns from selling freeholds. It also declined to say what fees, if any, leaseholders might have to pay for things such as a conservatory.<br></p> <p>We asked Taylor Wimpey about the cases involving Paula and Clare. It \u00adconfirmed it had sold their freeholds to E&amp;J Estates, but did not disclose the price, and would not comment on the \u00a332,000 E&amp;J Estates wants from Clare for the freehold on her home. <br></p> <p>We also asked about its new \u00addevelopments, such as Dale Moor View in Rossendale, Lancashire, where all the homes are leasehold. In a \u00adstatement, it says: \u201cAt Taylor Wimpey the vast majority of our houses are sold on a freehold basis. However, in a small number of developments, \u00adpredominantly in regions of the \u00adcountry where it is common practice in the market, we sell houses on a leasehold basis. Throughout any sale process, customers are fully informed of the ownership structure of the home. If a customer is interested in such a property, the sales team advises them whether the property is being sold on a leasehold basis.\u201d<br></p> <p>E&amp;J Estates said it was \u201cunable to comment on this matter but will always engage with individual leaseholders\u201d. <br></p> <h2>What can be done?</h2> <p>Campaigners say issues around \u00adleasehold properties will be top of the agenda for an all-party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold next month. It has attracted 43 MPs and lords, and is chaired by Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick and Tory Sir Peter \u00adBottomley. Members include Sir Keir Starmer, Emma Reynolds and Barry Gardiner.</p> <p>Sebastian O\u2019Kelly of support group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership says: \u201cIt is disgraceful that plc \u00adhousebuilders are building leasehold houses that \u00adordinarily \u2013 and until recently \u2013 would have had freehold title. This is an \u00aderosion of the wealth of ordinary people at the expense of the rich.<br></p> <p>\u201cYoung people, after years of paying rent, finally buy a home and then find they are still, in fact, tenants \u2013 which is what a leaseholder is \u2013 with all the \u00advulnerability that that implies.\u201d<br></p> <p>He adds: \u201cThe housebuilders are evasive over this issue and it beggars belief that the \u00adoutrageous ground rent multiples come from household-name builders. There is no attempt to justify the adoption of leasehold tenure for these houses, which are not complex communal sites such as blocks of flats.<br></p> <p>MP Justin Madders is calling for a ban on leasehold for estates of houses. \u201cIt is clear this system is being abused to drive huge profits at ordinary \u00adhomeowners\u2019 expense. There is no need for there to be leasehold properties, particularly those on an estate where the properties are mainly detached houses. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey need to be banned \u2013 it may be a convenient way for developers to get extra profit from their building work, but once they get in the hands of these private equity companies the profit motive overrides any considerations that there are real people living in their homes, who are being asked to stump up eye-watering sums.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Have you faced a large bill to buy the freehold on a recently built house?

  "<p>When Kelly and Steve O\u2019Reilly from Fife popped a five-litre can of paint mixed at their local B&amp;Q store into the boot of their new BMW, they had no idea of the destruction it was about to cause. On the short drive home, the container opened, causing, they say, an extraordinary \u00a39,000 worth of damage as it poured through the car. But the O\u2019Reillys are not alone; a growing number of shoppers allege that paint mixed at B&amp;Q, under the Valspar brand, is placed into flimsy plastic containers that open far too easily on journeys home, causing devastating damage.</p> <p>\u201cYou have no idea how much damage five litres of paint can do to a car until it happens to you \u2013 it went over everything \u2013 our shoes, clothes \u2013 everything,\u201d says Kelly, who was 35 weeks pregnant at the time. \u201cAfter three hours of cleaning we were not making any difference \u2013 the paint had seeped into the seats.

They say it seeped into the car\u2019s underbody, eventually shorting the electrics. The \u00a312,000-car broke down and had to be towed to a garage. Last week, it was declared as not worth repairing.</p> <p>They are just the latest in a growing number of B&amp;Q customers who claim that plastic containers of Valspar paint \u2013 sold exclusively in the UK by the DIY chain \u2013 are not fit for purpose.

She says she has lost a year\u2019s no claims bonus and had to pay \u00a3350 excess, with \u00a3240 worth of clothes in the boot ruined.

That suggests this packaging is not quite fit for purpose, and that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Barrister Richard Colbey of London\u2019s Lamb Chambers says the Consumer Rights Act is on the customer\u2019s side as all goods sold must be of \u201csatisfactory\u201d quality. Damages can, and often are, awarded to reflect harm caused by defective goods over and above the cost of the goods.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not possible for B&amp;Q to exclude its liability in this situation by saying it is not responsible for what happens once it leaves the shop. If B&amp;Q disputes liability the victims should sue and consider seeking a group litigation order. However, if the customers bought more than \u00a3100 worth of paint with a credit card, the card company would also be liable for the damage.\u201d</p> <p>David Foster, a partner at Guildford solicitor firm Barlow Robbins, said it would look at acting for the O\u2019Reillys and others. \u201cIt may be the tins or lids, or the security of the lids is suspect and the retailer should be both replacing the paint and paying for the clean-up. The litigation may rest on how the judge views the expert evidence both sides would produce.\u201d</p> <p>B&amp;Q is refusing to pay nearly all the above customers\u2019 claims. It says: \u201cAll the products we sell at B&amp;Q are rigorously tested before we put them on sale. In the past year more than three million cans of Valspar store-mixed paint have been bought in our stores, with fewer than one in 100,000 tins leading to a paint spillage complaint.</p> <p>\u201cOn the rare occasion that a customer experiences a problem, we take this seriously, assess the complaint to understand what happened and whether anything could have been done differently. All paint containers used by Valspar meet industry standards and their supplier is accredited by ISO 9001:2015. Despite this, we are carrying out additional testing so that we can remain completely satisfied that the cans are fit for purpose.\u201d</p> <h2>Where are the warnings?<br></h2> <p>To find out what warnings or advice are given when buying Valspar paint at B&amp;Q, Guardian Money bought a tin this week at our local store. The staff member who mixed it simply put the lid on by hand \u2013 no equipment was used \u2013 and sent us on our way. No holding clips were offered and there were no warnings about keeping it upright. Nor were there warnings on the container lid, despite a promise by B&amp;Q on 3 October that they would be put on Valspar paint containers.</p> <p>Having struggled to open paint lids in the past, most people would be staggered at how easy it is to open these. They pop open with minimal effort and feel flimsy in comparison with the old metal paint tins. To check its robustness, we took it outside and simulated it falling over in the back of a car. One decent shove and our container started leaking a small amount of paint.

Here, I thought, I could finally be myself \u2013 and I started to think about being out at work. I had been suppressing my true self and living a lie: friends and family knew about my sexuality, but it was tiresome to lead a dual existence and keep up a pretence with colleagues and students.<br></p> <p>I wanted to show my new students it was OK to be gay, that I was proud of who I was. If nothing else, it would mean an end to all of those draining strategies I\u2019d employed at work for years: don\u2019t admit you\u2019re into musical theatre; don\u2019t flounce; say you like football (I do, so that one\u2019s not too bad). The problem is that my teaching style is quite dramatic and, well, flouncy at times, unlike that of most maths teachers.<br></p> <p>I told my new head of department that I was thinking about revealing my sexuality at school. Her only concern was that some members of the team might offend me by making jokes \u2013 though with the aim of making me feel part of the team. I then broached my intentions with the headteacher. He\u2019s old-school, in a good way, traditionalist but totally living in the real world. He didn\u2019t bat an eyelid and told me to get on with it.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/apr/02/secret-teacher-refuse-negativity-teaching-bring-down\">Secret Teacher: I refuse to let the negativity in teaching bring me down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was easier said than done. I wasn\u2019t sure how to broach the subject, short of singing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj8C43r4zm0\">I Am What I Am</a> in assembly. An opportunity came when I took on a Y11 tutor group as a maternity cover. In our first session, one of the students asked straight out if I was gay. I answered with an emphatic \u201cYes\u201d. I waited for the booing or the pretending-to-be-sick noises, but none came. A group of girls wanted to know if I was single (I\u2019d recently broken up with someone) and whether I\u2019d have a civil ceremony (yes, if I met the right guy) but otherwise it was a non-event. I do think my honesty served to make them trust me quickly \u2013 vital in a pastoral role \u2013 but my sexuality was ultimately quite boring.<br></p> <p>My transparency has become an advantage. I\u2019m the school\u2019s go-to gay guy. People with gay children have asked me for advice. Other teachers have shared their concerns about the vulnerability of gay students.<br></p> <p>I hope my decision will help some of the young people in my school to feel less scared about making that still-scary step themselves. I recently ran into some of my students at a local gay pride event and they were thrilled to see me there. I loved seeing them there too, looking happy and relaxed in a safe environment and celebrating who they are.<br></p> <p>So why bother to tell my story in my workplace? Why now?

  "<h2>I\u2019m mid-40s and have stalled \u2013 but how do I compete for jobs with younger people?</h2> <p><strong>I am in my 40s and have worked all my life in several sectors. But I\u2019ve come to a standstill in my career where I\u2019m working for the NHS as a doctors\u2019 receptionist \u2013 \u201cDragons, wannabe doctors\u201d, as everyone calls us. This, of course, is not true, but why bother to explain, it will make no difference.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>I want a change, but feel like I\u2019m an old person in a new, just-out-of-school-and-willing-to-learn/make-a-difference world.&#xa0;How do I prove that I can be the right person for the job with my expansive work history over all these teens? Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Doctors\u2019 receptionists form a human buffer zone between two groups of distracted people \u2013 the doctors, doing their best to diagnose and treat multiple patients every day, usually in 10-minute segments, and trying and often failing to keep to an impossible timetable; and their patients, often anxious parents, with health concerns that make them more than normally self-centred. I can sense from your letter that the daily experience of being held responsible for circumstances wholly outside of your control has taken its toll.</p> <p>That is all too understandable, but you must try very hard not to let your sense of grievance show. One of the most unattractive characteristics you can reveal in an interview is world-weariness, bordering on bitterness and cynicism. No one wants to import such an attitude into their workplace and it will count heavily against you.</p> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s not a prejudice against&#xa0;older people, as such, that works against them; in stark contrast with the bright-eyed optimism of the young, it\u2019s the way they can exude a sense of cynicism and hopelessness.</p> <p>You want a change, but the chances are that your best bet of finding something satisfying to do will have some connection, even if slight, with some part of your previous \u201cexpansive work history\u201d. Think systematically of all the jobs you\u2019ve done, and all the different situations you\u2019ve encountered, and pick a couple you\u2019d like to return to. And then, just as systematically, list not what you\u2019d want from such positions but what you \u2013 with all your experience \u2013 could contribute to them. That\u2019s what any application you make must positively project: enthusiasm, real understanding of the specific task concerned, and with an emphasis on what you believe you could bring to it.</p> <p>You can\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d that you would be the right person for a job, nobody can. But you can, entirely legitimately, present yourself as a very attractive prospect.</p> <p> <strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 If being an administrator has been your primary experience over the past 20 years then there are a great many senior administrator positions that you could apply for, highlighting your extensive experience including customer facing work and the associated managing of unexpected events under pressure etc. But you sound frustrated, so take some time to work on your mind set. <strong>FatherLarryDuff</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Consider a larger employer, as you will have access to internal vacancies, secondment opportunities and staff development. Be proactive about your skills gaps and focus on redirecting your career with energy, determination and positivity. <strong>TheRunningGirl</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I am 40, and my closest colleague at work, on the same management level as I am, is 25 and has many skills I don\u2019t have \u2013 and recognises that I have some skills he doesn\u2019t yet have either. We learn from each other. I\u2019d say treat your colleagues with respect, do the job to the best of your ability, and show rather than tell those around you your abilities. If you have talent and are assertive you should be able to shine, but don\u2019t belittle those who are different from you. <strong>tacitanontacit</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Wait until you reach your 50s. <strong>stevenhope1964</strong></p> <h2>I want to help people and work in recruitment, but am always told that I\u2019m too nice</h2> <p><strong>I have worked in the relentless business of employment advice so long that I have become disillusioned about what transferable skills I have. I\u2019ve dealt with customers who have been unemployed for decades, and helped those with severe disabilities or that are suicidal and in need of mental health assessments.</strong></p> <p><strong>I first thought that I could go into recruitment, but after about six interviews I got told by every company that I am either \u201cnot hungry enough\u201d or am \u201ctoo nice\u201d for recruitment.</strong></p> <p><strong>My current job is not giving me the hours I would like and I am looking over my shoulder every day waiting for the boss to say, \u201cWell this is your last day, they pulled the plug.\u201d</strong></p> <p><strong>I have all the experience in the world but not one qualification to my name. I have been promised qualifications left right and centre but when I have asked about them the answer is usually something about them trying to get the funding.</strong></p> <p><strong>Where else do I fit, what else can I do? I love helping people but recruitment thinks I\u2019m not evil enough.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>A bit like the reader before, you show signs of allowing your disillusionment to colour your entire approach to finding agreeable work. Again, that\u2019s completely understandable \u2013 but if it becomes apparent in your manner it can only harm your prospects.</p> <p>I doubt if your lack of qualifications is holding you back. In feedback, recruiters often cite an absence of qualifications as an objective reason for rejecting an applicant, when in truth the reason was more subjective. Where the right job is concerned, your extensive experience should more than compensate for the absence of more formal training.</p> <p>I would strongly encourage you not to abandon recruitment as a prime goal. The fact you\u2019ve been called for interview six times is encouraging. Not all companies share the same hard-edged attitude to recruitment and staff management that you\u2019ve so far encountered.</p> <p>You have long experience of working with the long-term unemployed, the severely disabled and those with mental health problems. And still you love helping people. Please hang on to that central truth. Whatever you do, don\u2019t even think of pretending to be \u201cless nice\u201d or \u201cmore evil\u201d \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t convince anyone and you\u2019d feel a fraud.</p> <p>With optimistic perseverance, and employing some of the tips I\u2019ve suggested to the reader above, you have every chance of finding what you\u2019re looking for.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 It sounds like you\u2019ve been applying to recruitment agencies where the role is essentially a sales role. One option is to look at in-house recruiters where the roles are much more about assessment and selection, which sound like they would use your skills much better.</p> <p>You could also look at applying for entry-level recruitment and/or HR roles \u2013 often these come with the ability to do day release to gain a professional qualification with the CIPD. <strong>ElizaBen</strong></p> <p>\u2022 You work at the pointy end of human problems, which few people can do. This makes you a relatively rare commodity. Would it help to approach yourself as if you were one of your own clients, and make the case for yourself that you would for them? <strong>CatVidHevn</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

  "<p>\u2018Don\u2019t use your fingers,\u201d Lynne commands. \u201cStick it further into your mouth, cover your teeth with your lip and blow hard. Yes! Yes!\u201d I follow her direction and the peace of the morning is shattered by shrill wailing. Another sax lesson is in full swing.</p> <p>Over the years I\u2019ve sought relaxation in many forms. Some, such as running, have eased body and soul, providing much time to think. Others, such as motorcycling, demand total absorption so distract from thinking and worry. This latter need sees me taking music lessons from Lynne and discovering the joy of the saxophone.</p> <p>Actually, the only person taking joy in my playing is me; for others it is a less welcome new obsession. Matt raises his head from his educational (he tells me) gameplay, \u201cDaaaaaaaad. Can you be quiet? I can\u2019t hear the zombies\u2019 screams.\u201d Harry the cat only has to see me pick it up and he\u2019s out of the cat flap like a furry rocket leaving Houston.</p> <p>Its impact on the household and neighbours is enhanced by the fact that, Gollum-like, I keep my shiny, golden \u201cprecious\u201d close to hand on a stand in the hall. I can blow it in passing, and often do.</p> <p>Millie, herself a saxophonist, suggests: \u201cWe can grade together, Dad.\u201d No way. I don\u2019t have enough life left to grade my way up. More pertinently, though, this is all about stress relief that comes in a case not a glass. I don\u2019t want any pressure of exams.</p> <p>I love playing, though \u2013 the level of absorption is total and the instrument is a thing of beauty. I polish it, play it and service it. I pull the bell end through with a cleaning string in a comforting echo of cleaning a rifle barrel \u2013 from so many years ago when shooting provided the same distracted pleasure. Unlike shooting, however, no one gets earplugs when I play, no matter how much they beg.</p> <p>I need something to aim for so choose an alto sax piece from my youth: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou96vLl--e4\" title=\"\">Hazel O\u2019Connor\u2019s ballad Will You</a>. It\u2019s the soundtrack to a thousand seductions; the vocals end halfway, the rest being Wesley Magoogan\u2019s unexpected and stunning sax solo. The length and the instrument\u2019s dominance are probably helped by the fact that he co-wrote it.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tricky piece, much of it in the alto\u2019s upper register. For a novice it\u2019s a very punchy choice, akin to hoping to produce a Bake Off \u201cshowstopper\u201d the day after you buy your first cake tin.</p> <p>If you watch him in concert on You Tube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twqdWWY5iEc\" title=\"\">Magoogan plays with breathtaking feeling, skill and style</a>. Of the many other people who have covered it, no one gets close to matching his note-perfect, sensual delivery. It may help that he seems to have very long fingers and can cover the keys with a speed my stumpy ones can\u2019t get close to.</p> <p>The day after Lynne has suggested I may be \u201crhythmically challenged\u201d, I\u2019m discussing my wider shortcomings and finger length with Pete. \u201cActually, mate, I bet you \u00a3100 you can play Will You better than Wesley Magoogan,\u201d he says with a glint in his eye that suggests mischief rather than comfort.</p> <p>I assume the worst: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me he\u2019s dead \u2013 he can\u2019t be much older than&#xa0;me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not, but those long fingers lost a fight with a circular saw and he\u2019s not playing the saxophone like that, or probably at all, any more.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m speechless. Poor Wesley! I\u2019m not surprised, though, given that so much of my new life seems waymarked by pathos-laden back stories. Bereavement seems like a magnet to bizarre coincidence and event.</p> <p>I should have taken the bet though, as even now Wesley is still probably better than me \u2013 my F sharp sounding like Harry when his tail gets trodden on.</p> <p>For a while, his accident taints the piece for me but when I look up how positive he is now, curating the art talent of his son Lester (who has Down\u2019s syndrome), I\u2019m determined not only to play the song but also nail it. It may be aural torture for now but it\u2019s a tribute to Wesley, to positivity, a distraction from grief and another step forwards. Will You? \u2013 too bloody right!</p> <p><em>Adam Golightly is a pseudonym</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrAdamGolightly\" title=\"\"><em>@MrAdamGolightly</em></a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Manage your risk appetites.</strong> The general difference between men and women\u2019s approach to money is that men are usually risk takers, they will be more speculative and go for a higher risk/higher potential yield. Women tend not to be, they want to play it safer, so this can lead to arguments. I\u2019ve seen couples perfectly aligned in all other matters but, when they start talking about money investments, rows can erupt. Before you enter into any financial agreement, it\u2019s a good idea to think not only of the different products available, but the different approaches to risk and security behind them.</p> <p><strong>The heart is where home is.</strong> The biggest arguments I see are where there are children at home. The person who is more \u201cat home\u201d wants less risk. A lot of it is to do with very emotive things: matters to do with children\u2019s education are behind the biggest arguments I see. If private education is an option, one half of the couple usually wants it for the children (usually the one who is more at home with them) and the other is saying \u201cthe state is just as good and we can save the money\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Open your post!</strong> This is one of the simplest things you can do to avoid rows. If there\u2019s someone who has a habit of not opening financial post, then I advise you get into a routine of opening it together every evening. If that still doesn\u2019t work, and your partner won\u2019t open his or her post, then you just have to open it for them. Nothing gets better by not opening the envelope and often things can get very much worse.</p> <p><strong>Ringfence some of your wages. </strong>Debit or credit cards held in joint names can be a point of friction. Many couples argue about how that money has been spent. You may want to have separate cards and ringfence some of your wages to spend how you want.</p> <p><strong>Know where your money goes. </strong>Transparency and a realistic approach to how much money is coming in versus going out is key to avoiding almost all arguments. Yet very few couples will budget in this way until they are forced to. Some couples can be really shocked when I make them sit down and do this, and can find it painful. Mortgage financing these days can go into a lot of detail: the lender will want to know not only how much you earn, but also exactly where your money goes. Women tend to know this; men don\u2019t. In my experience, men are terrible at discussing money with their partners. My advice is to have a realism check regularly: go through bank statements and work out what are fixed costs, what are variables. Then ask whether you can afford it.</p> <p><strong>Be disciplined.</strong> If you need to contribute to regular things like tax, then siphon away an amount into a separate account if you are not disciplined enough to avoid spending it.</p> <p><strong>Outline your ambitions.</strong> It\u2019s not romantic but, before you set up home or knit together your financial lives, it\u2019s worth having a chat about your different aims and ambitions. Not just about where to live or having children, but your approach to money. This can save lots of rows later on. Will you prioritise the latest car over a new roof (lots of people do). Will you want to have holidays every year if it gets you into debt? Does one of you believe in \u201clive now pay later\u201d and the other need money in the bank to feel safe? These are things that can split a couple asunder.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t be shy and retiring. </strong>Lots of arguments, even among couples who have never rowed about money, can occur around retirement. This is in part because suddenly both people are at home all the time but also because of different approaches to retirement. One part of the couple may see it as a time to spend all the money they\u2019ve earned over the years, the other suddenly becomes averse to spending.</p> <p><strong>Structure your debt. </strong>If you get into debt, look at your assets and put a structure into place. <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Citizens Advice</a> can help but also go back to the source of the debt and ask if you can work something out. Don\u2019t panic, but face up to things. A financial advisor can be a great mediator and most people feel much better knowing where they\u2019re at.</p> <p><strong>Keep talking.</strong> If things get really sticky, a chat about money once a week can stop things getting explosive.</p> <p><em>Andy Bracken is a financial adviser at </em><a href=\"http://www.tjpltd.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Timothy James &amp; Partners</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/31/mothers-stop-moaning-about-motherhood\" title=\"\">I wrote a piece about not being a mum</a>. About the pain of not being a mum. At the time I was stunned by the reaction to it. Some saw it as an attack on mothers, whereas I saw it as a raw, bruised plea to appreciate what you\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve been surprised since, too. Not at any still-angry comments or my continued grief (I\u2019ve always known time has been mis-sold on the healing front) but that my no-baby agony could almost be equalled. But it has been \u2013 by the realisation of what not having children really means. Not having kids means I mean nothing in our society. And I really never saw that devastating PS coming.</p> <p>This is what I and other unhappy non-parents (a clumsy word but I can\u2019t go with \u201cchildfree\u201d. The forced \u201cyay!\u201d there is kidding no one) deal with. Every. Single. Day. The dismissive, demeaning language and sentiments thrown at the childless are relentless.</p> <p>A conversation I had at a funeral recently:</p> <p>A woman I\u2019d apparently met years ago (breezily): \u201cDid you ever marry?\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Her: \u201cDid you ever have kids?\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Her (less breezy now): \u201cOh well. Well done anyway. It\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>A conversation I had with an Oxbridge-educated comedian who you\u2019d hope would have a broader take on life.</p> <p>Him: \u201cHow are you? It\u2019s been years. How have you been? You got kids?\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Him (looking at the floor): \u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>And then he left. Come back, funny guy. The insignificance ain\u2019t catching.</p> <p>A moment with an old friend, talking about his niece who had struggled to conceive.</p> <p>Him: \u201cOh, we thought she would never have a baby. Thought she\u2019d end up with nothing. She\u2019d already bought two cats.\u201d</p> <p>Another moment with another friend \u2013 about her midwife.</p> <p>Her: \u201cShe was OK. She\u2019s one of those women, though.

And my response is inevitably met with the \u201cJesus, could you let this go?\u201d eye-roll.</p> <p>Well, no, I can\u2019t let this go. I feel rage about this. I hear this talk every day and it shouldn\u2019t go unchallenged. I don\u2019t want to be infuriated every day. I don\u2019t want to experience this feeling every day. I don\u2019t want to be reminded of my \u201csituation\u201d every day. But seeing as I am, every day, I\u2019m now going to say something. Every time. Isn\u2019t this bigotry?

To find the energy needed not only to soothe oneself and live with infinite grief but also to fight such extraordinary ignorance and cruelty. It\u2019s exhausting and crushing. I wrote a feature \u2013 years ago \u2013 about being scared I wouldn\u2019t have a baby (as a friend says, \u201cWell done on having a life so shit you made money out of it\u201d) and someone at the magazine added the words \u201cI feel like such a failure\u201d to my copy. I was livid. I hadn\u2019t written that; I didn\u2019t feel that. Except now, in my weakest moments, I do. But fuck that. You, copy-fiddler, wouldn\u2019t last a minute in my shoes. I\u2019m no failure. I\u2019m a fucking great survivor. All unhappily childless people are.</p> <p>But so many don\u2019t think that. So many like Leadsom don\u2019t think that.

So loud, it was as if she was giving birth to them all over again. Well&#xa0;if you care about your family so much, love, why not reserve your own seats?

No. But I did tweet Mumsnet to tell them one of their members needed a stick removing from her arse.)</p> <p>Oh, and I should also tell you about the mind-boggling introduction to an item on the Victoria Derbyshire show on BBC2.

It was a training run. It was good watching quality rugby league, it was high speed and soft hands and all-out alacrity. Fine alacrity. </p> <p>But it was big kids versus small.</p> <p>The players walked out having a laugh with little kids. Scotland players wore kilts off the bus. Australia bombed it in the first hit-outs and owned the fixture early. Then they got a bit loose, a bit ragged. And Scotland scored a try. And there was some rejoicing. But the 5,000-odd crowd wasn\u2019t really into it.</p> <p>It was a tool-about-on-Twitter type of match. In that funny old echo chamber, types were tweeting about tartan shorts, the referee\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d grey ones, and that Scotland\u2019s second-rower Dale Ferguson looks more like David Klemmer than David Klemmer. </p> <p>Klemmer has hair these days but looks far scarier bald, more like The Kurgan in <em>Highlander</em>.

For finding out that Australia played Russia once, in 2000, in this very city of Hull, and won 110-4. Wendell Sailor scored four tries. Ryan Girdler scored a hat-trick and kicked 17 goals for a personal haul of 43 points. Russia\u2019s points came from a try to their wing man, Matthew Donovan, which is not Donovanov because he\u2019s from Coffs Harbour. As Russian as Vegemite toast.</p> <p>Soon enough at Hull it was 30-nil. Australia were smokin\u2019, playing footy. Scotland scored from a kick and we went to half-time where Phil Gould told us Australia scored five tries in the first 23 minutes but Scotland won the next 17 minutes 6-4.

  "<p>Philip Larkin famously announced that sexual intercourse began in 1963 (\u201cBetween the end of the \u2018Chatterley\u2019 ban / And the Beatles\u2019 first LP\u201d). Being French, and a psychiatrist to boot, Philippe Brenot takes a rather longer view. In his latest book, The Story of Sex, a bestseller in France, he runs an anthropological eye over the sexual mores of human societies from prehistoric times to today. Yet Brenot believes that the sexual revolution did spark a dramatic change, creating the modern couple, which is the basis of our families today. Now, however, he thinks this partnership of equals is under assault from all sides.</p> <p>The academic, who has the wonderful title of director of sexology at Paris Descartes University, has spent his life studying sexuality. The Story of Sex is an irreverent, graphic novel (in both senses), filled with fascinating \u2013 if alarming \u2013 history. Cleopatra used a vibrator filled with bees; the word \u201ctrousers\u201d was considered to be positively pornographic in Victorian England. Illustrator Laetitia Coryn\u2019s extremely cheeky, but never sordid, pictures liven up the page and keep the narrative zipping along.

We have never been freer to define our own relationships, and follow our own pleasure, he says, but despite this we are far from satisfied; and the modern couple is looking dangerously fragile.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredible the difficulties couples have,\u201d Brenot declares, in a tone that makes me imagine he is throwing his hands in the air in despair. Of the couples he sees in therapy, he says, \u201cthere is nothing wrong with them psychologically, but still they cannot communicate quietly, live calmly and have sexual fulfilment\u201d.</p> <p>While we think of lovers as a timeless relationship model, it has been the family that has been paramount in society for most of history, the 68-year-old says. \u201cThe couple used to get together for the sake of the family,\u201d he explains. And the idea of equality in long-term pairings is even more recent, with \u201ctraditional\u201d marriages putting men firmly in charge of their spouses.</p> <p>\u201cLove marriages have only been widespread for a century or so, and homosexuality was condemned until very recently,\u201d Brenot notes.</p> <p>\u201cSince the 1970s, we have begun to invent modern couples with respect for each other and equality between the sexes,\u201d he says. \u201cThis only came about after \u2018marriage\u2019 as a concept began dying out. Not because people stopped getting married, but because marriage stopped being seen as a sacred union \u2013 couples instead started developing on their own terms.\u201d</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/jan/28/divorce-rates-marriage-ons\">the rise in divorces since the 1970s</a> and breakups of long-term relationships shows that the modern couple is not surviving, Brenot argues. In part, he says, this is because we are demanding more than ever before.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to live intimately, because we want perfect love and perfect sex and that is very difficult in a long-term relationship. We want a lot more than a reliable person to raise kids with.\u201d</p> <p>The solution, he says, is for us all to learn more about sex \u2013 which is where his book comes in. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to understand our intimate sex lives without looking at centuries of history, and even the origins of human life,\u201d he says. \u201cWe understand what we live today if we understand from where we came.\u201d</p> <p>For instance, he says, if we look at the way relationships were formed in early human societies we can see echoes of our own problems. \u201cWe came from primates, but in chimp society there are never couples or families. There are lone males and females with children.\u201d It was only as our brains evolved and emotions developed \u2013 including love \u2013 that monogamous relationships set in. For the first time (\u201csomewhere between 1 million BC and 100,000BC\u201d), it was possible to know the paternity of a child.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc1fdc814424a9a7f20bb39d7b781a67b28f32d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc1fdc814424a9a7f20bb39d7b781a67b28f32d7/157_166_2393_3204/747.jpg\" alt=\"Image from The Story of Sex: The Great Change 1960-1970.\" width=\"747\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Story of Sex \u2026 The Great Change 1960-1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Laetitia Coryn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the beginning of family life may sound like a wonderful moment, Brenot argues that it was also the start of women\u2019s subjugation, with men taking possession of their female partner and offspring \u2013 which traditional marriage legalised. \u201cPaternity is the beginning of male domination,\u201d says Brenot simply. \u201cThe day that happened, men took possession of women.\u201d</p> <p>In the animal kingdom, Brenot argues, there is none of the domination of female partners that has been a hallmark of human societies through history, nor is there domestic violence. Instead, among animals \u201cmales fight against other males and females fight with other females,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cViolence between men and women is only in humans \u2013 because of marriage, which puts men above women.\u201d</p> <p>During antiquity, meanwhile, a woman\u2019s role was to provide a child \u2013 and female sexual pleasure was dismissed. But this role was also a dangerous one. \u201cThere were so many impediments to female pleasure. In the 18th and 19th centuries, one in six pregnant women died in childbirth. Then there were the infections and sexual violence.\u201d</p> <p>For men, of course, things were different. \u201cMen have always done what they wanted,\u201d says Brenot.</p> <p>Even for men, sex for pleasure was something that happened \u201coutside the home \u2013 for instance with prostitutes. Women were seen either to provide offspring or pleasure.\u201d In ancient Rome, these rules were so strictly upheld that women could take their husbands to court for ejaculating anywhere but inside her body during intercourse, \u201cbecause sex within marriage was for procreation, and the wife\u2019s role was to receive sperm\u201d.</p> <p>Even during periods that today we think of as being golden ages for same-sex relationships, such pleasures were \u201creserved for the elite\u201d \u2013 and the reality was often less accepting than we think. In ancient Greece, for instance, it was only<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/04/gay-partner-has-fear-of-bottoming-relationship-incompatible\"> the man who was \u201creceiving\u201d</a> who was not stigmatised in a pairing. Similarly for the libertines in the 18th century, \u201cthere was a fluid sexuality, but it was also the top end of society \u2013 the intelligentsia and aristocracy. Throughout the centuries and the world\u2019s rural populations, to be gay \u2013 or for women to have control of their own sexuality \u2013 has always been frowned upon.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b713a67c7a4ace0df67f7f326257900cdd65eb61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b713a67c7a4ace0df67f7f326257900cdd65eb61/180_200_2361_3168/745.jpg\" alt=\"Image from The Story of Sex  Between War and Peace.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Story of Sex \u2026 Between War and Peace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Laetitia Coryn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today too, Brenot argues, while much has been written about more people exploring fluid sexualities, entering polyamorous relationships and breaking down gender norms, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that this is trickling down to all sections of society\u201d. And he warns too about a backlash from \u201cnew moralists\u201d who oppose gay marriage, and will, no doubt, do the same for trans rights and alternative relationships as they gain more legal rights. Coryn says this is one of the reasons she enjoyed creating the book. \u201cIn France, people who don\u2019t want gay people to be married, is a huge phenomenon. It\u2019s awful. We say in the book this is a misunderstanding of sexuality; homosexuality is normal. I hope this is one topic on which people will change their mind in reading the book.\u201d</p> <p>For heterosexual couples, relationships began to look up about the time of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Up until this period, \u201cmen were having fun outside the home \u2013 hunting animals or chasing women. While women were always at home,\u201d says Brenot. But the new spirit of education and the pursuit of knowledge changed this. Finally, says Brenot, men and women could be friends and even have platonic love.</p> <p>Yet it took contraception for men and women to gain a semblance of equality. Previously \u201cwomen were immobilised by marriage. They can\u2019t get out of it, they don\u2019t have the possibility of working or being free. The story of sex is, first of all, the story of marriage and the difficulties [it creates] for women.\u201d</p> <p>To start combating the problems that these historical inequalities have left us with, the psychiatrist insists, we need better sexual education, and one that starts at an early age. \u201cPeople think sexuality is just an instinct,\u201d he says, \u201cthat it is natural like eating and drinking. No. There is no gene that drives sexuality. All sexuality is learned.\u201d</p> <p>Because of this, says Brenot, the models for our sexuality are very important. Today, talking about sex is still taboo, and the dissemination of pornography has filled the void. \u201cPeople say pornography changes adolescent life. But it changes everyone\u2019s sexuality,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have sex differently now; we try to imitate what we see [on our screens]. People feel bad and say, \u2018I can\u2019t do what they do.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a26aec37727ffc14fad8bb924fe245c36b2a78b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a26aec37727ffc14fad8bb924fe245c36b2a78b/184_176_2349_3200/734.jpg\" alt=\"Image from The Story of Sex by Philippe Brenot and Laeticia Cory.\" width=\"734\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Story of Sex \u2026 the 21st century.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Laeticia Cory</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To displace this dangerous model, \u201csexual education should teach the rules that should govern relationships; it should teach us about communication, about consent and respect. This is not natural [to us]. We have to learn this.\u201d</p> <p>Coryn says that while the Story of Sex is not a sexual education manual, \u201cwe wanted it to be uninhibited\u201d, to make talking about sex seem as natural as it should be.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the time children are little girls and boys, we have to teach them that everyone should be respected and to start accepting difference,\u201d says Brenot. But, he says, while men and women are equal, that does not mean that they are the same. Railing against the teaching of \u201cgender studies\u201d departments, he says that a refusal to admit this difference is allowing gender inequality to become entrenched.</p> <p>\u201cThey say, \u2018Don\u2019t speak of differences \u2013 a man is the same as a woman. Society is guilty of making differences, but underneath we are the same.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Unpicking these ideas, he says, is the only way to combat our most pressing problems. For example, \u201cphysical strength is different from a very young age. So [children] need to understand boys are stronger and take that into account \u2013 because that is the start of domestic violence, which is a real problem.\u201d</p> <p>If we leave this teaching too late, he says, the battle is already lost: \u201cIn children\u2019s fairy stories it is the boy who seduces the girl, so there is power play early on.\u201d Then there is the fact men have always been free to have multiple partners throughout history, because men don\u2019t get pregnant. It is only by introducing the idea early on that \u201ccontraception is a joint responsibility\u201d that we can challenge this.</p> <p>Today\u2019s modern couple, he points out, faces new challenges from the rise in options for dating to \u201cnew forms of relationship,\u201d says Brenot. Yet Coryn stresses, as does Brenot, that there has never been a better time for people to live in terms of sexuality. Yet one thing has not changed, says Brenot \u2013 everyone still wants to find somebody to love. \u201cPeople are afraid to be alone at the end of their life. They are afraid not to find the perfect person to live with. It is a difficult problem for everyone today.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to learn how to live together anew.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Story of Sex: From Apes to Robots by Philippe Brenot and Laetitia Coryn is published by Particular Books, \u00a320.

It placed Comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument over whether the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing the campaign.</p> <p>In a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his letter to Congress, Comey said he felt \u201can obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, we don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record,\u201d Comey wrote to his employees.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/792167988929650688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Important new reporting from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SariHorwitz\">@SariHorwitz</a> suggests Comey sent letter because he felt pressure from inside:<a href=\"https://t.co/wWjRQGCQjH\">https://t.co/wWjRQGCQjH</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0tWUXnqapq\">pic.twitter.com/0tWUXnqapq</a></p>&mdash; Greg Sargent (@ThePlumLineGS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/792167988929650688\">October 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-29T15:16:16.575Z\">at 4.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5813f196e4b08d944ba4bcc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-29T00:54:11.504Z\">1.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Blum talks about John Boehner, the former speaker of the House.

Like [this] whole thing is fucking insane.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately for Clinton, in July the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi\">FBI</a> eventually decided to let this potentially illegal evasion of security protocol pass with a sharp wrap on the knuckles.</p> <p>There was an audible intake of breath among campaign followers in the summer, when Comey criticised her for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information, but his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">decision not to recommend criminal charges</a>brought to an end the one threat deemed capable of preventing her from becoming president.</p> <p>That was, at least, until Comey dropped a fresh bombshell. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juddzeez/status/792051041399439360\">three-paragraph letter</a> he released to Congress on Friday revealing the existence of potentially significant new evidence may or not have any legal bearing on whether charges are again possible. It certainly had a political impact.</p> <p>Clinton was in the air when the letter leaked. An onboard Wi-Fi outage meant she may not have discovered its existence at all until her plane landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a campaign stop just down the road from her very first event as a candidate on 14 April 2015.<br></p> <p>There was a long delay in her leaving the plane as aides urgently gathered onboard to discuss the issue. A planned photoshoot with Annie Leibowitz had to be cut short. Her opponent wasted no time pointing out that it is never a good look for a presidential candidate to be under criminal investigation by the FBI.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d was Donald Trump\u2019s predictable hyperbole at a rally minutes later in New Hampshire. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats rushed to downplay its significance on Friday, as campaign chairman John Podesta suggested Comey may have been \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d by aggressive Republicans into announcing a relatively minor wrinkle for the sake of transparency.</p> <p>The investigation had still not officially been closed, so it is also oversimplifying to say, as many initially did, that it has been \u201creopened\u201d. The fact that the evidence in question reportedly comes from separate investigation into a sex scandal engulfing Anthony Weiner, the estranged of husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s key aides, should make it less relevant to her security case, not more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-election-voters\">Hillary Clinton's email woes refuse to go away \u2013 what does this latest twist mean?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5813bd27e4b08d944ba4bbfc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T21:04:40.151Z\">10.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Lisbon, Maine, nearly an hour after he was scheduled to appear - there was an issue with the stairs on his plane - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told a room full of supporters that Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private email servers when she served as secretary of state is \u201cthe biggest political scandal since Watergate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI, after discovering new emails, is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump said, inaccurately. \u201cI have great respect for the FBI for righting this wrong.
