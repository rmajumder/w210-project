  "<p>The government should impose harsher punishment on professionals who decide not to report female genital mutilation in children, saying they are \u201ccomplicit in a crime being committed\u201d, according to a group of MPs.<br></p> <p>The failure of the UK to make a single prosecution against FGM despite changes in legislation that make it mandatory for professionals to report FGM is \u201cbeyond belief\u201d and is leading to \u201cthe preventable mutilation of thousands of girls\u201d, according to a damning report from the home affairs select committee.<br></p> <p>The committee says it is alarmed by reports that clinicians are ignoring the requirement to report child cases of FGM to the police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/20/female-genital-mutilation-reporting-cases-children-mandatory\">which was put in place last year</a>, and urges NHS employers and royal colleges to \u201ctake a hard line against such attitudes\u201d.</p> <p>It states: \u201cExisting disciplinary procedures for professionals who ignore the duty on mandatory reporting are insufficient and ineffective and it is unacceptable that some clinicians appear to refuse to accept it as their responsibility. The duty to report must not be seen as optional. A decision not to report puts children\u2019s lives at risk and is complicit in a crime being committed.\u201d</p> <p>The committee risks reigniting a row with health professionals, some of whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/20/female-genital-mutilation-reporting-cases-children-mandatory\">have argued</a> that mandatory reporting is counter-productive and compromises patient confidence. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://digital.nhs.uk/article/7180/First-ever-annual-statistical-publication-for-FGM-shows-5700-newly-recorded-cases-during-2015-16\">first annual statistics gathered on FGM</a> released in July revealed there had been 5,700 new cases of female genital mutilation recorded in England in 2015-16, and provided hard evidence that the practice was happening on UK soil, with 18 cases recorded as happening in the UK. There are an estimated <a href=\"http://www.city.ac.uk/news/2015/july/no-local-authority-area-in-england-and-wales-free-from-fgm/_nocache\"> 134,600 women with FGM born in countries where FGM is practised and living in England</a>.

The defendants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/04/doctor-not-guilty-fgm-dhanuson-dharmasena\">found not guilty</a>. Since 2010, only 29 cases of FGM offences have been referred to the CPS, with a number of cases still live. The report compared these result to other countries: in a similar period there have been 40 FGM-related trials in France, six in Spain; two in Italy and Sweden; and one each in the Netherlands and Denmark.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is beyond belief that there still has not been a successful prosecution for an FGM offence since it was made illegal over 30 years ago,\u201d stated the report. \u201cThat is a lamentable record and the failure to identify cases, to prosecute and to achieve convictions can only have negative consequences for those who are brave enough to come forward to highlight this crime.\u201d</p> <p>There was a \u201cstrong case\u201d for routine medical examinations of children deemed to be at particularly high risk of FGM, said the committee. The practice had resulted in \u201clarge number of successful prosecutions in relation to FGM in France\u201d but would require \u201ca radical change in practice in the UK\u201d and risked being \u201cunnecessarily traumatic\u201d.</p> <p>The report also criticised the quality of data being gathered on FGM, although some progress had been made.

She added: \u201cFerocious penalties against doctors who don\u2019t report FGM gets nobody anywhere.

Mary Wandia, End FGM programme manager, said: \u201cEvery girl at risk of FGM should be protected in every possible way \u2013 particularly by those with a duty of care. If there is a failure to prevent this \u2013 or any incidence of child abuse \u2013 then the person who failed should be held to account.\u201d<br></p> <p>Nimko Ali, an anti-FGM activist and survivor, said she was confident that data collection and mandatory reporting \u2013 as well as a raised awareness about FGM \u2013 would result in a prosecution and welcomed the call for professionals to face disciplinary procedures if they failed to report FGM. \u201cThat prosecution will take time, but what is more important is that these policies are preventing girls from being cut in the first place, she said.\u201d </p>",

He told Corbyn:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You talk about trying to unite the party. I find that quite hard to reconcile with something your campaign did just this evening, which was publish a list, a deselection list if you like, of the 13 MPs, including the deputy leader of our party, Tom Watson, who your campaign think have transgressed against you in criticising you. That isn\u2019t unifying. That is deeply divisive, and frankly, it\u2019s where you began the contest by talking about deselection in your opening speech. If that\u2019s what you are intending to do when if win this election, to deselect all our MPs, then we will be in even greater trouble than we are in right now ... It does feel like setting Momentum onto them to try and get them deselected.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn said that was not what the list was about. But Smith said that was how it would be seen by MPs. Corbyn also defended the list, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was information put out there which is statements that colleagues made on the record and it\u2019s all stuff that is out there on the public record.</p> </blockquote> <p>His comment contrasted with <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/09/jeremy-corbyn-ally-condemns-list-abusive-labour-mps\">briefing from his team earlier in the evening</a> saying the list of names should not have been released.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Smith has accused Corbyn of not knowing how many seats Labour needs to gain to form a government. </strong>Corbyn replied \u201cat least 90\u201d, but Smith said that the number was 106 and that Corbyn should know this. Corbyn said the actual figure depended on boundary changes. Labour has 230 seats in the House of Commons and the Conservatives 329, a working majority of 16. Smith was quoting a figure from this Fabian Society research.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/thefabians/status/620943111687172100\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fabian analysis shows we need to win 106 seats to gain a majority in 2020 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrew_harrop\">@andrew_harrop</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/fabtea?src=hash\">#fabtea</a> - See the report <a href=\"http://t.co/5m5lJQw90r\">http://t.co/5m5lJQw90r</a></p>&mdash; The Fabian Society (@thefabians) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thefabians/status/620943111687172100\">July 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Smith accused Corbyn of not being straight about what he said about triggering article 50 on the morning after the EU referendum.</strong> Asked why he had said it had to be triggered now, Corbyn said that article 50 did have to be invoked. He was not necessarily saying at that moment, he implied. But Smith told him:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy says he wants straight talking, honest politics. Jeremy, I watched that interview. You did say \u2018Let\u2019s trigger article 50 now\u2019 and I think the country saw you say it.

And, on that basis, tonight\u2019s hustings will confirm the impression that Jeremy Corbyn is the clear favourite. Owen Smith attacked him repeatedly. By contrast, Corbyn mostly responded with serene indifference. At Westminster he is widely expected to win quite comfortably and, judging by his demeanour, and the reaction of the studio audience (supposedly 50/50, but in the event much more vocal in support of Corbyn), that forecast seems reasonable.</p> <p>On a clapometer test Corbyn would have won quite easily, and some of his answers denouncing the government were effective. But when he and Smith argued with each other on specific points, rather rather than just respond to audience questions, Smith tended to get the better of the exchanges. His \u201chow many seats does Labour need to gain to win the election\u201d challenge was a bit too contrived, and Corbyn had a reasonable response, but it did make Corbyn look uncomfortable. Smith was more successful when he accused Corbyn (rightly) of being disingenuous about what he said about article 50 on 24 June, when he criticised Corbyn for trying to laugh off the claim that he condoned booing (as Corbyn had been doing) and when he challenged Corbyn over his response to the treatment of Ruth Smeeth at the Chakrabarti report launch. Smith also \u201cwon\u201d the exchange over the naming of 13 anti-Corbyn MPs by the Corbyn team tonight, and what he said about how this fuelled fears that MPs will be deselected may be the best news line of the night.</p> <p>If this were a boxing match, with points awards for successful blows on target, Smith would have won. But the audience did not seem to view it like that, and Smith\u2019s performance is unlikely to change the minds of many in an electorate that has probably mostly voted already anyway.</p> <p>One other point should concern team Corbyn just a little. There was an interesting moment when Faisal Islam asked a woman in the audience to explain why she was booing. She launched into an epic rant about Tony Blair, only for Islam to point out that the Blair government passed the anti grammar school expansion law everyone had just been supporting. Undeterred, she reverted back to diatribe mode. Corbyn believes he can appeal to the mainstream, but his critics claim he appeals mostly to far-left obsessives and, rightly or wrongly, this vignette will make them think they\u2019re right.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T21:49:35.686Z\">at 10.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d9b8b2e4b067ad30087c47\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T20:57:34.840Z\">9.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn and Smith are making closing statements now.</p> <p>Smith says the Tories have been in power for six years.

NP purchased a We-Vibe Rave vibrator in May of this year for $130 and used We-Connect, the app, several times, her suit said. </p> <p>The app also contains chat and video features, and allows a smartphone user to remote-control the vibrator, lending itself to long-distance users. \u201cTurn on your lover when you connect and play together from anywhere in the world,\u201d read one We-Vibe suggestion. The extra functionality gives Standard Innovation the ability to charge a higher price, the lawsuit claims.</p> <p>A spokesman for Standard Innovation, Denny Alexander, declined to comment, saying the company had yet to be served with a lawsuit. \u201cThere has been no claim that our customers\u2019 data has been compromised,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the course of the last few weeks, we have taken steps to further enhance the data security and privacy measures for our product offering \u2026 We are updating the We-Connect app later this month, and the update will include new in-app communication regarding our privacy and data practices and a new feature for consumers to control how their data may be used.\u201d</p> <p>We-Vibe\u2019s data collection came under scrutiny several weeks ago at Def Con, an annual hacking conference. Two hackers revealed that Standard Innovation collects data on the temperature and vibration settings in real time, as users operate the device. They also identified a security flaw that could, in theory, allow a hacker to take over the device. (The company has since patched the security flaw.)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/vulnerable-vibrator-security-researchers-find-flaws-in-connected-toy/\">In response</a> to the revelations at Def Con, Standard Innovation said it had updated its terms and conditions to reflect, in \u201cplain language\u201d, the kind of data it collects. Alexander told the publication CNET that most users do not register their devices, meaning any data the company\u2019s servers collect from those devices is anonymous. Standard Innovation anonymized the rest of the information it had collected after the Def Con presentation, he added.</p> <p>\u201cWe do collect certain limited data to help us improve our products and for diagnostic purposes,\u201d the company said in a <a href=\"http://we-vibe.com/blog/our-commitment-to-customer-privacy-and-security/\">statement</a>. \u201cAs a matter of practice, we use this data in an aggregate, non-identifiable form.\u201d</p> <p>The company also defended its practice of collecting information on the temperature of peoples\u2019 vibrators and on users\u2019 preferred intensity setting. Having data on temperature, the spokesman told CNET, allowed the company to ensure that key components of the device were functioning properly. As for intensity setting, \u201cIt is to understand how people use the products.\u201d If users always prefer the highest setting, \u201cthen perhaps we don\u2019t have a powerful enough device\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOf all the privacy violations our firm has prosecuted, this is among the most personal and invasive we have ever encountered,\u201d said Eve-Lynn Rapp, an attorney with the law firm Edelson PC, which is representing NP. \u201cWhile this particular example shocks the conscience more than most, it should also put consumers on notice that the \u2018internet of things\u2019, while providing convenience and assistance in their daily lives, is also ripe for unauthorized data collection.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>First of all, I would like to welcome everyone in this house and thank you for your attendance. It is very much appreciated. When I cast my mind back to the last day on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1998, just prior to the election, I called out across the chamber, \u201cI will be back!\u201d Those around me cried out, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t!\u2019\u201d </p> <p>My electorate boundaries were changed, forcing me to stand for the new seat of Blair. Also, with the introduction of full preferential voting, this cost me the seat. Although I polled 36% of the primary vote, this was not enough against the Liberals\u2019 21% and Labor\u2019s preferences, delivering them the seat.</p> <p>It has taken numerous elections, countless legal battles and doing a stint in maximum security on trumped-up charges \u2013 of which former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop stated I was Australia\u2019s first political prisoner \u2013 to find myself here. Some call it persistence and tenacity. My daughter describes it as a Johnny Farnham comeback. I call it standing up and fighting for what you believe in and not allowing the bastards to grind you down. So, to all my peers in this place and those from the past, I have two words for you: I\u2019m back \u2013 but not alone.</p> <p>I cannot begin to express the pride and honour I have in being joined in this place by three of my colleagues \u2013 Senator Malcolm Roberts, also representing Queensland; New South Wales senator Brian Burston; and Western Australian senator Rod Culleton \u2013 elected under Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation. As a strong, united team I guarantee we will make a difference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/comprehending-pauline-is-not-the-challenge-engaging-constructively-with-hansonism-is\">Comprehending Pauline is not the challenge. Engaging constructively with Hansonism is | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been 20 years and four days since I last delivered my first speech in this house, a speech that shook a nation, woke up many Australians and gave hope to those who thought no one was listening. That speech was relevant then and it is still relevant today. The problem is we have not had leaders with the foresight or the intestinal fortitude to cast aside political correctness. They have failed to discard old treaties and agreements that are not in our best interest and have signed new ones giving away our sovereignty, rights, jobs and democracy. Their push for globalisation, economic rationalism, free trade and ethnic diversity has seen our country\u2019s decline. This is due to foreign takeover of our land and assets, out-of-control debt, failing infrastructure, high unemployment or underemployment and the destruction of our farming sector. Indiscriminate immigration and aggressive multiculturalism have caused crime to escalate and trust and social cohesion to decline. Too many Australians are afraid to walk alone at night in their neighbourhoods. Too many of us live in fear of terrorism.</p> <p>In my first speech in 1996 I said we were in danger of being swamped by Asians. This was not said out of disrespect for Asians but was meant as a slap in the face to both the Liberal and Labor governments who opened the floodgates to immigration, targeting cultures purely for the vote, as expressed by former Labor minister Barry Jones \u2013 to such an extent that society changed too rapidly due to migrants coming in the front door but also the back door, via New Zealand. Now we are in danger of being swamped by Muslims, who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own.</p> <p>I love my country, culture and way of life. My pride and patriotism were instilled in me from an early age when I watched the Australian flag raised every morning at school and sang the national anthem; watching our athletes compete on the world stage, proud to salute the Australian flag being raised to honour them as they took their place on podiums. It is about belonging, respect and commitment to fight for Australia. This will never be traded or given up for the mantras of diversity or tolerance. Australia had a national identity before federation, and it had nothing to do with diversity and everything to do with belonging. Tolerance has to be shown by those who come to this country for a new way of life. If you are not prepared to become Australian and give this country your undivided loyalty, obey our laws, respect our culture and way of life, then I suggest you go back where you came from. If it would be any help, I will take you to the airport and wave you goodbye with sincere best wishes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/pauline-hanson-is-back-and-its-still-just-as-hard-to-counter-her-rhetoric-with-facts\">Pauline Hanson is back, and it's still just as hard to counter her rhetoric with facts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia is predominantly a Christian country, but our government is secular. Our Constitution prevents governments from imposing religious rule and teachings. The separation of church and state has become an essential component of our way of life, and anything that threatens that separation threatens our freedom. Australia has embraced migrants from all different races, making us one of the most multiracial nations on earth. Most have assimilated and are proud to call themselves Australians, accepting our culture, beliefs and laws. I welcome them from the bottom of my heart. As they integrate and assimilate, the disruption caused by diversity diminishes.</p> <p>Why then has Islam and its teachings had such an impact on Australia like no other religion? Islam sees itself as a theocracy. Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly. It does not separate religion and politics. It is partly a religion, but it is much more than that. It has a political agenda that goes far outside the realm of religion. It regulates Muslims\u2019 social and domestic life, their legal system and politics \u2013 their total life.</p> <p>Australia is now seeing changes in suburbs predominantly Muslim. Tolerance towards other Australians is no longer the case. Our law courts are disrespected and prisons have become breeding grounds for Muslims to radicalise inmates. Muslims are imprisoned at almost three times the average rate. The rate of unemployed and public dependency is two to three times greater than the national average. Muslims are prominent in organised crime, with associated violence and drug dealing. Antisocial behaviour is rampant, fuelled by hyper-masculine and misogynist culture. Multiple social surveys find that neighbourhoods of Muslim settlement are suffering from collapsing social cohesion and fear of crime. Australians, in general, are more fearful.</p> <p>Not only is terrorism seen around the world but it is now part of our society, with Muslim refugees involved in the Lindt cafe siege, the Curtis Cheng murder in Sydney and the stabbing of the two police officers in Melbourne. The grand mufti and other Muslim leaders are deafening with their silence, or lack of sympathy. Radicalisation is happening on our streets, in our suburbs and mosques. Yet, our leaders continue to tell us to be tolerant and embrace the good Muslims. But how should we tell the difference? There is no sign saying \u201cgood Muslim\u201d or \u201cbad Muslim\u201d. How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good and who is bad?</p> <p>Many more Australian Muslims have volunteered, or have tried to volunteer, to fight for Isis than we have in our own defence force. Asio has over 509 terrorist suspects under surveillance. Civil tension is on the rise across the country, led by Australians feeling the impact of Islam in their lives and a distaste for its beliefs. Their tolerance to our customs has seen Christmas carols no longer sung at some schools and Bibles not to be found in most hospitals. Some public swimming baths have times set aside for Muslim women only, and drivers licences are obtained by Muslim women wearing the burqa and niqab. Prayer rooms are now provided in universities, hospitals, schools, airports and shopping centres to accommodate Muslims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/forget-one-nation-cory-bernardi-is-the-politician-to-watch\">Cory Bernardi is more dangerous than One Nation \u2013 his party is in power | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Halal certification tax has been forced upon us, costing Australians approximately $10m a year. Halal certification is not a religious requirement but a moneymaking racket, and certification is unnecessary for Muslims\u2019 welfare because non-halal products can be consumed, provided the word \u201cBismillah\u201d is said over the food and a prayer is recited. Muslims want to see sharia law introduced in Australia. This law is a totalitarian civil code which prescribes harsh feudal rules imposed on everything, firstly for Muslims, later for everyone. As long as Islam is considered a religion, sharia conflicts with our secular state.</p> <p>Islam cannot have a significant presence in Australia if we are to live in an open, secular and cohesive society. Never before in Australia\u2019s history have we seen civil unrest and terror associated with a so-called religion, or from followers of that faith. We have seen the destruction that it is causing around the world. If we do not make changes now, there will be no hope in the future. Have no doubt that we will be living under sharia law and treated as second-class citizens with second-class rights if we keep heading down the path with the attitude, \u2018She\u2019ll be right, mate.\u2019</p> <p>Therefore, I call for stopping further Muslim immigration and banning the burqa, as they have done in many countries around the world. Burqas are not a religious requirement. Most Australians find them confronting, as did two of our former prime ministers. I am sure a lot of the women forced to wear them would love to cast them aside but live in fear to do so. In addition, no more mosques or schools should be built, and those that already exist should be monitored with regard to what they are teaching until the present crisis is over. Sharia law should not be acknowledged or allowed. And Australian companies should be banned from paying for halal certification.</p> <p>Australians have never been permitted to vote on immigration and multiculturalism. When have we been asked or consulted about our population? We reached a population of 24 million this year, 17 years ahead of prediction. Governments have continually brought in high levels of immigration, so they say, to stimulate the economy. This is rubbish. The economy is stimulated by funding infrastructure projects, creating employment. What major projects have we had in this country for the past 30 years? How many dams have we built in the past 50 years? </p> <p>The only stimulation that is happening is welfare handouts \u2013 many going to migrants unable to get jobs. At present, our immigration intake is 190,000 a year. High immigration is only beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business, seeking a larger market while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake. They are waiting longer for their lifesaving operation. The unemployment queues grow longer \u2013 and even longer when government jobs are given priority to migrants.</p> <p>Our city roads have become parking lots. Schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick are left behind to fend for themselves. And many cities and towns struggle to provide water for an ever-growing population. Our service providers struggle to cope, due to a lack of government funding, leaving it to charities to pick up the pieces. Governments, both state and federal, have a duty of care to the Australian people. Clean up your own backyard before flooding our country with more people who are going to be a drain on our society. I call for a halt to further immigration and for government to first look after our aged, the sick and the helpless.</p> <p>Foreign investment and foreign ownership are great concerns. The government finally released its register of foreign ownership, which reveals that foreign interests owned 13.6% of Australia\u2019s farmland. That is 52m hectares. It includes 30% of the Northern Territory\u2019s farmland and 22% of Tasmania\u2019s. The register fails to show the quality of the foreign-owned land. Is it the jewels in the nation\u2019s agricultural crown? Let\u2019s have a register on all land owned by foreigners, including non-agricultural land and housing. </p> <p>And why is there no information on who owns our country\u2019s vital irrigation and water assets, despite this being promised? The registry is a disgrace. It makes me wonder whose interests this government is serving. Australia needs a national government, not a corporate one, not a union one, and not an alternative lifestyle one. Any foreign ownership is regrettable, but why are we allowing the Chinese government, an oppressive communist regime, to own our land and assets? Why are we allowing our ports, utilities, services, agricultural land and industries, to be acquired by foreigners of any nationality?</p> <p>It is foolhardy to sell our water, agricultural land \u2013 our food source \u2013 essential services and ports. This is not in Australia\u2019s national or security interests. This foreign takeover is destroying small towns across the nation. A farm once the home of an Australian family is now run by a manager. People move, less money is spent, schools lose students and then the town starts to die. Now these foreign-owned properties become food bowls for their own countries. Tax is avoided, or very little paid, because they go straight from paddock to plate. Transfer pricing, which involves minimising taxation by artificially charging high prices or operating costs to subsidiaries in Australia, and other forms of tax minimisation, are a certainty.</p> <p>Housing is beyond the dreams of ordinary Australians. Why? Because they cannot afford to buy, due to foreign investors driving up prices. Officially, foreigners can only buy new housing, but this is not policed. If the Liberal party wants a pat on the back for having reduced the purchase price to $15m before it has to go to the foreign investment review board, they will not get it from me. I intend to give them a kick up the backside. Australians have given their lives protecting this great land from foreign takeover. I can guarantee most did not want to go to war but knew it was their duty to ensure their loved ones lived in peace. But, more importantly, they fought for freedom.</p> <p>I want Australian land, houses and companies to remain locally owned, and I believe I speak for the majority of Australians. Our land and assets are not for sale. Governments are only caretakers of our assets. No contract has been signed giving them permission to sell them. If they cannot rein in the budget with overpaid public servants \u2013 one being the head of Australia Post, who is on $4.8m per year \u2013 foreign aid, welfare fraud, politicians lurks and perks, including former prime ministers, and backroom deals for government jobs, then get out of the job of running this country. I warn this government and future governments: you never miss the water till the well runs dry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/its-good-to-catch-up-pauline-hanson-and-tony-abbott-bury-the-hatchet\">'It's good to catch up': Pauline Hanson and Tony Abbott bury the hatchet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia\u2019s federal gross debt is currently $499bn. Our interest payments are over $43.5m a day. Out-of-control government spending, mismanagement of taxpayers\u2019 dollars, multinationals not paying their fair share of tax and welfare that was introduced to provide for the aged and sick, or as a helping hand for those going through tough times, has now become a way of life for some and is abused and rorted by others. Welfare costs the Australian taxpayer approximately $158bn a year and this is expected to rise to $191bn by 2019-20. Nearly one half of our budget is spent on welfare. This is out of control and must be reined in.</p> <p>Farmers are screaming out for workers and small businesses have difficulty in finding people who want to work. Welfare is not a right, unless you are aged or sick. It is a privilege paid for by hard-working Australians. I support the government in wanting to stop school leavers going immediately on to welfare. What message are we sending them? Teach them how to apply for a job, rather than encouraging them to become dependent on money they have neither earned nor worked for. Then we have the single mums having more children just to maintain their welfare payments, and Muslim men marrying multiple wives, under their laws, then having multiple children at our expense while they collect thousands of dollars a week from the taxpayer. How many have ever held a job? Why would anyone want to work when welfare is so very lucrative? If people bring children into the world, it is their responsibility not the taxpayers\u2019. Therefore, I propose that if a woman has a child, the taxpayer will support the first child, but, if they have more, there will be no increase to the welfare payment. Get a job and start taking responsibility for your own actions.</p> <p>Not only are we facing a crisis with welfare but also with our health budget. It also is being scammed, abused and rorted and is costing taxpayers billions. The healthcare card has no identification on it, just a name and number. Anyone can, and does, take another person\u2019s card when visiting a doctor, especially those who bulk bill. Prescriptions are collected at a cost to the taxpayer, if the cardholder is on welfare. Overseas tourists, illegals and those not entitled to Medicare use their family\u2019s card or a friend\u2019s card. Let me give an example. When one tourist visiting family fell sick, he went to the doctor and used his cousin\u2019s Medicare card. He ended up in hospital and died. The owner of the card had to admit it was not he. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d you ask. Well, he just had to pay the hospital bill.<br></p> <p>We have to stop the rorts, mismanagement and abuse of our taxpayer-funded services, whether it be welfare, health or education. If you want to access these services then apply for an Australian identity card. You must prove you are entitled to apply for the card on a points system. There should not be any complaints because applying for a $30 phone plan is the same. So I will not accept do gooders complaining about people\u2019s privacy. The card will have an identification chip, a photo and electronic fingerprint. If we are ever going to pull back our deficit we must stop the thieves. If you are not prepared to apply for the card, that is your choice, but expect to pay full price for doctors and prescriptions, and no more welfare handouts will be coming your way.</p> <p>Family law would be the most discriminatory, biased and unworkable policy in this country. I referred to it in my maiden speech 20 years ago and still nothing has changed \u2013 if anything, it is worse. As a nation, we should hang our heads in shame when, on average, three men, and occasionally a woman, suicide a day due to family breakdowns. The whole system is unworkable and is in desperate need of change. Children are used as pawns in custody battles where women make frivolous claims and believe they have the sole right to the children. Children have two parents and, until we treat mums and dads with the same courtesy and rights, we will continue to see murders due to sheer frustration and depression and mental illness caused by this unworkable system. Suicide is the only way out for those who feel there is no hope after facing years of costly legal battles. Their lives having been destroyed and the pain of missing their children are the reasons many end up in a state of depression caused by the trauma and in some cases the blatant vindictiveness from former partners.</p> <p>Child support is another contentious issue and should be revised. Some parents are left caring and providing for children without any financial help from the other parent. Others refuse to work so they do not have to pay child support. The system needs to be balanced, taking in the age of the child on a sliding scale and both parents\u2019 incomes should be taken into account. Non-custodial parents find it hard to restart their lives, with excessive child support payments that see their former partners live a very comfortable life. Make it fair with both custody and child support and most parents will gladly take on their responsibility.</p> <p>I ask all parents: is it worth the pain and anguish to deny your child the love they so deserve from both parents? They are only children for such a short time and all children need both parents. Please put your differences aside, make your peace and come to agreements outside of law courts. The only ones to gain are the legal professions, who are rubbing their hands together watching the thousands of dollars coming their way. Is it worth losing the family home? Is it worth the grief it brings not only to you but also to your extended families, not to mention the children? At the end of the day, the answer is no. I speak from experience not only as a mum myself but also as a grandmother.</p> <p>I am not going to do a Derryn Hinch and speak for 45 minutes \u2013 oh, he\u2019s still awake! I have a lot more to say but I have six years in this place \u2013 Derryn, sorry, you only have three \u2013 so there will be plenty of time. Oh, I can feel the Greens cringing \u2013 no, they have left \u2013 and squirming in their seats at the thought that I could possibly be here for six years.</p> <p>In closing, I will finish on this note: very few of us ever travel a journey alone and nor should we. Our loved ones and friends we have accumulated along the way are an integral part of who we are. Three of my children are here today. They have been with me every step of the way sharing my triumphs and battles, my high points and the lowest in my life. I did not know my life was going to be such a rollercoaster of a ride. I love you with all my heart. But I hate to tell you guys: it\u2019s not over yet; buckle up.</p> <p>There are those who kept the political party I launched in 1997 alive for 13 years after I left in 2002 till I came back in November 2014. Special thanks to Ian Nelsen for never giving up and for asking me to come back and lead the party. James Ashby is a man I have the utmost respect and admiration for. Like myself, the establishment has also kicked him about unfairly. Your dedication and hard work beside me added up to the clincher that not only saw me win my seat but also saw the other senators win their seats. With deep appreciation and sincerity, thank you.</p> <p>Thanks to Sarah Beric. You took on a task unbeknown to you, from performing as a professional violinist to running a political office and campaigns. You have been invaluable. A couple of strangers came along at the right time, helped me spread my wings and gave me the support and assistance I needed that now see me standing on this floor today. These people are no longer strangers but dear friends, welcome at home any time for another lamb roast. Thank you, Bill and Renatta.</p> <p>As I said earlier, I was imprisoned in 2003 for three years, held in maximum security on electoral fraud charges. My sentence was quashed on appeal after 11 weeks. If it were not for my sister Judy and brother Peter fighting for my freedom and justice \u2013and Alan Jones, along with approximately 90% of Australians who believed I was wrongly imprisoned \u2013 I would have been behind bars for three years. My father always said, \u201cPolitics is a dirty game.\u201d </p> <p>I was one of seven children and the quiet one of the family \u2013 believe it or not! Believe me: you are lucky to have me here and not the rest of the Seccombe clan. We come from a breed of Australians who were taught values, morals, honesty, work ethic and common sense \u2013 things very much lacking today.</p> <p>I will never take my position as a senator in this place for granted and nor should I. To the people of Queensland and Australia who voted for me and my party: thank you. You have given me a great honour. Now it is up to me to prove my worth to you. I can guarantee Pauline Hanson is a name that carries with it independence, honesty, assurance, quality and reliability \u2013 things the Chinese can never buy. Also, halal snack packs are never provided \u2013 isn\u2019t that right, Sam?</p> <p>Mr President and my fellow senators: thank you for your indulgence. We may not agree on everything but we need to work together for the future of our country and its people. I look forward to working with each and every one of you, including the Greens, if you are prepared to see this country prosper rather than shut down.</p>",

Most other states and federal law don\u2019t cover overtime pay.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about raising the wage and hour protections floor, it\u2019s an uphill battle, but we just won in the biggest farm worker state in the country, and that bodes well for workers across the nation,\u201d said Wilson.</p> <p>California\u2019s more than 800,000 farm workers are currently entitled to overtime pay after working 10 hours in a day, or 60 hours a week. The new rules will be phased in over a four-year period starting in 2019. They will be in full effect for the majority of businesses by 2022, and by 2025 for companies with 25 or fewer employees.</p> <p>A similar proposal in June fell short of the three votes it needed to pass.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a truly historic change for farm workers in California,\u201d Arturo Rodriguez, president of the <a href=\"http://www.ufw.org/\">United Farms Workers</a>, the union that sponsored the bill, told the Guardian. \u201cThis will give future generations the opportunity to be treated like other workers in the US.\u201d</p> <p>California is the largest producer of agricultural goods in the country, providing over one-third of the country\u2019s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts, <a href=\"https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/statistics/\">according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture</a>.

He signed <a href=\"https://www.alrb.ca.gov/\">a landmark bill allowing farm workers to unionize</a> in 1975, during his first term as governor.</p> <p>\u201cBetter protections for farm workers has been a struggle for close to 80 years, given this racist legacy of excluding certain categories of workers,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cFarm workers have had to fight for policy change state-by-state, and California has been a leader.\u201d</p> <p>Opponents say the new law will increase costs for farmers, and force them to limit work hours and hire more employees. The seasonal nature of agriculture means long hours are necessary during sowing and harvesting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/obama-overtime-pay-new-rule\">Millions could get a raise under Obama administration's new overtime rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raising cattle \u201cdoesn\u2019t always fall within a 40-hour work week or eight-hour work day,\u201d said Justin Oldfield, vice president of government relations at the <a href=\"http://www.calcattlemen.org/\">California Cattlemen\u2019s Association</a>. \u201cThe simple one-size-fits-all approach offered [by the law] will hurt California ranchers as we compete with producers in other states.\u201d</p> <p>The new law will likely raise the cost of production on farms, said <a href=\"http://www.aae.wisc.edu/pdmitchell/\">Paul Mitchell, associate professor of agricultural and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have to harvest quickly, you work more than the standard work week,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that\u2019s all of a sudden going to get more expensive.\u201d</p> <p>Dairy in particular will suffer, since those farms typically operate seven days a week, and cows need to be milked multiple times a day. Small farms will also be hit hard, said Mitchell, since labor already ranks as their highest cost, and they don\u2019t have many employees to begin with.</p> <p>But as consumer awareness grows around sustainability issues, and companies compete in a tough market, agriculture across the country will have to keep pace.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be truly sustainable, we have to treat labor better,\u201d said Mitchell.</p>",

Here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s preview:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mauricio Pochettino inhabits a world in which the finest of margins can make the difference. And so, in the countdown to Tottenham\u2019s big night, he has trained on two pitches that replicate the 105m x 69m dimensions of the national stadium. They have alternated between them, Pochettino said, in order to look after the grass.</p> <p>\u201cWembley is a little bit bigger and this can help the teams that play along the grass and keep possession,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cTeams that build from the back, like us, have more space, more possibility to play and it\u2019s more difficult for the opponent to press you. We believe in the way we play and this is a good chance to play on a big pitch. We need to adapt our game.\u201d</p> <p>Pochettino said his squad\u2019s routine would not change; they will arrive at the stadium three-and-a-half hours before the kick-off and there will be a \u201cvery nice room\u201d for the team meeting. The traffic problems around the ground may not be as severe as those at White Hart Lane, he added with a smile.</p> <p>The excitement is mounting. \u201cWe trained today with the Champions League balls and the bibs with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> on, and it\u2019s difficult to describe the feeling,\u201d Pochettino said.</p> <p>The club is making every effort to smooth the transition; to create a home from home while White Hart Lane is deemed to fall foul of Uefa\u2019s regulations because of building work.</p> <p>The supporters have been urged to dress in all-white, while the Wembley arch will be lit in lily white and Tottenham Ladies players will hand out flags to youngsters in the upper tier. Happily for lovers of overblown pre-match montages, the montage from White Hart Lane will play on the giant screens. On a practical note, fans have been advised to get there early.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/13/pochettino-looks-forward-tottenham-calling-wembley-home-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52pmp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2715415\"            data-video-name=\"Pochettino looks forward to Tottenham calling Wembley home \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d830dde4b067ad30087559\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/13/160913spurs_KP-29260081_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/13/160913spurs_KP-29260081.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/13/160913spurs_KP-29260081_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/13/pochettino-looks-forward-tottenham-calling-wembley-home-video\">Pochettino looks forward to Tottenham calling Wembley home</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T17:30:43.332Z\">at 6.30pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>As first experiences of the Champions League go, Leicester City are probably entitled to wonder whether it is always this straightforward. It is not, as they will no doubt discover later in the competition, but this was a hugely satisfying way to start their European excursions and a reassuring way to discover there is no reason to be apprehensive about taking their place at the top table.</p> <p>Not every team will be as generous as Club Brugge but it was still striking to see Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side rediscovering the form that won the Premier League last season. Tough at the back, penetrative in attack \u2013 this was more in keeping with the story of the English champions, as opposed to the slightly dishevelled performances that have marked the start of their title defence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/claudio-ranieri-champions-league-riyad-mahrez-leicester\">Claudio Ranieri says Champions League music brought best out of Riyad Mahrez</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It finished with Leicester\u2019s first win in Europe since 1961 when Matt Gillies\u2019s team beat Glenavon in the preliminary round of the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup and, for the current side, it leaves them in a position of strength as they try to add to the statistic that says that, since 2002, only nine out of the 46 teams playing in the Champions League for the first time have qualified for the knockout rounds.</p> <p>They can certainly be encouraged when Jamie Vardy is worrying defences in this manner. Riyad Mahrez had started the season slowly but his two goals, the first a splendid free-kick, should soothe his confidence. \u201cI said to the players that when you hear the Champions League music it charges the battery and makes you fight,\u201d Ranieri said. The entire team looked energised, taking control once Marc Albrighton gave them an early lead and never looking like they might hand it back.</p> <p>Leicester certainly set off like a team in a hurry. Only five minutes had elapsed when Albrighton applied the decisive touch after the Club Brugge goalkeeper, Ludovic Butelle, made a hash of trying to claim the ball in mid-air. Luis Hern\u00e1ndez had hurled in a long throw from the right and Albrighton was loitering at the far post when Hans Vanaken inadvertently flicked the ball into the path of the Leicester player.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/tottenham-hotspur-monaco-champions-league-group-e-match-report\">Tottenham left to lament Wembley woes after Lemar strikes for Monaco</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd9545a0c9a0df12a93a3820211c88bf35ec7954\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd9545a0c9a0df12a93a3820211c88bf35ec7954/0_59_3216_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Vardy is brought down by Ludovic Butelle, leading to a second-half penalty for the visitors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Vardy is brought down by Ludovic Butelle, leading to a second-half penalty for the visitors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the kind of goal that demonstrated why the Belgian team had lost three of their opening six fixtures in the Jupiler Pro League and a reminder Leicester had been placed in just about as obliging a group as they could have wished. The evening might have taken a different complexion if Jos\u00e9 Izquierdo had shown more composure when he ran clear inside the opening three minutes. Yet his shot was careless trundling wide, and the same could be said for the rest of the home side\u2019s performance.</p> <p>Leicester looked as if they were enjoying themselves, unfazed by a stadium that had large pockets of empty seats and quickly working out that their opponents were not going to subject them to the same kind of pressure, or even close, that Ranieri\u2019s men experienced in their previous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/liverpool-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">match at Liverpool</a>. Mahrez\u2019s free-kick was curled elegantly into the top corner and could be an important goal if it is the catalyst for last season\u2019s Professional Footballers\u2019 Association player of the year to return to the point of maximum expression. \u201cMaybe the music woke him up,\u201d Ranieri suggested.</p> <p>Vardy later described being two ahead before half an hour had been played as \u201cthe perfect start\u201d and by half-time Danny Drinkwater had come close to adding a third with an audacious left-foot volley that was dipping beneath the crossbar until Butelle tipped it over for a corner. The fact that Drinkwater was willing to take on a shot from almost 40 yards seemed to epitomise the team\u2019s self-belief.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/manchester-city-borussia-monchengladbach-champions-league-group-c-match-report\">Ag\u00fcero hat-trick inspires Manchester City against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were only fleeting moments when Islam Slimani, starting for the first time, showed why Leicester had broken their transfer record to recruit the \u00a329m forward from Sporting Lisbon but the team played with structure and control, and that is always a good starting point in this competition.</p> <p>It helps as well that they have a striker with the pace and directness of Vardy. It was his running that led to the free-kick for Mahrez\u2019s first goal and in the 62nd minute he set off again, picking up speed and darting between the two centre-backs. The sprint took him into the penalty area and Vardy was too quick for the goalkeeper as well, touching the ball past Butelle before being taken down. Mahrez had failed to score with three of his previous four penalties, leaving Ranieri contemplating handing the role to Slimani, but this one was struck with power and was still rising as it hit the net. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t score I take the neck and crush the neck,\u201d Ranieri joked.</p> <p>Izquierdo did strike the post a few minutes later but the visitors can also reflect on a number of other opportunities in the second half. Robert Huth had two headed chances from corners. Ahmed Musa, a substitute, was lively after taking over from Vardy and Leicester will look back on their first Champions League assignment as a lot of fun.</p>",
  "<p>They came in their tens of thousands and the sense of occasion was palpable. Never before had so many watched a home club game in English football history but the over-riding emotion among the whopping 85,011 in attendance would be regret.</p> <p>What if Tottenham had been more clinical? What if they had not switched off twice in the first half to concede? Tottenham did not look unnerved by the grandest of occasions at Wembley. They merely came up on the wrong side of the finest of margins against a Monaco team that showed precisely why they are on top of Ligue 1 at present.</p> <p>Mauricio Pochettino had said beforehand that the strength of the Premier League is such that a tie in the Champions League ought to hold no fears. Tottenham had won handsomely at Stoke City on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s just as tough to play Monaco as it is at Stoke,\u201d the manager said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/tottenham-hotspur-mauricio-pochettino-monaco-champions-league\">Mauricio Pochettino furious at lack of Tottenham passion in Monaco defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It rang hollow. Monaco were no Stoke and they showed their clinical side to condemn Tottenham to a disappointing start in Group E. Toby Alderweireld\u2019s goal in first-half stoppage time to eat into Monaco\u2019s 2-0 lead had hinted at a comeback but Monaco closed the game out with a degree of comfort in the latter stages.</p> <p>Pochettino had told his players to play the match and not the occasion and theirs was a performance of drive and dabs of creativity. It was not a case of them falling flat on the big night. As a spectacle, it was enjoyable; the atmosphere was decent and there were moments when the decibel levels rose sharply.</p> <p>But Tottenham were found wanting when it mattered most. Son Heung-min missed a golden chance after eight minutes whereas Harry Kane could not finish towards the end, when centrally placed. As for the concessions, they were disastrous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/manchester-city-borussia-monchengladbach-champions-league-group-c-match-report\">Ag\u00fcero hat-trick inspires Manchester City against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monaco\u2019s breakthrough goal was a choker, particularly for Erik Lamela, who lost the ball in a dangerous area and watched the quicksilver Bernardo Silva advance unchecked towards the edge of the area. It was too easy for the Portugal forward, with neither Ben Davies nor Jan Vertonghen challenging, although the rasping finish was of the highest class.</p> <p>Silva played off the shoulder of the former Manchester United and Chelsea striker Radamel Falcao in what was a 4-4-2 formation from the Monaco manager, Leonardo Jardim. Within it Silva had the licence the drop off but it was a system that was marked by balance and boldness and one that was not upset by the early loss of the right winger, Nabil Dirar, to a muscle pull.</p> <p>Dirar\u2019s replacement, Thomas Lemar, scored his team\u2019s second and it was another concession marked by slapdash defending. From Silva\u2019s nonchalant back-heel, Djibril Sidib\u00e9 was granted the space to cross from the left and, when the ball eluded Vertonghen, it crashed into Davies and broke for Lemar. He banged his shot high into the net.</p> <p>Pochettino, too, had been adventurous with his selection, finding room for both Lamela and Son and using Dele Alli alongside Eric Dier in midfield, at the expense of the more defensive-minded Victor Wanyama. Alli flickered but he could find no end product.</p> <p>Tottenham were the brighter team for the first 15 minutes but Son\u2019s miss was disappointing. He had time to control Kane\u2019s cross at the far post and place his shot towards the far corner. Andrea Raggi, though, had bolted back to cover and he cleared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a4ca0714cb779af6333e471e971d80ef6c3eafc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a4ca0714cb779af6333e471e971d80ef6c3eafc/0_190_5017_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tottenham\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 in action at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tottenham\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 in action at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The record crowd grew restless as Tottenham trailed by two but Alderweireld\u2019s goal represented a life-line. He got himself in front of Kamil Glik on Lamela\u2019s corner to thud a header past Danijel Subasic and there was almost more to come moments later. Alli stretched to apply a touch to Lamela\u2019s clipped pass only to find himself narrowly short.</p> <p>Tottenham played Monaco twice last season in the Europa League, drawing away and hammering them at White Hart Lane but Jardim\u2019s current crop looked more polished, more streetwise. Silva and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho provided the refinement and Falcao also emerged with credit.</p> <p>Pochettino introduced Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 at the interval for his first action of the season \u2013 the midfielder was suspended for Tottenham\u2019s opening four Premier League games \u2013 and the scene was set for a knife-edged drama. The home team pressed hard on to the front foot, with Kane linking up the play, but Monaco remained capable of springing on the counter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/club-brugge-leicester-city-champions-league-group-g-match-report\">Leicester City ease to victory over Club Brugge on Champions League debut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alli worked Subasic with a dipping volley from distance, Kane saw a shot blocked by Jemerson and there was the bizarre moment when Alli threw himself to the ground, under a non-challenge from Fabinho, as Lamela prepared to take a corner and the referee, Gianluca Rocchi, rushed over to book the Monaco player. The visiting players panicked, clearly sensing that a penalty award was next, but Rocchi could not point to the spot as the ball had not been in play.</p> <p>Tottenham wanted one more chance \u2013 a shot at salvation \u2013 and it came in the 79th minute when the substitute Vincent Janssen crossed for Kane.

  "<p>Perhaps no cartoon frog has been as thoroughly maligned during the 2016 election as <a href=\"http://www.mattfurie.com/\">Matt Furie</a>\u2019s hapless Pepe. The meme-friendly, often crudely drawn amphibian has lately been seen smiling, sporting Trump-like hair and standing menacingly behind the Republican presidential nominee in a photoshopped lineup of The Deplorables, a play on Hillary Clinton\u2019s dismissal of many of the candidate\u2019s supporters belonging in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d.<br></p> <p>The Clinton campaign posted an <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/\">under-informed explainer</a> about Pepe, describing him as a \u201csymbol associated with white supremacy\u201d, though they admit he has been \u201cenjoyed by teenagers and pop stars alike\u201d in the past.</p> <p>San Francisco cartoonist and painter Furie created Pepe as part of his laid-back cartoon Boy\u2019s Club, which was collected in print by comics publisher <a href=\"http://www.fantagraphics.com/boysclub/\">Fantagraphics</a> this July. The easygoing strip chronicles the adventures of four roommates \u2013 Pepe, Andy, Brett and the malicious Landwolf \u2013 who spend a lot of time getting high, farting, spouting catchphrases and generally behaving like people who think Pepe memes are funny. Furie says Pepe himself is not into Nazis or Klansmen. \u201cIf anything, he\u2019d be part of the Green party,\u201d he tells the Guardian.</p> <p>Furie, also <a href=\"http://www.mattfurie.com/\">a witty painter</a> with a fine arts background, explains why he likes the crude reworkings of his careful linework, why he loves The Far Side, and why he\u2019s ultimately voting for Hillary Clinton, whether or not she likes his frog drawing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3840291560cafb5166148244f38c73892d6b7ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3840291560cafb5166148244f38c73892d6b7ce2/0_0_774_902/429.png\" alt=\"Matt Furie\u2019s Pepe the Frog from his graphic novel Boy\u2019s Club.\" width=\"429\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Furie\u2019s Pepe the Frog from his graphic novel Boy\u2019s Club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Congratulations on the book. Is it selling a lot of copies?</strong></p> <p>You know, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s doing! I hope it\u2019s doing well. Pepe\u2019s kind of hitting peak interest with people in the media right now, so I\u2019m kinda trying to utilize that and twist it into talking about the origins of Pepe, which is in this modest comic book I did. A lot of people are just not familiar with Pepe as he lives as a comic book persona \u2013 kind of a more simple-minded, chill frog. And now he\u2019s taken on the multiple faces of whatever\u2019s going on in the crazy world out there. I just want to bring it back down to earth a little bit at the moment.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://mattfurie.tumblr.com/image/150369755602\">Landwolf</a> feels like a much more appropriate avatar for malcontents than Pepe. <br></strong></p> <p>Definitely.<br></p> <p><strong>What was it like seeing The Deplorables picture with the characters replaced with famous heads including Pepe\u2019s?<br></strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve only just seen this stuff recently because everyone\u2019s sending it to me, including, like, media people. Honestly I don\u2019t really follow it very much but you can\u2019t ignore it. It\u2019s all over the place. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve ever seen Pepe as Donald Trump. When I first saw it I thought it was kind of funny. </p> <p>I don\u2019t take it too seriously \u2013 I just try to take it in stride, but the thing that\u2019s come to my attention is ... well, I didn\u2019t know what white nationalists were until, like, yesterday. And the alt-right or whatever? It\u2019s all very new and very strange and definitely not something that I support. I guess Pepe is kind of its own internet thing now. I\u2019m hoping not to get any hate or threats or anything. You have to do a little bit of research to even link it back to me, I think.</p> <p><strong>You don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a particularly political guy. Do you have any temptation to align yourself one way or another as stuff heats up before the election?<br></strong></p> <p>My interests lie more in philosophical or spiritual books, and politics come and go. But yeah, I\u2019m interested in it. I\u2019m particularly interested in environmental stuff, more like humanitarian stuff. I definitely lean much more liberal \u2013 basically the opposite of what\u2019s happening with Pepe right now.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/774684329016299520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am so proud to be one of the Deplorables <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump2016?src=hash\">#Trump2016</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/IFD1hfC60w\">pic.twitter.com/IFD1hfC60w</a></p>&mdash; Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/774684329016299520\">September 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Can I ask who you\u2019re voting for?<br></strong></p> <p>Well, I was really excited for Bernie, and that fizzled out, so I guess I\u2019m gonna have to take one for the team and go for Hillary even though she\u2019s talking smack, or whoever\u2019s writing for her at the moment is talking smack about Pepe.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m surprised at how little I\u2019ve seen you or Boy\u2019s Club written about in stories on Pepe.</strong></p> <p>Beyond Boy\u2019s Club, I think it\u2019s even more familiar as a meme for youth culture and teenagers. It\u2019s weird that people are saying he\u2019s been \u201ca longtime white supremacist meme\u201d. If anything he\u2019d be part of the Green party.

People are taking it <em>really</em> seriously and it\u2019s a damn cartoon frog.

  "<p>Balancing symbolism and substance has long accompanied the European project. The EU\u2019s star-studded flag as well as its choice of anthem (Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy) point to an era when federalist views once held sway. That era is gone. This week\u2019s informal summit in Bratislava \u2013 preceded, today, by European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-16-3043_en.htm\" title=\"\">state of the union speech</a> before MEPs \u2013 is likely to be remembered for realism rather than idealism. Europe is struggling with so many crises that it is hard to dispute the need to get back to some basics \u2013 which means restoring public confidence in the EU\u2019s ability to deliver for citizens.</p> <p>Today\u2019s symbolism is crude enough: on Friday, just six months away from the ceremonies due to mark the 60th anniversary of the treaty of Rome, all but one of the EU\u2019s leaders will gather in Bratislava to take a long, hard look into the future. Not invited is the UK. The message, with regret, is that Europe is going one way, Britain is going another.</p> <p>For the EU 27 there are many unknowns \u2013 not least because losing Britain is a big blow. So it is no surprise Mr Juncker tried to boost morale by saying \u201cthe EU is not at risk since Brexit\u201d. But if the message is that Europe must not be written off, there is still the challenge of making sure it gets heard outside the offices of EU institutions and in the average citizen\u2019s home.</p> <p>Mr Juncker\u2019s proposals are wide-ranging, from a near doubling of an EU-wide investment plan, to deploying more border guards and enhancing anti-terrorism cooperation, as well as efforts towards common EU defence policies (which UK membership of the club has long impeded). It is unlikely any of this will lead to any significant announcements in Bratislava \u2013 if only because forging consensus takes time.</p> <p>Mr Juncker and others want to frame a more positive narrative for the EU, at a time when it is under severe attack from populist forces that have been buoyed by Brexit. It was striking that he insisted that nothing Europe does is meant to erode the nation state, nor is it meant to blend separate identities into a single homogeneous bloc.</p> <p>This may read like an overture to Poland\u2019s nationalist government, which had been criticised for backsliding on democratic norms. But it is not. Mr Juncker\u2019s point was about trying to bridge the differences that emerged last year over the vexed issue of refugee quotas. Next month Hungary is set to vote in a referendum on the quota scheme. A resounding <em>nem</em> is expected. That Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister has just suggested Hungary should be kicked out of the EU for its refugee policies will have done nothing to help restore a sense of unity.</p> <p>Some simplistically see Europe\u2019s dividing lines reduced to an east-west clash. The wider picture is that populist forces are on the upsurge almost everywhere, exerting significant pressure in the Netherlands, France and Germany, where key elections will be held next year. With this backdrop, there are now increasing calls for a more social Europe to emerge.</p> <p>Mr Juncker made that case, reminding Poland and other new member states along the way how much they benefit from EU funds sent to poorer regions. Increased investment plans are meant to favour growth and jobs. This is a welcome development and recognition that European economics are not just about deficits and austerity. There is backing from EU civil society, parts of which want to go further. <a href=\"http://www.youthforum.org/assets/2016/09/Common-statement-A-new-Europe-for-people-planet-and-Prosperity-for-all.pdf\" title=\"\">A group of 177 European NGOs and trade unions</a> wants more \u201csocial and sustainable\u201d policies aimed at defusing far-right politics. Adopting a degree of flexibility in interpreting eurozone deficit rules for Portugal and Spain helps cast Europe as pro-growth. Similar leniency should be considered to deal with looming problems in Greece and Italy.</p> <p>What Europe\u2019s annus horribilis \u2013 which ran from the refugee crisis to Brexit \u2013 has shown is the need for citizens to see the benefits they can draw from the EU. The question must be asked why political leaders do not highlight Europe\u2019s fight on behalf of ordinary citizens \u2013 for example, as when the commission forced Apple to repay a record-breaking \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes. Instead, as Mr Juncker put it, all too often \u201csuccess is national, and failure European\u201d. Social and economic factors, along with security and a better sense of collective control in the face of globalisation, must surely be a key part of the EU\u2019s survival strategy.</p> <p>While Europe stares ahead, Britain remains entangled in our own uncertainties; outside but looking in.</p>",

  "<p>The proposed reduction in parliamentary constituencies and redrawing of constituency boundaries are both worrying (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/corbyn-johnson-and-osborne-among-mps-hit-by-electoral-shakeup\">Corbyn and Johnson to contest new seats under controversial electoral shakeup</a>, 13 September). Reducing the number of constituencies from 650 to 600 was a hasty response by the coalition government to the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal in 2009. There has been little or no attempt to justify this other than on grounds of economy, though the savings will be trifling in relation to total public expenditure.</p> <p>It has been overlooked that a major element of MPs\u2019 work is listening to, and trying to fix, the numerous problems and grievances of their constituents. Increasing the average constituency size by roughly 10% will inevitably increase the time spent by MPs on these matters, which must reduce the time available to them to scrutinise and check the actions of government. Possibly this was the result intended by David Cameron.</p> <p>Second, the way in which the boundaries have been redrawn is open to accusations of political bias. Although the boundary commissioners are independent once appointed, it is the government that appoints them and their appointments come up for renewal every five years. It is by no means fanciful to imagine that commissioners will be aware that some outcomes of their deliberations will be more agreeable to the government than others.</p> <p>Perceptions of political bias are also greatly fuelled by the vague and potentially conflicting criteria that the boundary commissioners are required to observe. These include the desirability of keeping constituencies reasonably compact and regularly shaped; of following existing local government and constituency boundaries; keeping areas with a sense of local community within the same constituency; and balancing urban and rural populations within a constituency.</p> <p>These problems could be solved at a stroke if we adopted a 21st-century approach to drawing constituency boundaries: giving the job to a computer. It would be simple to instruct a computer to divide the UK into 650 subdivisions, each with the same number of registered voters (or, preferably, people over the age of 18). One would also want to build in some additional restrictions, most obviously that of minimising the length of the perimeter of each constituency so as to avoid bizarre shapes (such as the salamander from which gerrymandering originates). Other criteria, such as following as far as possible local government boundaries, could also be programmed in if desired.<br><strong>Geoffrey Renshaw</strong><br><em>Dept of economics, University of Warwick</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is no single electoral system that fulfils all the requirements for fully democratic governance: among others, fair representation of all interests and strands of opinion; a stable and effective government; prevention of extreme groups gaining too much power; retaining a direct link between an MP and his or her constituents; and making all votes of equal value. The last in particular is generally recognised to be a failing of the present first-past-the-post system. Simply equalising the number of voters in each constituency will not, as is claimed, change that. Some constituencies will still be the marginal ones that essentially determine the overall result. I would argue that it is at least as important that constituency boundaries represent natural communities and that is not achieved by the present exercise, as a number of examples quoted show.</p> <p>Of course the register should be as up to date as possible and that should not be difficult in this computerised age. But why should it depend on the individual applying to be on it? For example, why should not every possessor of a national insurance number, or an income tax reference, or a driving licence, if otherwise eligible, be automatically entered on the electoral register?<br><strong>Frank Jackson</strong><br><em>Harlow Labour party</em></p> <p>\u2022 The weasel words in your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/the-guardian-view-on-david-camerons-legacy-changes-that-suit-the-tories\">editorial</a> (13 September) on proposed constituency boundary changes are: \u201cA constituency-based system, which provides an invaluable link between voter and MP, must be redrawn independently and fairly from time to time.\u201d However, the myth of the single MP, known to all constituents and coping with each and every need of their problems, is a malign illusion which often prevents the individual having an MP representing a recognisable community and who is sympathetic to his or her needs. Second, it is impossible, however independent and fair the boundary commissioners are, to divide up the electorate into single member seats without carving up communities and causing political gerrymandering.</p> <p>Fairness in elections, with a match between proportionality and accountability, requires multi-member seats, recognising community identity, and with electors able to express their preferences between parties and candidates. At a stroke we would then remove the plaintive cries that changes are undemocratic.<br><strong>Michael Meadowcroft</strong><br><em>Liberal MP, Leeds West 1983-87</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Boundary Commission has done its best to maintain historic county boundaries in their review of parliamentary seats. Unfortunately, in Cornwall, there are just over 500 electors too many and, to meet the parameters, the commission has proposed a new deeply unpopular Devonwall constituency, which sits on both sides of the River Tamar. With a modest relaxation of the rules,, compared with what has been allowed in the Isle of Wight, Cornwall could keep its identity. That means allowing a 6% variation in numbers of electors per seat instead of 5%. There would be a better fit to devolution in the west country.

  "<p>David Cameron\u2019s assertion that he is resigning as an MP to avoid becoming a&#xa0;distraction from the government is as disingenuous as it is palpably untrue (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 13&#xa0;September). Remember his only real job has been that of a spin doctor. But no amount of spin can hide the fact that he said he would remain prime minister even if he lost the EU referendum, and that he would also remain an MP if he resigned as prime minister. The truth is that, far from fearing becoming a distraction, he realised that, like most ex-PMs, he would be ignored. He would be perceived in the House of Commons as a prime minister whose career ended in failure as he was apt to concede. In&#xa0;parliament he would be mocked as a&#xa0;politician who made a catastrophic miscalculation that ended his career and plunged the UK into years of turmoil and consequences we cannot even imagine. His fragile ego could not cope with that prospect. On a more prosaic level the clue to his motivation to resign can be found in his attempt three years ago to sabotage EU measures designed to block tax evasion.

Then there were the \u201cvote blue, go green\u201d, \u201cthe big society\u201d, \u201cno top-down reorganisation of the NHS\u201d, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d and many other promises that came to nothing. But standing well above his many failures is the EU referendum, launched with no thought for the consequences of what has now happened.

Patterson was ruled out of this game due to a serious illness to his father, and he was expected to miss the rest of the season. But an improvement in his personal circumstances means the metronomic seamer, who has been badly missed, will be back in contention.</p> <p>This was actually Yorkshire\u2019s best day of the contest as they fought hard to wipe away their deficit, with the left-handed Lehmann sharing an eighth-wicket partnership of 101 inside 30 overs with Liam Plunkett, who made 73 with a couple of big sixes over long-on off Leach.</p> <p>However, Somerset kept the hosts at bay thanks to their buoyant left-arm spinner, who took the final six wickets, including Lehmann lbw sweeping and Plunkett caught flashing hard to slip, to boost his tally this season to 58 wickets at 22.6.

To bomb a regime out of existence has the same outcome as invading it. Those who destroy authority, law and order in other people\u2019s countries have an absolute obligation to restore them.</p> <p>The essence of imperial power projection, from the Roman to the British empires, was total commitment. Armies came, saw, conquered \u2013 and stayed to hold the peace. Conquering was easy. It was holding the peace that was hard, and eventually bled empires white. As&#xa0;in&#xa0;Baghdad in 2003, so in Tripoli in 2011: the destruction of authority was more cataclysmic than any other worst-case scenario. Cameron had seen this in Iraq, yet in Libya he cut and run. He sowed the seeds of chaos and left anarchy in his wake.</p> <p>We know, and knew then, that Islamist fanaticism feasts on tribal discord. By unlocking the doors of Armageddon, Cameron admitted fanaticism to north Africa. As such he threatened Tunisia, Algeria and Mali. He also provided a lawless corridor through which hundreds of thousands of refugees could make their way to Europe. He thus ironically fed the Brexit cause and his own downfall. He and his advisers must have given some thought to this.</p> <p>The Blair-Cameron interventions since the turn of the 21st century have, with American help, destabilised an entire arc of the Muslim world. Millions have died and been driven from their ancestral lands, on a scale reminiscent of historical human catastrophes in eastern Europe, Russia and China. Of course, this \u201ccould\u201d have happened anyway, as it happened in Lebanon and in the Iran-Iraq war. But it happened far worse after the interventions began.</p> <p>Much of foreign policy is founded on false parallels. The Libyan venture was said to be justified because intervention \u201cworked\u201d in former Yugoslavia. That is true. But Yugoslavia was a patchwork of European provinces. The wars worked only through massive commitment on the ground, with the two rebel provinces, Bosnia and Kosovo, becoming de facto EU protectorates. Bosnia is reputedly the most subsidised state on Earth. Libya had no such luck.</p> <p>The other proclamation is that Syria&#xa0;today \u201cproves\u201d that not intervening is even worse. This is madness. Syria was a tragedy of its own making, but it was immeasurably prolonged by the west arming President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s enemies and enabling a Sunni-Islamic State statelet to arise in Iraq; that and Russia\u2019s massive support for Assad. Intervention has been the death of Syria. The idea that British bombers and (heaven forbid) ground troops would have prevented such internecine strife is absurd. If we want to help Syria, we should welcome its refugees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/five-things-chilcot-iraq-war-inquiry-tony-blair\">Five things you may have missed about the Chilcot inquiry | Louise Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What the Commons report does not do, any more than did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/iraq-war-inquiry\" title=\"\">Chilcot over Iraq</a>, is ask why Tony Blair and Cameron were&#xa0;able to rush to war with so little thought given to consequences, and with so little opposition from within the&#xa0;political community.</p> <p>British leaders of the postwar and cold-war eras were chary of wars of intervention. They knew that violence mostly escalates and begets more violence. Harold Wilson, Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher steered clear of Vietnam, Congo, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Ethiopia.

Cameron likewise craved a personal \u201cvictory\u201d, and afterwards visited Benghazi to take credit. There were reservations from the defence and intelligence chiefs. But a feature of bombing intervention is that nobody on \u201cour\u201d side gets hurt. Intervention can seem almost an exercise, Olympic Games with whizz-bangs.</p> <p>In these circumstances, caution has no&#xa0;constituency. During Libya, Britain\u2019s much-vaunted national security council&#xa0;concerned itself with legalities and logistics. As in Iraq, when war drums sounded and the press was cheering, no one had time for the tedious topic of postwar reconstruction. Sceptics were dismissed as wimps, appeasers and do-nothings. Everyone was high on the narcotic of glory.</p> <p>It is to Cameron\u2019s credit that, in the case of war on Syria in 2013, he did ask for the check of a formal parliamentary vote, to confront what he absurdly claimed was \u201ca direct threat to this country\u201d. To parliament\u2019s credit, it refused him. That did not stop the Commons last year returning to the fray&#xa0;by voting to bomb Syria after all. That has hardly made any difference. But the thesis was, as they said of Gaddafi, the old one: that nothing could be worse than Assad. Want to bet?</p>",
  "<p>If you\u2019re a fan of Louis CK, there\u2019s a fair chance you\u2019ll also be a fan of Pamela Adlon. Their comic collaboration has stretched across two decades: first in CK\u2019s short-lived anti-sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/04/lucky-louie-box-set-review\">Lucky Louie,</a> where Adlon played Kim, the deadpan wife to CK\u2019s schlub husband, then in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/louie-louis-ck-season-five-premiere\">the dizzyingly adventurous sad-com Louie</a>, where she was Pamela, a caustic single mum who acted as the title character\u2019s best friend and lust object. In both shows, Adlon was the perfect comic foil for CK: bawdy, blunt and vaguely infuriated by the modern world, not to mention very funny.</p> <p>Still, as excellent as Adlon was, she was very much given second billing. Now, though, their roles have reversed. Better Things, a new comedy airing on FX, marks the latest chapter in the pair\u2019s collaboration, but this time it\u2019s CK in the supporting role and Adlon who\u2019s the lead. \u201cI wanted to tell a story about being a single mom, middle-aged, living in Los Angeles,\u201d she says over the phone in her recognisably gravelly voice.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s an important story to tell.\u201d</p> <p>Better Things stars Adlon as single parent Sam Fox. A former child star turned jobbing actor, her career has long since become ancillary to the more urgent task of looking after her three daughters. Outwardly her life has all the trappings of comfortability \u2013 shabby-chic mansion, a social life spent in the bars and restaurants of the Hollywood Hills. But she\u2019s also paying the lion\u2019s share of a recent divorce settlement and, with plum acting roles drying up due to her age, is subsisting on bit parts and voiceover work.</p> <p>This might sound familiar if you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on Adlon\u2019s own career. Also a child actor, her adult career has largely been made up of supporting roles (such as acid-tongued Marcy in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/nov/13/david-duchovny-californication-box-set\">Californication</a>) and voiceover work (Bobby in King of the Hill). And like Sam, Adlon has three daughters aged around 16, 12 and 5, and recently got divorced. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15747bae593776d9363179545c248c562fbee1e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15747bae593776d9363179545c248c562fbee1e7/0_34_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I rarely see anybody like me and my friends represented on television\u2019 \u2026 Adlon as Pam with Mikey Madison as Max in Better Things.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I rarely see anybody like me and my friends represented on television\u2019 \u2026 Adlon as Pam with Mikey Madison as Max in Better Things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was originally trying to think of alternatives to fictionalise myself,\u201d says Adlon. \u201cI\u2019d say \u2018maybe I have a daughter adopted from China, or maybe I\u2019m a lesbian, maybe I this, maybe I that\u2019. But it just seemed better to use my real life as the bones for the show.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a great call. Better Things\u2019 vision of family life feels rounded and detailed in a way most TV could only dream of. Adlon says she wants the show \u201cto elevate the mundane\u201d, and each episode is full of tiny but profound observations that could only come from someone who\u2019s lived them \u2013 futile battles with smoke alarms, wordless but telling meals with teens.</p> <p>It\u2019s refreshing: after all, it\u2019s usually men like CK and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/jun/15/larry-david-curb-your-enthusiasm-most-famous-character-himself\">Larry David</a> who get their own self-referential series. Hollywood tends to quietly nudge female actors into the background when they reach Adlon\u2019s age, a fate that is befalling Sam in the show. One standout episode sees a production team scrutinise her eligibility for a role in a new sitcom. \u201cWe\u2019ve got sexy, so why don\u2019t we get funny?\u201d, one of the showrunners suggests. They opt for Rachel McAdams instead.</p> <p>\u201cI think this happens all the time. Certainly to me,\u201d says Adlon when I bring up the scene. She thinks the entertainment industry is becoming slightly more inclusive, but she still rarely sees \u201canybody like me and my friends represented on television. So I wanted to tell stories about the friends in my world and things that happen ... these aren\u2019t really big, crazy, extraordinary things. It\u2019s just regular life.\u201d</p> <p>Regular life it may be, but Better Things never feels humdrum or safe. Its first few episodes feature Sam stealing one of her daughter\u2019s condoms, violent diarrhoea, and a deeply uncomfortable scene where Sam brings a black colleague (played by Lenny Kravitz) home for dinner with her daughters and her mother, who is weirded out by his presence. \u201cShe\u2019s not racist, she\u2019s over 70. You warn people over 70 that a black person is coming round,\u201d Kravitz\u2019s character tells Sam sagely.</p> <p>Intriguingly Sam\u2019s mum is British, played by Celia Imre with a plummy received-pronunciation accent. It\u2019s a piece of casting that mirrors reality; Adlon\u2019s mother is also British. \u201cI thought the only person who could do this part in the world is Maggie Smith,\u201d says Adlon. \u201cThen my casting director told me to meet with Celia. She\u2019s younger than I wanted and really gorgeous. The first day she had a wardrobe fitting I was like \u2018ok, she looks like Annie Hall with giant tits, and she\u2019s way sexier than any of my friends or me. Go make her into an old fluff\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f97db6c9b4a0dc13478b40a6aad5c39a104800e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f97db6c9b4a0dc13478b40a6aad5c39a104800e0/0_58_3008_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Louis and I used to talk about revisiting Lucky Louie, so anything\u2019s possible\u2019 \u2026 Louis CK and Adlon in Lucky Louie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Louis and I used to talk about revisiting Lucky Louie, so anything\u2019s possible\u2019 \u2026 Louis CK and Adlon in Lucky Louie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Imre\u2019s clipped tones jar so strongly with Adlon\u2019s drawl that it almost feels she\u2019s been teleported in from another sitcom.

After all, Louie loved nothing more than to disrupt its observational comic plots with bursts of surrealism \u2013 a date escaping via helicopter, a homeless man getting decapitated. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2016/09/pamela_adlon_s_better_things_on_fx_reviewed.html\">Early reviews for the show</a> have been raves, drawing favourable comparisons with CK\u2019s earlier work. <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/atlanta-better-things-tv-review.html\">Vulture critic Matt Zoller-Seitz wrote</a> that Better Things \u201ctook CK\u2019s refinements to a new level\u201d, and called it a \u201chigh-water mark for half-hour, auteur-driven TV comedy\u201d. But Adlon is at pains to underline the distinctions. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different show to Louie,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a similarity in the way we talk and write dialogue. But in terms of the realistic nature of my show and delving deeper into the characters and situations, it\u2019s very different.\u201d</p> <p>But what of the pair\u2019s other show? Adlon, who also produces and writes for Louie, is unsure when the series, currently on \u201c<a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/louie-c-k-louie-extended-hiatus-1201559159/\">extended hiatus</a>\u201d, will return. \u201cI think they\u2019re keeping it on ice, like Curb Your Enthusiasm maybe,\u201d she suggests. \u201cLouis and I used to talk about revisiting Lucky Louie, so anything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <p>For now, she\u2019s focused on Better Things. \u201cRegular real normal life is an amazing story to tell,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd three girls at different stages developmentally, it\u2019s just unbelievable fodder.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI hate to use the cliche, but it\u2019s all about learning moments,\u201d she adds. \u201cEverywhere, all up my butt, all day long.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>Drones aren\u2019t just for snooping on Bin Laden showering in the Tora Bora mountains. The idea of racing them has been embedded in pop culture for ages, but it\u2019s only recently that the sport has started to form itself into something recognisably professional. Landmarks have come thick and fast in the past year, most notably with the $1m (\u00a3760,000) Dubai World Drone Prix in March.</p> <p>Now, the fledgling sport is about to reach Britain. Sky has decided to invest $1m into a US drone-racing formula, run by a former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/07/tough-mudder-military-style-assault-course\">Tough Mudder</a> executive; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/14/sky-drone-racing-league-first-person-view\">10 episodes of the Drone Racing League will be shown on Sky Sports Mix</a>. The deal also paves the way for a British drone race, at a venue yet to be decided.</p> <p>In our vaping, Pok\u00e9mon Go future-present, drone racing could be the next step in our species\u2019 transition to the stuff of a second-string L Ron Hubbard novel. ESports are already worth half a billion dollars. So, just who are these magnificent men and their flying machines? \u201cDrones\u201d is a sexy, but misleading, name for vehicles that average 25cm in length. Unlike the Predators that launch missiles in western Pakistan and can hover for 24 hours at a time, the drones here are quadcopters: with four rotor blades surrounding a central chassis, they can move at up to 90mph. Racing formulas differ, but the pilots all use cameras embedded in their drones to get a first-person view while operating. The tracks are three-dimensional, left-right, up-down affairs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/14/sky-drone-racing-league-first-person-view\">Sky to air Drone Racing League in $1m deal</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84f2ebb8196f902b6e1b680deaa750227f4b836b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84f2ebb8196f902b6e1b680deaa750227f4b836b/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dubai World Drone Prix\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fan at the Dubai event watches the race through first-person-view goggles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With drone racing being such a new sport, a land-grab is under way. So far, the winners are the Sky-partnered Drone Racing League, the National Drone Racing Championships (which held a flagship event on Governors Island, New York, at the start of August) and the Dubai World Drone Prix (which, in addition to the groundbreaking prize money, offered 32 teams an all-expenses-paid trip to the UAE).</p> <p>The Dubai track is a futuristic assemblage of specially made polymer obstacles that resembles the vertebrae of an 800-metre-long plastic lizard. Competitors must execute tight manoeuvres to pass through different checkpoints. The Drone Racing League prefers a more grungy, urbex \u2013 urban exploration \u2013 feel. Its first race was in February, at the Miami Dolphins\u2019 Hard Rock stadium; the next was at the abandoned Hawthorne mall in Los Angeles. Neon checkpoints and LED-lit quadcopters add to the air of a speakeasy located somewhere in the orbit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatooine\">Tatooine</a>. The National Drone Racing Championships, on the other hand, with its grassland setting and slalom-style gates, looks like a gymkhana for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/03/star-wars-droid-bb-8-is-real-you-can-take-him-home-sphero-disney\">BB8</a>.</p> <p>Visually, the experience is all about immersion \u2013 seeing things from a pilot\u2019s eye view and experiencing an unsettling, dreamlike feeling of flying. The Drone Racing League has had to develop proprietary radio signal relay systems in order to broadcast video streams in areas such as tunnels where traditional rigs wouldn\u2019t penetrate. The National Drone Racing Championships became the first to launch a mainstream TV deal when ESPN picked up the rights for its August event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56ced8e3600d4d06d4f6f894d8438d64b451e864\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56ced8e3600d4d06d4f6f894d8438d64b451e864/0_0_5177_3451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"National Drone Racing Championships on Governors Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Competitors wait for the start of a practice race during the National Drone Racing Championships on Governors Island in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This isn\u2019t a sport that has yet developed its own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/jun/19/danny-macaskill-stunts-models-toys-video\">Danny McAskill</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/sep/14/surfer-kelly-slater-hurley-pro-video\">Kelly Slater</a>. At the moment, drone racers are mainly men who sit in a control booth, obscured behind their first-person-view goggles. Perhaps acknowledging this, the Drone Racing League has decided they must have self-consciously \u201cfunky\u201d names that make them sound like rejects from a casting call for a new Black Eyed Peas lineup. Among the most notable are FlyingBear, a mechanical product design engineer known for his tendency to stand up while racing; Spaztik (yes, Spaztik); the reckless Hazak; calculating Australian rekreK; and Zoomas, a former dirtbike racer who works in construction management.</p> <p>The naming silliness continues at the National Drone Racing Championships, where there\u2019s top-ranked Charpu, Nytfury, UmmaGawd and CodeRed. Almost all drone racers remain hobbyists, but the sport is seized by the sense that it\u2019s inventing the future. Right now, they claim, we\u2019re still in the era of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Fangio\">Juan Manuel Fangio</a> getting out of the car to swig champagne during a Monza pit stop. Soon enough, they argue, Bernie Ecclestone-style big bucks are inevitable. The list of investors is certainly impressive. Among those who have put money into the Drone Racing League are startup godhead Gary Vaynerchuk and Muse\u2019s lead singer Matt Bellamy. With that sort of backing, perhaps soon the names Ayrton Senna and Graham Hill will pale in comparison to UmmaGawd and Spaztik.</p>",

Cross-party agreement on the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/london-assembly\">London Assembly</a> holds that Transport for London should be handed responsibility for the suburban parts of the notoriously tormented routes connecting the capital to Sussex and other Home Counties, but the Conservative group thought Sadiq Khan should get some grief over his overtures to new transport secretary Chris Grayling, plus a bit more besides.</p> <p>Khan has been <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-to-take-immediate-control-of-southern-rail\">calling loudly since July</a> for TfL to take immediate control of Southern by sending in a management hit squad to knock things into shape while the Department for Transport sorts out its longer term future. He and <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/assembly\">AMs</a> agree that that should mean control of the <a href=\"http://www.southernrailway.com/southern/company-info/integration/\">Govia Thameslink</a> company\u2019s London operation being handed to TfL as soon as possible. Khan has written to Grayling to that effect and on Tuesday the assembly\u2019s cross-party transport committee did <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/letter_to_secretary_of_state_-_rail_devolution_-_sept_2016.pdf\">the same</a>, as part of a general expression of concern about <a href=\"http://www.mayorwatch.co.uk/london-assembly-expresses-concern-at-governments-worrying-lack-of-progress-on-rail-devolution/\">lack of progress</a> on rail devolution. Khan said he thought the government had \u201cmissed a trick\u201d in failing to accept his kind offer.</p> <p>What\u2019s the problem here? It isn\u2019t only Khan who thinks it\u2019s Grayling. The new transport secretary has <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/chris-grayling-mp-todays-vote-on-evel-offers-a-stronger-fairer-union.html\">spoken up</a> for \u201cgreater devolution to the nations and regions of the UK\u201d in the past, but it\u2019s easy to find luminaries of the London transport firmament who are completely convinced that he doesn\u2019t really want to hand down power over Southern. One view is that he\u2019s worried about putting stockbroker belt commuters in the hands of TfL at a time when it is coping with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/sep/10/transport-for-londons-financial-numbers-crunch\">substantial funding cuts</a> and also that he doesn\u2019t much care for Khan, who was his pugnacious Labour shadow during his time as justice secretary.</p> <p>The Tory City Hall attack was delivered by <a href=\"http://glaconservatives.co.uk/members/gareth-bacon/\">Gareth Bacon</a>, current leader of the <a href=\"http://glaconservatives.co.uk/members\">eight-strong Tory group</a>. After testing Khan\u2019s general knowledge - just checking, but he did understand that TfL would be \u201ccontrolling the franchise\u201d rather than directly running the service, did he? - Bacon invited him to say how many people were in this TfL top team-in-waiting of which he speaks, what their names are, what jobs they are doing now and whether Southern would be getting their services for free. To which Khan retorted that Bacon was \u201cclearly acting as a conduit for the secretary of state,\u201d and there the cross-party compact got a bit frayed. </p> <p>Bacon then widened his attack to the RMT union, which has been making its own contribution to the Southern saga with a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37347053\">series of stoppages</a>. If Khan could lacerate the train operator for cancellations and delays, could he not also tear a strip off the strikers? Or else, could he, with his strong union links, not have a friendly word, as he\u2019d criticised Boris Johnson for failing to do with the London Underground unions for eight whole years. Khan, mildly wrong-footed, said he found it \u201castonishing\u201d that \u201cthe workers\u201d were being blamed. From the ensuing verbal scrimmage the words \u201cmegaphone diplomacy\u201d and \u201casking assembly members to bat for you\u201d then emerged.</p> <p>For the record, Bacon says the \u201cconduit\u201d charge is \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. It\u2019s also worth adding that the RMT, unlike other London rail transport unions, is not tight buddies with Labour. But what matters much, much more than all of that - and on this, the consensus still holds - is that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/493754/dft-tfl-rail-prospectus.pdf\">rail devolution for south London</a> does indeed go ahead. The routes run by <a href=\"https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/\">Southeastern</a> (not to be confused with...), which happen to serve Bacon\u2019s Kent-ish Bexley and Bromley constituents, is scheduled to be the first part of a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/devolving_rail_services_to_london-final-report.pdf\">south London metro</a>\u201d to come under TfL\u2019s auspices, in 2018. </p> <p>That needs to pick up speed if the timetable is not to slip and if other franchises are to follow efficiently. Grayling is, obviously, the politician best placed to make that happen. Is his heart really in it? Is Khan\u2019s public lobbying helping or hindering?</p>",

They reveal internal emails that show connections between Wisconsin\u2019s Governor Scott Walker, his aides and wealthy donors \u2013 including Donald Trump. The contents are both depressingly predictable and outrageous.</p> <p>A union-backed recall bid vaulted Walker to national prominence in 2011, after he championed a notorious law stripping public sector unions of their collective bargaining rights. That successful campaign would go on to be a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign, and would probably be again if he runs in 2020.</p> <p>The documents comprise evidence compiled by prosecutors in a \u201cJohn Doe investigation\u201d into the Walker campaign and its network of allies looking into potential campaign finance violations. The focus of the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d inquiry (so named to protect subjects\u2019 anonymity while it was determined whether charges would be pressed) began in 2011, as Walker fought for his governorship in the recall election. In 2015 the Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=144525\">supreme court</a> stopped the investigation, saying the prosecutors had focused on people and groups \u201cwholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p>In 2011, the Walker campaign needed money fast and his team got to work. Kate Doner, the campaign\u2019s main fundraiser at the time, laid out her plan in an email that reads like a script from a bad movie. \u201cCorporations,\u201d she wrote. \u201cGo heavy after them to give.\u201d And then: \u201cTake Koch\u2019s money. Get on a plane to Vegas and sit down with Sheldon Adelson. Ask him for $1m now.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently Doner knows how to get results because a few months later, Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate, wired in $200,000 for the cause.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/wisconsin-promo/\" data-alt=\"wisconsin promo\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/wisconsin-promo/\">wisconsin promo</a> </figure>  <p>For a state-level election in Wisconsin, the campaign attracted a surprising number of national tycoons: hedge-fund billionaire Stephen Cohen gave $1m, Home Depot\u2019s Ken Langone chipped in $25,000, while hedge funder Paul Singer ponied up $250,000. \u201cPaul Singer: Grab him,\u201d Doner wrote in another email.</p> <p>The most stomach-churning example in the 1,500 pages is Harold Simmons, the owner of NL Industries \u2013 historically a major manufacturer of lead paint. The company faced millions of dollars in lawsuits over alleged lead poisoning of children.<br></p> <p>Simmons gave $750,000 in a series of payments to the third-party group prosecutors suspected of illegally coordinating with the Walker and Republican state senators\u2019 campaigns. The donations came as Walker and state senators were fighting the recall effort, and around the same time the Republican-controlled state senate took steps to pass legislation to effectively grant the industry legal immunity from lead poisoning claims (a federal court later struck the legislation down). To me, that looks like corporate pay-for-play.</p> <p>Walker knew Simmons\u2019 money was tainted. Campaign adviser Keith Gilkes, in an email to Walker, warned that the billionaire had successfully avoided paying millions in medical treatment for children who suffered from lead poisoning in Milwaukee, among other \u201cred flags\u201d. </p> <p>Politicians and their allies go to great lengths to hide their campaign finance dealings from public view \u2013 in this case they almost succeeded. David Prosser was one of the four conservative judges who approved the July 2015 ruling that ended the John Doe investigation.</p> <p>Some of the very emails Prosser wanted to destroy show how Walker\u2019s allies tried to secure his re-election to the supreme court \u2013 an outcome necessary to maintain its conservative bent and thus defend Walker\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>The influence money can buy has become an animating force in this year\u2019s presidential election, fueling the unlikely candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Both rejected the need to collect money from larger donors and corporations, Sanders with his $27 contributions and Trump with his personal wealth.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do,\u201d Trump, who is now soliciting contributions, once said of political donations.</p> <p>He surfaces in the John Doe documents for contributing $15,000 to the third-party group suspected of coordinating with Walker\u2019s campaign, following a 45-minute meeting with Walker at Trump\u2019s Fifth Avenue office.</p> <p>Trump may be an opportunistic charlatan, but he\u2019s tapping in to something real in voters. It\u2019s a rage born of disenchantment with today\u2019s democratic process. And these documents suggest that anger is valid.</p> <p>The US supreme court is expected to decide whether to intervene in the John Doe case later this month but it\u2019s unlikely to undo the problem it created. Exposing its injustice is a good first step.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Shaky! Should people be surprised that the biggest name in 80s chart-topping rockabilly pop has made an album of socially conscious, dark Americana?

Those campaigning for her swift release have been dealt a huge blow, but we remain undeterred in fighting for her safe return to Britain.</p> <p>Long periods of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s detention have taken place in solitary confinement in the high-security wing of the notorious Kerman and Evin prisons. Unsurprisingly, this has resulted in serious consequences for her physical condition. She has become increasingly frail and unable to walk. By preventing regular contact with family and legal representation, those holding her in Kerman have met the UN criteria for torture, and in doing so are breaching internationally accepted means of detention.</p> <p>This horrific contempt for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s human rights is compounded by the treatment of Gabriella. At just two years old, she was put through the trauma of being forcefully separated from her mother and has since had her passport confiscated.</p> <p>In June we celebrated Gabriella\u2019s third birthday outside the Iranian embassy, leaving a symbolic card and a balloon for Gabriella on their doorstep. She faces the prospect of being separated from her parents until she reaches at least seven years of age. This is no way for a child to grow up.</p> <p>Given that two British citizens, Nazanin and Gabriella, are being held captive in a foreign land, one would assume that the UK government is acting with urgency. It is not.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has provided little in the way of tangible action, mostly offering vague comments suggesting they are doing \u201ceverything possible\u201d.</p> <p>Tobias Ellwood, the Middle East minister, offers verbal reassurances, and the previous foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, told the House he had \u201craised the case a number of times, and (\u2026) subsequently followed that up with a letter\u201d. It is hardly the kind of action this case requires. It is not good enough.</p> <p>In light of the recent resumption of consular relations between Britain and Iran, it is surely fair to expect that the government will make full use of those services. They could begin by securing consular rights for all British citizens to stop this happening to innocent families in the future. But the specific circumstances surrounding Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s prosecution requires immediate clarification.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/nazanin-zaghari-richard-ratcliffe-iran-imprisoned\">The British family destroyed by the Iranian government: \u2018They\u2019re always looking to find a foreigner to frame\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government must call for regular consular access to Zaghari-Ratcliffe to check on her welfare. It is not enough for Iran to claim she is Iranian when they are clearly holding her as a bargaining chip in a developing relationship with Britain. Upgrading relations and encouraging more trade and visits without solving this issue of consular access and how dual nationals are used by Iran, clearly risks more families suffering Nazanin\u2019s fate. Our government must ultimately call for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s immediate release, or at the very least to face charges of an internationally recognisable criminal offence, and the ability to defend herself in fair proceedings.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people have joined the call for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s swift release, and from debates in the Commons it is clear that there is a coalition of politicians willing to support the government in taking action to redress cases such as hers. A crowded timetable means it can be difficult to give specific cases the parliamentary platform they deserve, but following her sentencing, the severity of her situation means we will continue to push for her plight to be heard.</p> <p>An appeal beckons, but given the secretive manner in which the Iranian judiciary conducts its affairs, any real hope for Zaghari-Ratcliffe lies in the British government deciding to stand up for one of its citizens. By remaining dormant in the face of this abuse of individual liberty, the government is failing to meet the standards that it regularly advocates to the international community at large.</p>",

That is why Jeremy Corbyn won today, handsomely. Theresa May may be entirely sincere in her desire to create more good schools, and her point about \u201cselection by house price\u201d is a good one, but Corbyn successfully highlighted some of the multiple flaws with her grammar policy. Where are the experts who back it? Why do FSM (free school meal) pupils in grammar-school Kent do so much worse than those in non-grammar London? Will pupils at grammar school feeder schools be guaranteed a place? How can segregation at 11 be justified? On all these questions, May couldn\u2019t provide an answer. It was easily her worst PMQs so far.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what I thought watching it in TV from my desk. Many of the journalists who tweet and report on PMQs watch it from press gallery in the chamber and they often get a different impression because they hear the actual noise levels (which can be much louder, and much more one-sided, than you would realise from just following it on TV). And they tell me what was striking was how little support May was getting from her own side. That\u2019s not because Tory MPs have suddenly gone all Corbynite; it\u2019s because many of them have serious reservations about grammar schools. On the basis of today\u2019s PMQs, and judging by what happened the last time Corbyn won a PMQs so clearly on an education matter (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/14/pmqs-corbyn-may-brexit-cannot-have-a-la-carte-access-to-single-market-eu-chief-says-politics-live?page=with:block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5#block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5\"> 12.26pm)</a>, the chances of May\u2019s plans being ditched, or having to be substantially amended, must be quite high.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T12:13:07.732Z\">at 1.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d93845e4b067ad300879bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T11:49:34.468Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My PMQs coverage normally leaves out <strong>Angus Robertson</strong>, the SNP leader, because he asks his questions as I\u2019m writing my snap verdict.

He asked May:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Does she agree with Mr Verhofstadt, the EU negotiator, and the Scottish government who want to protect Scotland\u2019s place in Europe?</p> </blockquote> <p>May responded by saying the Scots voted to stay in the UK two years ago.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s all very well him asking that question but only two years ago he didn\u2019t want to protect Scotland\u2019s place in the EU because he wanted Scotland to leave the Uk and on all of these questions - whether it\u2019s the q of the EU referendum, the referendum on independence on Scotland, the right honourable gentleman seems to think if he asks the same question all the time he\u2019ll get a different answer.

He was not flash (he never is), but his fourth question, where he spoke passionately about how wrong it was to separate children at 11, was powerful, and it was telling that towards the end Theresa May resorted to having to change the subject. Unlike last week May restricted her jokes to her final answer, but even her pay-off soundbite did not quite work. It was premised on the idea that this might be Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs.

It is about offering ladders to everyone. He quotes someone saying there is something hopeless about grammar schools, and the idea only some pupils can benefit. It was Cameron, he says, who said this.</p> <p>May says she wants a diversity of good provision. Good school places are important. Corbyn has still not welcomed the employment figures, she say. Labour would offer more taxation for working families.</p> <p>Corbyn welcomes anyone who can get a job. But there are now almost 1m people on zero-hours contracts. She quotes Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools. He said the idea the poor will benefit from grammar schools is \u201ctosh and nonsense\u201d. The Tory green paper addresses none of the problems in education, he says. Isn\u2019t this the case of a government heading backwards, to segregated schooling and second-class schooling for the many.</p> <p>May says some of Corbyn\u2019s facts were wrong. There are more teachers in schools. Corbyn has opposed all measures to improve schools, such as those on parent choice, and free schools. This may be Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs, she says.

It means censure or, to put it colloquially, a severe bollocking.</p> <p>If MPs are found to have broken parliament\u2019s rules, they can be suspended. Back in the eighteenth century parliament also had the power to imprison members of the public found to be in contempt (often reporters publishing reports that offended MPs). But that power is deemed to have lapsed.</p> <p>MPs could in theory summon someone to attend the Bar of the House of Commons (the bit marking the formal entrance to the chamber, not the place where they serve drinks) to be reprimanded in person. This happened to John Junor in 1957 when he was editor of the Sunday Express. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Junor\">Junor had written an article criticising MPs for their use of petrol allowances </a>(rationing still applied) and, although he apologised for the contempt, he did so without retracting his comment.</p> <p>In today\u2019s report the privileges committee said it considered summoning Myler and Crone to the Bar of the House. But it has not recommended that step - probably because the 1957 episode was seen at the time as a bit of a farce, and something that did not reflect well on MPs. It is also not clear what would happen if someone were summoned but refused to turn up.</p> <p>Instead what will happen is that MPs will debate the motion proposed by the privileges committee.

Associated correspondence and evidence is published on the internet.</p> <p> The report follows the referral to the Committee by the House of the Eleventh Report of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (Session 2010-12) which concluded that it has been misled by witnesses during its inquiries into phone-hacking. Based on the evidence and applying the standard of proof that the allegations must be significantly more likely than not to be true, the Committee of Privileges has found that:</p> <p> a) Mr Colin Myler misled the CMS Committee by \u201canswering questions falsely about [his] knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p>b) Mr Tom Crone misled the CMS Committee in 2009 by giving a counter impression of the significance of confidentiality in the Gordon Taylor settlement.</p> <p>c) Tom Crone misled the CMS Committee by \u201canswering questions falsely about [his] knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p> The Committee therefore finds Mr Myler (former editor of the News of the World) and Mr Crone (former legal manager at News International) to have been in contempt of the House.</p> <p> The Committee also found that:</p> <p> d) There is insufficient evidence to find that Tom Crone sought to mislead the CMS Committee about the commissioning of surveillance.</p> <p>e) The allegation that Les Hinton sought to mislead the CMS Committee as to the extent of the pay\u2010off to Clive Goodman and his own role in authorising the payments is not significantly more likely than not to be true.</p> <p>f) The evidence that Les Hinton misled the CMS Committee about the extent of his knowledge of allegations that phone\u2010hacking extended beyond Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire to others at the News of the World does not meet the standard of proof set for a finding of contempt.</p> <p>g) While the Culture, Media and Sport Committee was sceptical about Mr Hinton\u2019s memory, there is no evidence that he misled the Committee in relation to his role in the payment of legal fees or the fact that he authorised the payments to Mr Goodman to settle his Employment Tribunal claim.</p> <p>h) There is insufficient evidence of a breach of Parliamentary privilege on the part of NI (now News UK). NOTW was not a corporate body. As such, the Committee does not consider NI to have committed a contempt.</p> <p> The Committee recommends that the House be invited to agree a motion in the following terms:</p> <p> That this House\u2014</p> <p> i) approves the First Report from the Committee of Privileges;</p> <p> ii) having regard to the conclusions of the Committee in respect of Mr Colin Myler, considers that Mr Myler misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by answering questions falsely about his knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing, and therefore formally admonishes him for his conduct; and</p> <p> iii) having regard to the conclusions of the Committee in respect of Mr Tom Crone, considers that Mr Crone misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by giving a counter\u2010impression of the significance of confidentiality in the Gordon Taylor settlement and by answering questions falsely about his knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing, and therefore formally admonishes him for his conduct.</p> <p> The Committee also recommends that the Leader of the House take steps as soon as possible to address the issues identified by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 2013, particularly in respect of the penal powers of the House and select committees and contempt.</p> <p> The Government is expected to find an early date for debate on the Committee\u2019s report.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what it means.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Two very senior former News International executives, the former News of the World editor Colin Myler and the former News International legal manager Tom Crone, have been censured for misleading MPs when they gave evidence to the phone-hacking inquiry.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>A third executive, Les Hinton, the former News International chairman, has been cleared of misleading MPs - but only because the evidence did not meet a relatively high burden of proof.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>MPs are set to pass a motion censuring Myler and Crone.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>News International \u201cas a corporate body\u201d has not been found guilty of lying.</strong></li> <li><strong>The privileges committee is calling for an investigation into what can be done to punish witnesses who lie to select committees.

  "<p>In the wake of a victory that at once seemed extraordinary and inevitable, the Slovenian Football Association chief, Aleksander Ceferin, could not have been more matter-of-fact about the reasons behind his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/uefa-president-election-backroom-talks-michel-platini\" title=\"\">remarkable rise from relative obscurity</a> to one of the most powerful roles in football in less than six months.</p> <p>\u201cIt was my decision to run for presidency,\u201d he said, unsmiling but not nervous at facing the world\u2019s media following his 42-13 triumph over the far more experienced Dutch FA president, Michael van Praag. \u201cWhen I have seen there was so much support, it was much easier. For a new face to come to lead Uefa, it was the right time now.\u201d</p> <p>The official version of the 48-year-old\u2019s vertiginous rise begins with small gatherings of around 15 federations in eastern Europe in March at which they sought a candidate who could represent their interests, followed by a series of meetings on the fringes of the Fifa congress in Mexico City in May.</p> <p>Fearful of the power of the biggest European clubs and their lobbying strength, and concerned the Uefa executive committee did not always represent their interests, they swung behind Ceferin. As momentum grew, he also soon gathered the support of many of the Scandinavian countries, plus Italy, Germany and Russia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/slovenian-federation-leader-aleksander-ceferin-elected-uefa-president\">New Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin vows to review Champions League deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Uefa insiders said his success in winning them over was partly down to dissatisfaction with the other two candidates in the race \u2013 Van Praag and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/13/uefa-fifa-angel-villar-llona-2018-investigation\" title=\"\">controversial Spanish FA chief</a>, \u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Villar Llona, who withdrew this month \u2013 but also because he caught a prevailing mood.</p> <p>Inevitably, however, some wondered whether there were other factors in the patronage of Russia and the alleged support of Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, who insisted publicly he would be prepared to work with either candidate and after the vote railed that the idea he lobbied on Ceferin\u2019s behalf was an \u201cinsult\u201d to the voting members.</p> <p>Nor has it gone unnoticed that Tomaz Vesel, the new chair of Fifa\u2019s independent audit and compliance committee, is also a Slovenian who turned out for the same football team as Ceferin (who is, by all accounts, a decent&#xa0;player).</p> <p>Uefa, overseen for nine years by one of the greatest and most charismatic footballers of all time in Michel Platini, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/michel-platini-declares-clear-conscience-uefa-congress-speech\" title=\"\">who crashed to earth in a spectacular display of hubris</a>, has now turned to a little-known lawyer to lead it at one of the most turbulent periods in its history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/14/uefa-new-president-fifa-michel-platini-congress\">Uefa\u2019s new broom more reminiscent of Fifa\u2019s new dawn than a revolution | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even those who have spent time with him in Uefa meeting rooms \u2013 he is vice-chairman of the legal committee \u2013 say he is relatively sparing with his words. Initially, he plans to remain in Ljubljana, where his law firm is based, rather than moving to the smooth glass offices of Uefa on the shores of Lake Geneva.</p> <p>Ceferin has been president of the Slovenian FA since 2011 and local journalists say he is well regarded at home, not least for opening a new National Football Centre this year. The married father of three eventually became irritated with suggestions he was a nobody. \u201cI was never behind the scenes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should ask somebody behind the scenes. People trust me. Nobody behind the scenes can have 42 votes from all parts of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Ceferin has just a two-and-a-half-year mandate, owing to the untimely fall from grace of his predecessor, but insisted he would not be afraid to fight for the interests of smaller federations. All of which should make for an interesting dynamic.</p> <p>\u201cSome people may have said I\u2019m not a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can say that I\u2019m young and inexperienced but I honestly think it\u2019s disrespectful to all the presidents of small- and medium-sized federations who every year have to do more with less.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I know is that I\u2019m a team player, a man of conviction, a passionate man and a man of his word. I am not a showman and I\u2019m not a man of unrealistic promises.\u201d</p> <p>If true, that will mark him out as unusual in a world where talk is cheap but meaningful action is rare. While the Uefa members patted themselves on the back and politicked on the Athens riviera, inside their bubble there is still too little realisation of the low esteem in which they are held by the wider world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the questions over his speedy ascent up the greasy pole will only multiply. Ceferin, a black belt in karate who has traversed the Sahara five times (four by car and once on a motorbike), hinted he would employ the same tactics that had got him here to win re-election.</p> <p>Among other things, he vowed to stand up for the little guys by toughening up financial fair play rules and looking again at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/europe-top-four-leagues-guaranteed-four-automatic-champions-league-places\" title=\"\">new Champions League deal that favours Europe\u2019s aristocracy</a>. But he also insisted he would deliver greater transparency, term limits and a new compliance committee.</p> <p>As he did so, it was impossible not to think of the countless times those buzzwords had been tossed from podiums down the years by Sepp Blatter, Platini, Infantino and all those who had gone before and conclude that Uefa\u2019s new accidental leader could be judged only by his actions.</p>",

  "<p>The sun burned over the red rock spires of the Navajo Nation, where thousands of people gathered along a miles-long stretch of road for the tribe\u2019s annual parade on Saturday. Tucked away in the north-easternmost corner of Arizona, the cultural celebration has become something of a ritual for politicians seeking the support of the Navajo people.</p> <p>On one float, perhaps for the last time, Arizona\u2019s native son John McCain drew cheers as he passed. Not far behind, Ann Kirkpatrick, the three-term congresswoman from northern Arizona who is seeking to unseat him in the nation\u2019s marquee Senate race of the year, introduced herself to the crowd in Navajo, then in English. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/senate-women-democrats-majority-power\">Women poised to lead Democratic return to power in the Senate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At this stage, a victory for the Flagstaff congresswoman would be a stunning upset over McCain, who\u2019s survived in the Senate since 1987, when he succeeded Barry Goldwater.

McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and a party statesman, is by his <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-latinos-mccain-222810\">own</a> admission facing the \u201crace of my life\u201d with Kirkpatrick earning the distinction of being his toughest challenger yet. </p> <p>\u201cThis is among the most competitive races that we\u2019re looking at this cycle,\u201d said Lauren Passalacqua, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), which is helping Kirkpatrick organize and fundraise.<br></p> <p>Polling averages show McCain with a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/az/arizona_senate_mccain_vs_kirkpatrick-5455.html\">13-point lead</a>, though some <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/PPP_Arizona_June_2016.pdf\">surveys have</a> shown the race in a near tie.

She also readily admits to voting for Arizona\u2019s maverick \u2013 once, in 1998. </p> <p>Kirkpatrick is also battle-tested from running four grueling congressional races in eight years. She currently represents a district larger than the state of Iowa and significantly more diverse, which her campaign says gives her an organizational edge.</p> <p>\u201cThe timeline says a lot about the type of person Ann is,\u201d said Michael Frias, Kirkpatrick\u2019s former chief of staff. \u201cShe made the decision to run before the Trump phenomenon ... To make a boxing analogy, she decided to take on the champ, she is not waiting for the champ to retire.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br></h2> <p>Wearing moccasins and a large turquoise broach, Kirkpatrick zigzagged across the parade route, handing out campaign stickers and candy. She stopped often to chat with constituents, embracing those she knew personally. On more than one occasion the truck pulling her float paused for her to catch up.</p> <p>\u201cWe need fresh ideas!\u201d Kirkpatrick said into the microphone. \u201cFood stamps, general assistance, child care, Social Security, Access, Medicaid and Medicare, Indian health services funding, mental health services and tribal sovereignty. That\u2019s what this election is about. Ah\u00e9hee. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, McCain, wearing a Navy hat and a blazer, waved to the crowd from his campaign float, flanked by a security detail. Two Navajo code talkers rode with him. </p> <p>\u201cLook! It\u2019s John McCain,\u201d a woman squealed. He waved to her, and then turned to pose for a group taking his picture with their iPhones.</p> <p>Kirkpatrick readily admits her campaign\u2019s biggest challenge is to raise her public profile in the state. With less than 30 days to go before early voting begins , a new poll found 30.4% of likely Arizona voters did not know enough about Kirkpatrick to have an opinion of her. Only 7.8% of respondents said the same of McCain.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been running for 15 months and she\u2019s just now running ads to introduce herself to voters,\u201d said Jim Waring, a former McCain aide and and a state GOP senator. \u201cWith just 30 days before voting starts, I don\u2019t see how you close that gap.\u201d</p> <p>Her campaign is running statewide ads and ramping up outreach in the metropolitan areas outside her district, mainly Phoenix and Tucson. One new ad tells the story of Kirkpatrick\u2019s cowboy boots, which she bought with the money she earned working as a waitress in college and still wears. The boots are part of her \u201cArizona First\u201d campaign message, meant to draw a contrast with McCain, who she said represents Washington.</p> <p>McCain\u2019s delicate dance with his party\u2019s nominee is Kirkpatrick\u2019s greatest line of attack, and she\u2019s on the offensive. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere was a time when McCain was a maverick and a straight talker,\u201d Kirkpatrick said, counting herself among those who once supported the senator. She said his refusal to denounce Trump, especially after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">he questioned McCain\u2019s heroism in Vietnam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">insulted a Gold Star family</a>, shows that 30-plus years in Washington has changed the man who built a reputation as someone who challenges party orthodoxy. The senator was captured and tortured as a prisoner of war.</p> <p>\u201cPeople can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t stand up to Donald Trump when Donald Trump insulted him,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cPeople tell me, if he won\u2019t stand up for himself, he won\u2019t stand up for us.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats might be able to yoke some vulnerable Republican senators to Trump, but not McCain, says former Arizona senator Jon Kyl, a Republican who served alongside McCain. </p> <p>\u201cHis cake is pretty well baked,\u201d Kyl said of McCain\u2019s reputation in the state. \u201cThe big question \u2013 and the one that could make a difference \u2013 is whether Trump has an impact on who shows up to vote. \u201d</p> <p>Backlash to Trump has mobilized voter registration efforts in the state, especially among Latinos and young people who are more likely to register as Democrats or independents. Meanwhile, Clinton\u2019s campaign has sensed an opportunity to win the state for the first time in two decades. Her campaign recently opened two new field offices and is launching a six-figure ad-buy, while the DNC is <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/dnc-expands-footprint-arizona-georgia-utah-n641611\">growing its presence</a> in the state as well.</p> <p>Since winning their primary last month, McCain\u2019s campaign has trained its fire on Kirkpatrick, labeling her \u201ctoo liberal for Arizona\u201d while pitching himself as the state\u2019s best check against a liberal administration. </p> <p>\u201cAlthough she has spent her three unremarkable terms in Congress siding with her party bosses at every opportunity, Arizonans either don\u2019t know her or don\u2019t support her record of serving as a rubber stamp for the liberal establishment,\u201d said Lorna Romero, a spokeswoman for McCain\u2019s campaign, in an email. </p> <p>But liberal isn\u2019t how Kirkpatrick\u2019s constituents view her, says Fred Solop, a political scientist with Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, though he noted that with a fundraising powerhouse and sky-high name recognition, McCain can certainly drive the narrative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f93e339e0d3b5271b28f5433fe21a5df431e9c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f93e339e0d3b5271b28f5433fe21a5df431e9c2/0_28_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ann Kirkpatrick at a Navajo Nation parade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ann Kirkpatrick at a Navajo Nation parade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Ann Kirkpatrick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHer reputation in the district and her actual voting record are fairly moderate,\u201d Solop said. \u201cShe has worked across the aisle and has broken with the Obama camp on multiple occasions.\u201d </p> <p>From the sidelines of the parade route, Wilfred Segodi watched his children dive to catch the pieces of candy Kirkpatrick\u2019s team tossed as they passed.<br></p> <p>Segodi, a Democrat from Many Farms, Arizona, said he hadn\u2019t heard of Kirkpatrick before and planned to vote for McCain in November. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been there the longest,\u201d Segodi said matter-of-factly. \u201cWe know we can count on him.\u201d </p> <p>On the opposite side of the road, Danita Ryan, of Flagstaff, cheered enthusiastically for Kirkpatrick\u2019s float. Ryan said she was especially motivated to vote this year because of Trump, who she finds dangerous and offensive.Despite not knowing much about the Democrat, Ryan said she plans to vote for Kirkpatrick for one simple reason.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not John McCain,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for some new blood in Congress.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Meet the challenger</strong></h2> <p>Ann Kirkpatrick was born in 1950 in the small town of Whiteriver, part of the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation in eastern Arizona. </p> <p>Though her family is not of Native American ancestry, her parents both found work in Whiteriver and decided to stay and raise a family there. Her father ran the local general store and her mother taught public school. </p> <p>\u201cI thought I was Apache for a long time,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. Like the other children in her town, Kirkpatrick learned to ride a horse and speak Apache. She later learned Navajo and Mandarin and is conversational in Spanish, French and Greek.</p> <p>Growing up, Kirkpatrick said she never dreamed one day she might become a lawyer or legislator \u2013 and certainly not a US senator. \u201cI wanted to have 12 kids and be a mom,\u201d Kirkpatrick said sheepishly. \u201cI was told that girls don\u2019t go to college.\u201d</p> <p>But Kirkpatrick did go to college, at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and after a brief interlude working as a teacher, she returned for law school. After graduation, Kirkpatrick she became Coconino County\u2019s deputy county attorney, the first woman to hold the position. It\u2019s a distinction that would have resonance if she wins in November.</p> <p>Despite electing four female governors, Arizona has never sent a woman to the Senate \u2013 a fact Kirkpatrick said didn\u2019t cross her mind until after she entered the race. </p> <p>\u201cMy husband and I were on a long drive and I said: \u2018Has there been a woman senator in Arizona?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Well, your question is your answer.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 2004, Kirkpatrick said she hadn\u2019t considered politics when a group of friends and community leaders invited her to lunch and encouraged her to run for the state legislature. </p> <p>\u201cI never had thought about running for office,\u201d Kirkpatrick said, but her friends persisted. </p> <p>\u201cThey said: \u2018We know your background, we think you can bridge both cultures, can you run?\u2019\u201d she said, adding with a noticeable hint of pride: \u201cNobody thought I\u2019d win, but I did.\u201d</p> <p>Kirkpatrick seems to like playing the underdog. </p> <p>\u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been told I can\u2019t do things and I\u2019ve overcome all those obstacles,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. </p> <p>In 2008, she won her first congressional race, becoming the US representative for her district. Two years later, she lost in a rough-and-tumble race against Republican challenger, Paul Gosar, the congressman who made national headlines when he boycotted Pope Francis\u2019s address to lawmakers last year. </p> <p>The district was redrawn, and Kirkpatrick ran again in 2012. She won that race and returned to Capitol Hill. Not long after, she and Gosar traded rivalry for camaraderie. Together they teamed up on a handful of bills and earned the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/ann-kirkpatrick-paul-gosar-arizona-095651\">distinction</a> \u201coddest couple in Congress\u201d.</p> <p>In May 2015, Kirkpatrick surprised Arizona\u2019s political establishment when she announced she would challenge McCain in what would be his sixth and possibly last election.</p> <p>\u201cAnn loves Arizona \u2013 she is very kind and she\u2019s very warm,\u201d said Frias, her former chief of staff. \u201cBut anybody that doubts Ann\u2019s ability to stand up for herself and go toe to toe with anyone, including a sitting senator, is deeply underestimating her.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Concerns that British aid funding will be diverted away from supporting the world\u2019s poorest people towards facilitating trade have been raised by NGOs.</p> <p>In an article on Wednesday for the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3788162/My-fury-wasted-foreign-aid-International-development-secretary-Priti-Patel-pledges-major-overhaul-12billion-budget.html\">Daily Mail</a>, the new international development secretary Priti Patel announced that she would \u201cchallenge and change the global aid system\u201d and that her approach \u201cwill be built on some core Conservative principles: that the way to end poverty is wealth creation, not aid dependency; that wealth is ultimately created by people, not by the state; that poor countries need more investment and trade, not less\u201d.</p> <p>But NGOs have pointed out in response that the priority for aid in the UK has always been the alleviation of poverty and the support of the poorest groups in society, and that the UK\u2019s aid funding was already carefully targeted towards that end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/14/priti-patel-plans-foreign-aid-overhaul-based-on-core-tory-values\">Priti Patel plans foreign aid overhaul based on 'core Tory values'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Patel\u2019s article was \u201cchallenging reading\u201d said Aaron Oxley, executive director of campaign group Results UK. \u201cVirtually all UK aid money is already spent incredibly well on high-impact activities that are focused on eliminating poverty and have a proven track record of delivering results,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe first priority of UK aid must be to end poverty and leave no one behind, not to oil the wheels of British business,\u201d said Loretta Minghella, chief executive of Christian Aid. \u201cIncreased trade supported by the aid budget ought to benefit the poorest most, not those who already prosper.\u201d</p> <p>Minghella added that the Conservative government must start by cleaning up the UK\u2019s own backyard when it comes to corruption. \u201cTax dodging and embezzlement drain poorer countries of much-needed revenues for essential services like health and education and this is facilitated by global networks of corruption which even touch the UK\u2019s own shores,\u201d she said. \u201cAmong the worst offenders are the UK\u2019s overseas territories like the British Virgin Islands, which featured so heavily in the Panama Papers.\u201d Patel\u2019s commitment to transparency needs to be taken to the foreign office, said Minghella, which hasn\u2019t been awarded <a href=\"http://ati.publishwhatyoufund.org/donor/ukdfid/\">top ratings</a> yet.</p> <p>When economies boom, people are left behind, said Tanya Barron, chief executive of Plan International, and \u201call too often, this is girls and young women\u201d. She added: \u201cIn recent years DfID [the UK\u2019s Department for International Development] has been a global leader in ensuring that girls and young women are protected from violence and exploitation so that they can fulfil their potential. This sort of work too is critical to achieve our aim of a just, stable and prosperous world.\u201d</p> <p>Oxley added that proof of Patel\u2019s commitment to development will become apparent later this week as a conference to announce the <a href=\"http://international.gc.ca/world-monde/campaign-campagne/gfatm-fmstp/replenishment-conference-reconstitution.aspx?lang=eng\">replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria</a> is happening in Montreal. \u201cThe UK has historically been a big donor to the Global Fund precisely because it gets results and is constantly working to improve its impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to seeing a strong pledge from the UK that will directly contribute to saving millions of lives and help end these epidemics for good.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/05/tb-kills-three-people-every-minute-the-world-must-wake-up-to-this-pandemic\">France has pledged $1.08bn</a> (\u00a30.82bn), but the UK is yet to donate.</p> <p>\u201cUK aid is respected throughout the world as being among the most effective and most scrutinised,\u201d said Ben Jackson, chief executive of Bond, which represents NGOs in the UK. \u201cWe would welcome the opportunity to discuss with the secretary of state the ways in which aid can be delivered in the most effective way possible, to help the poorest people.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Scrivener, policy officer at Global Justice Now, hopes that Patel reconsiders her views. \u201cAid is not perfect,\u201d said Scrivener. \u201cBut that is no excuse for Priti Patel to divert money meant to help the poor into supporting multinationals in the name of free trade and the UK national interest. Nor should she be using it to pander to the tabloids\u2019 anti-immigrant agenda.\u201d</p> <p>ActionAid\u2019s director of policy, Alison Holder, said that the best way to achieve development is \u201cthrough supporting long-term change through education, fair reform of global tax and trade rules, resilience building, and by supporting people to take control of their own lives that can help communities to build their own futures, free from aid\u201d.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>David Attenborough has urged the government to use Brexit to better protect the UK\u2019s nature and wildlife.</p> <p>\u201cLike it or not Brexit has happened. All agriculture and environment treaties for nature and wildlife will have to be rethought. It\u2019s a great opportunity to refine the legislation to match our part of the world,\u201d he told conservationists at the launch of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/one-in-10-uk-wildlife-species-faces-extinction-major-report-shows\">2016 State of Nature report</a>. </p> <p>The report, compiled by more than 50 conservation organisations including the RSPB, the National Trust, the Marine Conservation Society and the Natural History Museum, showed that Britain was one of the world\u2019s most \u201cnature-depleted countries\u201d, with more than <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/sep/14/2016-state-of-nature-report-wildlife-winners-and-losers-in-pictures\">one in 10 wildlife species</a> threatened with extinction.</p> <p>\u201cThe report is very important. Our wonderful nature is in serious trouble and it needs our help as never before. This document produces facts and figures. We are living at a time of climate change so we need to know what is happening to wildlife. It gives us a huge opportunity. I hope we can take it,\u201d said Attenborough. </p> <p>Andrea Leadsom, in one of her first speeches as environment secretary at the same event, made no reference to nature protection after Britain leaves the EU, or the birds, habitats and other directives which have been the backbone of British conservation for 40 years. </p> <p>\u201cI want a 25-year plan for the environment, a truly long-term vision that sets the direction for future policy. We will publish a framework setting out a game-changing approach,\u201d she said at the event. </p> <p>She added: \u201cFollowing our decision to leave the EU, we now have a unique opportunity to develop a set of policies tailored to the needs of the United Kingdom, our species and our habitats.\u201d </p> <p>Leadom said the report showed the scale of the challenge facing Britain\u2019s environment but said there was much to celebrate. \u201cWe have truly ambitious plans to transform our approach to the environment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added that government would use big data and new technology \u201cto tackle old problems in different ways\u201d.</p> <p> Conservationists said the report was shocking, showing that modern agricultural techniques had had a major, negative impact on wildlife.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasing agricultural production has fundamentally changed the countryside. The report shows that we do not have a green and pleasant land. We have little more than green concrete yet we have come to accept it,\u201d said Trevor Dines, a botanist with the NGO Plantlife. </p> <p>\u201cThe pendulum has swung too far towards production. Big agriculture has won,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Guy Smith, National Farmers Union vice president, denied that farming was to blame for the dramatic wildlife declines recorded in the report. \u201cWhen farmers go out their front doors, and they see their farms, and they see lots of wildlife, and then they open up the newspapers and see the RSPB painting some lurid picture of a countryside with no birds, or bees, or mammals in it, they just get a bit depressed. There are many species that are not declining. All we say is, \u2018just change the record, please\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that mystifies us about this is that there has been no intensification of agriculture in the last 25 years,\u201d he told the BBC. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/04/national-trust-calls-for-complete-reform-of-british-farm-subsidies\">National Trust calls for complete reform of British farm subsidies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Caroline Drummond, chief executive of Leaf, a pressure group linking farming with the environment, said: \u201cWhilst this data is compelling, we do not feel it represents the whole picture.

In the past, Stanford and other business schools have run similar programs to help elevate women and other underrepresented groups in the business world. But the research shows that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/10/lgbt-diversity-business-equality-burberry-christopher-bailey\">LGBT community needs a similar boost</a> on the journey to the C-suite.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/29/caesars-entertainment-las-vegas-marriage-equality-lgbt-rights\">Why I decided to be honest about being gay at work \u2013 after my boss outed me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I spent most of my career as a television journalist. I remember repeated assignments where I was sent to \u201cget the other side\u201d of a story related to LGBT issues. During one particular on-camera interview, a state lawmaker who opposed gay marriage talked about the \u201csins\u201d of gay people. As she spoke, I reached into my pocket and felt something that didn\u2019t belong there. Without looking, I realized that my young son had slipped a small toy car into my pocket before I left for work. While the lawmaker explained that my family was not entitled to the same civil rights heterosexuals enjoy, I could grasp in my fingertips a concrete reminder of how ordinary my family was. </p> <p> My partner and I wonder how to get our son to eat more vegetables, and we worry about saving for college, just like most families. The public has made tremendous strides in recent years in how it perceives my family and the LGBT community in general. Many US laws have changed, too. Same-sex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court\">couples can marry</a>. In some places, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/07/same-sex-adoption-rights-supreme-court-unanimously-overturns-alabama-ruling\">they can adopt children as a couple</a>. The headlines show the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/business-protest-anti-lgbt-laws-mississippi-north-carolina\">LGBT community is at a turning point</a>. But the less conspicuous story may be that there is still more work to be done. While Apple\u2019s Tim Cook may be the world\u2019s most high-profile openly gay CEO, most of us would have a tough time naming another.</p> <p>The business case for diversity, though, is real. <a href=\"https://doc.research-and-analytics.csfb.com/docView?document_id=x695480&amp;serialid=u0qj22TwXJAwyF%2FreBXW%2FeSFdVyYwRIZQGZP1IAumTo%3D\">Researchers at Credit Suisse </a>found that companies with openly gay staff working in high level positions outperformed other companies by 3%. Yet Credit Suisse also found that up to 41% of LGBT workers in the US and 72% of senior LGBT executives have not come out openly at work. Even at companies with protective policies in place, employees are reluctant to reveal that they are LGBT. Something is holding people back.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.outnowconsulting.com/media/13505/Report-SMTBC-Feb15-V17sm.pdf\">study of more than 100,000 LGBT people</a> released in 2015 by OutNow, a Dutch LGBT marketing group, sheds more light. OutNow found that some 24% of lesbians, 30% of gay men, 40% of bisexuals and 55% of transgender people surveyed in the US believed that coming out could impact future promotions at work. And for some, it\u2019s not just about scoring a promotion \u2013 it might be about keeping the jobs they have. In the US, there are 30 states where you can be legally fired solely for being LGBT; only <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/state_maps\">20 states have passed legislation banning employment discrimination against LGBT workers</a>. So unless a company has carved out an explicit anti-discrimination policy, LGBT people can lose their jobs in three out of every five jurisdictions in the US, simply for being who they are. There is clearly more work to do.</p> <p>At Stanford, over many conversations with dozens of high-achieving LGBT people, we discussed our own experiences in the workplace. Many said they had been passed up for a promotion, despite impressive performance reviews. The reason they were given was often a so-called \u201clack of executive presence\u201d. While we all search for answers when we don\u2019t get the big promotion, many in our class felt that being a part of the LGBT community played a role in how they were perceived and whether they advanced in their careers. We need to get to a place where our abilities as leaders are judged solely based on our ideas and our business acumen, not our sexuality or our gender identity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/06/silicon-valley-diversity-problem-tech-industry-solutions\">These five tech companies are trying to solve Silicon Valley's diversity problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Research shows that some people do harbor prejudices against their LGBT coworkers, despite what may be the best of intentions. For example, a 2014 survey from the Human Rights Campaign found that <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-study-shows-majority-of-lgbt-workers-closeted-on-the-job\">80% of heterosexual people polled believe that LGBT people should \u201cnot have to hide\u201d</a> who they are at work. However, less than half of those same people said they would feel comfortable hearing LGBT coworkers talk about their social lives, dating or a related subject. Perhaps that was why, among the LGBT people also polled by HRC, 53% said they hadn\u2019t come out at work. And 25% of them reported hearing their coworkers make negative comments such as, \u201cThat\u2019s so gay\u201d at the office.</p> <p>I now work as a public relations director at PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC was the first of the Big Four accounting firms to <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/diversity/pwc-glbt-inclusion.html\">create a GLBT Partner Advisory Board</a>, which advises firm leadership on LGBT issues, including employee benefits. The firm hosts a biannual summit for LGBT employees to network, hear from guest speakers and hone leadership skills. Certainly, being LGBT doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019re a good manager, but it\u2019s important to create environments where equal opportunity exists.</p> <p>My classmates and I left the program in August feeling a profound connection to each other and a responsibility to those who will follow. While I have been out for many years, I left Stanford knowing I need to do more. I need to not only be out, but also visible to help less experienced LGBT employees find their way in the work force. </p> <p>Many recent college graduates who identify as LGBT say they were out in college, but returned to the closet when they began their careers. When I thought about being powerful in business school, I hadn\u2019t fully considered what that power meant. I now realize I can use that power not just to improve my organization, but to work toward a future when LGBT employees know that nothing is holding them back. <br></p> <p><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Two years ago, at a Democratic fundraiser in Seattle, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/22/remarks-president-dnc-event-seattle-wa\">President Obama spoke</a> of \u201cthe sense that around the world the old order isn\u2019t holding and we\u2019re not quite yet to where we need to be in terms of a new order that\u2019s based on a different set of principles\u201d. To be clear, he was talking about Ukraine and Syria and Israel, not about fashion week. But as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/feb/24/top-10-amazing-facts-you-didnt-know-about-coco-chanel\">Coco Chanel</a> so wisely remarked, fashion reflects the world we live in, and Obama\u2019s words are as true of the current state of the fashion industry as they are of international relations. In fashion as in politics, the system is outmoded, the establishment is at breaking point, the mood is fractious and unrest is in the air.</p> <p>This sounds a grandiose starting point from which to debate See Now, Buy Now, the trend to ditch fashion\u2019s six-month lead time and synchronise catwalk shows with store deliveries. But See Now, Buy Now is a crucial tipping point, at which the impact of technology, globalisation and democratisation on the fashion industry is felt not just by buyers in the retail industry sense, but by buyers in the me-and-you-on-a-Saturday-afternoon sense.</p> <p>On Monday evening, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/burberrygroup\">Burberry</a> stage their London fashion week catwalk show, it will break with a format that has held for more than half a century. This will not be a trailer for clothes that will go on sale six months later, but a starting gun for a collection designed to be bought, and worn, immediately. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/10/paul-smith-design-museum-exhibition\">Paul Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford\">Tom Ford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/05/hilfiger-tommy-30-anniversary\">Tommy Hilfiger</a>, among others, are adopting the same model.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/11/new-double-role-at-burberry-may-be-better-fit-for-christopher-bailey\">Christopher Bailey</a>, who as president and chief creative officer at Burberry is at the forefront of the change, calls See Now, Buy Now \u201can ongoing evolution\u201d. The word evolution is interesting, because when the world is in a period of rapid change, Darwin\u2019s process of natural selection goes into fast forward. Take the case of the peppered moth in the Industrial Revolution. At the beginning of the 19th century, the peppered moth was light with dark spots. When the atmosphere in London became filled with soot, the white trees became darker and the lighter coloured moths were more visible to birds. Within a few decades, the moths had evolved to become darker. In the same way, in our era of technological revolution, instant gratification has become the new normal and slow-moving fashion houses look suddenly vulnerable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98f7b1f96db72315e13c299da1d4ab7fdc1286bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98f7b1f96db72315e13c299da1d4ab7fdc1286bf/0_0_2448_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion shows will no longer be teasers for products that you can buy in six months time, but instead, they will be the starting gun for selling a new collection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"952\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fashion shows will no longer be teasers for products that you can buy in six months time, but instead, they will be the starting gun for selling a new collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Clym Evernden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The messy and confusing phase the fashion industry finds itself in while See Now, Buy Now is in this experimental period need not concern us here. In the end, the success or failure of the concept will be determined not by whether it is convenient for those in the industry, but whether it delivers for the consumer. At first glance, this seems a no-brainer. You see a look you want on the catwalk, you can buy it straight away. Yay! Right? Except it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. The grand, sweeping narrative of fashion \u2013 the lyrical view, which says that we crave full skirts in times when we yearn for old-fashioned values, or that hemlines get higher when economic confidence goes up \u2013 has traditionally been a folktale woven together in the months after the catwalk season, and presented as a delicious, page-turning big reveal in magazines and shop windows at the moment those collections go on sale. If fashion is reduced to clicking-to-buy on a new pair of boots, will this romantic element be lost?</p> <p>Not necessarily. The runaway success of the box set proves that storytelling can survive \u2013 even thrive \u2013 when an audience consume episodes at their own pace. Primetime slots no longer have the significance they once did, but TV is in a golden age nonetheless. The same could prove true of fashion and catwalk shows.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like the idea of seasonal trends is antiquated already,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/21/business-of-fashion-imran-amed-blogging\">Imran Amed</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/\">Business of Fashion</a>. The two-season model, designed around \u201cautumn/winter\u201d and \u201cspring/summer\u201d as two opposite wardrobes is outmoded in an era of air conditioning, of mass-market long-haul travel, and of a global economy. \u201cWhen we are designing a collection, we are not just creating it for people who live in one climate, one culture, or one way of thinking,\u201d Bailey says. Or as Zach Duane, CEO of Victoria Beckham, puts it, \u201cWhose autumn/winter are we talking about, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>The twice-yearly trend roundup is dead, and in its place has arrived an ongoing \u201cdigital campfire\u201d where stories are shared, embellished, made into myth. Social media has been key to this \u2013 \u201cThe reader has got used to seeing new trends every single day,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/01/lorraine-candy-editor-elle\">Lorraine Candy</a>, Elle\u2019s editor-in-chief \u2013 but the rising influence of menswear within fashion has had an impact, too. Womenswear and menswear are increasingly shown together on the catwalk, with the result that an industry that was once divided into a girls\u2019 school and a boys\u2019 school, and only met at parties, is now integrated. This has brought elements of menswear culture into mainstream fashion, and in particular a more drip-feed notion of trend. As Fiona Firth, buying director at <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/\">Mr Porter</a>, says, \u201cMenswear is an evolution from one season to the next, so the trends follow suit, and do not change dramatically seasonally.\u201d</p> <p>See Now, Buy Now is \u201cabsolutely logical\u201d for the huge brands who can afford to make a big noise with their shows, Duane says. \u201cIf you are spending millions of pounds promoting a collection, why on earth would you be doing that six months before it hits store, when you could drive desire at the moment it goes on sale?\u201d But if those brands can utilise the new model to amplify their voice, will that be at the expense of smaller labels, whose point of view will get drowned out? And if fashion becomes more commercial at the expense of experimentation \u2013 is the consumer not, in the end, the loser? If catwalk collections are a direct showcase of, rather than a teaser for, the clothes that will go in store, then it seems logical that the catwalks will be more wearable. \u201cI am the first to raise my hand and say I don\u2019t want to watch a bunch of trenchcoats and T-shirts on the runway,\u201d Amed says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? But smart brands will figure out a way to make the show interesting to the audience.\u201d Candy sees a positive in catwalk shows becoming truer representations of the clothes on the shopfloor. \u201cWe always want to shoot things that will actually be in the shops, and in this system that can be a struggle. So actually, I think it\u2019s quite a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>The most immediate impact of See Now, Buy Now on fashion will be on what you see rather than on what you buy. The details of timing are, in the big picture, less significant than the fact that the catwalk-as-trade-show is almost defunct; the modern catwalk show is an event for the wider fashion audience. This can be literal \u2013 as at Givenchy\u2019s S/S 16 New York show, where 800 seats were reserved for the public \u2013 or virtual, as in the Chanel shows\u2019 visual spectaculars which are instantly magnified through Instagram to reach an audience of millions. The model that triumphs will be the one that best pleases the global fashion audience. The industry is in upheaval, but the oldest adage in business still holds. The customer is always right.</p>",
  "<p>When she regained consciousness, Nidhi Chaphekar was lying on the floor of Zaventem airport in Brussels, across the room from the bird-shaped statue she had been standing near a few moments before. She tried to open her eyes, but her body wasn\u2019t doing what she wanted it to. Around her was a haze of thick black smoke, which was making her light-headed. She could hear her own internal voice, saying: \u201cNidhi, you\u2019re alive. Nidhi, it was a bomb. Nidhi, you have to tell your family. The children have exams. Nidhi, come on, get up.\u201d</p> <p>It was 22 March, the day that suicide bombers Ibrahim el-Bakraoui and Najim Laachraoui <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brussels-attacks\">attacked Zaventem airport in the Belgian capital</a> together with a third man identified by prosecutors as Mohamed Abrini, who is now awaiting trial on terrorism charges. An hour later, el-Bakraoui\u2019s younger brother Khalid set off a bomb at Maelbeek metro station on Rue de la Loi. It was the deadliest act of terrorism in Belgian history, and the government declared three days of national mourning. Isis claimed responsibility for the attacks, which killed 32 people and injured more than 300 others, including Chaphekar, a 41-year-old cabin manager for the Indian airline Jet Airways, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/23/the-photograph-that-has-come-to-define-horrors-of-brussels-attacks\">whose photograph became a symbol of the horror of that day</a>.</p> <p>On level two of the departures area of the airport, Chaphekar lay still. Her body was weak, and she was scared that she would be shot if gunmen were still nearby. She pushed herself up and looked around for help in the smoke. Her broken wristwatch was frozen at 8.07am local time, the exact moment the bomb hit her. She called out \u2013 \u201cExcuse me\u201d \u2013 still polite in distress, but there was no reply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dfd868e397b2f72d8d91ab2b583da05c0187300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dfd868e397b2f72d8d91ab2b583da05c0187300/0_79_4464_2679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chaphekar at home in Mumbai: \u2018I do believe it was destiny, that it was supposed to happen to me.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chaphekar at home in Mumbai: \u2018I do believe it was destiny, that it was supposed to happen to me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atul Loke/ Panos Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She turned back to see the distance she had been flung. \u201cEverything was shattered \u2013 the ceiling, the pillars, the counters, the baggage, oh my God,\u201d she recalls, in her home in a suburb of Mumbai in India. \u201cI gave up. I thought I won\u2019t be able to do it. I thought: \u2018Nidhi, you lie down.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A policeman ran past. Chaphekhar called for help. \u201cHe said: \u2018Lady, are you fine?

Her shoe had melted into her foot, her hair was burned and her face was streaked with blood. What worried her most was that she had lost all feeling in her legs. \u201cIt was as if they weren\u2019t there at all. I lifted one leg and put it on the arm rest, to put pressure on it. My foot was totally open like that,\u201d she says, turning her foot to one side to show where a piece of metal had struck it and fractured the bone.</p> <p>She looked down at her body for her staff lanyard, thinking she could use it to tie up her foot. \u201cAt that time, I saw I didn\u2019t have my clothes on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Video about a survivor of the Brussels terror attack\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F561996910654743%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Nearby, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3506021/Photographer-caught-blast-came-took-looked-make-sure-legs-took-iconic-picture-dazed-survivors.html\">Ketevan Kardava, a Georgian journalist</a>, had just recovered from the shock of the blast herself. She picked up her camera to start documenting the scene. Chaphekar was one of the first victims she saw, and within minutes, her photograph was being shared on Twitter. Soon news websites and television channels started picking it up. The following day, it was carried on front pages around the world. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know someone had taken my picture,\u201d says Chaphekar. \u201cI was worried only about my bleeding.\u201d</p> <p>Chaphekar had started the day as she always did, buttoning up the yellow jacket of her uniform and sipping her cappuccino before taking the 7.40am crew bus from the Holiday Inn hotel to the airport to prepare for a flight to Newark, New Jersey, later that day. Too impatient to wait for the lift with the rest of her crew, she and a colleague, Amit Motwani, took the escalator. Just as they reached the Olivier Strebelle statue on the second floor, the first bomb exploded somewhere in the distance. Thinking the sound had come from a broken wheelchair battery or air conditioner, Chaphekar\u2019s first instinct was to run towards the explosion to help. Motwani held her back. \u201cI said: \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019 He said: \u2018No, wait.\u2019 I said: \u2018Amit!\u2019 He said: \u2018Wait.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She turned to the right and heard a man scream so loud that she thought he must be dying. She turned left and took six or seven steps when her foot hit something hard. \u201cIt was like, <em>boom</em>,\u201d she says, making a low, deep sound. \u201cAnd I flew like a football. It was like lightning \u2026 as if you\u2019re put very close to the sun.

Doctors found shards of metal all over her body, the biggest a 2.5in (6.35cm) piece lodged in her foot. Another had entered her eye. The skin of her face and hands had been burned and would need grafts from her thighs. The sound of the blast made a hole in her eardrum, and a loud hum inside her head still causes migraines.</p> <p>When the stretchers came, they took her to an airport garage, where patients were being triaged. \u201cThey started putting tags on everyone, and we knew that was for priority. Severe first, normal later, mild last. I was trying to see which tag they had put on me. The paramedics came and cut open my trousers and saw I had deep wounds. So they put on another tag. I couldn\u2019t see the tags because they\u2019d fallen to one side. I was trying to see, and I didn\u2019t know which was the higher priority one, so I put them both on my chest.\u201d</p> <p>While they were there, one of the staff suddenly pulled down the shutters of the entrance and lay on the ground. The room went quiet. \u201cI asked him what had happened and he said sshhh,\u201d she says, putting a finger to her lips. \u201cI closed my eyes and started praying to God, thinking maybe it\u2019s time for the last wish now.\u201d</p> <p>A bomb disposal unit had sprung into action as soon as the first explosion happened. They couldn\u2019t prevent the second bomb \u2013 the one that hit Chaphekar \u2013 but they had managed to find a third by looking through CCTV footage, and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-belgium-blast-third-idUSKCN0WO2EU\">quickly evacuated the surrounding area to carry out a controlled explosion</a>. In the garage turned triage room, the medical attendant got the all-clear. He rolled up the garage shutters again, so paramedics and doctors could continue to help victims.</p> <p>From there, Chaphekar was taken to hospital in Antwerp and then airlifted to the Grande Hospital de Charleroi, about 30 miles south of Brussels. \u201cIn the [hospital] room, the whole team jumped on to me. \u2018Any pain here in the abdomen?\u2019 The doctors were checking my chest. I said: \u2018No, no.\u2019 I asked the nurse: \u2018Is my face burned?\u2019 She looked at me and said: \u2018Why?\u2019 I said: \u2018My job.\u2019 Because I knew, beauty is required, to be perfect is required, being physically, mentally fit is required. I didn\u2019t want to be someone who was dependent on anyone else.</p> <p>\u201cI gave my name, date of birth.

He cried at her bedside but she didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>It took two days for her to remember who she was and what had happened to her. When it suddenly came back, one morning around 10.30am, it was outside visiting hours, and she told the medical attendant she needed to see her family immediately, that she had been in a terrorist attack at Zaventem airport. \u201cHe said: \u2018Yes, your family are all here, they\u2019ve been here for a month.\u2019 That\u2019s when I realised how long I\u2019d been out.\u201d</p> <p>The hospital phoned her husband. He was on a bus, which he immediately got off to go to the hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s when I cried, not because of what I\u2019d gone through, but because I\u2019d put everyone through so much trouble. I was feeling very bad. My husband asked me: \u2018Do you know how we came to know that you were OK?\u2019 I said no. He said: \u2018Your picture was uploaded and it was a viral picture.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For eight or nine hours after the attack, Chaphekar\u2019s family had no idea which hospital she was in. The image of her, injured but alive, gave them hope. \u201cWhen I saw the picture, I saw the trauma I had gone through, the shock I had experienced,\u201d she says. \u201cI was recollecting the other people around me. How helpless they were, how helpless I was feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Millions saw that image of Chaphekar, the victim whose face -captured the collective trauma and shock of the day. When she looks back at it now, in her living room in -Mumbai, Chaphekar has mixed feelings. \u201cSo many pictures were taken on that day, but somehow only mine was circulated as it showed everything \u2013 the -circumstances, the panic, the trauma.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian was one of many newspapers to feature the picture on the front page. Chaphekar partly feels editors should have been more careful about how they used it. \u201cBeing a lady \u2026 this picture should have been blurred, cropped. Some media people have put it on the front page, the full page. When I saw that, I felt a little low. It doesn\u2019t look nice. It\u2019s not just adults reading the newspaper, it\u2019s children too. And especially my children. I was worried somebody would say: \u2018Look at your mom, don\u2019t you feel ashamed?\u2019 But nobody has said that. Everybody said: \u2018Your mom is so brave. She\u2019s like a tigress.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On 20 April, a week after she woke up in her hospital bed, Chaphekar asked to see her face for the first time since the incident. The nurse gave her a mirror and said: \u201cYou\u2019re looking better, don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e1775910d395e5d8bc7e49ec5524fbc55962f3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e1775910d395e5d8bc7e49ec5524fbc55962f3b/166_0_4980_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Her burned hand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Her burned hand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Nidhi Chaphekar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen she showed my face to me, I was just wondering: \u2018Is it me?\u2019 I was looking into the mirror and the nurse said: \u2018Are you fine?\u2019 I nodded and said yes. Then my sister and her husband came to see me, and she read my face. She said: \u2018What happened?\u2019 I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to live.\u2019 My sister said: \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 I said: \u2018I saw my face. And it has big patches and deep cuts, and who would look at me? My kids, my husband, my organisation, they\u2019ll say, now you\u2019re not a normal person.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her sister consoled her. \u201cShe said, people don\u2019t look up to someone because of their beauty, they look up to strength. And you have shown strength. People are with you.\u201d</p> <p>To prove it, she arranged for Chaphekar to speak to her kids on a video call. \u201cI was worried [about their reaction], but they saw me, and they said: \u2018Yay, our mummy\u2019s back.\u2019 And I realised it didn\u2019t matter to them.\u201d</p> <p>Chaphekar started setting herself small goals. She asked the nurses if she could clean her body herself. She started tying her own bandages. One day, when her legs were better, the doctor asked her to try taking a couple of steps. \u201cIf he said take two steps, I did five or six.\u201d</p> <p>Her determination was no surprise to Chaphekar\u2019s family. Even as a young woman, she had never been the type to give up hope. She had wanted to fly, but when she realised she didn\u2019t have the right qualifications to be a pilot, she bought herself a dress and interviewed for a job as a flight attendant. The talented athlete and beauty pageant queen, who married for love and against her parents\u2019 wishes, worked her way up to cabin manager at Jet Airways.</p> <p>Her childhood also bred resilience. She was raised in the village of Rajasansi, near an airport in the north Indian state of Punjab, she recalls one incident during the Sikh uprising in the 1980s when armed men ransacked her house and put a gun to her head. She was only 12.

  "<p>A new school year is starting for students in some countries, but education isn\u2019t a given for all children around the world \u2013 especially girls. Some 62 million girls between ages six and 15 are missing school, according to the World Bank.<br></p> <p>In the face of such worrying statistics, global health and government leaders took action to keep girls learning in northeastern Pakistan\u2019s Punjab state. In the mid-2000s, data showed that only about one-quarter of girls enrolled in middle school. Beyond that, poor girls\u2019 educations were linked to increases in child marriage and teen pregnancy, as detailed in the book <a href=\"http://millionssaved.cgdev.org/case-studies/punjabs-female-school-stipend-program\" rel=\"nofollow\">Millions Saved: New Cases of Success in Global Health</a>.

So the Punjabi government tried a new tactic to keep girls in the classroom and away from early marriages: paying their families.</p> <p><strong>Can money fix it?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/pakistan-womens-rights-activists-cry-fowl-girls-poultry-lessons\">Pakistan women\u2019s rights activists cry fowl over girls\u2019 poultry lessons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Punjab, leaders employed a tactic that\u2019s part of a larger global health strategy: conditional cash transfers (CCTs). Typically provided by government or nonprofit groups, CCTs give money to vulnerable people in exchange for those people taking certain actions \u2013 such as sending children to school or regularly seeing a doctor. <a href=\"http://www.icrw.org/sites/default/files/publications/IMPACCT_CCTBrief_webready.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CCTs</a> came into practice in places like Bangladesh in the 1980s. Many developing countries, including <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24556/K8731.pdf?sequence=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malawi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/health-revolution/video/2016/jun/14/kenyan-children-oprhans-cash-transfers-vulnerable-caretaker\">Kenya</a>, have started using them, and US metropolitan areas like New York City and Memphis have also tried the transfers.</p> <p>As part of major education reforms in 2003, Pakistan introduced the Female School Stipend Program (FSSP). The program offers 600 rupees, equal to $10 (US dollars), per academic quarter for families of schoolgirls in grades 6 to 10 who lived in one of 15 target districts with low literacy rates. The girls had to attend classes at least 80% of the time to receive the stipend. By 2014, the FSSP covered 393,000 pupils. </p> <p>A cost-effective global health program like this, says George Washington University\u2019s Dr Sarah Baird, can use limited resources to drive two key benefits. First, better education means kids can seek better jobs when they leave school. Second, it improves the wider economy. \u201cYou decrease poverty now and decrease future poverty by encouraging households to invest in children,\u201d says Baird, an associate professor of global health and economics. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about keeping girls in school.\u201d</p> <p>Classroom attendance in Punjab wasn\u2019t the only issue. If any program were to work, then it would need to factor in societal barriers. There are many reasons why girls might not have gone to classes: lack of safe hygiene facilities, domestic duties, fear of violence when traveling between home and school, and the cost of books and uniforms, to name a few. In many places where education is not free or compulsory, Thompson says, parents might invest spare money in schooling for their sons rather than daughters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/07/child-marriage-in-nepal-a-girl-is-a-girl-not-a-wife\">Child marriage in Nepal: 'A girl is a girl, not a wife'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baird notes that CCTs can chip away at school attendance problems, especially if barriers are multifaceted or too costly to fix directly. For instance, when building more schools isn\u2019t possible, CCTs might offer motivation to attend far-away classes.</p> <p><strong>Proven results</strong></p> <p>To check the program\u2019s impact, the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Bank</a>\u2019s Dr Nazmul Chaudhury and the state government monitored the results. Findings are <a href=\"http://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/Data/reports/pakistancctimpacteval2011.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">positive</a> so far, says Chaudhury, who previously helped set up CCTs in Bangladesh to benefit children in poverty. </p> <p>Researchers estimate that FSSP increased girls\u2019 enrollment in post-secondary school by between 11% and 32%, depending on the year and the class. Girls who went through the program married about 1.2 to 1.5 years later than girls who hadn\u2019t, and they tended to have fewer children.</p> <p>\u201cWe shared [results] with the government, and based on that, the government carried on with the program. It\u2019s still running today,\u201d Chaudhury says.</p> <p>He notes that there\u2019s more to find out. \u201cWe know about them going to school, but how long are they staying?\u201d Chaudhury asks. \u201cDo they have better job prospects?\u201d This, like many global health programs, will take time to see.</p> <p><strong>This content is paid for by the Center for Global Development</strong></p>",

The precision of the measurements is equivalent to measuring the width of your fingernail \u2013 but if you were in London and your finger was in Australia.</p> <p>The observations have already <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Gaia/Gaia_s_billion-star_map_hints_at_treasures_to_come\">hinted at scientific discoveries that may lie ahead</a> - including the possibility that the Milky Way may contain more stars than the current estimate of 100bn.</p> <p>Scientists originally calculated that Gaia would see about 1bn stars by the end of 2017, but this number has now been revised upwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03a96687540740119688c23c54d17774e4239d1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03a96687540740119688c23c54d17774e4239d1a/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A slide show depicting a representation of the ESA Gaia Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slide show depicting a representation of the ESA Gaia Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Floor van Leeuwen, of the University of Cambridge, who manages Gaia\u2019s data processing, said: \u201cIt looks very much like we underestimated the number of stars. We think we will see 2-2.5bn stars.\u201d</p> <p>However, he added that it is not obvious how this relates to the number of stars in the entire galaxy.</p> <p>The camera has now made observations of the precise position and brightness of more than 1.1bn stars. Astronomers are steadily converting the data into a 3D map of the galaxy - in effect, a cosmic version of Google maps.</p> <p>\u201cEvery mission to come will use this map,\u201d said Gilmore, adding that it would also help direct ground telescopes towards objects of interest in the cosmos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7daa06f789b5bb05613d003dc82dde97a7fefc94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7daa06f789b5bb05613d003dc82dde97a7fefc94/0_97_3076_1847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gaia observatory, which has mapped the precise position and brightness of more than a billion stars in the Milky Way\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gaia observatory, which has mapped the precise position and brightness of more than a billion stars in the Milky Way</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESA/ATG medialab; background: ES/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By scanning each star about 70 times, astronomers have also calculated the sideways motion of 2m stars, showing how they drift and \u201cwobble\u201d in the night sky.

That will be a complete revolution.\u201d</p> <p>Gaia astronomers will also be able to spot which stars have planets, by observing the characteristic wobble of the star caused by the gravitational pull of its neighbouring planet. Scientists estimate that Gaia could identify around 70,000 new exo-planets \u2013 planets outside of our solar system \u2013 by the end of the mission, which would be a dramatic increase on the 3,500 already known, most of which were identified by Nasa\u2019s Kepler spacecraft.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first time, we\u2019ll be able to look at the distribution of planets based on the position of parent stars,\u201d said Gilmore. \u201cThat will be a huge step forward in understanding planetary formation.\u201d</p> <p>Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA\u2019s Director of Science, said: \u201cToday\u2019s release gives us a first impression of the extraordinary data that await us and that will revolutionise our understanding of how stars are distributed and move across our galaxy.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has condemned attacks on Polish people in the UK in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>\u201cWe Europeans can never accept Polish workers being beaten up, harassed or even murdered in the streets of Essex,\u201d Juncker said in his annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis\">state of the union address</a> to MEPs in Strasbourg.

  "<p>Bernie Sanders leads a chorus of prominent public figures calling for clemency, a plea agreement or, in several cases, a full pardon for the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.<br></p> <p>Writing in the Guardian, the runner-up in the race to become Democratic presidential candidate argues that Snowden helped to educate the American public about how the NSA violated the constitutional rights of citizens with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\">mass surveillance program</a>.

Inconvenience, yes, embarrassment certainly, but what has truly been revealed is that the NSA itself was unquestionably committing international, domestic and constitutional crimes. </p> <p>Were the government to have any evidence that Snowden revealed information that should have been protected, I think he should be judged by a jury. I was the first person to be tried for a leak under the Espionage Act, and I certainly didn\u2019t object to my case being weighed by a jury, although it never came to that. But there has to be a public interest defense, which doesn\u2019t exist in US law now.</p> <p>As things stand, I think the chance that this or any president will pardon Snowden is zero. They wouldn\u2019t dare to challenge the intelligence community that remains so hostile to him. Nor does Snowden have any chance of a fair trial under the Espionage Act, any more than I did. </p> <p>So nothing would be gained by him coming back and standing trial unless the Espionage Act were changed to permit that public interest defense. He\u2019s said to me that he\u2019s willing to come back and serve one, two or conceivably three years as a result of a plea bargain arranged beforehand, but they haven\u2019t offered him one as far as I\u2019m aware. </p> <h2>Terry Gilliam</h2> <p><strong>Film director and former Monty Python star</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60136e7fa03778ac602e758934501c8a39f2ade1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60136e7fa03778ac602e758934501c8a39f2ade1/296_166_1306_783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Gilliam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Gilliam: \u2018What Edward Snowden\u2019s prize should be, I don\u2019t know, perhaps something as unglamorous and hard to display on his mantelpiece as a presidential pardon.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim P Whitby/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think anyone helping to strengthen the workings of democracy should be rewarded.

Thoreau points out clearly that civil disobedience gets its moral authority by the willingness to suffer the penalties from disobeying a law, even if you think that law is unjust.</p> <p>It would be incredibly unwise for this president to offer a pardon.

As well known, initial claims about prevention of terrorist actions collapsed under investigation, and no credible case has been made that the massive invasion of privacy, arguably in violation of constitutional rights, is warranted. Snowden made every effort to follow established procedures for bringing this crucial information to the general public. When these failed, he took the courageous and honorable step of transmitting the information through the medium of careful and highly reliable and experienced journalists, who, along with him, carefully vetted the material to ensure that no possible harm would be caused to individuals or to security. </p> <p>Citizens of the United States \u2013 and indeed the world, considering the extraordinary range of the operations that have been revealed \u2013 are very much in Snowden\u2019s debt.

Like Oliver Stone\u2019s new film, we can try to help emphasise that there is another side to Snowden\u2019s story than the one that prevails in the US media: that this is a man with a lot of integrity, who did a great merit for the civil rights and privacy for the mankind and who knew what he was doing when making a extremely risky decision.</p> <h2>Cindy Cohn</h2> <p><strong>Executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong></p> <p>Whistleblower Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures provided powerful confirmation that the NSA was spying on the digital lives of hundreds of millions of innocent people, undermining digital security and attacking American companies.

You can make the case that he did our nation a service, and that is why I believe he should return to the United States to make that argument in court and to the public.</p> <h2>Ron Wyden</h2> <p><strong>US senator for Oregon</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbacc480b72c9728d1b98fc80295794515ee2950\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbacc480b72c9728d1b98fc80295794515ee2950/0_101_3250_1948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ron wyden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Ron Wyden: \u2018I think it\u2019s very clear that mass surveillance was never going to end until the public found out about it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m not going to sit in judgment on pending criminal charges, though I certainly don\u2019t think there should be a double standard where defenders of particular programs can disclose classified information get and off scot-free, while critics of those programs go to prison. </p> <p>I think it\u2019s very clear that mass surveillance was never going to end until the public found out about it.

I believe the conduct I encountered proves his contention. The individuals responsible for investigating, prosecuting and adjudicating his actions have lied in court, ignored conflicts of interest and irrevocably tainted the evidence against him. I believe it amounts to prosecutorial misconduct. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think asking President Obama to pardon him is a lost cause.</p> <footer> <cite>Ladar Levison</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The charges against Snowden should be dismissed with prejudice; just like the case against Daniel Ellsberg was dismissed. To quote Judge Byrne, from his decision in 1973: \u201cThe totality of the circumstances of this case offend a sense of justice.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, I think asking President Obama to pardon him is a lost cause. Snowden revealed misconduct by the very person who is being asked to grant him the pardon.

The information that Snowden released to the public was critical: it made Americans aware of the way the law was being violated or at least subverted by unchecked government officials.</p> <p>Then there was the manner in which he released the information. It was careful and limited, given the unresponsiveness he had experienced inside the NSA and from other branches of government.</p> <p>Whistleblowing is an essential part of the architecture of checking government power.

And it turned out they could have been achieved by leaking three or four documents.</p> <p>In the years since then, the massive flood unleashed by Snowden has been used for one purpose only \u2013 to harm US intelligence and national interests by exposing perfectly legitimate intelligence sources and methods. </p> <p>As the debate wanes, the ongoing harm to the United States remains front and center. So the longer he stays away the more he becomes, in reality and in perception, simply one of Putin\u2019s tools. And a willing tool to boot, one suspects.

At that time, 90% of young people with disabilities or additional needs who wanted to access post-16 education had to move outside the county, far away from their homes.<br></p> <p>Thanks to the Bucks\u2019 Life Skills Centres Backus pioneered, that figure has been cut to 10%, helping more than 200 young people since 2012. \u201cUprooting a young person with autism and shipping them out miles away can be a gut-wrenching experience and a lot of them were the failing and going into crisis and needing a lot more support once they came back home,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>Backus put together a business case for offering specialist college units in the county, got local colleges onboard and convinced a cash-strapped council to build them using limited reserves. The first, Aylesbury Life Skills College, was funded by the department of education, Aylesbury College and Buckinghamshire county council in 2012 and a second unit in Flackwell Heath opened earlier this year. </p> <p>\u201cI love hearing what the students are doing now, these are children who had been written off - for example, one was told he\u2019d never be able to independently travel, now he can read timetables and travels all over the country on local transport.\u201d </p> <p>The initiative has been so successful that 12 other councils are now looking to set up something similar, with Milton Keynes and Harrow recently opening their own centres. Backus also advises parliament on transition in education as part of the All Party Parliamentary Advisory Groups for autism and learning difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who works for a local authority and just does their hours, but 50 hours will only feel like 15 if you\u2019re in the right place,\u201d she says. </p> <h2>Mary Burch </h2> <p><strong>Divisional secretary, </strong><strong>Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Families Association (SSAFA), Dunbartonshire</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f022fd6a6c2bf09909eef4d34a73d4274075621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f022fd6a6c2bf09909eef4d34a73d4274075621/0_48_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Burch with veteran Bill Bannerman\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Burch with veteran Bill Bannerman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: N/A</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mary Burch has spent the past seven years as divisional secretary of the Dunbartonshire branch of the Solders\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Families Association, <a href=\"https://www.ssafa.org.uk/dunbartonshire\">SSAFA</a>, the UK\u2019s oldest armed forces charity for veterans. But according to her nominee, Burch\u2019s job title doesn\u2019t do justice to just how much she does for the charity, particularly in the past two years when a severe lack of volunteers has seen Burch single-handedly take on 70% of all casework, to make sure no veteran is left disadvantaged or suffering. This is on top of doing the branch\u2019s administration, fundraising, recruitment and training. </p> <p>\u201cHolding things together to keep the charity going locally has been hard but absolutely wonderful; I could cry now thinking about the desperate situation some people are in when they come to us for help, it\u2019s a real eye-opener which changes you forever\u201d says Burch, who initially signed up for a couple of hours a week and is now volunteering up to 32 hours. <br></p> <p>The Dunbartonshire branch deals with as many of 75 cases a year, including veterans with post traumatic stress disorder, drug or alcohol issues, homelessness, financial difficulties and countless other problems. It could be taking someone to the supermarket to buy them emergency food supplies, or finding the funds to buy them a handrail to better get around the house. </p> <p>Burch, who has volunteered with charities since she was 16, has been working closely with local prisons to help support veterans into housing and employment once they are released and this summer helped to secure \u00a320,000 in funding from Poppy Scotland and various naval charities to buy an adapted van to enable a quadriplegic veteran to get out of the house and into the fresh air with his wife. <br></p> <p>\u201cMy son taught me a phrase - pay it forward; if you make a difference to one person\u2019s life it ripples out.

After four years of litigation and evidence collection, they have submitted their applications to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, seeking a judgment against the legal prohibition of OST in Russia.</p> <p>Their lawyer Mikhail Golichenko says: \u201cIt\u2019s not only about oppression, it\u2019s also about the disconnect between the state\u2019s imposed values, which very often are far from reality. The fight of human rights is an important treatment for people who use drugs in itself, as many people start using drugs because they don\u2019t feel part of this society, especially in countries like Russia.\u201d</p> <p>If the applicants are successful, it will be the first legally-binding decision from the European court of human rights that recognises drug users as vulnerable people who are entitled to protection.</p> <p>Here they share their reasons for pursuing the cases:</p> <h2><strong>Alexey Kurmanayevskiy, 34</strong></h2> <p>Kurmanayevskiy is a social worker and activist. He first used drugs as a teenager, and over the last 20 years he has made 19 unsuccessful drug treatment attempts in Russia.

When I went to the court to request access to OST \u2013 and when I got all my requests rejected \u2013 I realised an attempt to change the rules in Russia is not only about the access, it\u2019s about Russia\u2019s general approach to dealing with illicit drugs, as well as HIV prevention.</p> <p>I saw how human rights are diminished because of the desire to achieve the so-called drug-free world, and the ideology of drug control which obviously would never be achieved.</p> <p>Although my decision to go public about this application and my use of drugs was a risk \u2013 I was fired from my job and there were problems with my relatives \u2013 I wanted to fulfil some educational function. Many people in Russian society do not know anything about drug dependence, but the lack of social protection in Russia is the main reason why many turn to drug use, to get some relief.</p> <p>I believe another reason is the repressive drug policy that makes people who experiment with drug use permanently stuck. When the person is arrested or hooked up by the state in other ways, they are doomed to remain in this sphere because there is no mechanism to help. There is only a mechanism to oppress. And that\u2019s the main reason why there\u2019s an ever-growing number of drug users.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/07/governments-war-drugs-decriminalisation\">Why governments worldwide are changing tack in the war on drugs</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Irina Abdyusheva Teplinskaya, 50</strong></h2> <p>Teplinskaya<strong> </strong>is an activist.

  "<p>There is an idea that all that matters in Scotland is big constitutional change and that the Scots control this process. It is a dangerous illusion. Behind the song and dance of referendums lie real economic forces that will change Scotland no matter.</p> <p>A report out this week confirms what policymakers have long known \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/scotland-facing-billions-of-pounds-of-budget-cuts-say-economists\" title=\"\">public spending in Scotland can only go down </a>in the short- to medium-term, and urgent reform of how services are delivered is necessary.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.strath.ac.uk/business/economics/fraserofallanderinstitute/\" title=\"\">Fraser of Allander Institute</a>, part of Strathclyde University, has recently appointed <a href=\"http://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/roygraemedr/\" title=\"\">Graeme Roy</a> as its director \u2013 he was an economic adviser to the Scottish government from 2007 to 2016. This is important, as he knows both the shape of the economy and how it has been groomed for public consumption.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/scots-independence-referendum-brexit-nicola-sturgeon\">How do Scots feel about having another independence referendum, post-Brexit? | David Torrance, Vonny Moyes and Mike Small</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his latest report, he projects a worst case \u00a31.6bn of public cuts by 2020/21. That is 6% of what the Scottish government spends. Given the NHS and some other budgets are protected, he suggests other areas of spending could be cut by 17%. Roy speculates that the most likely place for this to happen would be the local government budget.</p> <p>The factors leading to this gloomy prediction are two-fold. The first is the continued austerity programme of the UK, which will see downward pressure on all public spending. The second is the transfer of tax-raising powers to Scotland. In the process of gaining responsibility, Holyrood has also acquired risk. With powers to raise 50% of what it spends, the Scottish government may see income fall if the economy performs badly.</p> <p>Roy reasonably attributes low economic performance in part to the Brexit vote, but that is not the only factor at play. Global sluggishness and borderline deflation are threatening many economies and Scotland is no different. Wherever you turn, there is bad economic news. In previous statements, Roy and the Fraser of Allander are clear that in the event of independence there would be a deficit of around \u00a315bn. Oil revenues have crashed, economic growth lags the rest of the UK and Scotland still runs a large public sector on relatively low taxes.</p> <p>Should Scotland opt to stay in the UK, as looks most likely, then the chances of the existing financial deal between London and Edinburgh lasting much longer look slim. The document protecting Scotland\u2019s funding is entitled <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/scotland-in-the-united-kingdom-an-enduring-settlement\" title=\"\">\u201cAn Enduring Settlement\u201d</a> \u2013 a nice sentiment, but probably wishful thinking. The emergence of a British nationalist government under Theresa May, seeking independence from Europe and a return to the good old days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/thatcher-grammars-poison-theresa-may-tories\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a>, means it is almost inevitable there will be a fresh assault on a deal viewed by many English voters as unfair.</p> <p>There is a tendency in Scotland to swing from triumphalism to gloom in a heartbeat, yet this is not a case of \u201cwe\u2019re all doomed\u201d. The pressure on Scottish public spending is common across Europe. Exceptional levels of debt, demographic pressures and low growth contribute to a sense that the old model of the state is over \u2013 RIP 1945-2008. But in the need for change lies opportunity.</p> <p>If the demand for independence were about anything substantial, it surely rested on the idea that things could be done differently. It was about taking Donald Dewar\u2019s phrase of \u201cScottish solutions to Scottish problems\u201d to its maximum effect. The problems are mounting and now would be a very good moment for some solutions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/29/what-next-for-nicola-sturgeon-and-the-snp\">What now for Nicola Sturgeon and the rebels who became the Scottish establishment? | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Scottish government has toyed with reform.

Such a thing is old hat for Westminster, where bodies such as the Institute of Fiscal Studies provide pre- and post-budget comments. In Scotland, no such body has previously existed \u2013 the political culture of impartial expert analysis and think-tankery is in its infancy north of the border.</p> <p>What Roy is trying to do is widen the debate beyond the partisan camps of yes and no, SNP vs Tory. It\u2019s early days and so far it has met with mixed success \u2013 most nationalists have used the report to repeat calls for an end to austerity. In time, the introduction of more impartial data will surely lead to a more sophisticated public debate.</p> <p>The question for the Scottish government, like those across the continent, is whether it has the leadership to guide the state through these turbulent times when radical change is both inevitable and desirable.</p>",

  "<p>The government has rejected growing calls for a major overhaul of the law on homicide, including the creation of a US-style offence of first-degree murder, saying it would create a \u201cmurder-lite\u201d category for most killings.</p> <p>The justice minister, Oliver Heald, told MPs the government was officially keeping an open mind on the issue, but that the introduction of a three-tier system would mean downgrading most killings to a second-degree category, which the public would not accept.</p> <p>Heald did, however, tell MPs that he wanted to encourage prosecutors to keep using the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/sep/12/ameen-jogee-jailed-manslaughter-police-officer-joint-enterprise-test-case\">much-criticised charge of \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d</a>, despite a supreme court ruling in February that judges had been misinterpreting a key element of the offence for the past 30 years. So-called joint enterprise laws allow the accomplice to be treated in the same way as the person who committed the deadly act.</p> <p>There have been growing calls for a review of the law on homicide, with MPs and senior legal figures suggesting the current mandatory life sentence for all murders creates injustices and should be scrapped. </p> <p>Heald, a former solicitor-general, told MPs on Wednesday that the government was not going to order a review of the law on homicide. He said there were no gaps in the current law, the public understood it in broad terms, and currently complex cases involving intention to kill or cause gross bodily harm, partial defences or various forms of manslaughter, could not be simplified by a new system.</p> <p>\u201cI think the public would be concerned about a system in which most murders fitted into a second-degree category. The public rightly thinks murder is the most serious and abhorrent crime, and I have a concern about creating a \u2018murder-lite\u2019 category,\u201d Heald told the justice select committee.</p> <p>The Law Commission criticised the current law on murder and homicide in England and Wales as a \u201crickety structure set upon shaky foundations\u201d as long ago as 2005, and proposed a three-tier system of first-degree and second-degree murder and manslaughter.</p> <p>Heald said there was no consensus on the alternative with many other options canvassed, including a four or five-tiered system suggested by the former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald, a refined version of the three-tiered system proposed by the Conservative barrister and backbencher Alex Chalk, and a single offence of homicide with sentencing left to the judges\u2019s complete discretion put forward by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC.</p> <p>The Conservative chairman of the justice select committee, Bob Neill, chided Heald for his response and suggested the whole issue had been in the \u201ctoo difficult to do box\u201d. Neill said it seemed that the \u201cbureaucracy of government can\u2019t be bothered to put its butt into gear to deal with it\u201d. ThThe minster rejected the charge.</p> <p>Heald did, however, try to encourage crown prosecutors to continue to use the joint enteprise charge. He said it was a useful tool and that the supreme court ruling in February had taken the law back to what it was previously.</p> <p>\u201cThe judgment makes clear that joint enterprise is not dead and it is still there for prosecutors to use,\u201d Heald said. He suggested that it was important in cases such as one involving two men kicking a third on the ground and being encouraged to do so by another bystander.</p>",

  "<p>In terms of global domination, Coca-Cola is definitely the real thing. In Britain, we spend \u00a31.15bn a year on the company\u2019s products. It is our&#xa0;biggest grocery brand.</p> <p>Even if you want to, it may be impossible to shake off the influence of this corporate behemoth. In 2004, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, attempted to explain why Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi, despite Pepsi proving more popular in blind taste-tests (the famous \u201cPepsi challenge\u201d). Using MRI brain scans, they found that, in blind tests, people focused solely on flavour. However, when the subjects knew they were drinking Coke, that information triggered sophisticated brain activity involving memory. This poses a tantalising possibility: has decades of&#xa0;iconic Coca-Cola advertising \u2013 all&#xa0;those celebrations of world peace, racial harmony and hot builders taking their tops off \u2013 hardwired a love of&#xa0;Coca-Cola in all of us? Possibly.</p> <p>Yet some analysts still insist that Coca-Cola is finally going flat. In early 2016, UK volume sales were down 5%, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2016/jan/17/fizzled-out-a-history-of-coca-cola-flops\" title=\"\">the lower-calorie Coca-Cola Life has flopped</a> and in 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/20/drinks-makers-consider-legal-action-against-sugar-tax-budget\" title=\"\">the sugar tax comes in</a>. After years of stuttering growth globally, in which Coca-Cola has arguably failed to adjust to a new healthier era, could it face years of slow decline? In the UK, 55% of its sales are still in mainline, high-sugar Coca-Cola.</p> <p>Certainly there are newcomers to the market, such as Karma Cola, which uses kola nuts (4x250ml, \u00a33.95, Waitrose; as a control, I\u2019d give this 7/10) and Fentimans Curiosity Cola (275ml, \u00a31.19, Waitrose, 8/10), which are expensive and acquired tastes, but offer more complex flavours than classic Coke (1.75l, \u00a31.70-\u00a32, 5/10).

Aggressive carbonation is this cola\u2019s only memorable characteristic. Unscrewing the lid, it emits a whoosh like a door opening on the starship Enterprise and, yes, it prickles on the tongue. But beyond that? Despite smelling like a cross between cola and a particularly zesty washing-up liquid, it&#xa0;tastes thin and indistinct; recognisable as cola, but only just.

Once the carbonation settles down \u2013 at first, it is like having your tongue rigorously scrubbed \u2013 the cola flavour comes over in a brief, dank, concentrated hit, one that leaves some rather iffy sickly-sweet, astringent aftertastes jostling in its wake. <br><strong>3/10</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer, Simply M&amp;S cola, 1l, 95p</strong></h2> <p>Broadly, if a cola has fruit and vegetable concentrates listed in the ingredients (usually apple, carrot, hibiscus), it will be significantly tastier than the competition. In terms of its flavour profile and its amber colour, the M&amp;S version is no Coca-Cola doppelganger (on that basis, picky kids may reject it), but adults should relish its comparative complexity. It is arguably too skewed to the two ends of the cola spectrum, sweetness and tartness, but it packs some interesting apple, caramel and citrus notes into its familiar cola-flavour framework. <br><strong>6/10</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Co-op, Loved By Us Original cola, 2l, 59p</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3a19afb28e1c16382967a4eeb2d3107550d4e8e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a19afb28e1c16382967a4eeb2d3107550d4e8e4/730_21_853_2344/364.jpg\" alt=\"Co-op cola\" width=\"364\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Co-op cola.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bless the Co-op for its labelling, which points out that frequently drinking sugary drinks may lead to poor nutrition: \u201cTry to restrict these drinks to mealtimes and replace them with sugar-free drinks, milk or water.\u201d That may explain its curious attempt at a cola, one bluntly dominated by burnt sugar, grape juice and stewed fruit flavours.

Insomuch as this cola has any discernible flavour, it is a foggy, muffled one of penny sweets and dark berry fruits, with a cloying, syrupy aftertaste.

Within the same timeframe as the donations, the Republican-controlled legislature passed new laws making it much more difficult for victims of lead paint poisoning to sue NL Industries and other former lead paint manufacturers (the laws were later overturned in the federal courts).</p> <p>The John Doe files also provide new insight into the extensive efforts made by allies of Scott Walker to help a conservative member of the Wisconsin supreme court, David Prosser, hang onto his seat in a 2011 re-election. A network of like-minded groups and campaigners channeled $3.5m in undisclosed corporate funds to pay for TV and radio ads backing the judge.</p> <p>The push was seen as vital, the documents disclose, as a means of retaining the rightwing majority of the court and thereby preserving the anti-union measures introduced by Walker. \u201cIf we lose [Justice Prosser], the Walker agenda is toast,\u201d one ally writes in an email sent around to the governor\u2019s chief of staff and several conservative lobbyists.</p> <p>In 2015, Justice Prosser refused to recuse himself from a case in which the state supreme court sat in judgment over the John Doe investigation, despite the fact that the investigation focused on precisely the same network of lobbying groups and donors that had helped him hang onto his seat. The judge joined a majority of four conservative justices who voted to terminate the investigation and destroy all the documents now leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>Prosser told the Guardian that four years had passed since his re-election before he joined the decision to close the John Doe investigation, over which time any potential conflict of interest had faded.</p> <p>The John Doe investigation was launched in 2012 after a set of recall elections that were forced on Walker and six Republican state senators in the wake of their hyper-partisan anti-union measure, Act 10. The prosecutors alleged that the governor\u2019s campaign committee had operated a coordinated network involving outside lobby groups through which unlimited amounts of corporate money could be channeled without public disclosure. </p> <p>Walker and the other parties who were the subjects of the John Doe investigation have all protested that they were unfairly accused of legal violations. They point out that no charges have been brought in the case, and that a succession of Wisconsin courts, including the state\u2019s highest, have cleared them of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Walker\u2019s campaign told the Guardian that the John Doe investigation was \u201cbaseless\u201d and had been shut down multiple times by the state courts. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <p>The third-party lobbying groups that were the subject of the investigation said the prosecutors had accused wholly innocent individuals of crimes that did not exist under state law. They insisted they had a right to comment about public officials and policy and to protect the confidentiality of their donors.</p> <ul> <li>Support the Guardian\u2019s fearless, independent journalism by <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/home?INTCMP=co_us_editorial_footer_johndoe\">making a contribution</a> or <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/supporter?INTCMP=mem_us_editorial_footer_johndoe\">becoming a member</a>. <br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a moment in every student\u2019s life when you end up at a fancy dress event, surrounded by white people dressed in saris, bindis, or native American headdresses. And you will find yourself thinking: \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is OK\u201d.<br></p> <p>Fresher events on campus are rarely a display of political correctness. But sometimes they cross the line between being \u201ca bit of fun\u201d (a phrase you hear a lot at uni) and full-on offensive. </p> <p>\u201cCowboys and Indians is a particularly common theme for fancy dress; as are tribal-themed parties,\u201d says Flora Carr, who has just graduated from the University of Exeter. \u201cI\u2019ve also seen girls dressed up as geishas. The traditional cultural dress is taken and then sexualised. </p> <p>\u201cI know students who have joked about blacking up. A lot of the laddy blokes try to go against political correctness \u2013 they use \u2018irony\u2019 as an excuse to do offensive things.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/how-britains-old-empire-lives-on-in-universities\">How Britain's old empire lives on in universities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>New students can easily be swept up in these parties without stopping to think. \u201cFreshers won\u2019t want to be the party-pooper, and I sympathise with that,\u201d Carr says. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all been victims of peer pressure. But think about international students arriving, and the first thing they come across is a kind of sexy version of their cultural history \u2013 that puts it into perspective.\u201d</p> <h2>Stories spread</h2> <p>Campuses have always been insulated from the real world, with little perspective from anyone outside the bubble. But now student behaviour is recorded and broadcast out to the world, and stories are spread way beyond the private banter of the rugby fives. What might have seemed acceptable among a close group of friends could be grossly offensive to other people. Yet despite increased awareness, the bad-taste outfits don\u2019t go away.</p> <p>Take the group of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509893/York-University-students-black-offensive-Cool-Runnings-fancy-dress.html\">York students who blacked up</a> to impersonate the cast of the 1994 film Cool Runnings, for instance. It\u2019s weak humour at best and incredibly offensive at worst. And what makes it even more disturbing is that black applicants are significantly <a href=\"http://www.nouse.co.uk/2013/06/18/reasons-unclear-for-minority-applications-disparity-at-york/\">less likely to be offered</a> a place at the University of York than white ones. But although the students were <a href=\"http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10824688.York_students_left_with_red_faces_after_blacking_up_to_recreate_film/?ref=mr\">pilloried in the media</a> and threatened with punishment by the university, it hasn\u2019t stopped others from doing similar things. In fact, partygoers in Leeds donned the <a href=\"http://thetab.com/uk/leeds/2014/03/07/club-posts-official-photo-of-punters-blacking-up-10144\">exact same costume</a> the following year, while law students at the University of Edinburgh thought it would be funny to <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-students-black-up-for-pub-crawl-1-3191533\">dress</a><a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-students-black-up-for-pub-crawl-1-3191533\"> up as Somalian pirates</a> (face paint and all). </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Think about international students arriving and seeing a kind of sexy version of their cultural history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anna Ball, a senior lecturer in English who co-directs the centre for postcolonial studies at Nottingham Trent University, says the fact that many of the universities experiencing these controversies are predominantly white may have an impact. \u201cI wonder if it has something to do with a lack of access to cultural diversity,\u201d she says. \u201cA mixed environment fosters cultural awareness and sensitivity, in a way that makes students more cautious.\u201d</p> <p>Concern about cultural appropriation has shot up recently: Google Analytics shows that interest has <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=cultural%20appropriation\">increased dramatically</a> since the start of 2015.  And university life has provided the focal point for much of the discussion, both in the UK and in North America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d440824152be7b4891b130fa8b84ecf50a593808\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d440824152be7b4891b130fa8b84ecf50a593808/219_410_3202_1922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Downward-facing dog slinks away from Canadian campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downward-facing dog slinks away from Canadian campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Source/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But sometimes attempts to curb cultural appropriation has led to accusations of heavy-handed censorship. There was controversy last year when the University of East Anglia (UEA) banned sombreros from its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/uea-student-union-bans-racist-sombreros\">freshers\u2019 fair</a>, and even yoga was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/23/university-yoga-class-canceled-because-of-oppression-cultural-genocide/\">banned at one</a> university in Canada because it originated from \u201ccultures that have experienced oppression\u201d. In Ohio, students at a liberal arts college complained about <a href=\"http://oberlinreview.org/9055/news/cds-appropriates-asian-dishes-students-say/\">culturally appropriative food</a>, arguing that Asian dishes such as b\u00e1nh m\u00ec and sushi were prepared so poorly that it insulted the cultures from which they originated, where food is taken seriously. Lena Dunham, a college alumna, supported the students who complained, saying their mission was \u201cright on\u201d.</p> <h2>How to decide</h2> <p>So where should students draw the line? \u201cThe important thing is to allow the groups affected by these issues to take the lead and determine themselves what they consider problematic,\u201d says Tessy Maritim, who campaigned against cultural appropriation at the University of Manchester. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many people who would turn up in racist fancy dress, but it\u2019s important to call out even just one instance to prevent normalising casual racism.\u201d</p> <p>Ibtehal Hussain, a student in London, points out that student socialising often accidentally excludes black and ethnic minority people, which compounds the issue. \u201cSocieties normally hold their socials in pubs, which can exclude Muslims who don\u2019t always feel comfortable in pubs, which means that a lot of black and brown people won\u2019t attend them,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Ball believes that appropriation isn\u2019t always bad, and cultural exchange is valuable. The Olympics is an example of cultural appropriation, she argues. But it\u2019s a question of how it is done \u2013 whether it celebrates cultures or simply makes a mockery of them. \u201cInteresting forms of cultural appropriation I\u2019ve seen include the adoption of hip-hop related clothing, jewellery and speech styles. Or, for example, the keffiyeh scarf is popular among students and that often functions as an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/18/oxford-uni-must-decolonise-its-campus-and-curriculum-say-students\">Oxford Uni must decolonise its campus and curriculum, say students</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But not everybody sees it that way. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a thin line when it comes to cultural appropriation, but it definitely stems from racism,\u201d says Shanice Dover, a recent graduate of the University of the West of England. \u201cIt\u2019s continuing this tradition of taking from people of colour and deciding what from that culture is valuable and what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cPeople hear the term \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019 and roll their eyes . In their minds, it\u2019s not racism because they associate racism with people like Adolf Hitler or KKK members. They think as long as they aren\u2019t being blatantly hateful like those people, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p> <p>So if you find yourself faced with a Mexican social and you\u2019re worried you\u2019ll get barred from the SU for wearing a sombrero, the context could be a clue. </p> <p>Take dressing up as the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, for example. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for that to be interesting, given her take on indigenous cultural engagement at a time when that was not visible in north American culture,\u201d Ball says. But if someone were to dress up in a garish parody of Frida Kahlo, in a way that was seeking to undermine rather than appreciate, then she thinks that would be problematic. \u201cIt\u2019s a really complex, fine line.\u201d</p> <p>So as long as you\u2019re not ridiculing the culture, or claiming some sort of ownership over it, it\u2019s probably OK. But if you find yourself as part of a men\u2019s football team, staggering down the main road in Durham wearing a monobrow and a flower crown, it might be worth having a think about the events that led up to this, and reconsidering. </p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>",

The 133-page complaint says the state of Michigan has disinvested in education in Detroit so much that children lack fundamental access to literacy.</p> <p>Hall, 16, said he has friends who can\u2019t read \u201cbut it\u2019s not because they aren\u2019t smart, it\u2019s because the state has failed them\u201d.</p> <p>Proficiency rates in core subject areas are near-zero at the schools where the seven students named in the complaint attend, the complaint says.</p> <p>\u201cAbsent literacy, a child has no way to obtain knowledge, communicate with the world, or participate in the institutions and activities of citizenship,\u201d said Mark Rosenbaum, director of the opportunity under law project of Public Counsel, which is filing the lawsuit.</p> <p>Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe, who is not involved in the litigation, said he expects the lawsuit will make history, \u201cmuch as Brown v Board of Education did\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe legal theory underlying the suit is both creative and rock-solid,\u201d he said, \u201cand Mark Rosenbaum\u2019s legal team is nothing short of extraordinary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you think of Brown v Board as one shoe that dropped, this is the other shoe,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause though it eliminated, technically, inferior schools for blacks, and eliminated de jure segregation, it didn\u2019t achieve one of its basic goals. And that is a decent educational opportunity for all kids, regardless of race, regardless of class, regardless of geography. That\u2019s become a more elusive goal.\u201d</p> <p>The plaintiffs include students from five of the lowest-performing schools in the city\u2019s system, which recently was overhauled before the start of the new year, after state lawmakers passed <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cac6a5b4764540c49282c66bb7c26782/qa-michigan-passes-617-million-revamp-detroit-schools\">a $617m plan to restructure the district</a> and shed its long-term debt. Teachers this year have waged large-scale protests over the prospect of working without pay and in subpar working conditions, though officials have <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/08/29/district-school-buildings/89532882/\">recently touted improvements in building repairs</a>.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s office said it doesn\u2019t comment on pending lawsuits. A spokesperson for Detroit\u2019s school system said the district\u2019s legal team hasn\u2019t had time to review the case.</p> <p>The lawsuit describes a public school system in Detroit that has experienced a precipitous decline under state oversight. Since 1999, Michigan has implemented various measures to restructure the governance of the system, including a string of appointed emergency managers tasked with overseeing the district\u2019s finances. But in that timeframe, the lawsuit says, the state has \u201cnot addressed the root causes of its failures [with literacy] in any systematic or meaningful way\u201d.</p> <p>The lawsuit cites a list of complaints that have fostered the current environment in Detroit: the proliferation of charter schools, vast schools closures, and \u2013 as part of the overhaul this summer of the district \u2013 a new provision that authorizes the hiring of non-credentialed teachers. Insufficient staff poses additional challenges, too, the suit states.</p> <p>At one school, co-counsel Kathryn Eidmann said an eighth0grade student handled teaching a seventh- and eighth-grade math class for a month because no teacher was available \u2013 a situation reported to the legal team by \u201cnumerous\u201d teachers. And this week, Eidmann said she spoke with a student who started his school year with two classes that don\u2019t have a teacher.</p> <p>\u201cDuring that period, he sits with a substitute in the ROTC classroom,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Eidmann said the case is the first in federal court to argue there is a right to access literacy under the US constitution\u2019s 14th amendment. In 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan <a href=\"http://www.aclumich.org/article/right-read\">filed a class-action lawsuit</a> in state court on behalf of students in the city of Highland Park\u2019s school system. That suit asserted Michigan had a constitutional obligation to educate students in Highland Park, which borders Detroit. A Michigan court of appeals panel, in 2014, rejected the claims in a 2-1 vote, and the state\u2019s high court <a href=\"http://michiganradio.org/post/michigan-supreme-court-won-t-take-right-read-case-against-state-highland-park-schools\">refused to hear the case</a>.</p> <p>While the federal case over Detroit\u2019s public schools is the first to argue literacy is constitutionally protected, Eidmann said it\u2019s \u201cvery well grounded\u201d in US supreme court precedent. In the 1982 decision of Plyler v Doe, the justices struck down a Texas statute that excluded undocumented immigrant children from public education, and said a state may not \u201cdeny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders\u201d.</p> <p>Detroit students, predominately low-income and children of color, meet the criteria of a \u201cdiscrete class\u201d, the lawsuit claims, and \u201chave been excluded from the access to literacy that public education provides to other students in the state of Michigan\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese are schools in name only,\u201d Eidmann said, \u201cwhere students are sitting in the classrooms often with no books, often where there\u2019s no teachers, often where there\u2019s no pretense of literacy taking place. In that sense, they\u2019re being denied a basic education.\u201d</p> <p>Though Rosenbaum\u2019s other case in Highland Park failed at the state level, Tribe said the federal court system is a more appropriate vehicle to address the litany of issues cited in the lawsuit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/detroit-public-schools-sickout-lawmakers-plan\">How Detroit's teacher 'sickout' cast a spotlight on unsafe school conditions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that a life-tenured federal judge is likely to be much more comfortable with and willing to think through in great detail,\u201d Tribe said.</p> <p>Tribe also believed the lawsuit makes a sound use of the Plyler decision.</p> <p>\u201cWhether it is kids who through no fault of their own were brought to Texas as undocumented aliens at the age of two, or kids through no fault of their own were born and are growing up in Detroit,\u201d he said, \u201cthe idea that saying, by the luck of the draw, you will never be equipped by society with the tools you need to achieve something that resembles the American Dream of upward mobility, that\u2019s a fundamental departure from constitutional principle.\u201d </p> <p>The suit asks the federal court to provide relief that includes evidence-based literacy instruction in every grade level, along with addressing physical school conditions.</p> <p>The five-count complaint names Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, as well as several state education officials, as defendants. The state department of education did not respond to a request for comment. The governor\u2019s office and a spokesperson for Detroit\u2019s school system both declined to comment.</p> <p>Hall, the student at Osborn Evergreen Academy, said he has witnessed classmates act out to avoid reading in class, if a teacher calls on them. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to get embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to feel dumb.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m as smart as I could have been, or I have enough knowledge or as much knowledge that I could\u2019ve got \u2026 because we\u2019ve missed out on so much opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of simple facts: that we don\u2019t have enough books, or it\u2019s hot in the classroom.

It was September 2011, and earlier that year the first-term governor had turned himself into the poster boy of hardline Republican politics by passing the notorious anti-union measure Act 10, stripping public sector unions of collective bargaining rights.<br></p> <p>Now he was under attack himself, pursued by progressive groups who planned revenge by forcing him into a recall election. His job was on the line.</p> <p>He asked his main fundraiser, Kate Doner, to write him a [briefing note](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p58/a317774, \u201cGuardian\u201d) on how they could raise enough money to win the election. At 6.39am on a Wednesday, she fired off an email to Walker and his top advisers flagged \u201cred\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d she began. \u201cHere are my quick thoughts on raising money for Walker\u2019s possible recall efforts.\u201d</p> <p>Her advice was bold and to the point. \u201cCorporations,\u201d she said. \u201cGo heavy after them to give.\u201d She continued: \u201cTake Koch\u2019s money. Get on a plane to Vegas and sit down with Sheldon Adelson. Ask for $1m now.\u201d</p> <p>Her advice must have hit a sweet spot, because money was soon pouring in from big corporations and mega-wealthy individuals from across the nation. A few months after the memo, Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate who [Forbes estimates](http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/gallery/sheldon-adelson) has a personal fortune of $26bn, was to [wire a donation of $200,000 for the cause.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p132/a317501 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>Adelson\u2019s generosity, like that of most of the other major donors solicited by Walker and crew, was made out not to the governor\u2019s own personal campaign committee but to a third-party group that did not have to disclose its donors. In the world of campaign finance, the group was known as a \u201cdark money\u201d organisation, as it was the recipient of a secret flow of funds that the public knew nothing about.</p> <p>One of the checks made out to the group, for $10,000, came from a financier called G Frederick Kasten Jr. In the subject line of the check, Kasten had written in his own hand: [\u201cBecause Scott Walker asked\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p52/a317493 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>Because Scott Walker asked. That could stand as an elegant catchphrase for the state of democracy in the US today, where elections are lost or won as much according to candidates\u2019 ability to attract corporate cash as by the strength of their leadership or ideas.</p> <p>The phrase is to be found within a batch of 1,500 pages of leaked documents obtained by the Guardian that are being published in their entirety for the first time. The cache consists of a stack of evidence gathered by official prosecutors in Wisconsin who were conducting what was called a \u201cJohn Doe investigation\u201d into suspected campaign finance violations by Walker\u2019s campaign and its network.</p> <p>The John Doe files published today open a door onto how modern US elections operate in the wake of Citizens United, the 2010 US supreme court ruling that unleashed a flood of corporate money into the political process. They speak to the mounting sense of public unease about the cosy relationship between politicians and big business, and to the frustration of millions of Americans who feel disenfranchised by an electoral system that put the needs of corporate donors before ordinary voters.</p> <p>The theme has become a rallying cry in the US presidential election. Bernie Sanders accused politicians \u2013 not least his Democratic rival [Hillary Clinton](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/6/bernie-sanders-slams-hillary-clintons-wall-street-/) \u2013 of selling themselves to Wall Street and special interests.<br></p> <p>Donald Trump went further, brazenly using himself as an example of a billionaire who has put politicians in his pocket. \u201cWhen you give to them,\u201d [he said](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9114565/donald-trump-debate-money) in a confessional tone during a televised Republican debate in the run-up to the primaries, \u201cthey do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d</p> <p>According to the independent monitoring group, the Center for Responsive Politics, [$2bn of corporate cash](http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php) has been lavished on the presidential race so far. It\u2019s a bewildering figure, but it only tells us so much about how the new American democracy works in practice, because so much of that largesse is shrouded in secrecy.</p> <p>Donors are often undisclosed, campaign finance laws are [notoriously complicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/05/17/the-impossibly-complex-world-of-campaign-finance-in-1-chart/), and scrutiny by electoral authorities is rare, prosecutions even rarer. When official investigations are launched, they often flounder before reaching a conclusion and virtually never have the chance to reveal their findings to the public. </p> <p>It is into that dark and obscure post-Citizens United world that the John Doe files leaked to the Guardian land. These are the documents that some of the most powerful judges in the country tried to stop the public from ever seeing. </p> <p>In July 2015 the state\u2019s highest court, the supreme court of Wisconsin, terminated the John Doe investigation before any charges were brought. The [conservative majority of the court ruled](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=144525) that the prosecutors had made a basic misreading of campaign finance law and targeted individuals who were \u201cwholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u201d. </p> <p>In a contentious twist to the ruling, the justices ordered the prosecutors to \u201cpermanently destroy all copies of information and other materials obtained through the investigation\u201d. </p> <p>This latter-day equivalent of a book burning could have condemned the John Doe investigation into permanent oblivion, leaving voters none the wiser. But at least one copy of the evidence gathered by the prosecutors survived the bonfire, and have now been leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>Snippets of the documents have already seen the light of day, [quoted in legal filings](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-wanted-funds-sent-to-wisconsin-club-for-growth-b99336519z1-272364371.html), some of which were mistakenly posted to an official website. But the Guardian\u2019s documents \u2013 consisting of email exchanges between Walker, his advisers, Republican leaders and major donors who included none other than Trump himself, together with court filings held under seal \u2013 amount to a rich chronicle of the electoral health of the United States in the wake of Citizens United.<br></p> <p>They also form the substance of a case currently before the US supreme court, which has been [petitioned](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) by the Wisconsin prosecutors in an appeal against the decision to shut down their investigation. The nation\u2019s highest judicial panel is expected to announce within days whether or not it will take the case.</p> <p>At the heart of the John Doe files is Scott Walker, the governor who shot to national prominence \u2013 a hero for conservatives, pariah for liberals \u2013 soon after taking office in February 2011 when he introduced the hyper-partisan [Act 10](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/02/wisconsin_assemblys_sneaky_mov.html). The legislation instantly made Wisconsin the battleground state in the fight between boardroom might and union muscle.</p> <p>The state capital Madison erupted in weeks of protests in which the legislative building was overrun with [thousands of protesters](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42047717/ns/politics-more_politics/t/tens-thousands-pro-labor-rally-wisconsin/). Democratic lawmakers [fled the state](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/116381289.html) and took up residence in neighboring Illinois in a failed attempt to foil Walker\u2019s plans.<br></p> <p>In the fallout of Act 10, progressive groups retaliated by dragging Walker and several other Republicans through a series of bitter recall elections. Six GOP senators were forced to defend their seats in 2011, and Walker himself was put through the [recall furnace](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wisconsin-recall-idUSBRE82T1FV20120330) in 2012.</p> <p>Those recall elections, and the question of whether Walker flouted campaign finance regulations in order that he and other Republican politicians could stay in office and preserve their anti-union legislation, were the focus of the investigation that generated the files now leaked to the Guardian. It was run by five Wisconsin prosecutors, led by Francis Schmitz, a former federal counter-terrorism expert.</p> <p>It was known as a John Doe investigation because, much like a grand jury, its subjects were kept anonymous while officials weighed whether or not to press charges. In this case, prosecutors alleged that there was evidence to indicate that Walker and his team of advisers and associates had set up a coordinated effort with lobbyists and major donors to swing elections by secretly pouring huge amounts of corporate cash into the races. </p> <p>The money was channeled through a third-party group, the DAs alleged, in order to circumvent state and federal rules that set limits on political contributions and require them to be publicly revealed. </p> <p>The documents show the governor and his fundraising team going after, and receiving cash from, many of the most prominent rightwing donors in the country. In addition to [Adelson](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p74/a317508 \u201cGuardian\u201d), there was business magnate Carl Icahn who was [approached for $100,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p4/a317509 \u201cGuardian\u201d) though nothing in the files indicates that he donated; the hedge-fund billionaire Stephen Cohen, who [arranged a wire transfer of $1m](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p98/a317510 \u201cGuardian\u201d); and Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone who [gave $25,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p13/a317512 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>Paul Singer, hedge-fund manager and chairman of the Manhattan Institute, also crops up in the documents. Three months before Walker\u2019s recall election, Singer attended a forum of business leaders held by the American Enterprise Institute in a luxury resort off the coast of Georgia.</p> <p>Walker was also there, arriving at the resort armed with a to-do list from his chief fundraiser Kate Doner. It bore the pithy command: [\u201cPaul Singer: Grab him\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p93/a317513 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>The governor presumably did as he was told. Two months later a check from Singer was [banked for $250,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p133/a317515 \u201cGuardian\u201d). </p> <p>What particularly caught the attention of the prosecutors was that when the money came in it did not go directly to Walker\u2019s personal campaign committee, Friends of Scott Walker. To do so would have been problematic, as any campaign committee directly linked to a candidate is limited in Wisconsin to accepting contributions of up to $43,000 that have to be fully disclosed. </p> <p>The prosecutors alleged in [court filings](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105201-2014-02-21-Schmitz-Memo.html#document/p14/a317779, \u201cGuardian\u201d) published here for the first time that Walker\u2019s campaign found a way around these restrictions by banking the corporate cash through the third-party group, Wisconsin Club for Growth. [WCfG](http://wicfg.com/) describes itself as a \u201cpro-liberty, pro-fiscal restraint\u201d organisation, sharing the same small government and anti-union ideology as Walker. It is a tax-exempt group, or 501 (c) (4), that is supposed to be primarily concerned with \u201csocial welfare\u201d rather than partisan politics and as such is not obliged to reveal its donors.</p> <p>In court submissions, the prosecutors alleged that Walker\u2019s campaign used WCfG as a shadow committee that allowed him to solicit large sums of corporate cash without scrutiny or accountability. \u201cContributions were personally solicited by Governor Scott Walker to WCfG ... in order to circumvent the reporting and contributions provisions of Wisconsin statutes,\u201d an investigator working for the [prosecutors in the John Doe investigation, Robert Stelter, alleged.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105192-2013-08-29-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p77/a317542 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>A good example of the way things worked was the donation made by Donald Trump. On 3 April 2012, two months before the governor faced the electorate, Walker flew to New York for a rapid-fire string of fundraising meetings with big money interests.</p> <p>He travelled the length of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, making stops at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, a hedge fund, a corporate law firm, and the residence of publishing tycoon Steve Forbes. He also [enjoyed a 45-minute audience with Trump](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p9/a317522 \u201cGuardian\u201d) in his Fifth Avenue lair.</p> <p>There is no record of the conversation between the two men. But it appears to have been a warm encounter, as the John Doe files show that Trump [wrote a check for $15,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p11/a317523 \u201cGuardian\u201d) on the same day. Who was the beneficiary of Trump\u2019s generosity? Wisconsin Club for Growth.</p> <p>Another example of the pattern is the casual comment Walker dropped into an email to his fundraiser dated 14 June 2011: [\u201cAlso, I got $1m from John Menard today\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105980-Fundraising-Coordination.html#document/p8 \u201cGuardian\u201d) Eight days later [a check for $1m](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p53/a317694 \u201cGuardian\u201d) is cut on a corporate check of Menard Inc, the billionaire John Menard\u2019s home improvement chain Menards, and made out not to the governor\u2019s campaign committee but to Wisconsin Club for Growth. There the donation remained a secret until the publication of the Guardian\u2019s leaked files.</p> <p>Friends of Scott Walker, Wisconsin Club for Growth and other parties named in the John Doe investigation have all vigorously denied any legal violations. They point out that no charges have been brought against any subject of the inquiries.</p> <p>John Fadness, spokesman for the Scott Walker campaign, told the Guardian: \u201cAs widely reported two years ago, the prosecutor\u2019s attorney stated that Governor Walker was not a target. Several courts shut down the baseless investigation on multiple occasions, and there is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing.\u201d </p> <p>In June 2014, the special prosecutor Schmitz [said through a lawyer](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/scott-walker-not-a-target-john-doe-special-prosecutor-says/article_9d5579ed-039d-5f22-ac98-947469c3c22d.html) that Walker was not a target of his John Doe investigation. Yet legal documents contained in the John Doe files identify as the anonymous [\u201cMovant No. 1\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105199-2014-2-21-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p15 \u201cGuardian\u201d) of the investigation \u201cFriends of Scott Walker, the personal campaign committee of Scott Walker.\u201d </p> <p>David Rivkin, the attorney representing Wisconsin Club for Growth and its director Eric O\u2019Keefe, said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cAs the Wisconsin Supreme Court explained, the John Doe prosecutors made up crimes \u2018that do not exist\u2019 under Wisconsin law in order to target \u2018citizens who were wholly innocent of any wrongdoing.\u2019 Because the U.S. Supreme Court does not review matters of state law, it should be obvious that the John Doe prosecutors\u2019 appeal is legally frivolous and just another publicity stunt intended to tarnish their targets\u2019 reputations and salvage their own.\u201d</p> <p>Further insight into the position of the subjects of the investigation \u2013 the \u201cmovants\u201d as they are technically known \u2013 is given in court papers including in the Guardian\u2019s [John Doe Files.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105213-WICFG-Motion-Quash.html \u201cGuardian\u201d) They criticise the prosecutors for making fundamental mistakes in their reading of campaign finance law. They said that regulatory restrictions on the size and source of donations only applied to groups that were expressly advocating for or against a named political candidate.</p> <p>WCfG\u2019s director Eric O\u2019Keefe [said in an affidavit](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105216-WICFG-Quash-Aff.html \u201cGuardian\u201d) that the club\u2019s involvement had stemmed purely from its commitment to \u201cadvancing liberty and fiscal responsibility\u201d. Its role in the recall elections was \u201cto educate Wisconsin citizens ... The Club paid for advertisements that advanced its pro-liberty, fiscal responsibility, pro-Act 10 beliefs. None of the advertisements expressly urged voters to vote for or against any candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The movants also complained that in issuing over-broad subpoenas for evidence and conducting [pre-dawn raids](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/417155/wisonsins-shame-i-thought-it-was-home-invasion-david-french) on the homes of some individuals, the prosecutors strayed well beyond their legitimate powers and into the realm of governmental abuse.</p> <p>In the course of the John Doe investigation, the prosecutors obtained hundreds of emails and bank records under subpoena. An email sent by Kate Doner, Walker\u2019s fundraiser, in April 2011, summed up the strategy. She said the aim was to raise $9m in six weeks, to pay for political advertising \u2013 she called it \u201cissue advocacy efforts\u201d \u2013 in the senatorial recall races. </p> <p>Walker, she said, wants all the ads [\u201crun thru one group to ensure correct messaging\u201d,](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p33 \u201cGuardian\u201d) and that group, the governor declared, should be Wisconsin Club for Growth. \u201cThe Governor is encouraging all to invest in the Wisconsin Club for Growth [which] can accept Corporate and Personal donations without limitations and no donors disclosure.\u201d</p> <p>The email trail shows a pattern of behavior developing: Walker meets up with big corporate donors and encourages them to contribute unlimited sums of money through WCfG in secret, then shortly after the checks start to flow. In June 2011, the emails show, the governor had dinner with the CEO of the largest privately owned trucking company in the US, Schneider National, in the hope of getting him and his peers to donate $250,000. </p> <p>\u201cStress the donations to WiCFG are not disclosed and can accept Corporate donations without limits,\u201d [Walker\u2019s talking points said.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p42/a317530 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>Two checks are recorded in the John Doe files from Schneider, [both made out to WCfG and totalling $65,000](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p1 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>The Schneider checks, like several others included in the files, were cut on corporate checks in the name of the company itself. It has long been a rule under [Wisconsin state law](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/11/XI/1112), commonly known as the \u201ccorporate ban\u201d, that corporations are not allowed to make direct political donations; they are only allowed to fund third-party groups that have to be fully independent of candidates, or spend money themselves on political TV advertising so long as the expenditure is declared.</p> <p>Some of those checks are published by the Guardian today, redacted to remove bank numbers. The Guardian has also redacted other documents in the files to remove personal information such as cellphone numbers and private home addresses. Personal email addresses have also been redacted unless they have already been put into the public domain, as in the case of Scott Walker\u2019s own [personal email address](http://watchdog.org/244820/scott-fitzgerald-john-doe-conservatives/). </p> <p>The John Doe files reveal that Walker\u2019s own advisers reached the conclusion that the large sums flowing into WCfG\u2019s coffers from corporate donors was critical to the survival of the Republican senators in their recall elections. In a memo sent to Walker shortly after the elections in August 2011, his former top campaign consultant RJ Johnson looked back on the contest and ruminated that \u201cOur efforts were run by Wisconsin Club for Growth ... who coordinated spending through 12 different groups. Most spending by other groups was directly funded by grants from the Club.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to note that WCfG \u201craised 12 million dollars and ran a soup to nuts campaign ... Polling, focus groups and message development was a collaborative effort.\u201d A mass of micro-targeted mail-outs and TV advertising that was bought with the donations had the impact that they [\u201cmoved independent swing voters to the GOP candidate\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p56/a317535 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>The collaboration set up in 2011 was successful in helping four of the six Republican senators fend off the recall challenge and keep their jobs \u2013 allowing them to hang onto their senate majority by one vote. Act 10 was safeguarded for the moment, and in a gesture of gratitude Walker himself was moved to ask an aide shortly after the vote: [\u201cDid I send out thank you notes to all of our c(4) donors?\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105983-2013-09-16-Exhibits-41.html#document/p129 \u201cGuardian\u201d) </p> <p>Supporters of Governor Walker and the outside groups that worked with him, including some prominent media outlets such as the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hyperventilating-in-wisconsin-over-scott-walkers-fund-raising-1408920214), argue that the prosecutors were mistaken in their view that the coordinated activities amounted to a violation of campaign finance law. They point out that nobody in the governor\u2019s circle has been charged with any alleged violation relating to the recall elections, and argue that WCfG and the other outside groups engaged in advocacy over issues related to the elections, which is not subject to restrictions, as opposed to express advocacy on behalf of one political candidate or another. </p> <p>They also insist, using a complex formula related to the electoral calendar, that Walker only became an official candidate on 9 April 2012. Any actions he and his associates took before then were not subject to restrictions, [they argued](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105212-FOSW-Notice-Appear.html#document/p10, \u201cGuardian\u201d). To which the prosecutors replied that Walker\u2019s campaign committee had been frantically fundraising and coordinating long before that date.</p> <p>The John Doe files do contain some evidence that Walker\u2019s senior team attempted to maintain a firewall between candidate and outside interests after that date. On 19 April, the lead adviser to the governor\u2019s recall campaign, Keith Gilkes, replied to a group of businesses wanting to put up billboards supporting Walker\u2019s candidacy: \u201cI cannot have any comment on this \u2013 it is an [independent expenditure](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105981-Ad-Coordination.html#document/p40/a317537, \u201cGuardian\u201d) separate from the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>But the files also contain documents that show that RJ Johnson, a prominent political strategist in Wisconsin who worked closely with Walker for many years, and Johnson\u2019s business partner Deborah Jordahl, were simultaneously arranging political ad spending on TV and radio for both Walker\u2019s campaign and the outside lobbying groups. On 23 April 2012 [Johnson emailed Gilkes](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p45/a317539, \u201cGuardian\u201d) about a Walker ad that he was putting out for the recall election; a week later [Johnson and Jordahl were emailing](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p47/a317540, \u201cGuardian\u201d) each other about radio ad spending on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth.</p> <p>That lead the special prosecutor, Francis Schmitz, to conclude that \u201ca review of email reflects that RJ Johnson ... [was involved](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105192-2013-08-29-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p99/a317541, \u201cGuardian\u201d) in the media buys on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth and Friends of Scott Walker.\u201d</p> <p>Neither RJ Johnson nor Deborah Jordahl immediately responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>Until the US supreme court indicates later this month whether or not it will intervene in the John Doe case, the question of the legality of the Walker network and the coordination that it involved will hang in the balance. The Wisconsin supreme court was firm on the issue: in its [July 2015 ruling](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;amp;seqNo=144525), the court castigated Schmitz for instigating a \u201cperfect storm of wrongs that was visited upon the innocent Unnamed Movants and those who dared to associate with them.\u201d</p> <p>In colorful language, the state\u2019s highest court praised Walker, WCfG and other movants in the investigation (it didn\u2019t name them, but [their identities](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105199-2014-2-21-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p15/a317721, \u201cGuardian\u201d) are self-evident from the John Doe files as \u201cbrave individuals\u201d. It said they had \u201cplayed a crucial role in presenting this court with an opportunity to re-endorse its commitment to upholding the fundamental right of each and every citizen to engage in lawful political activity and to do so free from the fear of the tyrannical retribution of arbitrary or capricious governmental prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>For good measure, the court added: \u201cLet one point be clear: our conclusion today ends this unconstitutional John Doe investigation.\u201d</p> <p>That point is certainly clear, unless the US supreme court, which has the final say in any matter of constitutional law, decides otherwise. The nation\u2019s highest court has been asked to take the prosecutors\u2019 petition by an alliance of campaign-finance monitoring groups, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Brennan Center and Common Cause.</p> <p>In their petition, the prosecutors ask the US supreme court justices to consider whether Wisconsin\u2019s top judicial panel was truly objective in reaching its decision to shut them down. \u201cIs the state as a litigant in an adversary proceeding entitled to a hearing before a panel of impartial justices, free of bias?\u201d, the prosecutors ask. </p> <p>Protecting Walker\u2019s agenda</p> <p>The John Doe files obtained by the Guardian give clues as to why the prosecutors have raised doubts about impartiality in the state courts. They suggest that two of the conservative judges on Wisconsin\u2019s top court who voted to halt the John Doe investigation may have themselves been intimately connected to the same campaigning network of rightwing politicians, lobbyists and major donors that the prosecutors were investigating.</p> <p>Take David Prosser. He was one of the four conservative judges who approved the [July 2015 ruling](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;amp;seqNo=144525) that terminated the John Doe investigation, sacked Schmitz from his position as special prosecutor and ordered the destruction of all the documents that had been collected (later that order was softened a little to a demand that the prosecutors hand in all the documents to the court which would keep them secret under seal). </p> <p>At precisely the same time as the six Republican senators were embroiled in their recall election, Prosser was in his own electoral fight for survival. He was up for re-election in April 2011 and facing a tough challenge from JoAnne Kloppenburg, then Wisconsin\u2019s assistant attorney general. The Prosser election and the recall election were intertwined in that Kloppenburg was attempting to turn her battle against Prosser into a [referendum on Governor Walker\u2019s](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/us/politics/05wisconsin.html) anti-union legislation, Act 10.</p> <p>Among the leaked John Doe files that the Wisconsin supreme court ordered to be suppressed are documents that underline how anxious Walker\u2019s circle were about the threat, as they saw it, to the court\u2019s conservative majority. In an email dated 14 December 2010, WCfG\u2019s director Eric O\u2019Keefe says he\u2019s been [in touch with Diane Hendricks](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317543, \u201cGuardian\u201d), the owner of a roofing company who Forbes describes as America\u2019s richest self-made woman with a personal fortune of $5bn. Hendricks is a well-known funder of rightwing causes and individuals, among them Scott Walker himself who she was to go on to support with [$500,000](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html) in 2012 for his own recall election.</p> <p>Hendricks has also popped up as part of the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Trump recently added [her to his inner team](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2016/08/11/trump-adds-richest-self-made-woman-diane-hendricks-to-economic-advisory-team/#29c3bf15392c) of economic advisers, having come under fire for only appointing men.</p> <p>[\u201cI have traded emails with diane hendricks,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317543, \u201cGuardian\u201d) O\u2019Keefe says in the email. \u201cShe is concerned about the state s. Ct.\u201d </p> <p>Hendricks was right to be concerned about the state supreme court. Were Prosser to lose the vote, the consequences for Walker and his entire rightwing union-bashing agenda would have been devastating. The four-to-three, conservative-to-liberal, balance of the state\u2019s top court would have been reversed, allowing progressive groups to overturn the reforms through legal challenges.</p> <p>The correspondence reveals how Walker\u2019s network of associates vowed to go to work to keep Prosser in his job, and thus preserve (or \u201cmaintain\u201d) the court\u2019s conservative upper hand. \u201cIt would be good for [Hendricks] to [talk with us or have her see our plan,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) writes RJ Johnson, the then \u201cgeneral consultant\u201d to Governor Walker\u2019s campaign committee.

Thus far I have [raised 450k](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) and am looking to raise an additional 409k.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson name-checks other [sources of big money donations](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) that he intends to tap. Leo Leonard of the conservative legal group the Federalist Society was looking for an extra $200,000, he says, and there were hopes for a further $1m from the US Chamber of Commerce. </p> <p>He wasn\u2019t bragging. As election day approached, money from rightwing lobby groups and corporations began to pour into Wisconsin, unseen by the public, as the message got out that Prosser\u2019s salvation was a necessary step to safeguarding Walker\u2019s radical rightwing reforms and Act 10.</p> <p>An email from March 2011, just two months after Walker took office as governor and a month before Prosser was tested at the polls, makes the point. It\u2019s from Matt Seaholm, state director of Americans For Prosperity (AFP), the Tea Party-affiliated group founded and funded by the billionaire rightwing Koch brothers. </p> <p>By now the anxiety surrounding the fate of the Wisconsin supreme court judge, David Prosser, is growing more intense. \u201cThis could stop everything that Walker is trying to accomplish and [the unions] know it. Goes without saying, that would be a bad thing,\u201d [Seaholm says](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105950-Strategy-Coordination.html#document/p7/a317545, \u201cGuardian\u201d), writing to Tim Phillips, AFP\u2019s national president. </p> <p>By 20 March, two weeks before the election, worry is distilling into panic. Brian Fraley of the Wisconsin-based conservative think-tank the MacIver Institute, shoots an impassioned plea for help to what he calls his \u201cgroup\u201d of like-minded lobbying groups and individuals, forwarded to Walker\u2019s chief of staff and other top advisers in Madison.</p> <p>[\u201cDavid Prosser is in trouble,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105957-Prosser.html#document/p6/a317546, \u201cGuardian\u201d) Fraley begins. \u201cAnd if we lose him, the Walker agenda is toast, as could be the Senate GOP majority and any successes creating a new redistricted map. That\u2019s not hyperbole.\u201d </p> <p>By the end of the bitter campaign, some $3.5m was spent by outside lobby groups channeling undisclosed corporate money to support Prosser\u2019s re-election \u2013 more than eight times the $400,000 the judge was allowed to spend himself. That included $1.5m from WCfG and its offshoot Citizens for a Strong America, and $2m from Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce (WMC), all of it in unaccountable \u201cdark money\u201d.</p> <p>It worked. [Prosser was re-elected](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/122364728.html), with a squeaky-tight margin of just 7,000 votes and after a fraught recount. The following month, Walker boasted to the Republican kingmaker, Karl Rove, \u201cClub for Growth\u2013Wisconsin was the [key to retaining Justice Prosser](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105957-Prosser.html#document/p18/a317547, \u201cGuardian\u201d). </p> <p>Act 10 was safe.</p> <p>Both of the two outside groups that channeled the recall election money (WCfG and WMC) are named as \u201cmovants\u201d of the John Doe criminal investigation into alleged campaign finance violations that was shut down under the court ruling that Prosser, having won re-election in no small part with their help, joined. Yet when it was suggested to Prosser and a second conservative judge on the court, Justice Michael Gableman, that they should recuse themselves from deliberations in the case, they both [refused](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/david-prosser-says-he-doesnt-need-to-step-aside-in-walker-probe-b99547465z1-319731971.html).</p> <p>In their [petition](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) to the US supreme court, the prosecutors challenge that refusal, arguing that \u201cthe special prosecutor did not receive a fair and impartial hearing\u201d. The petitioners go on to discuss Prosser in detail, but the passage is so heavily redacted that their argument is obscured. [They do say](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) at one point, quoting constitutional law, that \u201cNo jurist \u2018can be a judge in his own case or be permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Prosser declined to step aside citing a rule change that had been suggested and partially written by WMC itself. The change removed the obligation of supreme court judges in Wisconsin to recuse themselves in cases involving groups that had helped them secure their own elections.</p> <p>Kurt Bauer, WMC\u2019s president and CEO, declined to comment on the John Doe proceedings. But he stressed that the organization\u2019s \u201cgrassroots lobbying activities are conducted carefully within both the letter and the spirit of the state law. WMC strongly disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and will vigorously defend itself against such allegations.\u201d</p> <p>Bauer added that WMC was an independent group that was not controlled by any candidate or candidate\u2019s campaign. \u201cWMC will not allow itself to be silenced from commenting about public officials and public policy. WMC has long been a proponent of the First Amendment and has a history of fighting to protect its ability to publicly express its views. WMC maintains that commitment to protecting its right to express a point of view on public policy, public officials and candidates for office as well as protecting the confidentiality of its donors.\u201d</p> <p>In a telephone interview with the Guardian, Prosser, who retired from the state supreme court in July, said that in his view sufficient time had passed between his re-election in 2011 and the judgment in the John Doe case in 2015 for any potential conflict of interest to fade. \u201cIf this had been a year after the contributions I think I would have had to withdraw, but it was four years. There was no expectation on the part of recipient or givers that the contributions were designed to effect litigation, and so the contributions raised no questions whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>Prosser said that at the time of his re-election he was facing hostile TV ads that falsely tried to link him to Walker\u2019s contentious anti-union legislation Act 10, while he himself was unable directly to solicit large amounts of campaign contributions under new strict fundraising limits imposed by an earlier Democratic-controlled legislature. \u201cI certainly expected Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce sooner or later to put some money into my campaign. Of course I was going to hope that somebody would come in and defend me because I was unable to defend myself.\u201d</p> <p>But the judge stressed that the only spending involved came from \u201cthird parties in which no one on my campaign knew they were coming, didn\u2019t ask for them, and frankly if they hadn\u2019t come I would have been blown out of the water by false advertising\u201d.</p> <p>Last year Prosser issued a [12-page justification](http://media.jrn.com/documents/prosserrecusal.pdf) of his refusal to recuse himself from the John Doe case. In it, he made reference to an email from an \u201cUnnamed Petitioner\u201d that discussed raising money for a campaign \u201cto maintain the Court\u201d. The judge said the comment was \u201clittle more than evidence of the fact that some targets of the investigation ... engaged in expenditures that, under all the circumstances, were very valuable to my campaign.\u201d </p> <p>Just two weeks before writing that sentence, Judge Prosser had approved the court ruling that ordered the destruction of the John Doe files, among which was to be found the very same email to which he referred. The Guardian now publishes that [full email](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14, \u201cGuardian\u201d) for the first time, and as a result the identity of the anonymous \u201cUnnamed Petitioner\u201d who vowed to \u201cmaintain the Court\u201d can be revealed: RJ Johnson, \u201cgeneral consultant\u201d to the governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker.</p> <p>Why it matters</p> <p>So why should we care about today\u2019s fiendishly complicated ways of funding elections? After all, isn\u2019t it a cornerstone of American democracy that everybody should be able to express themselves, under the first amendment right of free speech, after which the American people gets to have the final say at the ballot box?</p> <p>One area of possible concern raised by the John Doe files chimes with the anger and disgruntlement of voters that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have so powerfully articulated in the presidential race. If money channels are set up in secret to allow corporations and the super-wealthy to inject vast amounts of undisclosed cash into political races, the level playing field can be distorted to the benefit of corporate-friendly candidates and to the disadvantage of those representing ordinary voters.</p> <p>By the end of Scott Walker\u2019s recall election, some [$81m overall](http://www.wisdc.org/pr072512.php) was spent on the battle \u2013 equivalent to $23 for every registered voter in the state. The governor and other Republican groups and committees invested $58.7m, while his Democratic rival and supporters were only able to muster less than half that amount, $21.9m. </p> <p>\u201cThe sheer increased volume of corporate money that has been brought into elections in recent years may go more on one side than the other,\u201d explained Richard Briffault, a professor specialising in campaign finance law at Columbia law school. \u201cCorporations tend to lean more Republican.\u201d</p> <p>Briffault added that the proliferation in the modern era of outside \u201csocial welfare\u201d 501 (c) (4) organisations \u2013 the tax-exempt status enjoyed by Wisconsin Club for Growth \u2013 also raised the possibility that political donations would go hidden. As tax-exempt groups that are supposed not to be primarily political in their orientation, they do not have to disclose their donors.</p> <p>\u201cThat can be a very good device for hiding the participation of wealthy individuals,\u201d Briffault said.</p> <p>The other great anxiety addressed by campaign finance regulations is the potential for corruption. The US supreme court has said in rulings going back decades that the first amendment right to free speech is tempered by the need to protect against cash-for-favors. The court has repeatedly stated that elected officials must avoid not only the reality of corruption in their dealings with donors, but also any appearance of corruption, because even a suggestion that dollars might have been exchanged for political favors has the ability to undermine public faith in democracy.</p> <p>The justices use the legalistic phrase: quid pro quo. Literally that means \u201cthis for that\u201d; colloquially, it\u2019s the idea that if you scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours.</p> <p>Paradoxically, one of the most robust statements made by the US supreme court justices about the dangers of real or apparent quid pro quo was made in [Citizens United](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBgsCF8enOAhUBLhQKHYnsBJAQFggeMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.supremecourt.gov%2Fopinions%2F09pdf%2F08-205.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF2hn4fN946L-Ma8WV0AHhWPW0oKQ&amp;amp;sig2=-JV0qIhMiqsYCaGDRth_wg&amp;amp;cad=rja), their highly contentious 2010 ruling. [Citizens United](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/08-205P.ZO) extended to for-profit corporations and labor unions the same first amendments rights to engage in elections that had hitherto been enjoyed by individuals. </p> <p>Corporations were essentially treated for the first time as though they were people. Together with the related ruling in [Speechnow.org](http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/speechnow.shtml), the supreme court paved the way for the creation of Super Pacs that can make unlimited spending on political advertising to help their preferred candidates into office.</p> <p>What is less well known about Citizens United is that in it, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the opinion, addressed head-on the fear that unlimited corporate cash would lead to an explosion in real or perceived corruption in the political system. He stated forcefully that there was no danger of corruption if one important condition was met: that corporations kept their distance from the candidates they were supporting and remained fully independent of the candidates\u2019 campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cBy definition,\u201d Kennedy wrote, \u201can independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\u201d Such separation was necessary, he added, to avoid the risk that unlimited secret donations are given \u201cas a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate\u201d.</p> <p>The problem is that the US supreme court has never defined in detail what precisely it means by \u201ccoordination\u201d between a candidate\u2019s campaign and outside groups, preferring to leave the fine print to lower courts and state legislatures. Most of the legal emphasis on coordination is on actual spending on political TV and radio ads, while the other end of the money chain \u2013 fundraising by candidates from big corporate donors channeled through third-party \u201cdark money\u201d groups that do not have to disclose their sources of income \u2013 is largely unregulated. The lack of firm rules has left players in the election game relatively free to act as they wish \u2013 one reason why prosecutions are so rarely brought, or if they are, ever completed. </p> <p>The outcome of this legal fuzziness is clearly evident in Wisconsin, where the John Doe investigation has been halted before it could even reach a decision on whether or not a full criminal inquiry was merited. That remains the legal standing of the case at present, pending the US supreme court\u2019s decision.</p> <p>But a moral question continues to hang in the air. If, as Kennedy put it, even the appearance of quid quo pro must be avoided to uphold trust in democracy, does the light shone on the modern American way of staging elections by the John Doe files leaked to the Guardian give cause for public concern?</p> <p>The lead paint mystery</p> <p>The strange case of lead paint might help answer that question. Lead, as the [terrible events](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/lead-drinking-water-level-nrdc-report-flint-crisis) of Flint, Michigan, have shown, is a potent poison that can seriously impair the intellectual ability of young children. The Flint health crisis was caused by contaminated water, but another peril to public health is the presence of the toxin in household paint before 1978, when it was banned in the US.</p> <p>The John Doe files reveal that the billionaire owner of NL Industries, one of America\u2019s leading producers of lead used in paint until the ban, secretly donated $750,000 to Wisconsin Club for Growth at a time when Walker and his fellow Republican senators were fighting their recall elections. Also in the same time-frame, the Republican-controlled senate passed, and Walker signed into law, legal changes that attempted to grant effective immunity to lead manufacturers from any compensation claims for lead paint poisoning.</p> <p>Since the laws were passed, the federal courts have stepped in and [overturned](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/appeals-court-reinstates-wisconsin-lead-paint-suit-b99317605z1-268494482.html) [key elements](http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/news/304161421.html) of them, leaving NL Industries \u2013 or National Lead Company as it was once known \u2013 still facing many legal challenges. But the point remains: had the new provisions been allowed to stand, they had the potential to save the company and others like it millions of dollars in damages.</p> <p>Lawyers working on the lawsuits argue that at stake were the rights of hundreds of children from poor urban areas whose lives were devastated by lead poisoning inhaled from paint when they were growing up. \u201cThese children were perfectly innocent. They entered life with all the gifts and health that God gave them and were devastated by this neurotoxin,\u201d said Peter Earle, the principal attorney on 171 cases that are currently ongoing against NL Industries and other former manufacturers of lead paint.</p> <p>The owner of NL Industries, Harold Simmons, made the [undisclosed payments to WCfG](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p5, \u201cGuardian\u201d) in three tranches between April 2011 and January 2012, precisely when the GOP senators and then Walker were facing a fight-to-the-death at the ballot box. </p> <p>Simmons, who died a year after Walker won his recall election, was a prominent funder of rightwing causes who, along with Donald Trump, was [reprimanded](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-18/news/mn-12355_1_contribution-limits) by the Federal Election Commission in the 1990s for exceeding legal limits of political campaign contributions. He [bankrolled with $3m](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=201041228&amp;cycle=2004) the notorious Swift Boat smear campaign against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election that erroneously questioned the current secretary of state\u2019s Vietnam war record.</p> <p>Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature made an initial attempt to change the law on the liability of lead paint producers shortly after Walker became governor. As the name implied, Act 2 was one of his opening gambits that he rammed through the legislature in less than a month after he came to office in January 2011. </p> <p>One of Act 2\u2019s key provisions was to tighten tort law to make it much more difficult for lead victims to sue. Under its terms, anyone injured by lead paint who wanted to issue a new lawsuit had to prove that the company they were taking on was responsible for making the specific paint that was on their walls at the time they inhaled the toxin \u2013 a practically impossible task given the number of different manufacturers and the layer-upon-layer of paint on the walls of old houses. </p> <p>The measure in effect granted immunity to NL Industries and other lead producers from any new claims for compensation. </p> <p>Less than three months after the law was enacted, Simmons arranged for the [first and largest check](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p5, \u201cGuardian\u201d) \u2013 of $500,000 \u2013 to be paid directly from Contran Corporation, his business empire, to Wisconsin Club for Growth. It landed at the time that the six senators were in their recall battles.</p> <p>Later that year, Walker\u2019s interest in soliciting more money from Simmons for use in his own personal recall election is made plain in an email among the John Doe files dated 14 November 2011. It was written by Keith Gilkes, Walker\u2019s then senior campaign adviser. </p> <p>The email was sent just one day before opponents of the governor formally triggered the recall procedure, putting Walker\u2019s job on the line. Gilkes rehearsed the names of several wealthy donors to hit up for donations, singling out Simmons and [\u201cSheldon Aldenhouse\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p61/a317549, \u201cGuardian\u201d), presumably a garbling of the name of Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate who later [donated $200,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p74/a317508, \u201cGuardian\u201d) to bolster Walker\u2019s recall chances.</p> <p>The Gilkes memo sets out for Walker some of the \u201cred flags\u201d associated with Simmons and other potential corporate donors \u201cso you are aware of what you might need to defend in terms of contributions from donors when these are disclosed\u201d. He [warns Walker](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p72/a317550, \u201cGuardian\u201d) that Simmons had a controversial track record for reportedly dumping toxic waste in Texas. Gilkes pointed to [an article](http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2010/february/harold-simmons-is-dallas-most-evil-genius/) by Dallas Magazine in which the billionaire was dubbed \u201cDallas\u2019 most evil genius\u201d. The memo also notes that Simmons avoided having to pay millions of dollars in damages to pay for medical treatment for child victims of lead poisoning in Wisconsin\u2019s largest city Milwaukee after an appeals court cleared NL Industries of causing a public nuisance and dismissed a lawsuit brought by the city for [$52.6m](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/35084654.html).</p> <p>The leaked John Doe files do not record what conclusion Walker and his chief adviser reached about Simmons when they discussed him as a potential donor. What the documents do reveal is that only a month later, a [second corporate check](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p6, \u201cGuardian\u201d) from Contran Corporation for $100,000 was sent to WCfG.</p> <p>The third and final [check from Simmons](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p6, \u201cGuardian\u201d) for $150,000, also made out to WCfG, was cut the following month from his own personal account.</p> <p>At this point, the Wisconsin legislature and Governor Walker made a renewed pitch to change the law to the benefit of NL Industries and other historic manufacturers of lead paint. They had already passed Act 2, but that only covered new claims, leaving the company still facing a mountain of lawsuits that were already ongoing.</p> <p>So the legislators had another go. In the same month as the third check landed, senate Republicans introduced a bill that would make the effective immunity for former lead paint manufacturers retroactive, thereby scuppering all existing lawsuits. </p> <p>That attempt failed to pass the Wisconsin legislature. But even then the Republican group did not give up. In 2013, after all the recall elections had been fought and won, partly with the benefit of Harold Simmons\u2019 support, the legislators tried one more time to pass a bill making the immunity retroactive.</p> <p>They did so with a great deal of encouragement from NL Industries. Earle, the lawyer acting for victims, has discovered under freedom of information laws that the firm employed a professional lobbyists for [330 hours](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036372-GAB-Lobbying-Summary-Table.html), at a cost of $172,500, to persuade the Wisconsin legislature to pass the retroactive immunity bill.</p> <p>Another [Foia document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036374-EP-Memo.html#document/p5/a316185) shows that NL Industries\u2019 lobbyist directly suggested to the Republican leader in the state senate the language that should be added to existing law to make the effective immunity retroactive. The lobbyist encouraged the Republicans to write four words into an amendment that would apply the new immunity protections to all negligence lawsuits \u201cwhenever filed or accrued\u201d. </p> <p>Two months later GOP senators slipped into a [budget bill](http://www.twincities.com/2013/06/06/wisconsin-civil-litigation-provision-angers-attorney-pursuing-lead-paint-claims/) an amendment that contained the same four words proposed by NL Industries: \u201cwhenever filed or accrued\u201d. The amendment was introduced after midnight just before the bill was finalized. It can be found by anyone who looks hard enough on [page 548 of a 603-page bill](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036359-Exhibit-8-2013-WI-Act-20-Biennial-Budget.html#document/p548/a316191) that Scott Walker duly signed into law. </p> <p>NL Industries used the amendment to press for dismissal of the negligence lawsuits it was facing. But the move failed. A federal appeals court stepped in and ruled that such a retroactive granting of corporate immunity was a violation of the US constitution.</p> <p>It is perhaps worth asking what it would have meant for the victims had the amendment stood. Victims like Yasmine Clark, one of the plaintiffs. She suffered such severe poisoning from lead inhaled from residential paint in her home in Milwaukee that she was hospitalized twice, when she was two years old and again when she was five. </p> <p>When she was at rock bottom, Clark was found to have a lead level in her blood of [48 micrograms per deciliter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036375-Mushak-Report-3-13-10-Copy-1.html#document/p6/a316189) and had to undergo chelation therapy to remove the toxins. To give a sense of what that meant, doctors in Flint, Michigan, sounded the alarm after children were found to have levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter from polluted water supplies \u2013 about one-tenth of Clark\u2019s concentration.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s negligence suit, and 170 other cases like hers, are still ongoing against NL Industries and other former manufacturers of lead pigment paint. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to shut me down,\u201d Earle said.</p> <p>\u201cYasmine is a victim of egregiously vindictive behavior by these corporations,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cThe idea of freedom in the US is that no matter how poor you are you have the opportunity to surmount those disadvantages, and these lead companies took that opportunity away from her.\u201d</p> <p>As for Scott Walker, Earle said: \u201cThe governor has chosen to ignore the children and instead fought tooth and nail for the corporations that did this. I don\u2019t have words to describe that conduct.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Walker\u2019s campaign did not respond to Guardian questions relating to its relationship with NL Industries. NL Industries itself, and Contran Corporation, did not respond to numerous invitations to comment.</p> <p>As researchers pore over the Guardian\u2019s leaked John Doe files, seeking light amid the darkness of today\u2019s political process, they may ponder the lead paint mystery. There is no evidence that Wisconsin Republicans led by Scott Walker attempted to change the law as a favor in return for Simmons\u2019 $750,000 donation that had helped some of them win their own elections and stay in office. No charges have ever been brought.</p> <p>But is there even the slightest appearance of quid pro quo? And if potentially there is, should that be a matter that the American people care about? Give the last words to Donald Trump, the presidential nominee of Scott Walker\u2019s Grand Old Party: \u201cWhen you give to them, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian US interactive team is Aliza Aufrichtig, Kenan Davis, Jan Diehm, Rich Harris and Nadja Popovich.<br></p> <p>Additional research by Lauren Leatherby, Nicole Puglise and Mazin Sidahmed.</p> </noscript> </figure>",
  "<p>Annuities have suffered their worst year on record, with payouts to newly retiring pensioners falling by 15% so far during 2016, according to data provider Moneyfacts.<br></p> <p>Annuities are an income for life, whereby those retiring can swap their pension savings accumulated while at work for an agreed fixed income, paid out every year until they die. </p> <p>Purchasing an annuity was compulsory for most savers until former chancellor George Osborne stunned the \u00a312bn-a-year industry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/14/pension-companies-stopping-retirees-access-savings\">freeing retirees</a><a> to do what they liked</a> with their money.</p> <p>Moneyfacts said that the average annuity income for a 65-year-old had fallen by 14.8% on a \u00a310,000 purchase price and by 15% on a \u00a350,000 purchase price so far in 2016. The figures are based on a pensioner buying a flat-rate annuity that does not increase with inflation. <br></p> <p>Annuity rates are largely influenced by two factors: interest rates and the longevity prospects of the population. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England base rate cut</a> after the Brexit vote and the prospect of negative interest rates have pushed the incomes paid on annuities to levels unthinkable even a few years ago.</p> <p>Richard Eagling of Moneyfacts said: \u201c2016 has been a truly awful year for annuities, with rates falling to all-time lows. This is particularly disappointing as the stock market volatility that we are experiencing has re-emphasised the importance of a secure lifetime income for many retirees.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, record low gilt yields following the EU referendum result, the impact of Solvency II legislation and a significant weakening of competition in the annuity market have all exerted considerable downward pressure on annuity rates during 2016.\u201d<br></p> <p>The falls in annuity rates easily surpass the previous largest annual annuity income drop of 11.5% recorded in 2012. </p> <p>Moneyfacts said that although there were more than three months of the year remaining, it was unlikely that the current economic environment would facilitate a strong enough recovery in annuity rates to avoid it picking up the tag of being the worst ever year for annuity rates.</p> <p>Workers reaching retirement age without the protection of a salary-based pension have to rely on what they can earn from their savings. Under new pension freedom rules, they are allowed to access their pension savings from the age of 55, but need to closely examine the tax implications. </p> <p>Most financial advisers reckon that a safe level of draw-down from savings is around 4% a year. But this suggests that a pensioner needs to accumulate \u00a3250,000 in savings to be sure of an income of \u00a310,000 a year. </p>",

It worked. The cooks and cleaners began to feel like soldiers. White commanders, under political pressure to let black troops do more, let Morris form a 20-strong test platoon. </p> <p>White soldiers wagered that black soldiers wouldn\u2019t jump from planes. But in early 1944, 17 of the 20 graduated, followed a short while later by six black officers. Other black troops flocked to join them \u2013 a $50 monthly salary bonus helped \u2013 and the 555th parachute infantry company, later expanded to a battalion, was born. It was called the Triple Nickles because of its numerical designation. </p> <p>When German forces pushed back Americans in the <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/battle-of-the-bulge\">Battle of the Bulge</a>, the battalion braced for action and history.

Gamblers give winnings away, or leave slot machines loaded with credits. Sometimes people nod off at gaming machines, allowing men like Nattrour to withdraw cash vouchers on the sly.</p> <p>Yet there\u2019s an obvious dark side to trolling Las Vegas for cash \u2013 round-the-clock access to gambling, drinking and drugs .</p> <p>\u201cI should have been out of here a couple months ago.

I spent $60 of my [social security] check on dope and over $600 playing slot machines.\u201d</p> <p>After 16-years as a truck driver, Nattrour moved to Las Vegas when his wife died. Three months later, he was broke and homeless \u2013 sleeping on, then under, the street. \u201cI\u2019ve had some problems since I\u2019ve been down here,\u201d he admitted. \u201cLast month I put $400 into a video poker machine, and I never got a four of a kind!

For his part, Aitcheson says he moved here by choice, from Orlando, to enjoy the city\u2019s vices. \u201cTwenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, you can gamble, drink, smoke, get hookers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever you want is here in Vegas.\u201d</p> <p>Drug addiction is the most pernicious problem below ground, O\u2019Brien said, with tunnels often segregated by whether denizens prefer heroin, crack or meth.</p> <p>Like Nattrour, Aitcheson prefers gambling. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve walked into a casino with $20, hit $600, and spent every dime of it playing every other machine in the house,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lori Flores, clinic manager at the <a href=\"http://www.gamblingproblems.com/\">Problem Gambling Center</a> in Las Vegas, is familiar with that cycle.</p> <p>\u201cAt the beginning, before I stopped gambling, it was the only thing that gave me relief,\u201d she said, talking about casinos. \u201cI went there to not feel.

You have people that are using drugs to self-medicate.\u201d</p> <p>At the other end of the tunnel, was a man they called Jazz.

  "<p><br></p> <p>Holly Hunter in a cowboy hat and tank top shopping for groceries in a Georgia college town wasn\u2019t something I knew I needed to see until I saw it. Katherine Diekmann\u2019s Strange Weather is a fairly simple melodrama, and one that could use a few reminders that it is better to show not tell. But as a showcase it\u2019s a role that would fuel actors\u2019 dreams. It\u2019s the type of rich, nuanced, regional American indie that flourished in the 1990s (does anyone remember Peter Fonda in Ulee\u2019s Gold?), and while some may consider it a little out of date, I prefer to take the more optimistic view and say it\u2019s the continuation of a classic style.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/07/holly-hunter-five-best-moments-the-piano-raising-arizona\">Holly Hunter: five best moments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Darcy Baylor (Hunter) is a no-nonsense gal who gardens at night during the hot months and hangs a transistor radio from her truck\u2019s dashboard.

If nothing else, Strange Weather deserves huzzahs for showing that \u2013 gasp! \u2013 there are more than just angry Christian zealots, greedy conservatives or toothless rednecks in the American south. (Even though Obama got trounced in Georgia in 2012, t1.8 million people voted for him.)</p> <p>Darcy remains haunted by the death of her son Walker, who killed himself seven years before just as he was getting his masters in business.

Turns out he\u2019s a made a fortune in New Orleans running a chain of family restaurants (make-your-own hot dogs) which was actually Walker\u2019s idea.

When she finally gets to his blandly decorated office suite, Strange Weather suddenly switches gears from a shaggy indie to a cracking, edge-of-seat-drama. Most of this movie, while well played, feels comfortable and familiar. But this showdown (and props are also in order to Hunter\u2019s scene partner Shane Jacobson) had me completely on edge. As individual sequences are concerned, it\u2019s actually one of the most tense and emotional I\u2019ve seen all year.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the air then fizzles with an unnecessary monologue (while burying bloody clothes that have stayed in a bag marked \u201cevidence\u201d for seven years) but Hunter is enough of a pro to make it work. Diekmann\u2019s restrained shooting style and evocative incorporation of solo electric guitar on the soundtrack goes a long way to pave over a choppy screenplay. Strange Weather is a flashback to indies from a time where you\u2019d root for them just for existing, and if anyone deserves that kind of break it\u2019s a woman like Darcy Baylor.</p>",

The company has contracts with a number of local authorities across England, providing care and support to 9,600 people each week, but no longer has a contract with Haringey.</p> <p>According to the union Unison, which is supporting the claim by the 16 women and one man, the \u00a33.27 rate was paid to staff who acted as \u201clive-in\u201d care workers at the time the national minimum wage was \u00a36.70 an hour.</p> <p>The carers also say they were on duty 24 hours a day, citing an example of one care worker staying for seven days at a time in the home of an elderly woman with severe dementia, sleeping in her room and frequently attending to her needs through the night.</p> <p> One carer likened the experience to being \u201cin prison\u201d, saying they were effectively not allowed to leave the house all week. </p> <p> All of the care workers were on zero-hours contracts and Unison says they felt they could not turn down work because they feared being penalised by the company. \u201cWe were working like slaves,\u2019 said Florence Wambulu, one of the care workers. \u201cThey have to treat us like human beings, not just someone who is there to make money for them.\u201d</p> <p> Sevacare disputes that the workers had been working 24 hours a day. It told the BBC that the \u201clive-in\u201d care workers\u2019 hours were covered by a \u201cdaily average agreement\u201d which saw them paid for 10 hours. The care workers were actually receiving \u00a3550 for a seven-day week, it says, which is the equivalent of \u00a37.85 an hour.</p> <p>\u201cSevacare submits that it pays, and had paid to these staff, an average hourly rate that is at least the national minimum wage over any pay reference period,\u201d the company added.</p> <p>The tribunal also involves former Sevacare staff in Haringey who claim their pay rates fell below the minimum wage because they were not paid for travelling between visits to clients. </p> <p>Haringey council, which was responsible for commissioning the care, is also being sued at the Central London Employment Tribunal for allegedly failing to ensure the workers were paid properly. The council says it ended its relationship with Sevacare in April this year after previously raising \u201cserious concerns\u201d with the Care Quality Commission.</p> <p>However, the BBC has seen payslips that suggest some care workers currently working in the borough are still not being paid the legal minimum. The hourly rate printed on recent pay documents is well below the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour, which came into effect in April and raised the minimum wage from \u00a36.70 hour for employees over the age of 25.</p> <p>A spokesman for Haringey said the council contractually requires providers to obey minimum wage law, including remuneration for travel time. \u201cOur rates allow for providers to pay both the national minimum wage and the national living wage, and we will be writing to them all to remind them of their Care Act obligations, stating clearly that no breaches will be tolerated,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31258205\">Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated last year that 160,000 care workers in England and Wales were not being paid the national living wage</a>. And last year Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs announced it would investigate whether the big six care providers were paying people the minimum wage.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timbuktu/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-100-tales-to-dr/posts/1673433\">Four months after launching on Kickstarter</a>, a children\u2019s book that tells the stories of 100 inspiring women has raised more than $1m (\u00a3754,000), making it the biggest original publishing project in the crowdfunding site\u2019s history. Almost 20,000 backers from 71 countries around the world have signed up to order <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/25/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-is-dream-kickstarter-success\">Rebel Girls, which introduces young readers to role models from the Bront\u00eb sisters to Serena Williams</a>.</p> <p>The sums involved in the majority of Kickstarter\u2019s publishing projects coming this autumn may be a little smaller, but the breadth and scope of the books is impressive: everything from a comic novel of <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/389494575/a-hole-in-the-ground-a-novel/description\">smalltown Canada from a Qu\u00e9bec humour columnist and broadcaster</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1870936832/lunakita-a-dog-log/description\">an account of looking after a rescued Staffordshire bull terrier</a>, charting the dog\u2019s journey from troubled crackpot to treasured companion, to <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/593967745/a-dark-forest-issue-three?ref=category_ending_soon\">a graphic novel about a Victorian girl</a> who is the only one in her village to notice a series of sinister goings-on.</p> <p>Of course, Kickstarter doesn\u2019t get involved in the messy business of producing books \u2013 it\u2019s a platform that puts people who want to produce books in touch with others all over the world who want to support their projects. But if you put the 1,973 publishing pitches that were successfully funded in 2015 together with the 994 successful comic and graphic novel projects, then last year\u2019s tally of 2,967 literary projects puts the crowdfunding site up among publishing\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d: Penguin Random House, Harper Collins, Hachette and Simon and Schuster. The latter, which is the smallest of the Big Four <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/67307-global-publishing-leaders-2015-simon-schuster.html\">according to Publishers Weekly</a>, publishes \u201cover 2,000 titles annually\u201d.</p> <p>Kickstarter\u2019s publishing \u201clead\u201d, Margot Atwell, wants to make it clear that the site \u201cdefinitely doesn\u2019t supplant the role of editor, publicist or publisher\u201d and is really \u201cjust one more tool an author or publisher can use to connect with readers and spread the word about their book\u201d. But writers all over the world are choosing this new route to publication in unprecedented numbers. The books and comics section has grown steadily since the site\u2019s launch in 2009, and accounts for around 13% of successful projects. In 2015, pledges totalled $35.2m and already in 2016 more than $20m has been pledged for more than 1,500 projects.</p> <p>This dwarfs competitors such as Crowdfunder.co.uk, which has raised \u00a3475,000 for publishing projects in the six years since the site was founded in 2010, or the bespoke publishing platform Unbound, which has published 79 titles since launching a year later. Indiegogo, who didn\u2019t provide any data on their writing category, has raised a total of <a href=\"https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2015/12/2015-crowdfunding-infographic-statistics-tech-film-social.html\">$1bn across all categories since its 2008 launch </a> \u2013 just 40% of Kickstarter\u2019s $2.5bn \u2013 with a 2013 estimate suggesting they trail in writing and comics by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jonchiehlau/dollar-for-dollar-raised-kickstarter-dominates-indiegogo-six-times-over-2a48bc6ffd57#.xbkvs1jh9\">as much as 10 to one</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Using Kickstarter lets creators make something great that they might not otherwise have been able to make</p> <footer> <cite>Margot Atwell, Kickstarter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Atwell, projects that tend to be successful on the site are \u201cideas that ignited the imaginations of a community, creators providing greater access to their creative process, and voices that are often underrepresented among the most commercial success stories\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cCertain communities, such as the comics world, have been faster to integrate Kickstarter into their process. Using Kickstarter lets creators gain support for their project in advance, so they can make something great that they might not otherwise have been able to make. Projects to create beautiful hardcover books, especially art books, children\u2019s books, and comics in colour, tend to be more costly to produce, which might be why we see a lot of those creators coming to Kickstarter to make their projects,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Compared to the UK market as a whole, Kickstarter is funding a far bigger percentage of fiction, children\u2019s books and comics. According to Nielsen Bookscan, fiction accounted for 5% of new titles in the UK, with children\u2019s books at 10% and graphic novels only 0.3%. On Kickstarter, 10.1% of successful publishing and comics projects were fiction, with children\u2019s books at 14.2% and graphic novels representing 8.8%.</p> <p>As a publishing veteran who <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/margot/derby-life-stories-advice-and-wisdom-about-roller/description\">launched her own imprint (via Kickstarter) last year</a>, Atwell says one of the most exciting things about crowdfunding is the way it inverts publishing\u2019s conventional publicity dynamic.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re creating a book, it\u2019s very affirming to know that it\u2019s something there is desire and demand for, versus the traditional publishing model of investing in an author and the production of a book, trying your darnedest to get the word out and reach readers, but not really knowing whether there is a readership.\u201d</p> <p>The writers and publishers using the site are \u201cinnovative, tech-savvy, and very willing to talk directly with their readers and fans\u201d, she continues, with some combining crowdfunding with more traditional approaches.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the most exciting projects we\u2019ve seen in the past year have been run by great independent publishers such as <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/896286441/2045227906\">Copper Canyon\u2019s Then Come Back</a>, a book of lost poems by Pablo Neruda, or <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/628605595/milkweed-books-because-bookshelves-should-never-be\">Milkweed Books</a>, a project to create a new independent bookstore, which is live on the site right now,\u201d Atwell explains. \u201cI\u2019ve also seen projects by hybrid authors who are published by mainstream Big Four publishers but also do projects on Kickstarter, such as <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/3548813\">Kate Milford</a>, who has run two great projects for novellas.\u201d</p> <p>Pitch and presentation are vital, when trying to stand out from thousands of other projects. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/katemiawhite?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Kate-Mia White</a>, who raised more than \u00a32,000 to fund the third volume of her Dark Forest series, spends a few days on every pitch she makes. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to create an eye-catching video with a strong theme, and keep the whole page in that theme,\u201d she says.</p> <p>White never even considered traditional publication, \u201cpartly because I was producing 16-page comics and partly I feel the internet is now a better way of reaching an audience.\u201d</p> <p>For David Hill, who raised more than \u00a33,000 to publish his memoir of living with a Staffordshire bull terrier, the \u201crelentless\u201d pitching didn\u2019t come easily.</p> <p>\u201cI was advised to share the link on multiple social media accounts several times a day, and talk about it until I thought I\u2019d talked about it too much, but then carry on talking about it anyway,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI found the first week or so to be quite dispiriting, but once the ball was rolling and it gained momentum, I started to feel encouraged, and finally, elated when it was successfully funded.\u201d</p> <p>When strangers are sharing their money to help with a project, the dynamic between writers and their backers can become very personal. \u201cMost of the backers know about my struggles with anxiety, job loss, and all the sacrifices that I\u2019ve made to give this rescue dog the life she deserves,\u201d Hill says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been so supportive, and I\u2019ve been really humbled by that support.\u201d</p> <p>The artist-led model has seen substantial sums of money devoted to projects in areas where traditional publishing often struggles. Literary journals raised more than $200,000 on Kickstarter in 2015, while poetry received almost $300,000. Anthologies brought in almost $500,000, while art books picked up more than $4m.</p> <p>\u201c[Crowdfunding] certainly gives the writer much more creative freedom, and the ability to tell their story exactly as they originally envisaged,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI believe it\u2019s really enriching the art of storytelling, and giving readers a much wider selection of stories to choose from.\u201d</p> <p>The broad range of projects that Kickstarter supports is no accident: in 2015, the business reincorporated as a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-now-a-benefit-corporation\">public benefit corporation</a>, a profit-making model that includes having a positive impact on the world as a legally defined goal. Atwell says this is part of the site\u2019s mission \u201cto support a more creative, equitable world, and to fight inequality\u201d. And while traditional publishing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/27/us-study-finds-publishing-is-overwhelmingly-white-and-female\">struggles to address problems with diversity,</a> crowdfunding offers an alternative route to publication for writers who are struggling to be heard.</p> <p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s critical to our culture and our society that people from every conceivable background have the opportunity to share their stories, and find stories that resonate with them and their experience,\u201d Atwell says. \u201cEven more than that, I think it\u2019s important for people to seek out stories that seem alien to them, so they build greater understanding and empathy for others. Empathy seems to be in short supply in the world today, and I really do believe in the power of literature to help increase it.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 20 September 2016 to make clear that Rebel Girls is Kickstarter\u2019s biggest publishing project for an original work. <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/530877925/bibliotheca/description\">Bibliotecha</a> raised more than $1.4m for a new edition of the Bible in 2014.</li> </ul>",
  "<p><strong>EasyJet</strong> is leading the FTSE 100 fallers on concerns about the outlook for the budget airline.</p> <p>Its shares are down 24p or 2% at \u00a311.10 after analysts at Barclays cut their target price from \u00a311.50 to \u00a310.50 with an equalweight rating. They said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given uncertainty around UK trading and the European geopolitical climate, visibility for the winter and 2017 is particularly low. On balance we think 2017 earnings will slip backwards as easyJet maintains its 8-9% growth rate, prioritising long term strategic opportunities over short term yields. Cash generation for the next few years will likely be poor, although the dividend is secure...</p> <p>Ever since the Sharm-el-Sheikh Metrojet bombing at the end of October 2016, it seems like easyJet has faced one demand shock after another (Paris, Brussels, Egyptair, Nice, Turkey, Brexit). The company is on track to record the worst year for yields in its history, and the situation has been compounded by operational challenges this summer including Gatwick congestion, extreme weather and French air traffic control strikes. All told, we believe external events have cost easyJet at least \u00a3150m in 2016.</p> <p>However, it would be dangerous to assume a \u2018bounceback\u2019 in the geopolitical or operational environment next year. In fact, we think investors should be braced for a tough winter, as easyJet continues to grow at 9% (mid single digit in the UK). The UK consumer makes up 50% of easyJet\u2019s revenue, and it is unclear how depreciation in sterling will affect appetite for off-peak discretionary travel (eg weekend/ski breaks). Allowing also for a tough October comparable, and the fact Easter moves out of the first half we model revenue per seat at -8.5% through the winter, leading to a forecast loss before tax of \u00a3123m \u2013 easyJet\u2019s highest in six years. </p> </blockquote> <p>Barclays was more positive on British Airways owner <strong>International Airlines Group</strong>, although its shares have slipped 1.5p to 418.2p.

Just <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/2167/energy.aspx\">21% of Americans think</a> the US should emphasize more fossil fuel production, as opposed to 73% who favor a focus on renewable energy. <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/poll-voters-want-pretty-much-the-opposite-of-what-congress-is-doing-5bc936a668c6#.cuv1wvazc\">82% of Americans favor government limits on carbon pollution</a>. Yet the positions of Republican Party leaders in all branches of government are the polar opposite.</p> <p>The only reason they haven\u2019t paid the electoral price is that Republican voters don\u2019t yet view climate change as a priority, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/06/conservative-media-bias-is-inflating-american-climate-denial-and-polarization\">due in large part to conservative media bias</a>. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/08/climate-change-louisiana-floods-increased-risk\">as climate change impacts become increasingly undeniable</a>, sooner or later the GOP will be held accountable for selling out the wellbeing of the American people to Big Oil.<br></p>",
  "<h2>Boundary changes, but little big-picture thinking</h2> <p>The political world is<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/corbyn-johnson-and-osborne-among-mps-hit-by-electoral-shakeup\"> running a high temperature</a> over the boundary changes to MPs\u2019 constituencies in England and Wales. The dramatic shakeup will alter the constituencies of more than 500 MPs. </p> <p>But there\u2019s a much bigger picture here that the boundary commissioners have overlooked. Rather than simply focus on the political landscape, this could have been an opportunity for a forward-thinking government to set in place true reform of local public services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/boundary-changes-are-not-a-democratic-reform\">Boundary changes are not a democratic reform | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like councillors, but usually better-known, local MPs get inundated with queries over local services, almost none of which are designed, led or delivered by Westminster but instead by local government. </p> <p>The boundary review could have been a chance to think about the fractured relationship between central government and local government, particularly at a time when former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s plans to devolve greater powers out to local regions seem to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/north-east-england-devolution-deal-off-the-table-sajid-javid\">coming unstuck</a>: only last week, communities secretary Sajid Javid told councils in the north-east of England that a multimillion-pound deal was off the table, after council leaders failed to agree over what devolved powers to accept. </p> <p>Instead, the terms of the boundary commissions were <a href=\"http://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/2018-review/\">very narrowly set</a>. Sam Hartley, secretary to the boundary commission for England, <a href=\"http://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/boundaries-are-changing-and-we-need-your-help/\">describes the task</a> thus: \u201cI often imagine the country as a jigsaw with 533 pieces \u2013 some very large, some very small. First, we glue them all together and then cut them into a new jigsaw of 501 pieces, all roughly the same size.\u201d </p> <p>Think how much more interesting it would have been if the members of the commission for England, who include former council chief executive Neil Pringle, had been given a brief to consider how to bring together health and social care, or housing and transport. Public leaders have to run public services within a political context; it\u2019s a shame that politics doesn\u2019t think more about the public services they control.</p> <h2>Nemat Shafik\u2019s stellar career</h2> <p>Ever since I interviewed Nemat Shafik, then deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in Washington DC in 2013, where she gave one of the lectures in that year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/apr/11/nemat-shafik-minouche-global-public-leaders-lecture\">global public leaders series</a>, I\u2019ve watched her career with interest. An Eygyptian-born economist, Shafik is a smart woman, who has moved in and out of the UK public sector with ease. She worked as permanent secretary at the Department for International Development for three years before joining the IMF, and moved back to the UK in March 2014, as deputy governor of the Bank of England, a role that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/nemat-shafik-economist-stellar-cv-bank-of-england\">some argued </a>made her the most powerful woman in the City of London.</p> <p>Shafik - usually known by her nickname Minouche - is now moving again, to become<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/bank-of-england-deputy-governor-quits-nemat-minouche-shafik-london-school-economics\"> the first woman to run the London School of Economics</a>. It\u2019s an interesting move that gets her out of the bank during what is likely to be a tough time, dominated by Brexit negotiations.

  "<p>The decision by Trinity Mirror to \u201chand back\u201d four of its Metro franchises to their ultimate owner, dmg media, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/pressure-on-profitability-sees-trinity-mirror-give-up-metro-franchises-in-scotland-cardiff-bristol-and-nottingham/\">because of questions over profitability</a>\u201d is not quite as it may seem.</p> <p>What it really illustrates are the divergent strategies of two major publishers. Trinity Mirror, acutely aware of the difficulties of selling regional newsprint titles, is eager to forge ahead with a switch to digital.</p> <p>By contrast, dmg media, the publishing arm of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT), has managed to make a huge success of its nationally distributed free paper, Metro. It has found a way to make newsprint pay, and handsomely at that.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s the reason it feels confident enough to increase its national distribution by 10% from 1 October, raising its total daily figure to a total of 1.47m.</p> <p>In a sense, both publishers stand to gain from Trinity relinquishing the Metro contracts for Scotland, Cardiff, Bristol and the East Midlands.</p> <p>Although those franchises are profitable, Trinity thinks the returns too marginal. Then again, aside from a single seller in Scotland, it didn\u2019t set out to secure advertising for its Metros for obvious reasons: it needs its own papers in those regions to maximise the advertising take.</p> <p>It is holding on, however, to its four other Metro franchises in the larger cities - Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Newcastle - because, despite the competition with its own titles, it sees a benefit is doing so.</p> <p>In fact, Metro is read by many more people in Birmingham and Newcastle than the print versions of Trinity\u2019s own titles.</p> <p>Metro\u2019s managers are evidently delighted with the fact that Trinity is handing over four franchises and would be even more pleased if they could have the other four (plus the single contract, in Yorkshire, held by Johnston Press).</p> <p>A Metro source told me the paper\u2019s management were sure that the titles would make \u201can instant and significant\u201d contribution to the bottom line. They believe the four can make healthy profits despite Trinity Mirror arguing otherwise. <br></p> <p>It is well to recall that the original contracts between Metro\u2019s owner and the regional companies were drawn up in order to defuse arguments about Metro\u2019s intrusion into the regions.<br></p> <p>Giving regional publishers the chance to print the papers and enjoy a portion of the advertising revenue can be seen as something of a truce deal.</p> <p>Since then, as the digital revolution has rolled on, the situation has changed, as witnessed by Trinity Mirror\u2019s online ambitions. Meanwhile, Metro has become a standout counter-revolutionary newsprint success.</p> <p>I mistakenly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/27/suddenly-national-newspapers-are-heading-for-that-print-cliff-fall\">wrote in May this year</a> that Metro\u2019s profits - which dmg media refuses to break out from its overall figures - were slight. In fact, I am reliably informed that the paper makes more than \u00a31m a month and, possibly, much more. </p> <p>One major reason for that is the revenue it enjoys from classified advertising. So it\u2019s no wonder that dmg media, which will have 75% of Metro in its grasp when it assumes responsibility for the Trinity quartet on 1 January 2017, would like to control 100%.</p> <p>London remains its most lucrative region by far. Most of the extra copies it will distribute from next month will be in the capital, with a greater presence on buses. Some 900,000 copies will be available each morning in the metropolitan area - up from 763,000 - and will therefore reach roughly the same distribution total as the London Evening Standard.</p> <p>Charlie Cox, Metro\u2019s chief executive, called the expansion a \u201ctestament to Metro\u2019s continued success\u201d, while its editor, Ted Young, referred to \u201cthe extremely low return rate we see on our London edition... [so] we know the appetite is definitely there for these extra copies.\u201d</p>",

She said the unemployment rate, the prison population, and organised crime rates were higher among Muslim populations. \u201cAustralians in general are more fearful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIslam sees itself as a theocracy, Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is now seeing changes in suburbs predominately Muslim. Tolerance towards other Australians is no longer the case. Our law courts are disrespected and our prisons have become breeding grounds for Muslims to radicalise inmates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuslims are imprisoned at almost three times the average rate. The rate of unemployed and public dependency is two to three times greater than the national average. Muslims are prominent in organised crime with associated violence and drug dealing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnti-social behaviour is rampant, fuelled by hyper-masculine and misogynist culture. Multiple social surveys find that neighbours of Muslim settlements are suffering from collapsing social cohesion and fear of crime.\u201d</p> <p>If Muslim immigration continued then Australians would find themselves living under Sharia law, Hanson said.</p> <p>The One Nation leader said no further mosques or Islamic schools should be built until the current \u201csecurity challenges\u201d passed \u2013 meaning incidences of terrorism. Hanson said Islamic facilities already established in the country should be subject to monitoring.</p> <p>Addressing multiculturalism more broadly, Hanson said Australians had never been permitted to vote on whether we became a multi-racial society. Hanson claimed the Australian economy wasn\u2019t stimulated by immigration \u2013 an orthodoxy considered central to economic thinking \u2013 it was stimulated by government infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Hanson contended \u2013 again, without supporting evidence \u2013 that high immigration only benefited the banks and multinationals. She argued that immigration was placing intolerable strain on essential services, like hospitals and schools, which she said were \u201cbursting at the seams\u201d.</p> <p>Hanson said foreign investment was a source of regret, particularly when it came from China and its communist government. She declared Australia was vulnerable to a foreign takeover, and Australians had fought in wars and given their lives to prevent foreign takeovers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42b68605e347f49941bc352d5209fa64de3bf938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42b68605e347f49941bc352d5209fa64de3bf938/0_225_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greens senators walk out of the Senate chamber as Queensland Pauline Hanson delivers her first speech .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greens senators walk out of the Senate chamber as Queensland Pauline Hanson delivers her first speech .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She declared Australian assets should not be for sale. \u201cI warn this government and future government, you never miss the water until the well runs dry,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She called for the adoption of an Australia identity card with an electronic fingerprint and a photograph to stop welfare fraud, which she said was a higher priority than addressing privacy concerns of the citizenry. \u201cIf we are going to control the deficit we have to stop the thieves.\u201d</p> <p>Hanson also highlighted her long running criticisms of the family court and the child support system, which she suggested was biased towards women who wanted sole custody of their children.</p> <p>The One Nation leader began her address to the Senate chamber on Wednesday evening by casting her mind back to 1998, when she called across the chamber: \u201cI will be back.\u201d</p> <p>She noted parliamentary colleagues taunted her at that time by saying she would not return to politics.

High immigration is only beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business seeking a larger market while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake.

Our city roads have become parking lots, schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick are left behind to fend for themselves and many towns and cities struggle to provide water for an ever-growing population.

Those opposite don\u2019t believe in some of the flexibility measures that would actually deliver for individuals the ability to contribute more into their superannuation to provide more in their retirement. We on this side think it\u2019s important to protect those flexibility measures, which is why we have argued so strongly for them.</p> </blockquote> <p>(This is interesting because it is the next obvious policy area for Labor and the Coalition to cooperate on after the budget cuts.

She started the piece with former Labor leader and US ambassador Kim Beazley, backing in Turnbull on the Kevin Rudd nomination for UN secretary general. Beazley\u2019s conversations with the prime minister confirm the view that Turnbull did not consider Rudd a suitable candidate. And that a government could not nominate someone without endorsing. She uses the example for a wider point.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Beazley\u2019s intervention forces us to think again about this incident, and opens a wider appraisal of Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership than has generally been seen in the orgy of words marking 12 months since he toppled Tony Abbott.</p> <p>Much has been made in the past year \u2013 and the past week \u2013 of the high expectations voters had that Turnbull would transform politics and their disappointment that he has not.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s performance is rated in terms of these expectations. Many of those who criticise him notably do so because he has not delivered what they particularly want.</p> <p>On the left, there is disappointment on issues like climate change and same-sex marriage. On the right, the criticism is he hasn\u2019t done enough on tax reform, budget repair and industrial relations.</p> <p>But there is very little said about the way the Turnbull prime ministership actually works. Whether it is good, bad or indifferent, it is certainly a very, very different prime ministership.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be blunt here. This is a bloke who is not particularly good at retail politics, nor particularly concerned about running to the beat of the retail politics drum.</p> <p>As one cabinet minister says, \u201cYou will observe that a particular issue isn\u2019t quite zooming down the ski slope politically and he thinks that\u2019s fine, he\u2019s relaxed. He doesn\u2019t mind things being a bit \u2018off piste\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet all those who have moaned about three-word slogans and politicians driven by the 24-hour media cycle and \u201cannounceables\u201d still don\u2019t seem happy with an approach so conspicuously lacking such frenzy.</p> <p>Few doubt Turnbull\u2019s intellectual capacities. But few also observe that the prime minister sees his job foremost as head of the \u201cOffice of Wicked Problems\u201d, not first as the beating heart of a political organisation focused on winning the next election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Discuss.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:57:25.318Z\">at 12.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d88e46e4b067ad3008770e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:44:59.757Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bowen says, hey government, there is more we can do to fix the budget together.

  "<p>Mr Robot remains a mystery hidden inside a bit of HTML code disguised as the most addictive show on TV. After a slow, character-focused start, season two has tipped us right into the deep end of wild speculation as we approach the finale. We don\u2019t trust what we see on screen, and at this point we\u2019re not even sure who\u2019s alive and who\u2019s dead. Here are the questions we desperately need the finale to answer, before we start attempting to hack into Amazon and USA Network\u2019s mainframe.</p> <h2><strong>Did Darlene and Cisco survive the shootout in the diner?</strong></h2> <p>Dom was covered in blood when she ran out, so someone got shot \u2013 but who? And what was Dom saying to them before the shooting? We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the finale opened with the diner scene retold from another angle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/08/mr-robot-recap-season-two-episode-10-pass-the-smelling-salts\">Mr Robot recap: season two, episode 10 \u2013 pass the smelling salts!</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What clue was in Elliot\u2019s apartment?</strong></h2> <p>The bold and brilliant scene in which Elliot asked us to help him find an Easter egg hidden in his apartment wasn\u2019t just an enjoyably meta comment on how Mr Robot turns its viewers into conspiracy theorists \u2013 it was also a chance to actually solve many of the show\u2019s biggest mysteries. Of course, we failed miserably. If you had more luck, please give us your theories in the comments.</p> <h2><strong>Why has Mr Robot vanished?</strong></h2> <p>The show has a habit of throwing in one twist to obscure another. This time it seems like the prison twist might have been used to hide Mr Robot\u2019s true intentions from us. What is he hiding from us (and Elliot)? Why has he been cultivating Elliot\u2019s trust throughout this season? Is he trying to take over?</p> <h2><strong>Is Tyrell Wellick really dead \u2013 and if he is, who\u2019s making those phone calls?</strong></h2> <p>Ever since Mr Robot told Elliot that he shot Tyrell Wellick \u2013 \u201cshot\u201d, not killed \u2013 most of the internet has been more convinced than ever that Wellick is alive.</p> <p>Now Elliot has tracked the location of the phone that Joanna Wellick\u2019s mysterious calls were coming from, but Joanna\u2019s bodyguard is convinced that the calls couldn\u2019t have come from that address. So what is that address? Is it Joanna\u2019s home, and we\u2019re in a \u201cthe call\u2019s coming from inside the house!\u201d situation? Or is it the address of another character we know?</p> <p>And if it\u2019s not Tyrell on the other end of that phone, then who would benefit from tormenting Joanna with those phone calls? Was her lover (who seems to have been entirely forgotten) involved?</p> <h2><strong>What happened to Trenton and Mobley?</strong></h2> <p>The FBI don\u2019t have them \u2013 Dom confirmed in this episode that they lost Sunil Markesh, which is Mobley\u2019s real name. Does the Dark Army have them or did they get away?</p> <h2><strong>What is phase two?</strong></h2> <p>We know it\u2019s Elliot\u2019s plan, but beyond that \u2013 not a clue. We know that Elliot is important to the Dark Army \u2013 they had Leon protect him in prison, after all \u2013 but we don\u2019t know why. What can Elliot offer them that they can\u2019t do themselves? Does it have something to do with the Washington Township plant? Speaking of which \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Why is the Washington Township plant so important to Whiterose and Phillip Price?</strong></h2> <p>And is it important to the Chinese government or the Dark Army, both of which Whiterose represents?

He was a drug dealer too \u2013 that could have been the reason he was killed.

  "<p>He wore pinstripes and a wide 1970s tie. She wore a $53 department store dress picked out by her mother. There was no engagement ring, no gift registry, no official photographer or party planner. The guest list \u2013 immediate family and close friends only \u2013 topped out at 14 people, which was about what their mock Tudor starter home could comfortably hold.</p> <p>About 200 people gathered at a friend\u2019s house that afternoon to toast the newlyweds with smoked meats, champagne and a tiered wedding cake. Some people headed to an off-campus dive bar for dancing, and the festivities continued until a 4am call from the local drunk tank. The bride\u2019s brother had been pulled over on a DUI while driving her yellow Fiat, according to the groom\u2019s memoir.</p> <p>And so began the most consequential marriage in US political history.</p> <p>The union solemnized between Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton in the living room of their first home as a married couple in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on 11 October 1975, created a force that has dominated Democratic party and US presidential politics for more than a quarter of a century and propelled two middle-class Americans into the highest circles of global and corporate leadership. </p> <p>The couple spent just over a year in the mock Tudor house that Bill bought to get Hillary to marry him \u2013 long enough for her to paint the kitchen cupboards a retina-burning orange and for him to botch a repair job on the fireplace. </p> <p>But even in that first year of married life \u2013 the last before either was elected to office \u2013 Bill and Hillary were trying to figure out how to accommodate two highly ambitious personalities within one marriage, according to their friends from those days.</p> <p>\u201cHe always knew he wanted to come back here and he made no bones about it. He wanted to come back here and help his state \u2013 and God knows it needed helping,\u201d said Ann Henry who, with her husband Morriss, hosted the Clintons\u2019 wedding reception at her house. \u201cHe had told all of us here about her. He told us: \u201cShe is so smart. She could do anything. She could be a US senator. She could be a governor. She could be anything she wanted to be. He recognised her and her abilities.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Six months after their wedding, Bill decided to run for state attorney general, plotting election strategy around a table that was used more for board games than dinner parties, according to friends. Even then, they called it the war room.<br></p> <p>By the end of 1976, after Bill Clinton\u2019s election, they were on their way to Little Rock, a journey that would take the Clintons to their first stint in the White House.</p> <p>For their baby boomer generation, they were the ultimate power couple. For Arkansans in the early 1970s, when women still needed a husband\u2019s consent to get a car loan or credit card, they stood for a new way of negotiating work and marriage, one where wives matched their husbands for career and political ambitions. Hillary Rodham did not even take her husband\u2019s name until 1982, when her husband who lost his bid for re-election as governor was trying to get back into power \u2013 that is when she began to go by Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, in his speaking slot at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/bill-clinton-speech-hillary-democratic-convention\">Democratic national convention</a> in July, spun the story of his marriage as classic fairytale romance. \u201cI met a girl,\u201d he began, recounting his awe-struck state upon meeting Hillary Clinton in the Yale law library in 1971, and how he finally won her heart, asking three times for her hand in marriage before he got a yes.</p> <p>The story as told by Bill Clinton, was said to be an attempt to \u201chumanise\u201d his wife, left out the messy real-life bits, as fairytales do, in his case the epic cheating and lying, the lacerating public humiliation that risked his presidency and smolders still in the background of Hillary\u2019s presidential ambitions, fanned by the comments of internet trolls. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s testimonial and his repeated assertions that she was \u201cthe best darn change-maker I have ever seen\u201d did little to address the other questions about their extraordinary partnership, and really the ones that matter most: how did a formidable couple manage their respective ambitions?</p> <p>It is easy to ask, as many do, whether Hillary Clinton would ever have had a shot at being the first female president if she wasn\u2019t married to Bill Clinton, whether she exploited her position as first lady to jump on to a relatively safe New York Senate seat, and whether she once again used her husband\u2019s connections to major donors and Democratic party grandees to fix the race against Bernie Sanders in her second run for the White House. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89542544cfeaf275988eb83a62becf90d831768d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89542544cfeaf275988eb83a62becf90d831768d/0_0_1979_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billary1 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"980\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s the default sexist question.</p> <p>But maybe the real question is whether Bill Clinton, who had already lost one election by the time of his marriage, would have succeeded in becoming America\u2019s youngest governor and one of the country\u2019s most popular presidents without Hillary Clinton by his side? Maybe Bill Clinton held her back \u2013 and Hillary Clinton would have got there any way, or even sooner.</p> <p>Those who befriended the young couple as they embarked on married life in the college town of Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the 1970s asked early versions of those same questions about balancing ambition within a marriage.</p> <p>The friendships they made during that first year of married life were lasting. Morriss and Ann Henry, who hosted that wedding reception, were lawyers and had held public office, like the Clintons. They were in Philadelphia when Clinton formally accepted the nomination. So was Margaret Whillock, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s first guide to southern living. Diane Blair, a close confidante from those days, died of cancer in 2000, but she kept extensive notes of their conversations, which are housed in the University of Arkansas.</p> <p>A look-back through time is always faulty. People project present-day realities \u2013 in this case Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee \u2013 on their memories. But when the friends first met in the 1970s, Bill and Hillary Clinton both seemed headed for prominent positions in public life. According to their friends, it was an open question who would get there first, and at what personal cost.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was a perfect fall day in the Ozarks \u2013 warm sun, cloudless blue sky, with a hint of coolness in the air, and the Razorbacks were playing a home game. Craig and Margaret Whillock\u2019s house was just down the street from the law school where Bill and Hillary Clinton taught. </p> <p>Craig Whillock, a former state representative and aide to a local member of Congress, had been one of Bill Clinton\u2019s earliest mentors when he came back home to Arkansas.</p> <p>When Bill Clinton announced he wanted to run for Congress, against a longtime Republican incumbent, Whillock ran up to get his contacts book, and drove the newcomer all over the district making introductions, according to his widow, Margaret.</p> <p>The Whillocks often opened up their home to large football parties, and on one glorious afternoon in 1974, Margaret Whillock looked up to see Hillary Clinton at the back door. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hillary\u2019s pay records show a starting salary of $16,450 \u2013 slightly more than her husband who was on $16,182</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was something about her that was so compelling,\u201d Whillock said. \u201cI saw her out of the kitchen door, framed in the door watching the crowd, and she had on a white dress and I thought: \u2018She is going to be important to me\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>The Whillocks were already playing surrogate parents to both Clintons. Bill Clinton regularly used to drop in for dinner with the family, on his way home from a teaching job at the law school. When Hillary Clinton decided to pay a visit and eventually take a job at the law school herself, Bill Clinton asked Margaret Whillock to show her around. </p> <p>He was desperate for Hillary Clinton to like Arkansas, to like it enough to stay, Margaret Whillock said.</p> <p>\u201cBill Clinton was so excited she was coming to Fayetteville. He was thrilled out of his mind. He wanted her to like it here. He wanted her to meet people. I think he realized what a jewel he had in her.\u201d</p> <p>Whillock was working full-time as a school teacher and she had six children at home. That did not deter Bill. \u201cHe said: \u2018You have to have her over. You have to have her over,\u201d she said. </p> <p>So on Clinton\u2019s second day of work at the law school, Whillock invited her for lunch and the women became friends.</p> <p>Even then Hillary Clinton was a high-flyer \u2013 certainly in Arkansas where she was among the first women teaching in the law faculty, and a leader in expanding legal services to the poor \u2013 at a time when judges barred women from taking on rape cases on the grounds that they could not cope with the unpleasantness.<br></p> <p>She was an ambitious, east coast liberal in a hurry in a small, southern town that operated at a slower, gentler pace, especially where gender roles were concerned. Women \u2013 if they did work outside the home \u2013 were mainly confined to feminine professions like teaching and nursing. </p> <p>\u201cShe was different because she was interested in things,\u201d Whillock said. \u201cShe did things differently. She wasn\u2019t into going shopping too much and that kind of thing.\u201d<br></p> <p> Clinton was one of just 27 women in her graduating class at Yale law school. In Arkansas, there was an even bigger gender imbalance. She was among the first female professors at the law school, winning the job over 39 male and two other female applicants.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>And she earned more than her husband from the very beginning of their marriage. Both were employed to teach at the University of Arkansas law school. Hillary\u2019s pay records for the 1974-1975 academic year show a starting salary of $16,450 \u2013 slightly more than her husband, who was on $16,182 in his second year at the law school, and she would continue to outpace him on pay for her short time there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8f6a84510fa4c889f91c1a1583bc09de0da15fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8f6a84510fa4c889f91c1a1583bc09de0da15fe/0_0_786_538/500.png\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton pay\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s starting salary was $16,450.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She also had a broader portfolio of responsibilities, teaching criminal procedure and establishing a legal aid clinic, and she came with glowing recommendations from her professors and supervisors at her previous jobs.</p> <p>By the end of that year, after Bill Clinton won his election as attorney general, the couple were on their way to Little Rock. Their lives as private citizens were over. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton would face much closer scrutiny over her conduct as a wife: her decision to keep her last name, to hold down a demanding job, and to take on big policy projects, such as her successful overhaul of Arkansas\u2019s public schools, which had been ranked worst in the country.</p> <p>She saw even then the possibilities of using her position as the first lady of Arkansas to make change \u2013 if not always the perils, according to Henry, whose husband Morriss had served as a state senator. </p> <p>\u201cShe was talking about Eleanor Roosevelt. That was her role model and mentor kind of thing,\u201d Henry recalled. \u201cI was saying sometimes you have to be careful and you can only do so much and then there is a backlash.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton disagreed, citing Roosevelt\u2019s activism as first lady. \u201cI said by the time Eleanor Roosevelt was so involved in politics, that marriage was all over and I am married with three children,\u201d Henry said.</p> <p>She was not clear whether Clinton really saw her point.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Diane Blair was a prodigious taker of notes \u2013 on yellow legal pads, note paper with silly cartoons, and in typed records of hour-long phone conversations with Hillary Clinton when the then first lady was having some down time at Camp David. </p> <p>Blair\u2019s reflections on her close friend take up 16 boxes of her papers at the University of Arkansas \u2013 pages scrawled with references to Chelsea Clinton\u2019s ballet lessons, the flannel nightgown Hillary Clinton wore in the living quarters, and other intimate details of her friend\u2019s life in the White House.</p> <p>But the essence boils down to this, Blair writes at one point, paraphrasing her friend: Bill Clinton was the duck. Hillary Clinton was the decoy. As the wife, Hillary Clinton was constantly under attack for exhibiting traits that might be admired in a man. </p> <p>Her intelligence and tenacity \u2013 which would have been an asset in a man \u2013 made people uncomfortable, according to pollsters. She needed to project a softer side. </p> <p>And Clinton told Blair, the White House operatives went along with that because it directed the criticism away from Bill Clinton.<br></p> <p>Clinton was also getting tired of the criticism of her appearance. \u201cI gave up my name, got contact lenses. But I\u2019m not going to try to present to be someone that I\u2019m not,\u201d she told Blair.</p> <p>\u201cShe has about come to the conclusion that no matter what she does is going to piss off some people, so will just continue to be herself and let everybody else make whatever adjustments they have to.\u201d</p> <p>From her privileged position as confidante, Blair also served as a sounding board for Clinton at the bleakest moments during her time as first lady, when she was confronted with her husband\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky.</p> <p>It seems clear even then, when the humiliation was still fresh, that Clinton never seriously contemplated divorce. \u201cHe has been her best friend for 25 years, her husband for 23 years, they\u2019re connected in every way imaginable, she feels strongly about him and family and Chelsea and marriage and she\u2019s just got to try to work it through,\u201d Blair wrote in her notes. \u201cShe is not trying to excuse him. It was a huge personal lapse. And she is not taking responsibility for it.\u201d</p> <p>Blair goes on to record Clinton\u2019s efforts to rationalise her husband\u2019s behaviour \u2013 because of the pressure he was under as president, his early upbringing, and to dismiss its importance. </p> <p>Ultimately, Clinton forgave her husband. \u201cShe\u2019s in it for long haul,\u201d Blair wrote. \u201cBecause she\u2019s stubborn; partly her upbringing; partly her pride \u2013 but, mostly because she knows who she is and what her values and priorities are and she\u2019s straight with those \u2013 she really is OK.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Nine months later, in July 1999, Blair flew to DC for a visit, arriving at the White House to find Bill Clinton practicing his putting, and Hillary Clinton lounging by the pool. </p> <p>That evening Blair found the couple in the solarium, with Bill Clinton helping Hillary Clinton with a speech \u2013 trying to make it punchier. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear how much she values his advice and editorial skills,\u201d Blair wrote. When Clinton came back from the event, she thanked her husband for his help.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s second act had begun. She spent her final months as first lady launching her run for the Senate seat in New York. From here on, it would be Hillary Clinton\u2019s ambitions taking center stage, and Bill Clinton offering back-up support.</p> <p>And, the old Arkansas friends said, Bill Clinton was entirely fine with that. The admiration he had for Hillary Clinton all those years before was still alive, they insisted.</p> <p>\u201cThe way he talks about her and the way she talks about him,\u201d said Margaret Whillock, visited the family in Chappaqua when Clinton was in the Senate. \u201cOne time he said Hillary got this great new dress for the Met opening or something like that. He knew those things. He was glad. He was proud of her.\u201d</p> <p>She went on: \u201cYou could just tell.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Many of us are familiar with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/le-petit-prince-pages-auction\" title=\"\"><em>Le&#xa0;Petit Prince</em></a>, whether in French or English: I&#xa0;haven\u2019t read it for decades but I do remember two salient details: that the prince finds a downed pilot (who narrates the story), and that when the Prince \u2013 as we suppose \u2013 dies, there is no trace of his body.</p> <p>The similarities between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/antoine-de-saint-exupery\" title=\"\">Saint-Exup\u00e9ry</a>\u2019s life and work are so obvious as to be obligatory to note when writing about him: he was a pilot of rare courage even among pilots; he was flying a reconnaissance mission over occupied France in 1944 when his plane vanished. No one knows what happened to him, but a silver bracelet with his name on it&#xa0;was found by a diver in the Mediterranean in 1998.</p> <p>Correspondingly, Fabien in <em>Night Flight</em> runs into a storm while delivering mail from Patagonia and is never heard from again. However, such is the&#xa0;power of this short, timeless work that this does not seem like a tragedy: there is something more mysterious at work. \u201cVictory ... defeat ... such words are completely meaningless\u201d, the text muses as it contemplates Fabien\u2019s fate and that of his boss, the driven, philosophically inclined Rivi\u00e8re.</p> <p>Published in 1931, <em>Vol de Nuit</em> was Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s second novel. Drawing on his own experiences in South America, he turned the bare details of&#xa0;aeronautic mail delivery into what became seen as an existentialist classic. I am, incidentally, not entirely happy with the phrase \u201cin South America\u201d: it&#xa0;should really be \u201cover\u201d, for the point about flying, especially in such circumstances, is that it takes place in another world. As Fabien says to his wife, who is a little dismayed that he is&#xa0;not upset to be leaving her for his plane: \u201cIt\u2019s great leaving at night. You pull the throttle control, face south, and 10 seconds later you turn the landscape round and head north. The city has become just part of the seabed.\u201d How simple and yet how immense and&#xa0;exact to the experience of flight that phrase \u201cyou turn the landscape round\u201d is.</p> <p>The quality of the writing is extraordinary. Like a plane, it has weight and yet can soar. A pilot who has returned after a rather hairy journey is described, after his landing, thus: \u201cThe pilot, busy with some mysterious task, did not deign to reply. Probably he was listening to all the noise of the flight which was still within him ... Finally he turned towards his superiors and workmates and regarded them seriously, as though they were his property.\u201d This is Yeats\u2019s \u201clonely impulse of delight\u201d given substance and a shadow.</p> <p>I suppose that, given a certain temperament \u2013 and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was, by all accounts, a dreamy child and young man \u2013 it would be almost impossible <em>not</em> to write such a poetic and yet precise work as this, rather as it is hard to take a bad picture of Venice. Flying and writing were in his blood, and the solitude and majestic spectacle of flying across the Andes at night is, I&#xa0;would imagine, conducive to reverie. I have flown over the moonlit Alps in a tiny plane, and it is not an experience you forget. \u201cIt\u2019s too beautiful,\u201d Fabien thinks as, at one point, he climbs above&#xa0;the storm to find himself in \u201can&#xa0;unfamiliar part of the sky which was hidden like the bay of the Blessed&#xa0;Isles\u201d.</p> <p>This, then, is <em>The Little Prince</em> for grownups: a story about what one makes of an immense solitude (very well translated by David Carter; and the cover of the book is beautifully conceived), written by a remarkable man, who was described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tomwolfe\" title=\"\">Tom Wolfe</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/14/100-best-nonfiction-no-7-right-stuff-tom-wolfe\" title=\"\"><em>The Right Stuff</em></a> as: \u201cA saint in short, true to his name, flying up here at the right hand of God.

The avatar will become your digital alter-ego, chat to other people, even long after you pass away, be your personal assistant, confidant and who knows what else? The possibilities are endless.\u201d The site has yet to go live but 33,000 people have already signed up. </p> <p>In a similar way, social network <a href=\"https://www.eter9.com/auth/login\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eter9</a> uses AI to analyse your posts and comments to learn about your personality in order to create a virtual counterpart that will publish, comment and interact for you on the network following your death. Eter9 founder Henrique Jorge says it enables users to have a \u201cvirtual extension of yourself alive forever\u201d. </p> <p>Jorge says the avatars are clever. \u201cFor example, if the user posts some videos and music about a particular band in a specific time of his life, his counterpart won\u2019t post about that band for the eternity. It will have learnt about him during his life, so it collates all the information gathered and will post according to his patterns.\u201d</p> <p>Currently in beta, Eter9 has attracted 50,000 users. So far Jorge hopes to integrate Eter9 with other social networks in the future.</p> <p>\u201cAs time passes, evolution is inevitable and AI is, of course, part of it,\u201d says Jorge. \u201cIt\u2019s potential is impressive, but it\u2019s up to us decide how far it can go. As long as we control the machines we create in order to help us, only good results will come. Our world is becoming more and more technological and digital. Digital afterlife is inevitable; in fact, I think it\u2019s already happening: every action you take in the cyberspace remains there even after you pass away.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/24/snapchat-give-voice-sexual-abuse-survivors\">Using Snapchat to give a voice to sexual abuse survivors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But isn\u2019t having an avatar chat to your family and friends years after you\u2019ve died a bit creepy? \u201cWe are very aware of the emotionality that is attached to the topic of death or to that of robot clones or avatars,\u201d replies Ursache. \u201cFor us it is really important to emphasise that we do not want to preserve the banalities of the life of a person, but would much more like to create a legacy that allows your great-grandchildren to interact with their great-grandfather \u2013 and beyond.\u201d</p> <p>While living on as an avatar certainly sounds fun, it flags up many issues. Can an avatar really replicate your own true thoughts and style of messages across social media? What happens to all the data that\u2019s collected once you\u2019ve died? (Eter9 insists the information is only stored in its system servers and is not transmitted to third-party websites). One area that could throw up all sorts of problems is if the family of the bereaved are unhappy with the posts of an avatar. Will family warfare continue even long after you\u2019ve passed away when your avatar, knowing you disliked your family, spouts out less than complimentary posts about your siblings? </p> <p>Scanning through Instagram, perhaps many of my generation will be known long after we die for being avocado-obsessives and fans of coffee boards with not-so-funny slogans. Maybe it\u2019s time to get cleaning up our cringeworthy Facebook and Instagram posts \u2013 or asking our avatars to do that for us. </p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>The family of a \u201clovely\u201d 13-year-old girl who claims to have been groomed for sex by Asian men in Rotherham were so afraid of her alleged abusers that they moved to Spain after their complaints to the police, social services, their MP and the home secretary went unresolved, a court has heard.</p> <p>The girl, who cannot be named, is the main complainant in the trial of eight men from the South Yorkshire town who allegedly groomed and sexually exploited three underage girls between 1999 and 2003. </p> <p>Now 27 and a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, she claims her abusers threatened to \u201cgang rape\u201d her mother if she did not submit to their sexual abuse, which took place largely in an alley behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham town centre, in a local park and in bushes near a museum, Sheffield crown court heard on Tuesday.</p> <p>She claims that Sageer Hussain, 30, first raped her behind Boots when she was 13 and later called her a \u201cwhite slag\u201d when she tried and failed to stop him. She told police that the first and second time he raped her, between 1 January and 4 April 2003, he told her to scream so that his friends, waiting nearby, would know to come and watch.</p> <p>She claims that on another occasion she was driven to Rotherham\u2019s Clifton Park by Hussain\u2019s cousin, Mohammed Whied, who sat on the car bonnet watching while Hussain raped her inside. On a further occasion, Hussain allegedly raped her in bushes near the museum, calling her \u201ca big baby\u201d when she protested, then flicking cigarette ash in her hair, Michelle Colborne QC, prosecuting, told the jury. A few days later he punched her in the face and threatened her with a crowbar and set light to an aerosol in her face, the barrister said.</p> <p>The girl told her mother what had happened and gave a statement to police alleging that various men had raped her, including Hussain. A medical examination in April 2013 recorded bruises to her thighs and bottom, but she quickly withdrew the allegations and no charges were brought. Ten years later she reported the abuse to police again, saying she had been threatened by the men at the time. \u201cFor example, they threatened they would gang rape her mother. They would drive around the estate where she lived to make sure they were serious,\u201d Colborne told the jury.</p> <p>The girl\u2019s parents sought help from social services and the police, writing to their MP and the then home secretary, David Blunkett, who was a Sheffield MP at the time. They had a panic alarm installed in their house and eventually moved to Spain to get away, the court heard.</p> <p>Her mother later told police how she watched her child turn from \u201ca loving, lovely girl to one she described as \u2018horrible\u2019 and she was powerless to control\u201d, Colborne told the jury. She asked: \u201cWhat causes a perfectly lovely child to go from that state to a life of deceit and fear?\u201d Hussain had subtly groomed the girl with cigarettes, alcohol and cannabis, she said.</p> <p>The complainant now campaigned against child sexual exploitation, the jury was told. She ha has also written a book about her experiences, given evidence to the home affairs select committee and appeared in a Channel 4 programme called Britain\u2019s Sex Gangs.</p> <p>Hussain\u2019s older brother, Basharat Hussain, 40, is also accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting the girl during the same period. Another of their cousins, Asif Ali, is accused of raping her too, along with friends Ishtiaq Khaliq, now 33, Waleed Ali, 34, and Masoued Malik, 32. Malik is also accused of false imprisonment and conspiring to indecently assault her when she was 14, along with Naeem Rafiq, 33, in a house in Woodside Walk in Rotherham.</p> <p>Two further complainants came forward earlier this year to accuse Khaliq of indecently assault on various occasions between August 1999 and December 2001.</p> <p>The men deny all the charges against them. The case continues.</p>",

  "<p>The European Union is facing an existential crisis, the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, will say on Wednesday, as he announces a raft of economic and security plans in the search for common ground in the wake of the British vote to leave.</p> <p>In his annual state of the union address to the European parliament, Juncker will say commonality between EU member states has never been so low, with governments everywhere quicker to say what they don\u2019t want from Brussels rather than work together.<br></p> <p>The EU executive hopes to find the elusive common ground with a plan to boost the EU\u2019s infrastructure fund by increasing its value to \u20ac500bn (\u00a3425bn). Juncker will also press for speedy implementation of a recently agreed law to create an EU border and coastguard to ensure better control of migrants arriving from the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/expel-hungary-from-eu-for-hostility-to-refugees-says-luxembourg\">a poisonous diplomatic spat between Luxembourg and Hungary</a> over the treatment of asylum seekers underlined just how difficult it will be to find agreement on the migration crisis. At least 3,169 people died or went missing in an attempt to reach Europe during the first eight months of the year.<br></p> <p>Juncker\u2019s speech, which was still getting the finishing touches on Tuesday night, comes just two days before EU leaders meet in Bratislava for a summit without Britain, aimed at charting a way forward for the EU after Brexit.<br></p> <p>Neither event is expected to result in detailed discussions on the EU27 strategy for dealing with the UK as it heads towards the EU exit.</p> <p>Juncker will, however, refer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex\">the murder of a Polish factory worker</a> in Harlow, Essex, as he speaks out against violence and discrimination.</p> <p>EU officials are increasingly resigned to the likelihood that the UK is unlikely to trigger article 50 in the near future, a fact that causes varying degrees of angst.</p> <p>Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, who will meet Theresa May in London next week, called on the British government to trigger article 50 by the end of the year to provide clarity and avoid \u201cweakening\u201d the EU. \u201cTo wait more than a year is completely counter-productive,\u201d he told the Guardian and five continental papers. </p> <p>He dismissed the argument \u2013 advanced by some British government sources \u2013 that it would be better to wait until French and German elections are over, before triggering article 50 in late 2017. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not an acceptable argument. There are always elections in the European Union in some member states.\u201d Waiting until after Germany\u2019s elections in autumn 2017 could mean the UK would still be an EU member during the next round of European elections, throwing up complications for all sides. But the British government is unlikely to be face immediate pressure from other governments to trigger exit talks. </p> <p>In a letter to the 27 governments sent before the meeting, the man organising the summit, European council president, Donald Tusk, said it would be \u201ca fatal error to assume that the negative result in the UK referendum represents a specifically British issue\u201d.</p> <p>He writes that \u201cit is true that the leave campaign was full of false arguments and unacceptable generalisations\u201d, but the Brexit vote was also \u201ca desperate attempt to answer the questions that millions of Europeans ask themselves daily\u201d, citing border control and the fight against terrorism.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople in Europe want to know if the political elites are capable of restoring control over events and processes which overwhelm, disorientate, and sometimes terrify them. Today many people, not only in the UK, think that being part of the European Union stands in the way of stability and security.\u201d</p> <p>The EU institutions are converging on the idea that Europe needs to concentrate on practical policies; both the nuts and bolts of deepening the single market and extending it to the internet through a digital single market will feature in Juncker\u2019s speech.<br></p> <p>Brussels insiders share frustration that national governments are reluctant to defend EU policies and complain that ministers lack EU knowledge, sometimes unaware when they say \u201csomething must be done\u201d, that a policy already exists, or is being discussed.</p> <p>According to Schulz, too many governments want to cherry pick the bits of the EU they liked, such as generous European funding for poorer regions, while ignoring the bits they don\u2019t. If countries continued to take the advantages without fulfilling their duties, this would end in \u201cdestroying the European Union\u201d he said. </p> <p>In his speech, Juncker will also mount a defence of trade policy, amid ongoing doubts about whether the controversial transatlantic trade deal (TTIP) can ever be agreed, as well as questions over ratifying the EU-Canada trade deal, which was seven years in the making.</p> <p>Tusk echoes this qualified defence of trade deal. \u201cFailing to reach trade agreements ... will inevitably create an impression that Brexit has sparked a process of eliminating us from the global game,\u201d he said. But future trade agreements can only work by restoring trust of workers, consumers and entrepreneurs.<br></p>",

It may be that the UK government was unable to analyse the nature of the rebellion in Libya due to incomplete intelligence and insufficient institutional insight, and that it was caught up in events as they developed. </p> <p>\u201cIt could not verify the actual threat to civilians posed by the Gaddafi regime; it selectively took elements of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s rhetoric at face value; and it failed to identify the militant Islamist extremist element in the rebellion.

  "<p>This, the year of our Lord 2k16, marks 19 years since the first episode of <strong>South Park</strong> (<em>Friday, 10pm, Comedy Central</em>). For its 20th season, which begins this week, a trailer has been released featuring a voice actor repeatedly saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve been there\u201d, soothingly, to panning shots of a well-adjusted suburban kid\u2019s landmark moments \u2013 birth, first day of school, uni \u2013 while the show\u2019s most vulgar output plays in the background. The message from creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker is that South Park has won the war. It\u2019s now an all-American entity, one that\u2019s outlasted the moral panic that surrounded its early seasons. Stone and Parker are staging a churlish sit-in on modern culture, and they\u2019re not going anywhere.</p> <p>If, somehow, you\u2019ve missed the last 19 years of Stone/Parker output, let\u2019s stop here for a quick refresher. The show has drawn horror from almost everyone with a mouth capable of forming itself into a shocked \u201cO\u201d. From Christian groups, Muslim groups, the entire nation of India (where it is banned outright), and from self-appointed guardians of TV the Parents Television Council, who called it a \u201ccurdled, malodorous black hole of Comedy Central vomit\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Y8f13WBAE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/96Y8f13WBAE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>At any point during the show\u2019s run, Matt and Trey could have toned it down. For the sake of an easy life, they might have thought twice about showing the Holy Virgin Mary squirting menstrual blood into the Pope\u2019s face, perhaps. Whether you admire their refusal to compromise or see it as hard-headed is really a matter a personal opinion. Either way, this attitude is apparently a recipe for great comic success and enormous riches. Part of Parker and Stone\u2019s triumph comes from taking risks, like playing around with a continual, series-long theme in the most recent season with new character PC Principal, a pumped-up enforcer of politically correct culture, who savagely beats any child willing to disobey his edicts.</p> <p>As a good Guardianista I should pull my cardigan tight and frown at such mockery of liberal values. It does, though, underline Stone and Parker\u2019s career-long insistence that it\u2019s not \u201cthe thing\u201d they hate, just the way society reveres \u201cthe thing\u201d. Let them have this: while other cartoons contort themselves to keep a footing in popular culture (hello, Simpsons guest stars), South Park effortlessly proves that its pathologically dismissive humour is the only type that remains fresh. Where animated comedy is concerned, there seems to be two choices: overzealous displays of puerile offence, or a fawning lapdance at the feet of the zeitgeist; and if, God forbid, you grasp for both, the result is Family Guy. South Park then, is a precious thing.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the trailer released to coincide with the show\u2019s 20th run doesn\u2019t give much away about what to expect: after all, this is a show that builds an episode from scratch less than a week before broadcast. My hope is for a slant towards episodes starring infant sociopath Eric Cartman, The previous political correctness-themed season could have made some changes in that department, but when you\u2019re making a moralising epic all about the cost of offence, you can\u2019t have someone like him around rocking the boat. There isn\u2019t a lot to love about Cartman: the bullying, the xenophobia, that time he got a fellow pupil to eat their parents. But evil has an allure, and he\u2019s part of the furniture now. Like a parasitic wasp burrowing into your frontal cortex and settling in \u2013 and, like South Park itself \u2013 he\u2019s here to stay.</p>",
  "<p>Fires have returned once again to the forests and peatlands of Riau province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

A thick, acrid smoke covered large areas of Indonesia and neighbouring countries, and more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/indonesias-fires-crime-against-humanity-hundreds-of-thousands-suffer\">500,000 cases</a> of acute respiratory tract infections were reported between July and October 2015.</p> <p>Riau is often one of the hardest hit by the fires, due in part to its <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/blog/2014/04/preventing-forest-fires-indonesia-focus-riau-province-peatland-and-illegal-burning\" rel=\"nofollow\">high concentration of peatland</a>. Dry peatland is like gasoline for fires, says Woro Supartinah, coordinator of the NGO Riau Forest Rescue Network which monitors fires in the region. Yet Dosan, a small village in the province surrounded by palm plantations, has not recorded a single fire since 2012, according to those who live there, thanks to a concerted local effort to tackle the problem. The question is whether such success can be replicated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-12T14:31:39.html\" data-alt=\"Map of Dosan, Riau province, Sumatra.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-12T14:31:39.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Map of Dosan, Riau province, Sumatra.</a> <figcaption>Map of Dosan, Riau province, Sumatra.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Undoing the damage</h2> <p>In 2003, the regional government began a poverty-alleviation programme, giving three hectare plots of land to smallholders \u2013 including those in Dosan \u2013 to plant oil palms. On receipt of the land, the villagers drained the peat to make the land more productive by dissecting it with a labyrinth of canals. And then the land started to burn.</p> <p>Six years later, after a particularly destructive fire ravaged 11 hectares around Dosan, a farmers\u2019 collective known as Cooperative Bungo Tanjung launched a programme to protect peatland, prevent fires and promote better cultivation practices.</p> <p>Most significantly, the programme promotes canal blocking. \u201cWe build the dams to keep the level of the water stable at a minimum of 30cm. At this level, palm oil can grow but it is humid enough to avoid fires,\u201d explains Pak Dahlan, a senior farmer in the village. Although it is relatively simple to build the dams, the 20m Indonesian rupiahs (\u00a31,150) that each costs \u2013 mainly thanks to the price of cement \u2013 is a handicap to scaling up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf5c64de7d69e7e04f358d902fdd5e0a9f624a92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf5c64de7d69e7e04f358d902fdd5e0a9f624a92/0_8_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firefighters from community-based firefighter unit Masyarakat Peduli Api\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firefighters from community-based firefighter unit Masyarakat Peduli Api patrol Dosan at least twice a day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Villadiego</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe community pays for the dams,\u201d says Dahlan, who adds that the village is trying to raise money to increase the number of dams from 13 to at least 25. As part of their money-raising efforts, the cooperative organises festivals and gatherings where they ask for donations.</p> <p>In addition to the dams, the Dosan smallholders have made a common agreement to stop the practice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2012/nov/05/up-in-smoke-slash-burn-farming-video\">slash-and-burn</a>. The technique, widely used in Indonesia to clear forest quickly and cheaply, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/11/indonesia-forest-fires-explained-haze-palm-oil-timber-burning\">significantly increases</a> the risk of uncontrolled fires. While slash-and-burn is illegal under Indonesian law, there is an exemption for smallholders which Dosan\u2019s smallholders are urged to ignore.</p> <p>The final core part of the fire-prevention project is the Masyarakat Peduli Api, a community-based firefighter unit funded by the Indonesian government and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) that patrols Dosan several times a day.</p> <h2>Beyond Dosan</h2> <p>In addition to the funding from the government and UNEP, a number of local NGOs are supporting Dosan in its efforts to stop forest fires. Perkumpulan Elang, a conservation and community development NGO in Riau, for example, has provided smallholders with the knowledge to build the dams and keep the water level stable in the peatlands.</p> <p>Other villages are now starting to follow Dosan\u2019s example. In Jatibaru, located 40km from Dosan, villagers started to dam the canal which runs through their oil palm plots earlier this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8fe4af582e8dc86f018a80a3610094fd424076b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fe4af582e8dc86f018a80a3610094fd424076b6/0_97_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A canal dam in Jatibaru\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inspired by Dosan, villagers in Jatibaru have started to dam the canal which runs through their oil palm plantations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Villadiego</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have problems with fires every year. Three years ago there was a big fire and we had a warning from government saying [...] that if any other fires happened they would arrest whoever was responsible,\u201d says Maman, a community leader. He has supervised the construction of eight dams built since January, but says they are not enough to protect the whole village.</p> <p>Dosan, which is not part of a bigger concession, sets an example for larger palm oil producing regions, says Adhy Prayitno, a researcher at the Center for Disaster Studies at the University of Riau. However, while the principle of blocking canals can be replicated, each place has unique requirements so the design of solutions must be adapted to suit local hydrology characteristics, he added.</p> <p>Dosan people know the village and their land inside out, says Prayitno: \u201cCompanies can learn from this. They have to build a mutual relationship with local communities and give them more opportunities to participate in the [palm oil] supply chain.\u201d </p> <p>However, Rachel Carmenta, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for International Forestry Research, says the current flurry of forest fire prevention schemes in Riau \u2013 both through the government\u2019s Peatland Restoration Agency as well as through communities such as Dosan \u2013 need to take stock of past lessons. \u201cThey are operating largely in the absence of a systematic evidence base\u201d, she says. </p> <p>In addition, evidence suggests the most effective fire management interventions \u2013 such as peatland rewetting \u2013 are also the most controversial, she says, and deploying these \u201cwill therefore require significant negotiation and stakeholder dialogue to bring about consensus, in turn requiring expertise, money and time \u2013 as well as monitoring.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/Media/Press-Releases/2016-press-releases/halifax/ker-ching-childrens-pocket-money-hits-nine-year-high/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research by Halifax</a>, 81% of children in the UK receive pocket money. On average, a child gets \u00a36.55 a week, the highest level for nine years, the bank says. But it seems the gender pay gap rears its ugly head at an early age, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/03/boys-get-more-pocket-money-than-girls-halifax-survey-finds\">with boys getting 12% more pocket money than girls</a>.<br></p> <p>Although 79% of children save some of their pocket money, there are those who want all children to learn good money-management habits, as well as what to do in an increasingly cashless world. Both objectives led a group of parents in Hampshire to come up with <a href=\"https://www.gohenry.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">goHenry</a>.<br></p> <h2>Crowdfunding success</h2> <p>In June the business <a href=\"http://blog.crowdcube.com/2016/06/07/gohenry-breaks-crowdcube-record-with-3-99m-raise/\" rel=\"nofollow\">raised almost \u00a34m on Crowdcube</a>, the platform\u2019s largest crowdfunded deal to date, with money coming from 2,300 investors, 1,300 of whom are goHenry customers. Parents pay \u00a32.49 per month per child to use goHenry, following a free two-month trial.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the UK\u2019s first digital banking solution for families that aims to make kids smarter at managing money,\u201d CEO Alex Zivoder says. \u201cWe offer 8- to 18-year-olds a pre-paid Visa debit card and app with unique parental controls. It\u2019s all designed to help young people learn good money habits, while giving parents peace of mind and an easy way to manage pocket money.\u201d </p> <p>Parents pay pocket money on to the goHenry card from their bank account. They can set spending limits and decide where and how the card can be used, for example whether it can be used for online purchases. They can also keep an eye on how their child is spending the cash. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c66fca7f465266a3c50ea295c5e2199aabbe2981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c66fca7f465266a3c50ea295c5e2199aabbe2981/453_26_623_778/400.jpg\" alt=\"Founder of goHenry\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Zivoder, CEO of goHenry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Tyler Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cashless society</h2> <p>As Zivoder observes, many children can\u2019t buy things in an increasingly cashless society without borrowing a parent\u2019s card. \u201cAnd often parents have no oversight into this spending, while kids aren\u2019t learning the value of money,\u201d says Zivoder. <br></p> <p>Unlike traditional bank accounts, goHenry was founded by parents and built from the ground up, he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just take something for adults and brand it for kids; goHenry was designed specifically for young people and their parents.\u201d <br></p> <p>Children can earn more for completing tasks, while savings goals can be set for things they want to buy. \u201cMoney management is a vital life skill, and the more parents support their kids to know how to manage money, the better. Research suggests that children start forming money habits from the age of seven, whereas parents leave discussing saving until their kids are nine.\u201d<br></p> <p>Zivoder says the future of pocket money is digital. \u201cIn 2015, more than half of UK transactions were cashless. </p> <p>\u201cToday, one in 10 people use their smartphone to check their spending each day.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Parental control</h2> <p>Mother-of-four, Angela Davies, lives with husband Neill in the Hampshire village of Sway. \u201cMy youngest is 14 and two have left home now, but we\u2019ve used goHenry since 2012. Often I\u2019d forget to get cash out for pocket money,\u201d she admits. \u201cMy kids were too young for bank accounts \u2013 and the nearest branch is four miles away anyway.\u201d<br></p> <p>Davies says goHenry has provided a convenient way to make weekly pocket money payments from her bank account on to a goHenry debit card, while setting individual purchase and weekly spending limits. \u201cMy daughter can tag items of clothing \u2013 she loves Jack Wills \u2013 then she can see her pocket money building up until she can afford to buy them.<br></p> <p>\u201cI was also able to list tasks, so they could automatically earn more by doing household chores, such as washing the car. When your kids buy things you get a notification, too.

  "<p>When Pablo Trapero was 13, growing up in the rough-edged district of La Matanza outside Buenos Aires, his father gave him a warning. It was 1985 and Argentina had just emerged from the cruel years of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/25/argentina-junta-coup-videla-peron-1976-archive\">military junta</a>. The boy wanted to get involved in his school council. His father, sceptical of how long democracy would last, advised against it.

Several members of a wealthy family from the capital had been arrested for the kidnapping of four people. Three had been murdered despite ransoms being paid. \u201cI was young,\u201d he says, \u201cso I don\u2019t think I really understood it.

The family were the Puccios, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-34106282\">a name still notorious in Argentina</a>. The father, Arqu\u00edmedes, proved to have planned the crimes \u2013 but he didn\u2019t act alone.</p> <p>The first victim was Ricardo Manoukian, a friend of the eldest son, Alejandro Puccio. The pair played rugby together; Alejandro had been good enough to be picked for the Argentinian national team. The family imprisoned Manoukian at their gated home, accepted a ransom of $250,000, then shot him. The same method was used twice more, until the police finally intervened while a ransom was being paid for the fourth victim. Soon, it transpired that, in the time of the junta, Arqu\u00edmedes Puccio had worked for the government in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/argentina-denial-dirty-war-genocide-mauricio-macri\">\u201cdirty war\u201d of terror and disappearance</a> against tens of thousands of trade unionists, students and activists.</p> <p>Trapero is bearded, shaggy and, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/clan-review-argentina-kidnap-drama-film-pablo-trapero-puccio-family\">all the horrors of his film</a>, warm and affable. The surviving members of the Puccio family, he says, did not help him. In fact, they denied being Puccios at all. \u201cThe mother and one daughter still own the same house, but they changed their names. Our production team contacted them and they literally said, \u2018Who? No, you have the wrong address.\u2019 And closed the door.\u201d But Trapero had other sources: social acquaintances, team-mates of Alejandro, lawyers offering case files and recordings of the calls made to the victims\u2019 families with ransom demands. Those families were also involved in the film, visiting the set to confirm details of location or costume. Trapero says that process was creatively thrilling. \u201cBut then you remember that for them, reliving this is the most terrible thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42126716e1d92ace538cbfc35752fa98f9e93083\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42126716e1d92ace538cbfc35752fa98f9e93083/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pablo Trapero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pablo Trapero was \u2018terrified\u2019 about the Puccio family\u2019s response to The Clan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Ghilardi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without a detective to build his story around \u2013 the police were scarcely involved until the end \u2013 The Clan instead takes us inside the Puccio home, a display case of middle-class banality. With the comic actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0289856/\">Guillermo Francella</a> deftly cast against type, Arqu\u00edmedes is a shark-eyed torturer and killer, but around the dinner table just a pompous old man. The other Puccios affect not to notice the screams from the top of the house. Alejandro complains bitterly about his father involving him in murder, then uses the proceeds to open a sports shop.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What Trapero calls 'the people in the shadows' remain obscenely powerful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Making the film reminded Trapero of his father\u2019s warnings. The dirty war is assumed to have been a busy, bloody time for Arqu\u00edmedes Puccio. Then, as the country became a democracy, he simply slipped into the role of affluent businessman, still preying on his fellow Argentinians, but now for private profit. What Trapero calls \u201cthe people in the shadows\u201d remained obscenely powerful. \u201cI am more afraid of this kind of person than I am of the bastard who attacks you openly,\u201d he says. \u201cThe person whose face you don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p> <p>For Trapero, there was always more to the story than one lone sociopath. When the tapes of the ransom demands surfaced, he says, it turned out they hadn\u2019t been recorded by the police, the Puccios or the victims\u2019 families. The list of other candidates was short. \u201cThose who Arqu\u00edmedes worked with in the junta, they were always part of these crimes. And they took their share of the money.\u201d So there were people involved who were never arrested? \u201cAbsolutely. Completely.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4bb3746a7e0e69771a08b1c5931f3836a5d3c8ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bb3746a7e0e69771a08b1c5931f3836a5d3c8ab/0_185_5577_3346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from The Clan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is real justice\u2019 \u2026 scene from The Clan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artificial Eye</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the trial of Arqu\u00edmedes, Alejandro and another son, Daniel \u2013 the remaining family members were never charged \u2013 sections of the Argentinian press scoffed at the idea this perfect family could be guilty. Thanks to the Puccios\u2019 legal team, Trapero says, the trial itself \u201cwas really a negotiation\u201d. After his conviction, Arqu\u00edmedes enjoyed a prison life deeply relaxed by Argentinian standards, in which he successfully completed a law degree. \u201cThere were always these favours.\u201d So while Trapero was \u201cterrified\u201d about the response of the victims\u2019 families to the film, he says they were delighted. \u201cI feel uncomfortable saying it, but one of them told me, \u2018Thank you \u2013 this is real justice.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When Trapero was a child, his mother taught and his father sold cars. In English, La Matanza means \u201cthe killing\u201d, a reference to it having once been a place where cattle were slaughtered. Under the junta, it also hosted pockets of concealed opposition. The church school Trapero attended was influenced by leftwing \u201cthird world Catholicism\u201d. Only years later did he learn that some of the priests who taught him had been sheltered by the school from the military. The experience inspired the film he made before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/clan-review-argentina-kidnap-drama-film-pablo-trapero-puccio-family\">The Clan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/21/white-elephant-review\">White Elephant</a>, about a shantytown priest played by the great <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201857/\">Ricardo Dar\u00edn</a>.

On its opening weekend, 53% of Argentinians going to the cinema went to see The Clan. </p> <p>Trapero was surprised such a huge audience wanted to revisit so bad a memory. \u201cBut my theory about Argentina is that it has this postcard image of itself, which is very melancholy. We\u2019re forever thinking about our broken dreams.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThe importance of the tango explains that. It\u2019s not like samba in Brazil, which expresses happiness. Tango is about sadness and obsession with the past. And in Argentina there is the highest ratio of psychologists to ordinary people anywhere. Everyone is in therapy. My wife studied psychology, my sister is a psychologist \u2026\u201d And you make films, I say. \u201cExactly! So I need therapy, too. But it means there is always reflection.\u201d</p> <p>He says he was glad to make the film for the sake of his son. Otherwise, \u201che might have one day heard this story and thought it was just fiction.\u201d But for now at least, he wants to step away from Argentinian history. He says he feels optimistic about the country. \u201cFor my father\u2019s generation, there was always the despair that the junta would come back. I don\u2019t think that will ever happen.

  "<p>Persuading councils to accommodate more refugees is a delicate art, but it is one that David Simmonds \u2013 who has overseen a successful drive to get councils to find homes for 20,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees \u2013 has begun to master.</p> <p>Earlier this month the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-anniversary-of-government-commitment-to-resettle-20000-syrian-refugees\" title=\"\">government announced that homes had been found for all the Syrian refugees the UK had committed to house</a>, and about 2,800 had arrived. Simmonds, who chairs the Local Government Association\u2019s asylum, refugee and migration task group, describes this (with understated satisfaction) as a \u201cgood achievement\u201d and \u201cone of the success stories\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/child-refugees-theresa-may-yvette-cooper\">Child refugees: Theresa May should be ashamed, says Yvette Cooper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But he is doubtful about whether a parallel commitment to give sanctuary to an unspecified number of unaccompanied refugee children can be achieved with the same speed, unless the government allocates more money to help councils across the UK to meet the \u201cstonkingly huge\u201d cost of caring for&#xa0;them.</p> <p>As deputy leader of Hillingdon council, in west London, since 2002, the 40-year-old Conservative councillor has had plenty of experience of accommodating lone refugee children, who, even before the start of the refugee crisis last year, often arrived at Heathrow, in his area. In his job with the LGA\u2019s asylum taskforce, he has watched the numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children double to 4,000 last year, and seen some councils (particularly Kent, with its port at Dover) struggle to cope.</p> <p>He believes that councils have the capacity to help many more children, and is sympathetic to the argument that Britain has a responsibility to help other European nations to share the burden of finding homes for the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-minors-idUKKCN0XT15M\" title=\"\">estimated 85,000 asylum-seeking children travelling alone</a>. This was the argument made by the Kindertransport refugee and Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/alf-dubs-antisemitism-islamophobia-racism\" title=\"\">Alf Dubs</a>, as he successfully pushed the government into a U-turn on its child migrant policy. The Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act committed the UK to taking a share of these children. Yet, since the legislation was passed,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\" title=\"\"> no child has been brought to the UK</a>. Simmonds says that \u201cthe government has got to turn the sentimental commitment into a practical one\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018It\u2019s no good saying \u2018yes, we want to help\u2019 unless you are also willing to say what that means in practice\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The success with which homes were found for the 20,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees to whom the then prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/07/uk-will-accept-up-to-20000-syrian-refugees-david-cameron-confirms\" title=\"\">David Cameron promised to give sanctuary</a> a year ago provides a template for how even the most cash-strapped council can be persuaded to cooperate, he argues.</p> <p>\u201cNo one has argued that we shouldn\u2019t be doing this. There are no protests saying they shouldn\u2019t be here. Even Ukip has been quite balanced about it,\u201d he says, during an interview at the LGA\u2019s Westminster headquarters. \u201cImmigration is a hugely polarising debate. Opinion polls show the country is pretty divided, but I\u2019ve been struck by the willingness of councils to help.\u201d</p> <p>This was partly because the call for council cooperation came in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees\" title=\"\">the death of Alan Kurdi</a>, the Syrian three-year-old who drowned as he fled the war a year ago, at a time when public opinion had firmly accepted the moral need to give sanctuary to more refugees from Syria.</p> <p>More crucially, it was because the government allocated clear funding to councils, to help meet the cost of housing refugee families, so that services for local residents would not be affected. About \u00a38,000 per individual for the first year, dropping to a smaller sum by 2020, has been put aside by the government to help subsidise the considerable costs involved in setting families up in the UK. Until there is similar clarity, indicating that the \u201cgovernment is genuinely committed to funding and supporting the children\u201d, councils will remain cautious about agreeing to accommodate more refugee children who have travelled across Europe alone, says Simmonds. \u201cIt is no good saying sentimentally: \u2018Yes, we want to help,\u2019 unless you are also willing to say what this means in practice.\u201d</p> <p>At present, councils get central government funding for the first year the child is with them, but after that the funding arrangements are still unclear. Given that a foster care placement can cost up to \u00a3140,000, this is a difficult cost to meet without help.</p> <p>\u201cCouncils are saying, \u2018If you want us to start taking on large numbers of children, there has to be evidence that it will be properly resourced.\u2019 If children are in the care of a council, that council will be responsible until they are 25; there could be university costs. There is a very big bill potentially attached to that. No council wants to be in a position where, having taken people in, they are then having to say we can\u2019t afford to support them\u2026 Our concern for the Dubs amendment was that it didn\u2019t envisage what was the long-term plan for all these children.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/may/19/kindertransport-survivors-todays-child-refugees-nicholas-winton\">Kindertransport survivors on today's child refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The success of the Syrian refugee commitment was in part due to the fact that a dedicated minister for settling Syrian refugees was appointed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-office-minister-with-responsibility-for-syrian-refugees-appointed\" title=\"\">Richard Harrington \u2013 </a>who set up a team to implement the pledge, and worked closely with councils to establish how best to help.

Harrington\u2019s job no longer exists, and there has been no team created for child refugees. \u201cIf we want to bring in significant numbers of children, then you need a similar team focused on that task, which we don\u2019t have,\u201d says&#xa0;Simmonds.</p> <p>But he is broadly optimistic about the capacity for refugees to be a force for good for local communities, if the process of finding them the right homes is sensitively handled. He understands why some councils have offered to take many families, while others, particularly in London and the south-east, have not committed themselves to housing any. This geographical division has been described as \u201casylum apartheid\u201d, but Simmonds says it is only logical that areas with available housing will be more ready to help.</p> <p>\u201cIn London, the south-east and Bristol, councils have been struggling to keep up with a massive expansion in the population, so understandably they are not rushing to be at the front of the queue. But there are other parts of the country, including some of the rural areas, where the population has been declining, and actually that has put different pressures on services \u2013 how do you run a school if all your classrooms are half empty?\u201d In many of these areas, he argues that the arrival of refugees will help the local economy.</p> <p>\u201cIt may be that for the first couple of years, they may need councils to find them somewhere to live and they may be claiming benefits, but once they are settled they can be an important part of the UK economy. These people are not always going to be a burden,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not a simple cost equation.\u201dThese are not views always shared by fellow Conservative party members, but he says that at a local government level the \u201cpolitical differences you see played out on a parliamentary stage are a lot less relevant. Local government tends to be quite practical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe moral consensus is very finely balanced and it depends where you go in the country,\u201d he points out. \u201cMy job is to walk that line, because if those [local] communities feel they have been fairly treated, they will probably be supportive.\u201d</p> <p>He firmly believes, however, that if local people say: \u2018\u201cAll these refugees are coming and now the library has closed,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t feel fair.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-mullin\">Chris Mullin</a> is a bit of a mystery. A leftwing troublemaker who managed to serve in the Blair government; a weedy-looking operator who took on the police and the IRA to <a href=\"http://www.chrismullinexmp.com/recent-articles/error-of-judgement\">free the Birmingham Six</a>; an idealistic socialist reporter who freelanced for the Sun and Telegraph; a dedicated parliamentarian who did not enter the Commons until he was 39; a writer of conspiratorial novels who reinvented himself as a self-deprecating, almost cosy political diarist \u2013 Mullin, now 68, has folded together multiple careers more like a Victorian than a modern MP.</p> <p><em>Hinterland</em> is another canny, deceptively casual Mullin performance. Covering his whole life, including phases already covered by his highly successful diaries, this slim book begins as a series of loosely connected anecdotes, after-dinner in tone, apparently random in their chronology, about the Labour party in the 70s and 80s. Mullin describes a boisterous, off-duty union leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/25/norman-willis\">Norman Willis</a>, a \u201clong-winded\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/neil-kinnock\">Neil Kinnock</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)_deputy_leadership_election,_1981\">Tony Benn\u2019s tumultuous 1981 challenge</a> for the Labour deputy leadership. It\u2019s all vivid stuff; but anyone who knows the party\u2019s history will be familiar with most of it already.</p> <p>Yet within a few pages you begin to realise that Mullin\u2019s conversational but cutting little stories have contemporary resonances. A Benn ally who is falsely accused by the Labour right of organising intimidatory heckling at party meetings turns out to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonlansman?lang=en-gb\">Jon Lansman</a>, now one of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s lieutenants, and founder of the leftwing pressure group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/08/momentum-corbyns-shock-troops-labour\">Momentum</a>, often unfairly accused of behaving in exactly the same bullying way.</p> <p>A similar reality check for demonisers of the Labour left comes with Mullin\u2019s account of how he captured his constituency, Sunderland South. In 1987 it was a longstanding Labour seat with a shrinking majority and a right-leaning MP, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/15/gordon-bagier\">Gordon Bagier</a>, best known for his support of the Greek military junta and about to enter retirement. To succeed him, Mullin had to outmanoeuvre an \u201coligarchy\u201d of trade union and Labour rightwingers, who were used to manipulating the local party by \u201cflooding\u201d it with temporary members \u2013 again, precisely what the Labour left is currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/corbyns-team-incensed-as-new-members-denied-labour-vote-again\">being condemned for doing</a>.</p> <p>Mullin held the seat for 23 years, despite the disintegration of the local shipbuilding and mining industries that had previously been the source of much of Labour\u2019s support. He refers to Sunderland as \u201cthe Deep North\u201d, and still lives a few dozen miles away, he tells us in a rare moment of ostentation, <a href=\"http://www.chrismullinexmp.com/my-garden\">in a cottage with a lawn which \u201ctakes three hours to cut\u201d</a>.</p> <p>He was born in a different world: the postwar suburbs of Chelmsford, in Essex, where both his parents worked for the telecommunications company Marconi. They were relatively prosperous and upwardly mobile, and sent him to a private boarding school. \u201cI was bullied mercilessly,\u201d Mullin writes, \u201cbut I knew I would outlive the bullies \u2026 [as] one of only a handful of the students to make it into the sixth form and from there to university.\u201d</p> <p>Usefully for his later battles with the establishment, Mullin studied law. He doesn\u2019t explain how he became political \u2013 sometimes this book\u2019s omissions feel as significant as its confessions \u2013 but he does admit that a summer job at Pontins was \u201cmy first encounter with the working classes\u201d, and that he found them \u201ccheerful, decent people\u201d. In 1970, at the precocious age of 22, he was selected as a Labour parliamentary candidate in North Devon. He lost his deposit.</p> <p>For the next decade and a half, he restlessly explored the large territory which existed in the 70s and 80s for confident young Britons who were interested in both leftwing activism and journalistic adventures. He nosed around wartime Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Occasionally he got a scoop, such as his discovery that the Daily Telegraph correspondent in Vietnam \u201cwhose reports appeared under the byline John Draw was \u2026 Nguyen Ngoc Phach, an officer in the army of the southern regime\u201d. When Mullin got back to Britain, following the more leisurely rhythms of journalism then, he \u201coffered the information \u2026 to the editor of the Guardian diary column\u201d. The editor \u201cdeclined to use it on the grounds that it was \u2018a bit so-whattish\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His relationship with his wife in postwar Vietnam is recalled with a melodrama that could almost be Graham Greene</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>South-east Asia changed Mullin. There, he learned that there was often \u201csomething wrong with the official version of events\u201d. He acquired a suspicion of America, which runs caustically through the rest of the book, and which set him apart from the unthinkingly transatlantic politicians who would come to dominate Labour during the Blair era. And he met his Vietnamese wife, Nguyen Thi Ngoc. The perilous early stages of their relationship in authoritarian postwar Vietnam are recalled with a tenderness and melodrama that could almost be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\">Graham Greene</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the book, the quietly, carefully spoken Mullin rations the emotional moments. \u201cI was a lonely youth with an overwhelming sense of social inferiority,\u201d we suddenly learn on page 63. In the penultimate chapter, he abruptly admits to \u201cfragile self-esteem\u201d, even as a government minister. In a passage that anyone who thinks politicians are an impregnably self-assured elite could usefully read, Mullin writes about dragging a wheelie suitcase to his basement flat in south London after each red-carpet trip abroad as a Foreign Office minister, and feeling \u201cas though I had been on the set of a film for the previous few days\u201d.</p> <p>Mullin made the transition from being a major source of irritation to the Labour hierarchy \u2013 in the early 80s, he published a still-infamous guide for rebellious party members,<em> How to Select or Reselect Your MP</em> \u2013 to being a minor Blair favourite because his views were more eclectic and pragmatic than those of most leftwingers. His decades in Sunderland left him sceptical about union power and liberal approaches to crime. His encounters with an over-mighty state in Vietnam made him sympathetic to some of New Labour\u2019s privatisations.</p> <p>But it would be a mistake to imagine he abandoned all his radical convictions. When I interviewed him last year about Whitehall\u2019s barely disguised horror at the possibility, however remote, of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, Mullin was as keen as ever to rehearse the argument of his 1982 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/10/y-fictional-prime-minister-harry-perkins-jeremy-corbyn-a-very-british-coup\"><em>A Very British Coup</em></a>: that any truly leftwing government would be illicitly destabilised by what he calls here the \u201cunseen hand\u201d of the British establishment. It\u2019s a typical Mullin phrase: understated, streetwise, slightly mocking of the powers-that-be.</p> <p>This book is a little too brief, and too bulked out with recycled material and plugs for other volumes, to be a classic political memoir. But it is an unusual and sometimes inspiring one, written by an unusually fearless politician. Halfway through, Mullin quotes an editorial he wrote for <a href=\"http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/\">Tribune</a>, the once-influential leftwing Labour journal which he edited with typical mischief and prickliness from 1982 to 1984: \u201cThis paper is not the property of any sect, tendency or personality \u2026 \u201d The same could be said of him. With luck, Labour\u2019s current leftwing phase will produce a new Mullin or two before it is snuffed out.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Hinterland</em> is published by Profile.

  "<p>It is hard not to suspect that it\u2019s all over for The Great British Bake Off. Its delicately balanced recipe depends so much on the flavours of its presenters and judges. When Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins confirmed that they were unwilling to follow the show to Channel 4, they deprived that recipe of its spice and salt.</p> <p>Like many members of the show\u2019s enormous audience \u2013 15 million watched the last season finale, and the current series\u2019 ratings hover around the 10 million mark \u2013 they clearly feel that the programme\u2019s spiritual home is the BBC. And, perhaps, that money should not be \u2013 need not be \u2013 the ultimate deciding factor in any moment of decision. But in allowing such a state of affairs to occur \u2013 a popular show travelling to another channel but leaving its beloved stars adrift \u2013 Love Productions, which makes the programme for the BBC, may well have destroyed the thing it created. The viewers will be the poorer for it.</p> <p>Yet we should not be surprised that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off\">right to broadcast Bake Off has been sold to Channel 4</a>, which is reported to have offered \u00a325m for the show per year, as opposed to the \u00a312.5m the BBC was either willing or able to pay. The programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/06/genius-of-great-british-bake-off\">radiates English pastoralism</a>. It is flavoured with the simple pleasures of the village fete, and scented with middle England (plus, to the sensitive palate, spiced with just a faintest background waft of Brexiteer). It is beloved because it champions the lopsided, good-hearted charm of amateur craft \u2013 of ordinary, everyday creativity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/13/bake-off-deal-all-bbc-channel-4\">Is the Bake Off deal all about the dough?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What it projects, however, stands in complete contrast to the way it is made. It works because it is machine-tooled with ruthless precision by Love Productions \u2013 a highly successful, ambitious company 70% owned by Sky. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/12/benefits-street-richard-mckerrow-channel-4\">The same company also makes the controversial Benefits Street</a>, which some argue has unpleasantly stereotyped benefits claimants.</p> <p>The BBC has long been part of an aggressive, highly competitive market. It has long needed to set the values of the market uneasily alongside its ethos of public service and public ownership. That\u2019s the world we live in. It is the world ushered in by successive governments and by the BBC\u2019s former director general John Birt when he marketised the corporation (out of necessity, he would argue) in the late 80s and 90s.</p> <p>The current situation that besets Bake Off seems to exemplify that curious doubleness: the show\u2019s stars seem impelled by loyalty to the BBC; its makers are apparently motivated by a combination of cash and a desire to grow the Bake Off brand (it has said so in its statements) in directions the BBC is unable or unwilling to go.</p> <p>Is there any fighting chance for GBBO on Channel 4? The problem for the broadcaster is that everything about Bake Off is particular. It has been refined over its six years on air. It began as a rather po-faced pedagogical show that contained seemingly endless items on the history of baking. That has largely fallen away, while the end-of-the-pier humour of Giedroyc and Perkins has blossomed, and the onscreen personae of its judges \u2013 flinty Paul Hollywood, grandmotherly Mary Berry \u2013 took time to settle into their current form.</p> <p>While exports of Bake Off have flourished, with versions produced in 21 territories, the show has struggled in some countries, notably the US. There, CBS dropped The American Baking Competition (with Paul Hollywood) after one season in 2013, and even Mary Berry was not enough to save its successor, ABC\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/doonan/2015/12/abc_s_great_holiday_baking_show_is_a_saccharine_copy_of_the_great_british.html\">The Great Holiday Baking Show</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/30/great-holiday-baking-show-british-bake-off-abc-copy-fails\">flopping</a> last year. The formula, then, is not enough. It needs its people.</p> <p>There are intriguing questions hovering over the BBC\u2019s motives in all of this. Had it simply agreed to Love Productions\u2019 terms, Bake Off would be galloping into the future without a hitch. The BBC has let it be known that its refusal to match Channel 4\u2019s offer was because \u201cresources are not infinite\u201d.</p> <p>It is quite true that the BBC, thanks to last year\u2019s funding settlement, is operating in straitened circumstances: it is now having to pay for licence fees for the over-75s, formerly borne by the government. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/06/bbc-pay-cost-free-tv-licences-over-75s-fee-deal\">That will cost it \u00a3750m by the financial year 2020-21</a>. Given the way it has grown and nurtured the show, the BBC possibly expected a certain level of loyalty from Love Productions that it hoped would transcend the crude realities of cash. By refusing to stump up, it is perhaps sending out a signal to other production companies that it cannot, in the future, be milked ruthlessly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/06/genius-of-great-british-bake-off\">The genius of The Great British Bake Off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the other hand, the BBC is not without choices. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/29/bbc-match-of-the-day-premier-league-highlights\">In 2015 it agreed to pay \u00a3204m</a> to retain the rights to Match of the Day over three years, a show with fewer viewers than Bake Off.

The loss of Bake Off, meanwhile, will present a challenge for the BBC. The show had become emblematic of the broadcaster\u2019s ability to draw audiences from across age, class and political divides, towards a universally popular piece of \u201cappointment\u201d television \u2013 one that also has a lively existence beyond the screen, on social media.</p> <p>It is one of a handful of shows regarded as quintessentially BBC, embodying its values (entertaining, and sometimes informing and educating too).

Instead, we have <strong>9/11: Truth, Lies and Conspiracies </strong>(ITV) which, while not as bad as it could have been, nevertheless marks the year the sound of barrel-scraping began to drown out the sound of history.</p> <p>The film gave airtime to three kinds of believers. First there were the \u201ctruthers\u201d, such as multimillionaire venture capitalist Jimmy Walter who remains convinced that explosives were used to blow up the towers to provide a pretext for the US government to take the country to war and boost the military-industrial complex. Then came the cover-up theorists who insist that government agencies are refusing to admit the mistakes they made, and that 9/11 could have been averted. Lastly were the conspiracy theorists, who claim that successive governments have lied about Saudi Arabian involvement in the attacks to protect national business interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-9-11-comments-since-2001\">Donald Trump and 9/11: the lies, exaggerations and eye-popping claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There wasn\u2019t enough information, though, to allow viewers to assess the value or likely truth (or \u201ctruth\u201d) of competing claims.

I was born and grew up in England and first travelled to Poland with my parents in 1978, as a two-year-old. But when I was old enough, I made it my own. As a youth, the country was the gateway to my \u201cwild east\u201d. It\u2019s that other Europe where there are fewer rules and more adventures; where I fell into work as a foreign correspondent, partly thanks to the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/28/ian-traynor-obituary\">late Ian Traynor</a>. That brought me further east, and the sort of experiences that as an infant Tintin fan I had only ever dreamed of.</p> <p>Now, as a 40-year-old man visiting the prosperous and occasionally luxurious Poland (yes, really), it\u2019s odd to imagine how harsh life was on our earlier visits. By bringing my mother to the country\u2019s maritime resort of Sopot (in northern Poland on the Baltic) on a middle-aged, middle-class, working vacation, I\u2019m not burning that ghost. I\u2019m taking it out for a meal in a fancy restaurant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f7e7d47a911a0f434c515b1b378223a7b3528cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f7e7d47a911a0f434c515b1b378223a7b3528cd/0_52_3759_2256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Looking from the lighthouse onto the promenade along the south beach and Baltic Sea shores in the spa Sopot in Pomerania, Poland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The promenade along the south beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hilke Maunder/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When you have the whole Mediterranean to choose from, the very idea of a Polish Riviera seems laughable. And yes, there is snow on the beach in January. But on 17 September last year, Sopot\u2019s mercury hit 28C in the shade. Because like its people, Poland\u2019s weather can be inexplicably hot, as well as utterly miserable. At least, like them, it is rarely boring.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pier's a simple walkway into the sea, with moorings and cafes instead of sugary souvenirs and scary fairground games</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Poland normally has a chilly spell in late August, followed by a <em>z\u0142ota jesie\u0144</em> (golden autumn). It\u2019s something akin to the UK\u2019s fabled Indian summer, which this year is proving anything but elusive. It is often heralded by a blood moon and is glorious, not just for the endless forests of copper and golden leaves. There is also an amber light created by a sun that is lower in the sky; and most importantly, heat.</p> <p>Most foreigners who visit Sopot go because of some personal reason. A British man with a Polish wife who misses her homeland; an Irish IT worker living in Krak\u00f3w who misses the sea; a German with heritage in the area, perhaps with nostalgia for the pre-war, German-speaking Zoppot of G\u00fcnter Grass and, before him, the Kaiser. There is also a contingent of marauding Scandinavians, who maintain the tradition of sailing across the Baltic to pick up cheap Polish alcohol and thrills. The rest, and there are many, are mostly Poles seeking value that cannot be found in Spain, Greece, or for that matter, Brighton.</p> <p>For as far as sea-towns go, Sopot is refined. First of all there is the wooden pier, the longest in Europe. It is a pleasant, simple walkway into the open sea, with moorings and cafes as opposed to sugary souvenirs and scary fairground games. Much of the city\u2019s architecture is over 100 years old and has been well restored. This is thanks Sopot\u2019s origins as a spa town, which grew up around mineral springs. These create an air around them that is so clean that it seems sweet. Breathing it makes you feel like you are trying on a nice new pair of lungs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e18d697a34f3c942eb679a702c049733000b3078\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e18d697a34f3c942eb679a702c049733000b3078/128_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rooftop bar at Zatoka Sztuki, Sopot, Poland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zatoka Sztuki</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zatoka Sztuki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This also might explain why the place looks so different to the treeless, windswept coasts of England. Healthy-looking sycamore, oak, chestnut and willow line not only the streets but also the seafront; some are growing on the beach itself. This comprises several miles of fine, golden sand backed by a protected dune that has been colonised by long grasses and flowering wild roses. Behind that is the coastal path which links tasteful wooden bars where Polish beer is now rivalled by elaborate cocktails.</p> <p>A favourite has become the Aperol-prosecco spritz, which is served with <em>pierogi</em> (filled dumplings). By day, these bars are bases for beach-volleyball players, paddleboarders and parents watching their small children construct giant sandcastles. By night, some beach bars become impromptu music venues with live jazz acts and solo acoustic performances.</p> <p>There are permanent structures such as <a href=\"http://zatokasztuki.pl/restauracja/\">Zatoka Sztuki</a>, which in the warmer months has a posey roof bar, with hot tubs and a view. Nearby is the legendary nightclub and art gallery <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Sfinks700\">Sfinks</a>. It\u2019s the Ha\u00e7ienda of Poland, but without the guns, and has had the clever idea of celebrating its 25th birthday every day this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b52d21ba7535c05c4741d36213a01f7fc1e43d5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b52d21ba7535c05c4741d36213a01f7fc1e43d5c/0_208_5064_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crooked House, illuminated shopfront at night, on Bohater\u00f3w Monte Cassino, Sopot, Poland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crooked House on Bohater\u00f3w Monte Cassino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nightman1965/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sopot\u2019s main promenade is Bohater\u00f3w Monte Cassino, named after the heroes of the second world war battle against the Germans in Italy, at which Polish and British forces fought side-by-side, and won. Particularly on the weekends, Monte Cassino can be crowded out by what are pejoratively known as <em>dresiarze</em> and <em>blachary</em> \u2013 boys who go out in sportswear, and girls who are assumed to like boys with sporty cars. For those who think they won\u2019t fit in, it\u2019s easy to escape.</p> <p>A longer walk, or a ride on hired bikes, can take you along the beach path all the way to Gda\u0144sk, for a feast of history if you want it. The city was Poland\u2019s great seaport for centuries, attracting immigrants from Britain. Pinched by crusaders for a while (<a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/847\">Malbork Castle</a>, the largest in the world, is nearby), it was then the Prussian and German city of Danzig; then an interwar city-state; then the flashpoint of the second world war; and finally the birthplace of Solidarno\u015b\u0107 (Solidarity), which helped bring the cold war to an end. Today, it has scrubbed up very well and is full of life. A 15-minute train ride takes you back to Sopot.</p> <p>Fresh fish is plentiful. Stalls have a high turnover of flounder, a decent cousin of the plaice. At <a href=\"http://www.bulaj.pl/\">Bulaj</a> we also ate excellent halibut (\u00a311). The cosiest place to dine is <a href=\"http://restaurant.cyrano-roxane.pl/en/\">Cyrano et Roxane</a> (mains from \u00a38.50), hosted by Frenchman Marc Petit and his Polish wife. They combine local ingredients with imports from Auvergne, such as livers for his homemade p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras. If you want to go really fancy, there is <a href=\"http://entrevilles.pl/en/\">L\u2019Entre Villes</a> (mains from \u00a310), which feels like stepping in to some Polish oligarch\u2019s Kensington mansion. We had starters, steak salad and partridge, all locally sourced and perfectly done, with impeccable service. Diners\u2019 remorse meant that, of course, the next day was potato pancakes (from \u00a31.50 for two) at a humble \u201cmilk bar\u201d, <a href=\"http://barbursztyn.pl/in-english/\">Bursztyn</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cadeeecf77cf55f1d72984c01f0a674593df674b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadeeecf77cf55f1d72984c01f0a674593df674b/0_0_1000_667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interiror of restauarnt L\u2019Entre Villes in Sopot.

The reply: \u201cBecause it\u2019s one of the best kitesurfing spots in Europe and it\u2019s where I learned. You\u2019ll both love it there even without doing any sport. There\u2019s a ferry.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the ferry from Sopot across the Bay of Puck to Poland\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.local-life.com/gdansk/articles/hel-peninsula\">Hel peninsula</a>, which is a very long, very narrow, spit of sand that is popular with lovers of fresh air, seaborne activity and corny puns.</p> <p>The crossing took an hour and a half, and the surface of the water was as still as a millpond. We sat next to a friendly German father and daughter, the mirror of our vacation. They have no pre-war roots in the area, she was quick to say.</p> <p>We snacked on sunflower seeds straight from their sunflower. The further out we got, the cleaner and sweeter the air became.

Its beach is on the north side of the peninsula, and has powdery sand that is almost white, backed by pine-tree woods with a carpet of squidgy moss and heather in purple bloom. Locals forage for juicy, pungent mushrooms and have a knack for differentiating between the delectable, the hallucinogenic and the fatal. Tourists are advised not to play fungus roulette.</p> <p>A 10-minute walk brought us to the south side of the peninsula, where there is a splendidly simple wooden pier. It presented a sunset that made the sea shine and set the clouds alight in a blaze of pink. The air was sweeter than ever. A lone fisherman ambled past a cafe, ignoring its offers of Mo\u00ebt and <em>tiramisu</em>. Across the water to the south were the Gda\u0144sk shipyards, where the salt of the Earth had changed the world. To the west, kitesurfers leapt at the sky.

While the rest of the species were increasing, Eaton said: \u201cWe are seeing a lot of turmoil, some species going up really, really fast and some going down equally fast. It does not look like a healthy, natural situation. If that carries on, you end up with just 50% left.\u201d</p> <p>Insects and other invertebrates, which make up 97% of all animal species, are particularly struggling, with 59% in decline since 1970. These provide vital services such as pollination and keep soils healthy, said Eaton: \u201cThe work they do for us is just immense. If they were to disappear, I think we\u2019d see environmental breakdown very quickly. They are about the most important things out there.\u201d</p> <p>Among the species in decline, great crested newts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/hedgehogs-continue-to-disappear-from-british-gardens-wildlife-survey-shows\">hedgehogs</a> and corn marigolds have suffered from changes in farming practices.

  "<p>At her first press conference in the week following that July Saturday night where Malcolm Turnbull stood before the voters ashen faced at the Sofitel, briefly contemplating his own political mortality, enraged at the very prospect of something so divergent from the life plan, Hanson was, reassuringly, the Hanson of old.<br></p> <p>It was like we\u2019d all peeled back the lid of the tin at the back of the cupboard marked 1998 and there she was, perfectly preserved in aspic. Those piercing eyes, cornflower blue. The flaming hair. The quaver in the voice. The righteous jut of the jaw. The stupendous scale of the feelings. The manifest disdain for facts and evidence.</p> <p>Pauline Hanson strode across the grass in Brisbane, spotlight trained on her, rugged up in a brightly coloured winter coat against a Queensland winter little more vengeful than a gentle breeze, ready to be disdained by the working press, a familiar ritual which that only endears the One Nation leader to her rusted-on supporters: plucky Pauline, giving those pricks of journos a good kicking. Go Pauline. You show \u2019em love. The Kimbos and the Himbos deserve everything they get.</p> <p>The Brisbane journalists didn\u2019t hesitate before getting stuck in, ripping her xenophobic, incoherent, noxious manifesto apart, question after question. Pauline Hanson just raised her jaw an inch or two higher and sailed on, a battleship of righteousness, with the flotsam holding on gamely, flapping against the hull. Watching the show back at my desk in Canberra, I had the clear view of the disconnected spectator. Here was Pauline, being pecked relentlessly by a mob of magpies. Like Donald Trump in America, attacks \u2013and that\u2019s what that press conference would look like to a person only glancing up periodically to peruse the show \u2013 are likely to make her stronger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/pauline-hanson-is-back-and-its-still-just-as-hard-to-counter-her-rhetoric-with-facts\">Pauline Hanson is back, and it's still just as hard to counter her rhetoric with facts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why is this? Understanding that requires referencing the various reasons why she\u2019s back. Hanson\u2019s and One Nation\u2019s success in 2016 is are in part about a double dissolution election (although Pauline\u2019s Hanson\u2019s personal support eclipses that), in part because the popular media has done a superb job of keeping Pauline Hanson in the spotlight as a quasi-political celebrity, partly because she appealed to voters Malcolm Turnbull spent zero time in the campaign talking to \u2013 the people stuck in the old economy with zero prospects of finding themselves recruited by Microsoft.</p> <p>I also think the strength of her showing is also about registering a gesture. She is a totem of the disdain many voters feel for politics as usual. Pauline Hanson is a raised middle digit on the floor of the Australian Senate. If the political class in Canberra rounds collectively on the stranger in its midst, deploys the blunt instruments of gotcha and when did you stop beating your wife, this will only confirm the worst fears of some deeply alienated voters that the system is rigged permanently against the interests of the people, that politics is about elites protecting their own patches. </p> <p>As John Howard noted in early July, treating Hanson as a \u201cscorned species\u201d is a monumental mistake. It expresses disdain for her supporters, who have as much right as anyone else to have their interests represented in parliament, and it ultimately plays into her studied depiction of herself as put-upon outsider, which is the dynamic on which she trades.</p> <p>Understanding Hanson\u2019s context is simple enough. But we face another challenge. The problem is not so much comprehending Pauline. Her shtick is now reasonably familiar. The contemporary problem is how we engage constructively with Hansonism, and by constructively I actually mean deconstructively, which is our core business as journalists: calling out the snake oil, attempting to protect people from being manipulated. </p> <p>Just as strategists have had to evolve their core methodologies as voters have evolved, journalists have to understand that the rules of our game are being rewritten as well. We have to understand that we now practise professionally in a post-truth environment, where increasingly, our audiences can increasingly choose to exist comfortably inside bubbles, selecting only the information and commentary that reinforces their views, rejecting other material.</p> <p>The problem we have in facing up to the more toxic and corrosive elements of Hansonism in 2016 (as opposed to the more orderly times in 1998) is that facts just don\u2019t seem to matter as much as they once did. My innate respect for facts and reason and evidence remained largely intact until I watched the dynamic around Donald Trump play out during America\u2019s gruelling primary season. </p> <p>I watched in horrified fascination from another hemisphere as the collective might of America\u2019s greatest newspapers turned their guns on the nativist king, not with random take-downs, or savage hit jobs, but just with forensic journalism: countering Trump\u2019s inflammatory nonsense with facts, and logic, and careful interrogation\u2014all with no visible impact on Trump\u2019s approval ratings.</p> <p>I know enough of my own eco-system, the world of national affairs that intersects between includes news publications, comments, threads and social media, to know that political conversation increasingly feels like a giant exercise in confirmation bias. A great many people still consume their politics passively and genially, with a healthy dose of scepticism and a genuinely open and enquiring mind, but there is also an increasingly rancorous cohort of political consumers who reject vehemently any information that does not reinforce their existing belief structure. </p> <p>This cohort feels the whole media-political superstructure is lying to them and manipulating them, and countering this belief with exhaustive explanation sometimes only escalates the feelings of rage. More lies.

Journalists see ourselves as honest brokers, professional nit-pickers, pursuing the business of fact-checking and accountability, standing as an institutional check on executive overreach. </p> <p>We work ferociously hard, harder than we have ever worked, and for leisure we go to films like Spotlight and feel good about ourselves and our truth-to-power mission. A great chunk of our audience still respects what we do, bless them. But another chunk sees us quite differently. They view the media as being the tame house pets of a busted political system; part of the jig, which that is now well and truly up. </p> <p>Katharine Viner, the editor in chief of the Guardian, captured these developments wonderfully well in a recent essay about how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth\">technology has disrupted the truth</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now, we are caught in a series of confusing battles between opposing forces: between truth and falsehood, fact and rumour, kindness and cruelty; between the few and the many, the connected and the alienated; between the open platform of the web as its architects envisioned it and the gated enclosures of Facebook and other social networks; between an informed public and a misguided mob.</p> <p>What is common to these struggles\u2014and what makes their resolution an urgent matter\u2014is that they all involve the diminishing status of truth.<strong> </strong>This does not mean that there are no truths. It simply means, as this year has made very clear, that we cannot agree on what those truths are, and when there is no consensus about the truth and no way to achieve it, chaos soon follows.</p> </blockquote> <p>Practising journalism in a post-fact environment is, in a way, more of an existential threat for journalism than technological change. Our whole function in a democracy does rest on an assumption that facts have broad-based currency, that there are shared principles around which societies can coalesce and public interest can be served. To discover that the power of agreed facts is on the wane is, professionally, like losing your moorings. </p> <p>Intuiting the seeming inevitability of the post-fact, post-truth world, is a bit like enduring a head-on collision with the certainty of your own redundancy: what if, structurally, societally, journalism can no longer speak truth to power because no-one cares about us speaking truth to power any more, because no-one trusts us either?</p> <p>For the working journalist (as opposed to the working cypher for an undisclosed agenda, or working propagandist for their employer or their latest political paramour, or the non-working non-caring non-functioning hack), there really is no greater horror, because we know that journalism still matters. We know this, not as some statement of narcissism, as some abstract claim of entitlement, as some crotchety articulation of Paradise Lost, as some undignified foot stamp about our lost influence \u2013 we know it because the working journalist inhabits the same universe that powerful people inhabit.</p> <p>We are not of that universe, but we enjoy privileged sightlines on it, enough to know that lies get told, sometimes monstrous ones, that corruption happens, that self-interest can often trump the greater good and the national interest. We know that the public does needs us to stand vigilant, sometimes as more threat than promise, as a structural check on bad behaviour, not because we deserve that honour, but because we have been conditioned our whole careers to serve the public, and most of us are intent on doing that for as long as someone will fund journalism.</p> <p>I know, for example, that the following statement from Pauline Hanson\u2019s manifesto is a statement unsupported by evidence: \u201cMulticulturalism has failed everywhere. It is negative and divisive, a weight that is drowning our once safe and cohesive society.\u201d I know the proposed prescription for the problem is first, impossible and second, inflammatory, exhibiting the sort of sentiments that have in the grand sweep of history led great powers into destructive conflicts. </p> <p>\u201cOne Nation will abolish multiculturalism and the Racial Discrimination Act and promote assimilation, nationalism, loyalty and pride in being an Australian.\u201d This statement resonates with some people, particularly the losers of globalisation, but if you interrogate it it\u2019s about as meaningful as placing a drive-through order at McDonald\u2019s: could I have the McHappy Meal with a side of jingoism? Could I scapegoat someone else to feel better about myself and my prospects? Could we just send all the foreigners back home?</p> <p>But in order to call out the falsehoods and dissembles and false comforts, we have to be trusted by our audiences, and we have to be self-aware enough to understand that at least some of our audiences now think that most of us are no better than the people we purport to keep honest: that we are all part of the same stinking, creaking, self-referential system that is increasingly cloaked in odium.</p> <p>I\u2019ve reported every federal election since 1996. I\u2019ve never lived through an election cycle where media commentary mattered less than in the 2016 campaign. Neither major-party leader felt any great pressure to subject themselves to rigorous interviews. News Corporation\u2019s Daily Telegraph whipped itself into a frenzy about the evils of Labor day after day, loyally putting down progressivism in all its forms \u2013 and the result of all the histrionics and all the dire predictions of Armageddon from Ray Hadley and his ilk was a positive swing to Labor in the Telegraph heartland in Australia\u2019s most populous state. Take that, Rupert, said the good voters of New South Wales.</p> <p>Part of the declining cultural relevance of the mainstream media is due to forces entirely beyond our control. It\u2019s predominantly technological change, which has allowed consumers to access their own information without the pesky middle-people \u2013 and again, technology, allowing public figures to communicate with voters directly without the media filter. But if we think that\u2019s all it is we are deluding ourselves. We have to look in the mirror. Our intemperate excesses have also discounted our moral value. Our own behaviour has helped fuel a lack of trust, which leads inevitably to an erosion of our core mandate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/the-most-depressing-thing-about-pauline-hansons-view-of-muslims-the-facts-no-longer-matter\">The most troubling thing about Pauline Hanson's view of Muslims? The facts no longer matter | Susan Carland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And when we have discounted our own currency, how then can we help ensure that voters aren\u2019t manipulated by a new mob of charlatans: the nostalgia merchants and the new protectionists, and the xenophobes, and the reflexive nationalists, and the populists who proliferate and prosper in truthiness, and the people who lied to the voters in Britain to help generate the Brexit vote, to faux everymen like such as Donald Trump, who thinks politics is not about service but about publicity and about trolling the world?</p> <p>I don\u2019t see an easy solution to the current impasse. But I suspect the way back is through understanding rather than glib judgment, and through resisting the temptation to style a genuine crisis of civic integrity as an abstract culture war between elites and people too foolish to understand their own interests \u2013 as if that binary, reductionist view of the problem was anything other than a cheap framing device to structure yet another hot take on a complex phenomenon in time for deadline.</p> <p>From a journalist\u2019s perspective it does involve understanding Pauline Hanson and the context sitting behind her resurgence. That doesn\u2019t mean white-washing her manifestly intolerable positions. It doesn\u2019t mean excusing her, or launching apologias, or finding reasons why she\u2019s terribly misunderstood: \u201csome of my best friends are Paulines\u201d.</p> <p>It means looking her directly in the eye. It means comprehending her and the voters she represents. It means acknowledging that there are people who vote for Pauline Hanson because they are afraid of the future for entirely rational reasons, because governments have failed to give them hope for the future, and we need to acknowledge that perhaps part of the reason politicians have been insufficiently attentive to the losers is because journalists \u2013 under pressure, battling shrinking newsrooms, unable to get out into the field \u2013 haven\u2019t done enough to tell their stories.</p> <p><strong>This is an edited extract of an essay that appears in the <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/190003\">spring issue of Meanjin</a>, out 15 September.

  "<p>Spurred on by the Western Bulldogs supporters camping out for semi-final tickets, I\u2019m jumping the queue here and positing an AFL and NRL grand final week prediction: the entertainment, entirely superfluous and inconsequential as it may be, will plumb new depths. Why? Because neither league seems to realise that they\u2019ve abandoned their own winning formula: the worse it is, the better it is.</p> <p>In other words, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZdiaFXW2U8\">Meat Loaf</a> was actually good. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OrSswm-ibA\">Ricky Martin?</a> Very good. A leathery Chris Isaak, pop \u201cstar\u201d Ellie Goulding (there\u2019s still no confirmation she was actually a famous person) and a malfunctioning lip-sync operation? Hmm, almost. Memorably bad at the very least.</p> <p>And that is how you should do it. In lieu of a Super Bowl style mega-budget and A-list pop stars, you take a washed-up pop star who wouldn\u2019t get a headline gig anywhere outside Australia (Leo Sayer, I\u2019m looking at you), you have them do as little preparation as possible, and then you let them blast away like it\u2019s closing time at a karaoke bar. On grand final day the laws of the music entertainment business are inverted: it actually <em>needs</em> to be shambolic and unprofessional. </p> <p>Professionalism is anathema to the spirit of the day, the actual football aside. Nobody remembers competence. We don\u2019t need a \u201ctight\u201d performance from some indie no-hopers. You know why I can tell you that The Temper Trap once played a workmanlike set at half-time of an AFL grand final? Because I went and scanned <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AFL_Grand_Final_pre-match_performances\">this harrowing Wikipedia page</a>, which documents the cavalcade of mediocrity that has passed for entertainment in the mind of whichever person in the league marketing department went to Splendour in the Grass one time. It\u2019s like they\u2019d rather nobody talked about it than have <em>everybody</em> laugh at it.</p> <p>This year\u2019s Temper Trap, bless him, is Vance Joy, one of those cookie-cutter \u201cquirky\u201d singer-songwriters who may have been on a talent show once, or maybe not, I\u2019m not actually sure but geez everything that comes out of his mouth reminds you of the time that you could only get a seat at the third-coolest cafe on the shopping strip; the cafe where, not coincidentally, Vance Joy\u2019s music was being played. But gun to your head, you couldn\u2019t hum one of his songs. If you managed it you\u2019d hate yourself forever.</p> <p>Put it this way, on the AFL website\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-08-31/homegrown-acts-to-headline-grand-final-entertainment\">announcement of Vance Joy\u2019s appearance</a>, he\u2019s holding a ukulele. That\u2019s who he is. A musical fedora. Thankfully they didn\u2019t bother with a picture of his support act, The Living End \u2013 40-year-old men who somehow still look like they\u2019ve on their way to a dress-up party as Joe Strummer\u2019s roadies. The mere sight of them is so tragic that anyone who caught a glimpse would immediately log off, and the AFL know it. They\u2019re not entirely stupid. At least in their case there\u2019s a kind of demographic synergy: if The Living End\u2019s music was an item of food it would be a Four \u2018n Twenty meat pie.</p> <p>The NRL have also had a \u2018mare this season. Last year they straddled the good/bad divide beautifully with Cold Chisel and Jimmy Barnes, who has sounded pretty scratchy for his whole life and can really do no wrong regardless. This year, we now discover, they\u2019ve gone with Keith Urban. </p> <p>Keith Urban.</p> <p>Keith. Urban.</p> <p>At the risk of labouring the point, can anybody in Australia name a single Keith Urban song? Could Nicole Kidman even name one? His greatest ever feat, if we\u2019re being honest, is that he\u2019s been world famous for more than a decade despite having no discernible talent other than above average aptitude for operating a hair straightener. And good on him for that. But you certainly wouldn\u2019t hold it against the bloke if he needed an autocue to remember his own lyrics. He\u2019ll be joined on stage by Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora. Presumably C.C. DeVille had a prior engagement on a cruise ship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/23/the-joy-of-six-afl-grand-final-entertainment\">The Joy of Six: AFL grand final entertainment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But here\u2019s the main thing: regardless of preferences or tastes, people don\u2019t go to sporting events to hear music. Most of us would prefer that the only thing piped through stadium speakers was the odd number plate announcement for whichever poor bastard left his headlights on in the car park. That\u2019s more entertaining than Vance Joy, surely. We don\u2019t need music. We actually don\u2019t need noise at all.<br></p> <p>In the lead-up to a grand final we want to make the noise ourselves, because silence actually serves as a more compelling backdrop than The Living End, or Ed Sheeran, or whatever interminable dross they\u2019re spraying at us this time. Silence makes you nervous. It let\u2019s you know you\u2019re alive among a hundred thousand people, who are all probably thinking the same thing. Given a lead-up of 1) silence and 2) the national anthem (and in the case of the AFL, an obligatory burst of Mike Brady\u2019s Up there Cazaly), both of the grand final crowds this year would be going wild. </p> <p>They won\u2019t, with no offence intended, go wild for Vance Joy or Keith Urban. Vance Joy actually played VFL football a few years back, so I\u2019m sure even he realises what an epic swizz this whole thing is. If it wasn\u2019t him and his tiny guitar taking the stage I\u2019m sure he\u2019d rather listen to Chubby Checker wheezing his way through The Twist or watch Nena butchering 99 Luftballoons than some some part-time barista whose home-recorded single got picked up by Bedwetter FM.</p> <p>And the leagues should listen to our calls: we don\u2019t want fey hipsters or some old mate from X Factor: give us a corpulent rock god or a one-hit wonder. Give us a musical car crash, or give us silence.</p>",

In reality, the<a href=\"http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=78&amp;articleid=1163\"> Rio Declaration</a> is an entirely nonbinding and voluntary agreement which 178 countries entered into at the Rio Earth Summit almost a quarter of a century ago. </p> <p>Its aim was to promote a vision of sustainable development by combatting poverty, disease and overpopulation; fostering conservation, atmospheric protection, pollution controls and biodiversity; and by establishing a greater role in all of this for non-state actors like women\u2019s groups, young people, NGOs and business. </p> <p>It also promoted local participation \u2013 many cities and local authorities around the world have signed up to ICLEI \u2013 also known as <a href=\"http://www.iclei.org/\">Local Governments for Sustainability</a> \u2013 which encourages their participation in implementing Agenda 21 initiatives. </p> <p>It\u2019s not a treaty, does not override national sovereignty and does not allow the UN to dictate what governments do. It has no legal force and is not intended to be implemented in a top-down way. </p> <p>Nevertheless, almost as soon as it was inked, Agenda 21 became the focus of conspiracy thinking, which at first mostly came from the far right. </p> <p>The main thrust of most of those conspiracy theories echoes Roberts\u2019s remarks to the Senate: Agenda 21 is in fact a UN plan to deprive nations of their sovereignty, and individuals of their property rights. </p> <p>On the fringes of the right, a benign agreement encouraging social and environmental stewardship became a disguised attempt to impose global communism on free citizens. </p> <p>Tom DeWeese, an American rightwing activist who heads up the American Policy Center, was one of the earliest critics of the agreement, and has remained consistent in his claim that sustainable development is a <a href=\"http://americanpolicy.org/2010/12/01/the-conservative-blind-spot/\">\u201cutopian, socialist nightmare\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Like Roberts, DeWeese wants his country to pull out of the UN, and also cites the erosion of national sovereignty and property rights as the main dangers posed by Agenda 21, which is voluminously attacked on his website. </p> <p>The<a href=\"http://www.jbs.org/issues-pages/stop-agenda-21\"> John Birch Society</a> \u2013 infamous for its decades-long crusade against imagined communist conspiracies \u2013 also played a key early role in pushing the idea that Agenda 21 was communism in another guise. </p> <p>During the late 1990s, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/1997/05/01/extremists-and-the-anti-environmental-lobby-activities-since-oklahoma-city/#sthash.RjLJRZG1.dpbs\">burgeoning militia movement</a> in the US took the view that Agenda 21 was part of a grand plan to institute one world government \u2013 the plan for sustainable development was the first step on a road that would lead to the UN\u2019s black helicopters landing on the White House lawn to dismantle the Republic. </p> <p>This belief has persisted on the armed, radical right \u2013 the Bundy <a href=\"http://usuncut.com/news/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-oregon-militia-takeover/\">occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge last January</a> was driven in part by the idea that local ranchers were being deprived of grazing rights under the aegis of Agenda 21. </p> <p>In recent years, though, paranoia about Agenda 21 has become mainstream via rightwing media stars and politicians. Probably the most important advocate has been Glenn Beck, who has spruiked the conspiracy theory on television and radio. </p> <p>He even authored a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Agenda-21-Glenn-Beck/dp/1476716692\">dystopian science fiction novel</a> which envisaged an America under the yoke of global, environmentalist government. </p> <p>The blurb provides a neat summary of the fear at the heart of anti-Agenda 21 activism: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just a generation ago, this place was called America. Now, after the worldwide implementation of a UN-led program called Agenda 21, it\u2019s simply known as \u201cthe Republic.\u201d There is no president. No Congress. No Supreme Court.

The collapse of communism was a disaster for the left and, really, they embraced environment as their new religion.</p> </blockquote> <p>Malcolm Roberts couldn\u2019t have said it better. </p> <p>In general, the debate about climate change in Australia has been poisoned by a belief \u2013 shared by the far right and some mainstream conservatives \u2013 that <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/business-spectator/why-is-climate-change-seen-as-a-communist-plot/news-story/cbc7e85e8563154211b09f11386caa65\">climate science is basically a leftist plot</a>. Roberts continues this tradition. </p> <p>Some will dismiss him as a harmless kook, and point out that One Nation are nowhere near the levers of power. But in a finely balanced Senate, in which Roberts\u2019 beliefs are effectively shared with some members of the Liberal party, it\u2019s not a stretch to think that Roberts will be able to act to prolong delays in this country coming up with an effective response to climate change. </p> <p>The danger of the far right, as always, is in their relationships with ostensibly mainstream actors, and the way in which their conspiracy thinking affects policy. </p>",

  "<p>Consumer groups are urging the federal government to change consumer lease laws that allow companies to target vulnerable Australians and can leave them paying up to 15 times more for common household goods and potentially never own them.</p> <p>Consumer leases are a growing concern for community legal centres across the country. They allow people to take possession of goods such as fridges or televisions from companies for what appear to be small weekly or monthly fees.</p> <p>But they often contain hidden clauses that can dramatically increase costs over time and often don\u2019t allow a person to actually own the goods at the end of the lease term. Consumer groups also say they are frequently targeted at vulnerable and low socioeconomic groups and individuals.</p> <p>The former assistant treasurer Josh Frydenberg commissioned a Treasury review that focused on consumer leases and pay day loans.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/ConsultationsandReviews/Consultations/2016/SACC-Final-Report\">The review was released in March 2016</a> and recommended capping consumer leases at 10% of a person\u2019s income, so they could not sign up to an agreement that they were unable to later pay. It also flagged changes that would compel lease providers to disclose the full costs of the lease up front.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/22/pokies-operators-could-face-legal-action-under-australian-consumer-laws\">Pokies operators could face legal action under Australian consumer laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it has remained largely untouched. A spokesman for the minister for revenue and financial services, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, said the government would respond and seek to implement changes before the end of the year.</p> <p>Redfern Legal Centre\u2019s debt and credit solicitor, Will Dwyer, said the Treasury review made positive recommendations that aligned significantly with concerns raised by consumer groups. He said there had been \u201cno movement\u201d from government in response to the review.</p> <p>\u201cIt was provided to government in March this year but really there\u2019s been no effective response yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThese recommendations are pretty common sense for reducing consumer harm and increasing the transparency around these products, so it\u2019s overdue for response.\u201d</p> <p>Dwyer said consumer lease arrangements can seem initially to be quite affordable. But their complexity means that people often \u201cdon\u2019t understand what they\u2019re signing up to and there are misrepresentations made by lease providers about the overall cost of the lease\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cQuite often these arrangements would mean they would be borrowing the goods and would not own them at the end.\u201d</p> <p>Kat Lane, principal solicitor at the Financial Rights Legal Centre, said that consumer leases were a \u201cfundamentally misleading contract\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day the big problem with these leases is just how expensive they are,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most fundamental problem is that people go in thinking they\u2019re buying the goods. But they\u2019re not. There\u2019s a fundamental misleading conduct that just goes on and on and never gets fixed.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day that goes by is another day where someone is ripped off. There\u2019s thousands of them every day. I hate to think how many people are getting in to these contracts that I don\u2019t think are fair.\u201d</p> <p>Gerard Brody, the chief executive officer of the Consumer Law Centre, said he would like to see the government respond to the report \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo many people are having their finances made worse by inappropriate credit products, and the review recognised there was a need to reform consumer leases,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for O\u2019Dwyer said: \u201cThe government will be in a position before the end of the year not only to respond but to look at the implementation of a lot of these recommendations.\u201d</p>",

Fortunately, this happened in an era that afforded me something our current policies now forbid, and that was to re-apply for bail a few days later. </p> <p>I was released from prison to engage in a community diversionary program, one that would allow me to have a real crack at rehabilitation.

In this case, Roberts argues that all the major science organisations around the world have collaborated, manipulating climate data to suppress temperatures in the 30s and 40s, thereby making today\u2019s temperatures look unusual.</p> <p>The weird thing here is that Roberts isn\u2019t even getting the conspiracy theory right. The theory he is thinking of \u2013 which even most climate change deniers now reject \u2013 is not that global temperatures were higher in the 30s and 40s, but that specifically temperatures just in the US were higher than today.</p> <p>Climate scientists used to believe that was the case. Even then, they knew the world as a whole was warming, so the scientific discussion revolved around trying to explain the spatial variation \u2013 why temperatures in the US were different. It was in no way a challenge to the clear observation that global temperatures were rising sharply.</p> <p>The chart below is from a <a href=\"http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_07/\">paper published in 1999</a> discussing this issue and comparing the known global temperature rises with the understanding of US temperatures at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0a9b1cdc4443a531b0e1ac57914249d78a8b72c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0a9b1cdc4443a531b0e1ac57914249d78a8b72c/0_0_725_248/500.jpg\" alt=\"Graphs from a 1999 Nasa paper comparing how scientists then interpreted US temperatures with global temperatures.\" width=\"500\" height=\"171\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graphs from a 1999 Nasa paper comparing how scientists then interpreted US temperatures with global temperatures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The problem was, records going that far back are based on all sorts of measurements that are difficult to compare \u2013 some are taken at different times of day or at different altitudes.

More than 15 years ago, Nasa\u2019s method of doing so resulted in the conclusion that US temperatures were unusually high in the 30s and 40s.</p> <p>Then Nasa expanded the data set it used to include information about ocean temperatures and corrected for the then well-documented <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/terra/news/heat-islands.html\">\u201curban heat island\u201d effect</a>.</p> <p>The changes didn\u2019t alter the trend much but did mean that the hottest year on record in the US became 1998 rather than 1934. As data and understanding improved, further adjustments were made by Nasa in 2011, which revealed more of a warming trend across the US.</p> <p>All the changes <a href=\"http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha02300a.html\">were discussed by Nasa</a> at <a href=\"ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/GHCNM-v3.2.0-FAQ.pdf\">the time</a> but more than a decade later climate deniers picked this up and claimed it was a conspiracy.</p> <p>There is no such thing as meaningful raw data when it comes to historical temperature records \u2013 they must be interpreted. With more data and better understanding, that interpretation will change. And since several different organisations around the world do their own interpretations of the data and agree on the outcome, confidence in their results can be high.</p> <p>In any case, Roberts\u2019 claim that global temperatures were higher in the 30s and 40s is not even a conspiracy theory that is held by anyone.

One book from 1965 \u2013 one of the first works to suggest there was a \u201clittle ice age\u201d \u2013 did suggest some rapid warming towards 1700 in the northern hemisphere as the world emerged from the cold period. But that was based on very limited data and, even in that work, temperatures were not thought to have risen to unusual heights. And newer work based on much more detailed records suggests any cool period at roughly that time was much less pronounced than previously thought.</p> <p>This statement highlights another strategy used by climate deniers.
