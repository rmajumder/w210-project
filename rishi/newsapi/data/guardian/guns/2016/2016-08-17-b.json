  "<p>A new law designed to protect small businesses from unfair contracts could force milk processors to change supply agreements with dairy farmers as the industry comes under intense pressure over the price crisis. </p> <p>The unfair contracts law comes into effect on 12 November and extends consumer protections to small businesses in deals with large businesses. Under the new law, the courts would be able to strike out any unfair contract terms.</p> <p>The deputy chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Michael Schaper, told Guardian Australia that, while the new law did not cover existing contracts such as the Murray Goulburn and Fonterra contracts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/25/barnaby-joyce-announces-dairy-assistance-package-after-cuts-to-milk-price\">that slashed milk prices retrospectively</a>, the reform would cover contracts after November.</p> <p>\u201cThe critical element here is what is fair and what is unfair and there are three limbs to that,\u201d Schaper said. \u201cFirstly, is there a term in the contract that is not really necessary to protect the legitimate commercial interests of the big firm?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/nick-xenophon-calls-for-free-school-milk-scheme-to-help-rescue-dairy-industry\">Murray Goulburn backs milk price transparency plan to help dairy farmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe second one is whether or not it is something that if relied on, causes a loss to the small business. </p> <p>\u201cThe third one is that there is a major imbalance in the rights and responsibilities between the two sides.\u201d</p> <p>The ACCC is currently investigating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/17/dairy-farmers-say-sudden-milk-price-drop-leaves-them-high-and-dry\">milk cooperative Murray Goulburn</a> and the circumstances around its partial float on the stock market, after it paid out high milk prices and then slashed them retrospectively, leaving their farmer members owing hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p> <p>Schaper said it was up to the courts to decide whether a term of the contract was unfair rather than the ACCC. But the law will change business-to-business contracts across the spectrum including financial services, phones, leases, franchises and agriculture.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have been saying [to different industries] is we think these areas are problematic, why don\u2019t you tidy them up before the law comes into play,\u201d Schaper said. <br></p> <p> Under the changes, a judge can strike out unfair terms and allow the rest of the contract to operate.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf the question is, does this apply to the Murray Goulburn farmers, the very short answer is it doesn\u2019t apply to their existing contracts at the moment \u2013 that\u2019s the big one and it\u2019s not retrospective, it\u2019s going forward.\u201d</p> <p>The new law applies to annual contracts worth up to $300,000 or multiyear contracts covering up to $1m. But, importantly, the ACCC says if the price is not specified the contract is deemed to be under the threshold. <br></p> <p>In the case of dairy farmers, average dairy contracts are worth well over $300,000 but supply agreements often do not state a clear price because processors change price over the life of the annual agreements. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the amounts that can be quantified when you enter into the agreement so that it\u2019s an amount you know for certain,\u201d Schaper said.</p> <p>\u201cBut a lot of contracts, you don\u2019t know for certain what [price] is going to be and our interpretation of the law is that if you cannot quantify it absolutely then you have got to treat it as zero.\u201d<br></p> <p>As a result, the law could significantly change the way processors are allowed to deal with dairy farmers. </p> <p>While he could not comment specifically on future Murray Goulburn contracts due to the ACCC\u2019s ongoing investigation, Schaper used the example of a franchise agreement, where a business pays a fee of $100,000 upfront plus 10% of their earnings every year. In that case, the 10% earnings would not be counted in the threshold because it is not quantified. </p> <p>\u201cWe are generously interpreting it in a way to try to give coverage to as many small businesses as we can and [the Australian Securities and Investments Commission] has taken a similar tone because incidentally, Asic look after financial services under this arrangement. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/one-concessional-loan-coalition-dairy-rescue-package-approved-murray-gouburn\">Only one concessional loan from Coalition's dairy rescue plan approved</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe may get knocked out of the court on that one but, for the time being, that is the advice we have been given and no one has kicked back to us to say we think you are barking up the wrong tree.</p> <p>\u201cWe are reasonably confident in what we\u2019ve got and where we are going with it.\u201d</p> <p>David Basham, a dairy farmer and the acting chair of the peak industry body Australian Dairy Farmers, said in anticipation of the unfair contract laws, processors would have to scrutinise the supply agreements to make sure they are fair.</p> <p>He said the unfair contract law could also overturn the long held practice in which most large processors insist that dairy farmers supply them exclusively \u2013 unlike other commodities where growers are free to sell to any buyer.</p> <p>\u201c[Under the unfair contract changes] it could be a restriction of trade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen dilemmas with new processors coming in. People want to supply some milk but cannot risk changing over completely making it harder for new players.\u201d</p> <p>Schaper said the ACCC would be finalising the Murray Goulburn investigation in the next few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cEvery industry works differently, you don\u2019t want to come in with a heavy hand and destroy what works in an industry but at the same time people need to know what they are getting committed to,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>The last dark day for USA basketball came 12 years ago in an Athens arena. That was when Argentina beat them in an Olympic semi-final that marked a massive restructuring for the American national team, and a vow to never return the shock defeat. And for the next two Olympics the US dominated just as the US should. But then came the last week and three near losses to Australia, Serbia and France.</p> <p>But Wednesday would not be another 27 August 2004. The US played played a stifling defense against Argentina, on the way to a 105-78 Olympic quarter-final victory. It was a performance as dominating as those the US had in early wins over China and Venezuela. Kevin Durant scored 27 points and Paul George 17.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/17/olympic-mens-basketball-usa-v-argentina-live\">Olympic men's basketball: USA 105-78 Argentina \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet the dominance was not obvious early. For the Americans, who have struggled to play cohesively in these Olympics, the last thing they needed was to walk into an Argentina home game. But that\u2019s essentially what they did on Wednesday night. The fans at their other games had generally been polite and mostly supportive. But Argentina is a neighbor of Brazil and their fans lined up outside the Carioca Arena 1 clutching banners and chanting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.gdnmobilelab.com/olympics-embed/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" autoplay=false></iframe> </figure>  <p>A group of supporters stood on a balcony outside the stadium holding a giant sign with hand-drawn pictures of the team\u2019s stars on the front. Below them, a joyous group of Argentinians clad in blue and white jerseys sang and screamed and chanted. The singing continued as they moved into the arena\u2019s concourses. They sang before their national anthem, they sang during their national anthem and they sang after their national anthem. They sang almost through the whole first quarter as 25-year-old guard Facundo Campazzo, who plays for Real Madrid, sliced through the American defense throwing up gentle one-handed shots that fell in the rim.</p> <p>Behind his shooting and dazzling behind-the-back passes Argentina built up a 19-9 lead on the befuddled American players. The Argentina fans went berserk.</p> <p>Then the fun stopped. The American machine surged forward. Campazzo\u2019s shifting, dancing moves suddenly didn\u2019t dazzle quite as much as before. The shots that fell in so easily during the early parts of the game clanked off the rim. The US defense, which had been missing their last several games, suddenly reappeared. With Argentina\u2019s guards unable to break down the US inside they passed the ball to their outside shooters, who couldn\u2019t hit their long jumpers. These misses were turned into rebounds, which were tuned into fast breaks.</p> <p>Quickly, Argentina\u2019s lead disappeared in a blizzard of layups and dunks. By the end of the first quarter the US had gone up 25-21 and Argentina were in trouble. The start of the second quarter was much of the same. The US defense shut down Argentina\u2019s guards and then turned mistakes and missed shots into easy baskets. For the first time in more than a week the American players looked confident, even flashy. Durant hit several open jump shots but he also took the ball into the lane, playing more aggressively than he had in earlier games. At one point he faked to one side and cut to the other before thundering to the rim.</p> <p>Late in the half the US had gone on a 29-9 run to lead 54-29 and the game was essentially over. And yet the singing went on and on and on. As the US played out the last minutes of a blowout, Argentina\u2019s fans sang and danced, bouncing up and down in the aisles. They sang for almost the entire fourth quarter as the US finished a blowout of their beloved team and maybe found their form in this tournament.</p>",

This is a US team that\u2019s clearly more talented than their opponents, but they\u2019re not invulnerable. If they don\u2019t play better in the upcoming elimination games, it wouldn\u2019t even be a huge upset if they get knocked out at some point. In back to back games, the US have been able to survive partly because time ran out on their opponent\u2019s comeback attempt. It\u2019s probably particularly troubling that France was able to pressure them all game without Tony Parker playing a single second.</p> <p>Maybe this is a tad too gloomy. With the win, the US has secured the top seed in the group and one has to think that they\u2019ll raise their game once the real tournament play begins.

The current and growing controversy over mayors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/corsica-mayor-bans-burkini-violence-beach-protests-sisco-france\">banning burkinis</a> on beaches has proved one of the most divisive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/corsica-mayor-bans-burkini-violence-beach-protests-sisco-france\">Corsican mayor bans burkini after violence at beach and protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Socialist prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/25/manuel-valls-french-pm-hard-line-against-terror\">Manuel Valls</a>, broke his silence on Wednesday to say he understood and supported the handful of seaside town mayors who have banned burkinis, or full-body swimsuits. </p> <p>He said wearing a burkini was \u201cnot compatible with the values of the French Republic,\u201d but refused to pass a nationwide law banning it. He hinted at the importance of not \u201cplaying politics\u201d with such issues, but his support for the mayors was greeted with joy by the right and sparked criticism from some in his Socialist party.</p> <p>\u201cIn the face of provocation, the nation must defend itself,\u201d Valls told La Provence newspaper. </p> <p>With presidential and parliamentary elections due next year, politicians are acutely aware of the tension and fear running high in France following the death of more than 230 people in terrorist attacks in the past 19 months. </p> <p>Last month in Nice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bastille-day-truck-attack\">85 people were killed</a> when a Tunisian delivery driver drove at crowds watching Bastille Day fireworks. Less than two weeks later, two attackers who proclaimed allegiance to Islamic State <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/men-hostages-french-church-police-normandy-saint-etienne-du-rouvray\">killed a priest in his church in Normandy</a>. July\u2019s attacks have led the right to push its political agenda firmly on to issues of terrorism, security and the place of Islam in French society.</p> <p>The day after the Normandy church attack, the mayor of the French Riviera town of Cannes, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\"> Sarkozy</a>\u2019s rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains party, decided to ban burkinis from public beaches in the name of public order and French secularism. Thierry Migoule, the head of municipal services for the town, told Agence France-Presse the ban was on \u201costentatious clothing which refers to an allegiance to terrorist movements which are at war with us\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"video explainer: why ban burkinis?\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F551124101742024&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Cannes burkini ban only became public in recent days and immediately a handful of other seaside towns across the country followed suit. Since the Cannes beach ban came into force, police have stopped 10 women in burkinis. Six left the beach, and four were fined \u20ac38 (\u00a333).</p> <p>Burkinis are not a common sight on French beaches, just as niqabs were extremely rare in France when Sarkozy banned them in 2011. In the upmarket northern resort of Le Touquet, the local rightwing mayor and MP, Daniel Fasquelle, a close ally of Sarkozy\u2019s, is to implement a burkini ban in the coming days \u201cto fight against religious proselytising\u201d. He told AFP: \u201cThere are no burkinis in Le Touquet at the moment, but I don\u2019t want the town hall to be caught off guard if we are affected by this phenomenon.\u201d</p> <p>At the heart of the burkini row is the French principle of secularism, or <em>la\u00efcit\u00e9</em>, and whether it is being twisted for political gain. The French republic is built on a strict separation of church and state, and <em>la\u00efcit\u00e9</em> is intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. In theory, the state is neutral in terms of religion and allows everyone the freedom to practise their faith as long as there is no threat to public order.</p> <p>Since the terrorist attack on the satirical magazine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/charlie-hebdo-attack\">Charlie Hebdo</a> last year, however, some French academics and historians have warned that politicians are deliberately distorting the principle of <em>la\u00efcit\u00e9 </em>and using it to stigmatise Islam.</p> <p>Jean Baub\u00e9rot, a historian and sociologist of French secularism, told <a href=\"https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/le-journal-de-13h\">France Inter</a> radio the burkini bans seemed \u201cextremely irrational\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a counter-productive measure to bother these women who have nothing to do with the terrorists and to give the impression of stigmatising a whole group of people who are also under threat from terrorism, because there were women wearing headscarves who were also killed in the attack on Nice.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said Valls was playing with fire by supporting the hard right\u2019s exaggerated interpretation of secularism that pushed French identity in an authoritarian way, rather than viewing it simply as the separation of church and state, and the equality for all beliefs in a neutral state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/five-reasons-wear-burkini-annoy-french-cannes-mayor-muslim\">Five reasons to wear a burkini \u2013 and not just to annoy the French | Remona Aly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beno\u00eet Hamon, the former Socialist minister who quit President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government in 2014, accusing it of betraying leftwing policy, criticised the burkini bans as he announced his decision to run in the left\u2019s primary race for a presidential candidate. He said: \u201cIslam must be treated like a religion like any other\u201d and attacked \u201cinopportune declarations by politicians who want to make political capital on the question of Islam\u201d.</p> <p>The question remains as to whether the decrees banning burkinis, which mayors can issue for only a limited period, conform with French law. France has some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/22/frances-headscarf-war-attack-on-freedom\">toughest legislation on headscarves</a> in Europe, including a ban on niqabs on the basis that they hide a person\u2019s identity. Wearing a burkini, which covers the hair and body for swimming while leaving the face uncovered, does not contravene French law and remains legal.</p> <p>The Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) has filed a complaint against the bans with France\u2019s highest administrative court, the Conseil d\u2019Etat, which is expected to rule in the coming days. </p> <p>Marwan Muhammad, a CCIF spokesman, said the bans restricted fundamental liberties and discriminated against Muslim women. \u201cThis summer we are witnessing a hysterical political Islamophobia that pits citizens against one another,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The burkini row is only the start of what promises to be a tense electoral season focussing on national identity issues and Islam\u2019s place in France. Earlier this year, when Valls called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/13/french-pm-ban-islamic-headscarves-universities-manuel-valls\">a ban on the Muslim headscarf at universities</a>, Hollande said it would not happen.</p> <p>Sarkozy, who will launch his bid to become the right\u2019s presidential candidate next week, has proposed banning the headscarf at universities and in private companies.

Public service workers must by law be impartial and must not show their religious belief with an outward symbol such as a headscarf, cross or turban. This applies in hospitals, post offices and town halls. Nurses who wear the hijab have to take it off on arriving at work. </p> <p>In 2004 all religious symbols in state schools were banned. In 2011, the niqab, or face veil, was outlawed in all public spaces by President Sarkozy, as part of a move against anyone covering their face in public. Women in niqabs are banned from any public space including streets, buses, shops and collecting children from school.</p> <p>In 2012, Sarkozy\u2019s education minister issued a memo recommending schools uphold the \u201cneutrality of public service\u201d on school trips, meaning mothers in hijabs should remove them if helping on an outing. Schools were left to decide. Some barred mothers in headscarves, others didn\u2019t. In 2014 Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the Socialist education minister, said mothers in headscarves should be allowed on trips, but the memo has not been annulled.<strong> </strong></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",
  "<p>The crisis of soaring numbers of people living on the streets or at risk of losing their homes should be tackled with an all-out attack by the government on homelessness, an all-party committee of MPs has said.</p> <p>It calls on ministers to back proposed changes to the law to force councils to provide proper support for all people in danger of homelessness, and says that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/10/low-income-families-private-housing-rent-benefit-freeze\">welfare cuts</a> and affordable housing shortages will exacerbate England\u2019s housing crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe scale of homelessness is now such that a renewed government strategy is a must.

In one case, a person was told by officials to go away and Google a solution to her homelessness.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s report says: \u201cWe understand the the financial pressures they [councils] are under and the difficult choices they have to make. But treating someone as a human does not cost money.</p> <p>\u201cWe have received too much evidence of councils and their staff treating homeless people in ways that are dismissive and at times discriminatory. This is unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The committee calls on ministers to support <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/homelessnessreduction.html\">a private member\u2019s bill</a> introduced by Tory MP Bob Blackman, which would require councils to provide practical help to anyone who is homeless or at risk of losing their home, regardless of whether they are deemed to be in priority need.</p> <p>Earlier this year the former chancellor George Osborne declared homelessness to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/15/chancellor-osborne-100m-budget-homelessness\">unacceptable in our day and age</a>\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/16/homeless-crisis-budget-charities\">earmarked \u00a3115m in the budget</a> to tackle rough sleeping. But while ministers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/10/homelessness-crisis-ministers-prevention-duty-councils\">hinted they may consider legal changes</a> to tackle the issue, no formal proposals have been forthcoming, and it is unclear whether they will support Blackman\u2019s homelessness reduction bill.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s report emerges against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/09/britain-rough-sleepers-homelessness-housing-crisis\">rising homelessness</a> over the past five years, and increasing concern over housing benefit freezes and affordable housing shortages, coupled with rising rents and insecure private sector tenancies. Homeless acceptances have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/23/rise-in-homelessness-in-england-triggers-calls-to-follow-welsh-strategy?CMP=share_btn_tw\">increased by 33% since 2010</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503015/Rough_Sleeping_Autumn_2015_statistical_release.pdf\">rough sleeping numbers have doubled</a> over the same period.</p> <p>The single biggest cause of homelessness is the ending of an assured shorthold tenancy, which accounted for a third of all homelessness acceptances in 2015 up from 13% in 2005, highlighting the insecurity experienced by many tenants in the private rented sector. </p> <p>Separately, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/17/we-call-on-labour-to-pledge-to-end-homelessness\">letter published in the Guardian</a> from over 200 Labour MPs and activists calls on the party to pledge to end homelessness in its next manifesto, including a commitment to build more social housing. </p> <p>It says: \u201cRadical, socialist solutions are needed urgently to address homelessness and all of the ugly manifestations of grotesque inequality in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Under current English law, last changed in 2002, a full duty of homelessness is in effect reserved for those deemed to be in priority need, which in practice means that families with young children and pregnant mothers are most likely to be rehoused. This means most single people and a number of vulnerable groups, including rough sleepers, are left to fend for themselves.</p> <p>The problem was highlighted by the homeless charity Crisis, which in 2014 carried out a <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/publications/MysteryShopping_Report_FINAL_web.pdf\">\u201cmystery shopper\u201d exercise</a> in 16 councils. It found a third of single homeless people were turned away, some of whom had presented as victims of domestic violence.</p> <p>Blackman\u2019s bill, which, unusually, is sponsored by all MPs on the communities and local government select committee, is based on the recommendations of an <a href=\"http://www.mungos.org/homelessness/publications/latest_publications_and_research/2544_the-homelessness-legislation-an-independent-review-of-the-legal-duties-owed-to-homeless-people\">expert panel</a> convened by Crisis. This was in turn inspired by <a href=\"http://gov.wales/topics/housing-and-regeneration/services-and-support/homelessness/new-homelessness-legislation/?lang=en\">a law introduced in Wales</a> in 2015 which requires councils to act to prevent families losing their homes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/welsh-law-early-support-prevents-homelessness-crisis\">Early findings</a> show a significant reduction in the number of Welsh households officially classified as homeless, suggesting prevention work was helping to keep more families in their homes.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cStatutory homelessness remains less than half the 2003-04 peak; however, one person without a home is one too many. The government is investing more than \u00a3500m to prevent and tackle homelessness and continues to spend around \u00a390bn a year on working-age benefits to help the most vulnerable.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cThe report recognises the causes of homelessness are varied and complex, so across government we are considering how to improve services, including around mental health and addiction support.\u201d </p> <p>The chief executive of Crisis, Jon Sparkes, said: \u201cHomelessness is one of the great social injustices of our time, and there is now a clear cross-party consensus that if we\u2019re to put an end to it once and for all then we need a change in the law so that all homeless people can get the help they need.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Sinclair, the chief executive of St Mungo\u2019s charity, said: \u201cThe committee\u2019s report comes at a crucial moment for homelessness policy. Rough sleeping is rising dramatically and we agree with the committee that there is an urgent need for a new cross government strategy to stop the scandal of people being left stuck on our streets.\u201d </p> <p>Campbell Robb, the chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cToday\u2019s report is a welcome recognition of the steep rise in homelessness, and the urgent need for a new government strategy to tackle this crisis.\u201d </p> <p>Nick Forbes, senior vice chair at the Local Government Association, said: \u201cThe extension of legal duties on councils, as supported by the committee, would need to be accompanied by sufficient powers and funding from the government, as part of a coherent national strategy. Without this, councils will continue to find it difficult to deliver on our ambitions to end homelessness.\u201d </p> <ul> </ul>",

Data review \u2013 impact of detention on the welfare of children in Nauru RPC</strong><br></p> <p>SCA has undertaken a review of all the data that we hold in relation to the welfare of children in the Nauru RPC. The data review is a rigorous analysis of all of the incident reports and casework reviews which SCA has on record in relation to the 281 children who have been held in Nauru. It provides an evidence based case study to inform discussions about the impact that detention has on the welfare of children. A copy of the data review is attached for discussion at the meeting. We are obviously treating this material with the utmost confidentiality.<br></p> <p><strong>2. Child Safeguarding and Early Childhood Services on Nauru</strong><br></p> <p>Irrespective of the outcome of the current tender process, i would like to discuss with you opportunities for SCA to provide a broader suite of development programs on Nauru for asylum seekers, refugees and the Nauruan community. Such programs would respond to the significant unmet need that exists in Nauru in areas like child safeguarding and early childhood education.<br></p> <p><strong>3. Regional Engagement</strong><br></p> <p>We are keen to discuss the Government\u2019s current thinking on a regional solution, including building capacity in transit countries for timely refugee status determination, investment in improving access to basic services, and genuine cooperation across the region to share resettlement of UNHCR identified refugees.<br></p> <p>I would also like to take this opportunity to note how much we appreciate the dialogue with your office in relation to a range of matters, including asylum seeker welfare and family reunion issues.<br></p> <p>I look forward to meeting with you next week.<br></p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br></p> <p>Paul Ronalds<br>Chief Executive Officer<br></p> <h2>Dutton to Save the Children</h2> <p>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION<br></p> <p>Ref No: MC15-219710<br></p> <p>Mr Paul Ronalds<br>Chief Executive Officer<br>Save the Children Australia</p> <p>Dear Mr Ronalds</p> <p>Thank you for your letter of 7 August 2015 concerning the welfare of children in Nauru, and regional engagement more broadly. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring these matters to my attention and for our recent meeting.<br></p> <p>I acknowledge Save the Children Australia\u2019s (SCA) desire to support the welfare of children and families accommodated at the Nauru Regional Processing Centre (RPC).</p> <p>With respect to the review of data held by SCA in relation to the welfare of children at the Nauru RPC, I reiterate that I take matters of child protection very seriously and the Department of immigration and Border Protection shares this attitude.<br></p> <p>The implementation of recommendations arising from the Moss Review has resulted in improvements to centre security and care for children and vulnerable persons in the Nauru RPC. The Department is working closely with the Government of Nauru to assist with the development and implementation of a child protection framework in Nauru. A Child Protection Panel was also established in May 2015 to identify where management of incidents in detention can be strengthened to better address any allegations of abuse, neglect or exploitation made in relation to a child.<br></p> <p>With regard to any potential opportunities for SCA to provide community development programmes on Nauru, raising these with the GoN is a matter for SCA.</p> <p>I also note that child protection within the Nauruan community, other than that of transferee children in the RPC, is a matter for the GoN.</p> <p>The integration of transferee children into local Nauruan schools is being undertaken in the best interests of the children and in support of their access to formal education opportunities. This includes integrating transferee children into early childhood education programmes conducted by the GoN.</p> <p>With regard to our discussion on regional engagement, note that the Australian<br>Government is committed to combatting people smuggling and trafficking of persons in the region and continues to work with regional partners through the Bali Process to identify engagement and capacity building opportunities. This forum has been very productive in building capacity to manage illegal migration throughout the region.</p> <p>The Governments of Australia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Nauru and Cambodia are committed to addressing people smuggling and illegal migration. Australia\u2019s regional processing and settlement policy has been pivotal in addressing this issue. Australia has also provided valuable capacity building to Nauru, PNG and Cambodia to tackle this issue and will continue this work.</p> <p>Thank you for raising these matters.</p> <p>Yours sincerely</p> <p>PETER DUTTON 16/9/15</p> <h2>Save the Children to Turnbull: the same letter was sent to Dutton and Brandis </h2> <p>Save the Children Australia<br></p> <p>3 May 2016<br></p> <p>The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP<br>Prime Minister<br></p> <p>Dear Prime Minister,<br></p> <p>Save the Children Report on Child Asylum Seekers in Nauru<br></p> <p>As you are aware, Save the Children Australia was appointed by the Australian Government to provide a range of services to asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru during the period August 2013 to October 2015. In the course of providing these services to relevant individuals, our staff gathered data concerning the background and experiences of individual children, adults and families residing in the Regional Processing Centre and developed well-informed impressions in relation to the operation of Australia\u2019s regional processing system in Nauru.</p> <p>Save the Children acknowledges that there are no easy solutions in balancing the need to act compassionately and humanely towards people fleeing persecution, while also developing effective policy responses to the increasing migration and refugee flows in the region. However, the challenges inherent in developing sound policies in this area are significantly compounded by laws and measures which impede transparency in relation to assessing the human cost of Australia\u2019s current approach to asylum seekers who arrive by boat.<br></p> <p>Accordingly, as the primary rights-based organisation working with asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru from 2013 to 2015, we consider it incumbent upon us to reflect and report on areas where the data that our staff collected, and the observations that they made, indicate that the rights of child asylum seekers may have been violated. In that sense, we seek to provide a snapshot (that goes beyond anecdotal reports) of some of the human consequences of Australia\u2019s policies in relation to asylum seekers who arrive by boat, and prompt consideration of whether such costs justify the perceived benefits.</p> <p>Using the evidence gathered through data analysis, staff observations and other credible sources, the enclosed report on \u2018Child Asylum Seekers in Nauru\u2019 identifies significant and numerous child rights violations in this context. Children were, among other things, detained for extraordinary periods of time, disproportionately negatively affected by the experience of detention, frequently exposed to harm, violence and abuse, and were often separated from their parents.<br></p> <p>The contents of this report ultimately support the position that when viewed through the lens of the experience of child asylum seekers, Australia\u2019s unyielding policies in relation to the treatment of asylum seekers who arrive by boat are not appropriate in their current form.<br></p> <p>Recognising existing policy objectives, this report makes a number of core recommendations to the Australian Government which entail ensuring that:<br></p> <ul> <li>child asylum seekers and their families are not transferred to, or forced to remain, in locations whether they are at serious risk of harm;<br></li> <li>the transfer and treatment of child asylum seekers and their families is subject to ongoing independent and transparent human rights monitoring; and<br></li> <li>individuals who have experienced human rights abuses in this context have access to an effective remedy.<br></li> </ul> <p>We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this report and its recommendations with you and your staff. Please contact [REDACTED], Head of Policy and Advocacy, at [REDACTED] if you have any queries or would like to arrange a meeting.

It also notes the recommendations that have been made.</p> <p>As you would be aware, the Australian Government remains committed to the regional processing and settlement arrangements in place in Nauru. The Department continues to work with the Government of Nauru to support the implementation and management of these arrangements. This includes contracting service providers to deliver services to support transferees in the regional processing centre, as well as refugees living in the Nauruan community. The Government of Australia is working closely with the Government of Nauru to build its capacity and ability to manage child protection matters. Significant investment has been made by Australia to improve the Nauruan education and health systems.</p> <p>The Australian Parliament has scrutinised the operations of the Nauru regional processing arrangements on a number of occasions and continues to do so. A number of independent organisations, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the International Committee of the Red Cross, conduct regular monitoring visits. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also recently visited Nauru and will report to the Governments of Nauru and Australia on its findings.</p> <p>Thank you for bringing the concerns of Save the Children to the Minister\u2019s attention.<br></p> <p>Yours sincerely<br></p> <p>Acting Commander<br>Regional Processing and Settlement Branch<br>9 May 2016<br></p>",

  "<p>The US Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein has <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/16/politics/jill-stein-vaccine-gmo-science/\">come under fire</a> for supposedly \u2018anti-science\u2019 statements relating to the risks of vaccines, genetically modified crops and electromagnetic fields from Wi-Fi. She said that there were \u2018real questions\u2019 about the dangers of vaccines, that GM foods have \u2018not been proven safe\u2019 and that \u2018more more research is needed\u2019 on the risks of electromagnetic fields.</p> <p>For many American liberals, who have often feel that <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/science-must-be-seen-to-bridge-the-political-divide-1.12119\">science is on their side</a> in an increasingly polarised political war, her statements seem like a betrayal. While she is hardly endorsing a conspiracy, Stein is a Harvard-trained doctor and she is expected to know that these things are pretty safe.<br></p> <p>As with climate change, it is tempting to claim that the science is certain, the evidence is clear and the debate should move on. Things are rarely so black-and-white. In politics, the facts don\u2019t speak for themselves, so it falls to experts to make sense of the shades of grey. </p> <p>Experts have been having a tough time recently. Among the casualties of the Brexit campaign was the status of experts and their hard-won evidence. Michael Gove\u2019s response to elite institutions\u2019 predictions of economic calamity was that \u2018we\u2019ve had enough of experts\u2019. Much to the frustration of the Remain camp, the Leavers showed little interest in who knows what. For them, it was about <a href=\"http://www.perc.org.uk/project_posts/thoughts-on-the-sociology-of-brexit/\">who was in control</a>. In the US, Donald Trump\u2019s ascendancy has <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/the-truth-about-post-truth-politics/\">led some to conclude</a> that we are now in an era of \u2018post-truth\u2019 politics. (We shouldn\u2019t ignore the irony that many fans of conspiracy theories label themselves \u2018Truthers\u2019). </p> <p>So what should experts do? How can governments make good decisions when any scientific claim is likely to be torn to shreds? </p> <p>Take electromagnetic fields (EMFs). We are surrounded by them. They are invisibly emitted across a range of frequencies by overhead power lines, microwave ovens and mobile phones as well as Wi-Fi routers. Scientists have known for decades that high-frequency EMFs like ultraviolet light can cause cancer. And they also know that powerful, low-frequency EMFs can cause health problems by heating up wet body tissue, which is how microwaves cook food. These well-known mechanisms provide the basis both for the regulation of new technologies and for advice that we should wear sun cream to prevent skin cancer and limit our exposure to X-rays. However, there are also some unknowns, some hints that long-term exposure to low-power EMFs may cause trouble. When these uncertainties are aired in public, scientists and campaigners have in the past been accused of scaremongering. Earlier this year, the Australian broadcaster ABC was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/12/criticism-of-catalyst-misses-the-point-no-journalist-should-be-in-thrall-to-mainstream-opinion\">seen by some as irresponsible</a> for its broadcasting of a clumsy documentary on EMF risk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/16/the-debate-about-mobile-phones-brain-cancer-and-artificial-electrosmog-its-complicated\">called \u2018Wi-Fried\u2019</a>. </p> <p>In 2000, however, scientific uncertainty was seen as sufficiently troubling to justify a new approach to the regulation of mobile phones in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201628\">In a new paper</a>, I revisit the controversy over mobile phone risks and conclude that it provides a useful model for how experts should deal with complex issues. </p> <p>Some readers may remember that, around the turn of millennium, the health scare over mobile phone EMFs was front-page news. More than a decade later, worries have largely abated. A <a href=\"http://www.mobilemastinfo.com/opinion-research/opinion-research.html\">YouGov</a> survey in 2013 measured public concern about mobiles among the population at 9%, down from 27% in 2000. Over the same period, mobile phone ownership went up from 50% of the population to almost 100%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mobilemastinfo.com/opinion-research/opinion-research.html\"><strong>Percentage mentioning handsets/masts as a concern</strong></a> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b66cd4661a3c68aa7c7b4a61370b520c0ad6838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b66cd4661a3c68aa7c7b4a61370b520c0ad6838/0_0_2666_822/1000.png\" alt=\"Base: All GB adults (2,164) P10Q1: What, if any, health-related dangers concern you most nowadays?

P15Q1: And which other health-related dangers are you also seriously concerned about?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The science of mobile phone risks has not advanced substantially. New <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601591/a-connection-between-cell-phones-and-cancer-has-been-found-should-we-be-worried/\">studies </a>continue to raise questions. <a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/late-lessons-2\">Advisory bodies</a> continue to draw attention to troubling epidemiological data, criticising industry bodies for their \u2018inertia\u2019. In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified mobile phone EMFs as a \u2018possible human carcinogen\u2019 (placing them alongside bacon and almost every other enjoyable food). Officially, the jury is still out of the risks of EMFs, and most of us seem to be OK with that.</p> <p>In 1999, an expert committee was established to deal with a rash of headlines about mobile phone dangers. A few people had blamed their brain tumours on their new mobile phones. Some who claimed to be \u2018electrosensitive\u2019 argued that mobile phones were making them dizzy or ill (an extreme version of this is the subject of this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/11/allergic-to-life-snowflake-arizona-video\">brilliant Guardian film</a>). Local communities were becoming more vociferous in their opposition to mobile phone masts that were springing up around them. Licences for third generation mobile phone bandwidth had just been auctioned, giving the Government a \u00a322 billion windfall.</p> <p>The response to public concerns had until this point been to reassure people that all technologies complied with guidelines that were based on the scientific fact of the heating effects of microwaves. As long as phones and phone masts were legal, they were therefore safe. As one regulatory spokesperson put it, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t heat you, then it doesn\u2019t harm you\u201d. End of conversation. Many concerned citizens were not satisfied by this response. They asked why the regulators appeared to be ignoring suggestions of so-called \u2018non-thermal effects. They asked why long-term exposures hadn\u2019t been investigated. They asked whether some groups may be less safe than others.</p> <p>Experts were no longer answering the questions that were being asked of them. The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones was created to fill the credibility gap. It was chaired by Professor Sir William Stewart, who had been the government\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser at the tail end of the Mad Cow Disease (BSE) outbreak. This crisis had shaped Stewart\u2019s response to the mobile phones controversy. He told a parliamentary committee that, after BSE, \u2018Never again will any scientific committee say that there is no risk.\u2019 His group took seriously the uncertainties surrounding mobile phone risks and saw people\u2019s concerns as legitimate ones. He recommended that children should be advised not to use mobile phones, that phones should carry labels with their Specific Absorption Rates (a measure of how much energy is absorbed by body tissue over a certain time) and that mobile phone networks should be more careful with how they place their masts. He demanded that industry and government fund more research to fill gaps in knowledge on things like electrosensitivity. Following the Stewart report in 2000, the UK officially became more uncertain about the risks of EMFs. </p> <p>Expert groups are often relied upon by politicians to tidy up the facts on contentious issues. It rarely works. People don\u2019t like being patronised with easy answers where there are none to find. With mobile phones, a group of experts took a different approach. They instead admitted that there are uncertainties and trusted in citizens\u2019 ability to navigate them. When it comes to climate change, Wi-Fi, GM crops, vaccines and mobile phones, there will always be scientific grey areas. If experts want to regain their credibility, they urgently need to find ways to talk about them.</p> <p><em>This post is based <a href=\"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201628\">on a new paper, \u2018Scientific Advice on the Move</a>\u2019, published as part of a special issue of Palgrave Communications. </em></p>",

make sequenced genomes available to researchers.</p> <p>The process has been helped by the possibility the DNA bank could help members of the stolen generation find their lost families, an option the centre\u2019s deputy director, Prof Emma Kowal, said was still under investigation. </p> <p>The service would be limited by the number of genomes on file, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility for members of the stolen generation to be able to access that database or access a service that can compare their DNA sequences to those sequences that we have in the data bank,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be possible for some people that such a process could reveal blood relatives.\u201d</p> <p>Identifying hereditary markers for diseases such as cancer and providing clinical treatment would be improved by studying Indigenous genomes, Kowal said, likening it to <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/831786\">a 2014 study in Greenland </a>that found some Inuit people carried a gene that increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 50% and made the disease resistant to common treatment methods.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that there could well be situations like that in Australia and we haven\u2019t had a chance to get that information really because the Indigenous genome sequences haven\u2019t been there and Indigenous people have said no,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cIndigenous people should not have to choose between bad science and good clinical care.\u201d</p> <p>Kowal said participants would be given \u201cfull control over their genome\u201d and any research that stemmed from the DNA bank. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of issues of research in medical information and DNA being used to argue for the genetic inferiority of Aboriginal people and then there\u2019s more recent efforts like the human genome diversity project in the 1990s, or the \u2018vampire project\u2019 as it was known to some, where there was worldwide opposition to it from Indigenous peoples,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of that it\u2019s such a cultural, sensitive, and difficult issue for some of the Indigenous community \u2026 so we were driven to create the very best example of Indigenous participation that exists.\u201d</p> <p>That includes a world-first \u201cdynamic consent\u201d model which allows the DNA donor to provide or revoke consent for specific projects even after they have consented to their sequenced genome being held on file, Kowal said.</p> <p>Every application to access the data would be decided upon by the Indigenous governance board, which is chaired by the Indigenous human rights commissioner Mick Gooda.</p> <p>Also on the board is Prof Mick Dodson, who was opposed to the genome projects of the 1990s on the grounds that DNA was <a href=\"https://www.lowitja.org.au/sites/default/files/docs/Genetics%20report%20WEB%202.pdf\">collective cultural property</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

However, besides those owned by Origin, all other fossil fuel generators continued to operate far below their capacity, only offering electricity to the market for a very high cost.</p> <p>In addition, Mountain showed the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) forecasted that low wind and the interconnector maintenance would create high prices, which the generators could have responded to by ramping up supply and making solid profits.</p> <p>\u201cYet, they did not respond to that information by making more of their production available to the market,\u201d Mountain said in the report.</p> <p>\u201cHad this capacity been made available to the market at more reasonable prices, even prices far above production cost, those extreme prices would not have occurred.\u201d</p> <p>Mountain said Snowy Hydro, Engie, AGL and Energy Australia were exploiting their market power to push up prices. He said they weren\u2019t doing anything illegal, but they were taking advantage of a market that wasn\u2019t functioning properly.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a question of social license \u2013and we\u2019re seeing this in many other industries, where people are expected not just by the letter of the law but by the spirit of the law and maybe there\u2019s scope for some of that to find its way into how we think about these things,\u201d said Mountain.</p> <p>Miriam Lyons from GetUp said the market is failing to deliver the competition needed to protect consumers\u2019 interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/adelaide-charges-ahead-with-worlds-largest-virtual-power-plant\">Adelaide charges ahead with world\u2019s largest 'virtual power plant'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis shows that the answer to South Australia\u2019s problems is not more gas, but more competition. Supporting cleaner suppliers of on-demand energy \u2013 like concentrating solar thermal in Port Augusta \u2013 would be far better for consumers, and for the planet.\u201d</p> <p>Mountain conducted a detailed analysis of how much the generators gained by withholding their supply. For the past eight years, wholesale prices in South Australia averaged $64 per megawatt hour. But in the first two weeks of July it averaged $433.</p> <p>On 7 July in particular, there were 16 settlement periods (which happen every 30 minutes), occurring almost back-to-back, where the wholesale price was above $2,000 per megawatt hour.</p> <p>Mountain said it was not conceivable their marginal cost of production could have been more than $300 per megawatt hour.</p> <p>As a result, during that period the generators reaped $46m from the wholesale market. Mountain calculated they would have made only $5m if they had not charged more than $300 per megawatt hour.</p> <p>Mountain said: \u201cThe fact that these generators did not compete to get their plant dispatched when prices were many multiples of their production costs suggest that these generators stood to gain more by withholding capacity from the market or, equivalently, making it available only at extremely high prices, than by competing vigorously to offer their production to the market.\u201d</p> <p>As an example of the concentrated market power in South Australia, Mountain pointed to AGL, which owns the Torrens Island power station. \u201cIt was privatised as a single power station \u2026 It\u2019s capacity is almost equal to the average demand of South Australia,\u201d Mountain said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/01/windfarms-unfairly-blamed-for-south-australias-high-energy-prices\">How the campaign against South Australian windfarms backfired</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week, Dylan McConnell from the Melbourne Energy Institute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/11/electricity-price-spikes-caused-by-energy-companies-gaming-the-system-report-finds\">released another report</a>, which showed this sort of behaviour was occurring in South Australia, but didn\u2019t look at July 2016 so closely.</p> <p>McConnell agreed with Mountain\u2019s analysis and said one simply way of alleviating the concentration of the market was to build more interconnectors with other states.</p> <p>But he said another way was to diversify the sources of renewable energy.</p> <p>\u201cWind is absolutely the dominant renewable energy source in South Australia. And the fact is that when the wind doesn\u2019t blow, you\u2019re creating these conditions that are more susceptible to market power abuses,\u201d McConnell said.</p> <p>He said concentrated solar thermal with storage or battery technology could be one solution. But he said the caveat was this can\u2019t be owned by the owners of the current generators, since that wouldn\u2019t increase competition.<br></p> <p>McConnell questioned whether the grant made by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to AGL to install a lot of batteries in people\u2019s homes, which they would then control, was a smart move for that reason. \u201cIt\u2019s a good project. But it\u2019s increasing their market power where it explicitly shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>There was a moment at the opening of Mike Parr\u2019s career survey exhibition, Foreign Looking<em>,</em> when I began to have grave doubts. </p> <p>The opening night crowd were pressed into one of the NGA\u2019s downstairs galleries that had been stripped of everything except for Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue Poles. We were watching Parr, frocked up in a white gown, having makeup applied by a beauty professional. The doubt suddenly flickered in my mind: is this for real? Is this what we\u2019re really here for? This is <em>absurd</em>.<br></p> <p> Once the makeup session was over, another woman drew blood from Parr\u2019s arm. This went on for some time. A woman in the crowd fainted, and there was a hubbub as NGA guards came in to see if she was OK. A young artist friend standing next to me went off to the bar and helpfully returned with a salt-encrusted Bloody Mary, my third of the evening. People around us started making jokes \u2013 \u201cI hope he gets a cookie when he\u2019s finished\u201d. </p> <p>Then part three began: Parr, somewhat shaky from having so much blood drawn, was led over to the floor in front of Blue Poles. He lay down and then, for the next five minutes, another assistant took a paint brush, dipped it into a bowl of Parr\u2019s blood, and started slashing it over the artist\u2019s dress. </p> <p>It was a Pollock, only in blood, and since the famous American abstract expressionist died in a car crash, there was an irony at play. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"743f29abe06d46d07c58e3d7ab272f7bf64a8017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/743f29abe06d46d07c58e3d7ab272f7bf64a8017/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson Pollock the Female, by Mike Parr (2016)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In the greater scheme of Parr\u2019s performances, this was all fairly laid back\u2019: Mike Parr is splattered in his own blood for his 2016 performance art piece Jackson Pollock the Female</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NGA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the greater scheme of Parr\u2019s performances, this was all fairly laid back; he\u2019s had his lips sewn together on more than one occasion, burnt and punctured his legs, vomited blue dye \u2013 all those masculine performance art clich\u00e9s, but given an urgent and personal meaning in Parr\u2019s oeuvre. </p> <p>Parr began his career as a conceptual artist, and as you enter the exhibition proper there\u2019s a number of early text works including Facts About The Room (1970): one hundred statements about the room you\u2019re standing in, the first among them stating that this is a room with windows. It actually has no windows, so the narrative that unfurls as you read the statements creates a push-pull between what you read and what you\u2019re actually experiencing, an imaginative transaction between the artist and the viewer.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc19b58b44b43a3c0ff5681a7588aa985e82f960\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc19b58b44b43a3c0ff5681a7588aa985e82f960/0_0_933_777/500.jpg\" alt=\"Cathartic Action: Social Gestus No. 5, aka \u2018the armchop\u2019 (1977), by Mike Parr\" width=\"500\" height=\"416\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cathartic Action: Social Gestus No. 5, aka \u2018the armchop\u2019 (1977), by Mike Parr</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Delacour/NGA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The links between language and perception, gesture and meaning have been a central tenet of the artist\u2019s work throughout his career. After more than a decade of producing performances and conceptual works, Parr began his<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>Self Portrait Project in the mid-1980s. These etchings produced using power tools such as angle grinders \u2013 no mean feat given that Parr was born with only one arm \u2013 have become renowned works in their own right within Australian contemporary art. They are an obsessive response to the idea of capturing a representation of the self through drawing, albeit one mediated by a Black and Decker; despite the heavy black lines and lakes of ink, there is a suppleness to them that is remarkable. </p> <p>The weight of Parr\u2019s Self Portrait Project is apparent in the number of attempts he\u2019s made to end it. He has done performances where he\u2019s painted out his prints in red and black paint, documenting the process on video, and earlier this year he set fire to a pile of his prints at Carriageworks, in a gesture that was somehow meant to protest global warming \u2013 how that works I\u2019m not sure. <br></p> <p>Meanwhile, his performances over the decades have oscillated between what appear to be exercises in aesthetics, to bloody political protests \u2013 including variations on the lip-sewing works \u2013 to performances such as those at the opening, where he puts on a dress and does something, like eat an apple.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01d174aee99d581609dad95c737d0882f8d2572b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01d174aee99d581609dad95c737d0882f8d2572b/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Parr stands with The Golden Age (Choking), 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The weight of Parr\u2019s Self Portrait Project is apparent in the number of attempts he\u2019s made to end it.\u2019: Mike Parr stands with The Golden Age (Choking), 2011</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NGA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> As a viewer at the NGA, I was reminded of another Parr performance way back in October 1982, one that I\u2019d seen as part of a group of young art students who\u2019d bussed down to Canberra for ACT 3: a performance art festival that featured Parr, Stelarc and Dale Frank among others. The specifics of that multi-part, multi-site performance are lost to memory but some details remain: part one was secret; part two involved driving out to Lake Burley Griffin and watching Parr on another dark promontory starting a fire; and part three was spectacular. The audience was ushered into a room lined with uniformed school kids sitting in total silence. In the front of the room, a white chair with a blue lightbulb stood out like some weird robot, and in the background, outside and behind glass, was Parr stoking a huge fire. </p> <p>Like at the recent NGA performance, I was confronted by the entirely arbitrary nature of meaning in art \u2013 the random decisions about how one medium is somehow more worthy than another, how one form has more cultural relevance. What did it all mean? I still can\u2019t tell you, but the poetry of the moment has always stayed with me \u2013 and those moments of doubt only last for a second. </p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://nga.gov.au/Parr/Default.cfm\">Mike Parr | Foreign Looking</a> is showing at the NGA, Canberra until 6 November</em></p>",

Bannon also helped set up a spin-off thinktank called the <a href=\"http://www.g-a-i.org/\">Government Accountability Institute</a> that published a book alleging that the Clintons had pulled strings for foreign donors to their foundation.</p> <p>In recent months, it has become the ideological engine house of the Trump train, accused of stoking racial tensions and fueling the mood of nationalism with a slew of stories on subjects such as uncontrolled immigration at the US border and the threat of Islamic extremism.</p> <p>From its small headquarters in Washington DC, this scrappy challenger to the liberal media consensus has served as a rebel base for the assault on Capitol Hill and beyond \u2013 hosting Duck Dynasty stars and UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage on trips to Washington, and continuing Bannon\u2019s close ties to populist champions such as Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Trump\u2019s new campaign chief executive is no stranger to the establishment himself. After four years in the US navy, he went to Harvard Business School and joined Goldman Sachs before setting up a boutique Wall Street advisory firm specialising in media deals.</p> <p>It was one such deal that left him with an unexpectedly lucrative share in the royalties from the hit comedy show Seinfeld. After selling the firm in 1998, he went on to be executive producer of everything from an Anthony Hopkins film to a documentary on Ronald Reagan that led him to be described as the \u201cLeni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/\">According to Bloomberg</a>, the source of that uncomfortable moniker was Andrew Breitbart, a new media revolutionary who helped launch Huffington Post and edited the Drudge Report before branching out with an eponymous website of his own that Bannon largely took over after Breitbart\u2019s death in 2012.</p> <p>But it is the kind of label that sticks fondly in Trump land, which quoted from the same Bloomberg profile in the <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-announces-major-campaign-hires\">statement</a> confirming Bannon\u2019s appointment on Wednesday \u2013 referring to its headline description of him as the \u201cMost Dangerous Political Operative in America\u201d.</p> <p>The impetus for Bannon\u2019s swift ascent of Trump Tower appears to stem, as many things there do, from the candidate\u2019s family. Jared Kushner, the husband of Ivanka Trump who also owns another supportive rightwing media outlet, the New York Observer, is reported to have rushed back to New York this week to convene an emergency meeting to consider how staff changes could reboot his father-in-law\u2019s flagging campaign.</p> <p>Ostensibly, it is plummeting poll numbers that have rattled the Trump inner circle.

  "<p>Anjem Choudary was a gift for our media establishment. Here was a man who seemed to have more journalists on speed dial than he had mainstream Muslims.

Whether it was burning poppies on Armistice Day or declaring allegiance to the latest terrorist iteration, Choudary never failed to deliver. The impact the media had in recruiting gullible followers should not be underestimated.</p> <p>I was told by a friend who challenged Choudary\u2019s supporters in north London that these diehards would gleefully clutch the tabloid papers that carried his latest provocation. Choudary\u2019s notoriety allowed him to reach the impressionable and vulnerable young people who felt alienated from the rest of society. We will never know whether any of these were among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/16/revealed-how-anjem-choudary-inspired-at-least-100-british-jihadis\" title=\"\">100 or more people he and his followers are said to have inspired into terrorism</a>.</p> <p>Now that Choudary is out of the fray, who will be the next bogeyman? In some respects he was already yesterday\u2019s extremist, as young people increasingly look to the internet for their extremist fix. Islamic State relies less on middle-men and more on direct communication through social media.</p> <p>While new measures take hold to limit their appeal in that space, the media must still guard against glamorising these men of violence. Such demagogues should never be given the credibility of being called representatives of the Muslim world. Many of us were shocked, for example, that when Isis came to the public\u2019s attention two years ago, its publicity was done for it by reckless broadcasters falling over themselves to tell us of the latest slick online video.</p> <p>Choudary\u2019s imprisonment is also a reminder of the shoddy state of counter-extremism in Britain. For years&#xa0;successive governments have struggled to define what extremism was&#xa0;and who they were trying to confront. Hasty and ill-thought-through measures have alienated the very Muslims who kicked out extremists such as Choudary from their mosques. But now he has been locked up without any new legislation being required (albeit in a secret trial with the evidence not shared with the wider public).

Those \u2013 including the government \u2013 who argue that \u201cmuscular liberalism\u201d is the way to tackle this are sadly mistaken. Being illiberal while imposing liberalism challenges the very notions of tolerance and respect that our society claims to espouse. In a liberal democracy, we should never restrict speech unless it incites violence or glorifies terror.</p> <p>There has long been collusion between sections of the media, who provide an echo chamber to Choudary, and the ideologues who use him to hold sway over government policy on tackling terrorism. It is time to reject both approaches and instead promote saner voices in government to engage with anyone opposed to the likes of Choudary and his infamous band of fanatics.</p>",

They will apply to banks, trustees, accountants, lawyers, financial advisers and company formation agents such as Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the centre of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a>, an unprecedented leak of 11.5m files from the database of the world\u2019s fourth biggest offshore law firm.</p> <p>The consultation states: \u201cThe vast majority of tax agents, intermediaries and others who provide services in relation to the taxation consequences of commercial arrangements, or who facilitate their implementation, operate within the spirit of tax law and do not enable tax avoidance. But a minority do enable tax avoidance.\u201d</p> <p>An<a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/788/78805.htm\"> investigation by MPs on the public accounts committee</a> in 2013 found that the commissions paid to the promoters of tax avoidance schemes can be up to 20% of the tax saved.</p> <p>The committee, then chaired by Margaret Hodge, suggested following the example of Australia, which requires promoters of avoidance schemes to get a ruling from the tax office before implementing them.</p> <p>It highlighted the abuse of tax breaks for film and video game productions by accountants including Ingenious Media. Earlier this month, HMRC claimed victory in a four-year battle against Ingenious for a scheme that allowed investors in blockbusters including Avatar to claim tax relief.</p> <p>In 2014, HMRC won its eighth tribunal case against the tax consultancy NT Advisors, saying its pursuit of the company had protected \u00a3750m in tax. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/21/chris-moyles-used-car-dealer-tax-avoidance\">radio presenter Chris Moyles</a> was among those penalised. He had been an investor in NT\u2019s Working Wheels scheme, which involved notional trading in secondhand cars.</p> <p>KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms potentially targeted, welcomed the new measures. A spokesman said: \u201cTimes have changed and the debate around tax has changed too. What was seen as acceptable behaviour is no longer regarded as appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Jolyon Maugham QC, a tax barrister, described the proposals as \u201cvery strong medicine indeed\u201d in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham\">Twitter post</a>, saying advisers who seek to profit from avoidance \u201cshould be put at risk\u201d.</p> <p>HMRC says it wins 80% of cases that go to court, and that it has collected more than \u00a32bn from users of tax avoidance schemes under rules introduced by the government in 2014, which mean avoiders must pay tax upfront while their returns are investigated. </p> <p>There was, however, a backlog of 27,000 cases waiting to be heard at HMRC tax tribunals as of last December.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \u201cHMRC is tripling the flow of avoidance cases to the tribunals over the next two years. \u200eThe government has given \u00a37m of additional funding to HMRC, and an additional \u00a370m to the Ministry of Justice to handle the increased flow of cases.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The war in Yemen has been good for British arms manufacturers. In the first year of bombardment, the UK <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences/licence?rating=Military&amp;region=Saudi+Arabia&amp;date_from=2015-04&amp;date_to=2016-03\" title=\"\">licensed \u00a33.3bn of weapons sales</a> to Saudi Arabia, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade. Riyadh is carrying out extensive air strikes to drive back Houthi rebels as leader of the US- and UK-backed coalition supporting president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, and the British government has vowed to support the intervention \u201cin every practical way short of engaging in combat\u201d. British officials are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/british-us-military-in-command-room-saudi-strikes-yemen\" title=\"\">in the command and control centre for the strikes</a> and have access to target lists.</p> <p>The cost to Yemen has been immense. After 16 months of civil war, more than 6,500 people have died, according to the UN; 2.5 million have been displaced; over half the population <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54277#.V7SQy9fd5Rk\" title=\"\">faces severe food insecurity</a>. Save the Children <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/2016-07/yemen-teetering-edge-famine-number-malnourished-babies-and-children-soars\" title=\"\">says one in three under-fives is suffering from acute malnutrition</a>. Damage to infrastructure and economic losses have already amounted to more than $14bn, according to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-damages-idUSKCN10R2B7\" title=\"\">a joint report</a> by the World Bank, United Nations, Islamic Development Bank and European Union, though that figure is likely to be a substantial underestimate since the research concluded earlier this year. The tally of damaged schools and unusable public hospitals is particularly horrifying in a country that was desperately poor even before the outbreak of war, when its per capita GDP stood at just under $1,100.</p> <p>The devastation has not brought a resolution any closer. The government of President Hadi is recognised internationally, yet the Zaydi Shia Houthis \u2013 who have formed a marriage of convenience with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, ousted in the Arab spring \u2013 still hold Sana\u2019a. A spate of bombings since the collapse of a four-month ceasefire earlier this month have killed 10 children at their school and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/saudi-led-air-strike-yemen-hospital-kills-at-least-seven\" title=\"\">hit a hospital</a>, killing 14, as well as striking a food factory. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-arabia.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Houthis have renewed attacks </a>across the border with Saudi Arabia, claiming&#xa0;more lives.</p> <p>Britain bears much responsibility for this suffering \u2013 as does the US, which has overseen $110bn of arms sales to the Saudis under the Obama administration \u2013 and France. UK arms sales rules state that export licences should not be granted if there is a clear risk equipment could be used to break international humanitarian law. The British government says its licensing system is one of the most careful in the world. But on the kindest possible reading, the Saudi forces are incompetent in their attacks and, at worst, they are indifferent to the civilian deaths. In January, a UN panel warned of \u201cwidespread and systematic\u201d attacks on targets such as schools, weddings, mosques and medical facilities, in violation of international law. The Foreign Office has just retreated on assurances that the Ministry of Defence assessments showed the coalition was not targeting civilians and had not breached human rights law. Late on the day that parliament went into recess, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-07-21/HCWS125\" title=\"\">it issued written corrections,</a> saying that the MoD had merely not assessed that the coalition was targeting civilians or breached human rights law.</p> <p>The Campaign Against Arms Trade has now won the right to a judicial review of sales to Saudi Arabia, to be heard by February next year. Many more civilians are likely to die in the meantime. The ongoing conflict poses longer term risks to those outside the country too. The disintegration of Yemen is fertile ground for jihadist groups, in particular al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula and, to a lesser extent, Islamic State.</p> <p>Britain and other arms exporters should suspend sales with immediate effect, halt other forms of support for the bombings and use their influence to revive the peace process. Reaching <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/yemen-stemming-rise-chaos-state\" title=\"\">a workable and durable settlement will be difficult</a>, though some observers had felt that the talks had appeared to be making progress prior to their suspension. Negotiations will need to acknowledge the international dimensions of this conflict. Saudi Arabia fears that the Houthis are proxies for Iran \u2013 though there is little evidence of significant support \u2013 reflecting its deep concerns about Iranian power in the region. Given the complexity of Yemeni society, talks will need to take in the concerns of many of the others involved: notably players such as southern secessionists and tribal leaders, but also representatives of women\u2019s groups and other civil society activists. Finally, reconstruction will require the kind of support that has been lent to the military effort. Britain has profited at the expense of Yemeni civilians. It should now do its utmost to protect them.</p>",
  "<p>A British man was stabbed in the neck and killed in Ayia Napa after he and a friend had a row with two locals over urinating in public, the girlfriend of one of the suspects has told Cyprus police.</p> <p>George Low, a 22-year-old estate agent from Dartford, Kent, died and his friend, Ben Barker, was seriously wounded in a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/14/british-tourist-dies-in-knife-attack-at-cyprus-holiday-resort\"> pre-dawn knife attack on Sunday</a> as they holidayed in the coastal town, famous for its party atmosphere.</p> <p>Low was stabbed in the neck, while Barker was stabbed in the back.</p> <p>According to Cyprus police, a 48-year-old woman who appeared at a local court on Wednesday in connection with the case said her boyfriend had told her that he and a friend had carried out the attack after a row sparked by the tourists urinating in the street. </p> <p>The Greek Cypriot woman also told the court she picked up her boyfriend from the resort shortly after the stabbing and helped him change clothes, then returned to collect his mobile telephone from a spot where he had hidden it.</p> <p>A report by the Cyprus News Agency claimed that the woman, who was not named, and her boyfriend had been living together in her home in Larnaca for a year. The court ordered her into police custody for eight days to give investigators time to prepare a case against her as a potential accessory after the fact.</p> <p>Police spokesperson Andreas Angelides told Associated Press authorities are still searching for the two alleged attackers, who have been identified as Mehmet Akpinar, 22, and Sali Ahmet, 42.</p> <p>Pictures of the men and warrants for their arrest have been issued, and investigators who are treating the case as premeditated murder and attempted murder have appealed to locals to come forward with any information.</p> <p>A third Turkish Cypriot is being sought who may have helped the suspects slip across the border to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in the north of the island, according to the Cyprus News Agency. </p> <p>Cyprus has been divided along ethnic lines since a 1974 Turkish invasion in the wake of a coup aiming at union with Greece. Cypriot authorities have no control over the north and cannot make arrests there.</p> <p>Low\u2019s mother, Helen, 47, said Barker and her son had been due to fly back home on Sunday. Her son had spent two previous seasons in the resort as a club rep and manager, and was last there in June celebrating his birthday.</p> <p>His death had left the entire family \u201cnumb\u201d, she said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re just heartbroken. We cannot believe something like this could happen to our son.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 August 2016 to clarify that the claim of urinating in public was made by the girlfriend of one of the suspects.</p>",
  "<p>If you put Brexit to one side, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\">latest unemployment figures </a>are no surprise.</p> <p>They show that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remained at 4.9% at the end of June, the lowest since 2005, while the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance dropped by 8,600 to 763,600 in July, the first fall since February 2016.</p> <p>These headline figures are a continuation of recent trends and reflect a growing economy.</p> <p>However, economists were surprised by the numbers because they had expected a rise in the claimant count on the back of the result of the EU referendum on 23 June.</p> <p>With hindsight, a Brexit-driven shift in the unemployment numbers was unlikely. While companies such as Unilever, JP Morgan and Airbus warned that voting to leave the EU would make doing business in Britain more difficult, they had little incentive to cut jobs immediately after the referendum.</p> <p>As it stands, Britain is still in the EU and we have little idea about what Brexit will look like. The drop in the value of sterling has actually made doing business in Britain more profitable for companies exporting goods and services from the country.</p> <p>The early evidence suggests consumers are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2016/aug/09/retailers-benefit-as-sunshine-sends-post-brexit-spending-soaring\">more bothered about the warm weather than Brexit</a>, so shops, pubs and other high street businesses do not need to make cutbacks. Retail sales rose by 1.9% year on year in July, the best performance since January according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG, as shoppers splashed out on summer clothing and barbecue food. </p> <p>The impact of Brexit on the economy will not be known for some time. It will be judged by the size of company cutbacks, but also by planned investments and expansion plans that are scrapped. This is why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England has cut forecasts for 2017 and 2018 rather than this year.</a><br></p> <p>So while the unemployment figures show the economy did not go into shock straight after the vote, Brexiters have little reason to celebrate yet.</p> <h2>Is Deliveroo\u2019s model under threat in courier row?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-announces-it-will-not-force-new-contracts-on-workers\">The protests by Deliveroo workers</a> about their pay highlights that the online revolution is still to solve the biggest conundrum facing shops, restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses \u2013 the last mile.</p> <p>The \u201clast mile\u201d is the phrase used in retail and logistics to describe the process of getting a customer\u2019s order to their front door. </p> <p>For online businesses, the last mile is remarkably inefficient compared with the rest of their operation. Even the zaniest technological advances imaginable do not change the fact that a business must find a way to get its product to the customer.</p> <p>The beauty of a shop or restaurant is that this cost is put on the shopper. In a supermarket, for example, the shopper travels to the store, picks the products off the shelf, then goes home. But online food retailers, such as Ocado, have to bear these costs themselves. </p> <p>This is why a string of online businesses, including the mighty Amazon, have struggled to make a profit despite growing sales rapidly. It is also a good reason why the restaurants for which Deliveroo delivers food were not doing it themselves.</p> <p>Deliveroo has to keep costs under control to make its model work, meaning the amount it pays its couriers is key. The company does not publish its financial results so the health of its balance sheet is not clear. </p> <p>William Shu believed he had identified a gap in the market when he founded Deliveroo in 2013. But a mile is a big gap to fill.</p> <h2>TfL\u2019s English language exam proposal for cabbies tests everyone\u2019s patience</h2> <p><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/17/uber-takes-tfl-to-high-court-over-english-written-test\">Transport for London\u2019s attempts to rein in Uber</a> are becoming ugly. TfL is proposing that drivers applying for a private-hire licence who are from countries where English is not the main language will have to present a certificate showing they have a B1 level of English on the Common European Framework. This certificate requires a two-hour exam that costs \u00a3200 to sit.</p> <p>The new requirements are more stringent than those facing bus drivers, train drivers and other public servants. Uber accepts that drivers should be proficient at spoken English, but believes the proposals go too far and that the company and its drivers are being unfairly targeted \u2013 hence the legal action. </p> <p>TfL says it wants to enhance public safety, but it would be wise to reconsider its position. While public safety and reducing the number of cars on London\u2019s roads are laudable targets, fighting against technological developments and protecting the status quo \u2013 which is what this looks like \u2013 are not.</p> <p>Uber has grown rapidly in London and other cities because its users believe it offers value and convenience compared with the alternatives. The company is not going away. It should be considered as part of a solution for London\u2019s traffic problems, rather than a problem. </p> <p>Rivals who have lost market share because of Uber should focus on improving their service, while TfL should focus on more important things than making taxi drivers write essays.</p>",

D\u2019Agostino twisted her leg and Hamblin pulled her up.

Since then, only 17 have been granted, and 16 of those have been to men.

Her position was a surprise, considering Vogel had just won the 1600meter title. But then opportunity knocked \u2026 or rather, it went sprawling. A competitor, Arden McMath, collapsed in front of Vogel, giving the track star an opportunity to scoot past and avoid the ignominy of last place. However, instead of speeding by, Vogel helped McMath up and carried her across the finish line, ensuring McMath finished ahead of her. \u201cAny girl on the track would have done the same for me,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/high-school/track-and-xc/story/_/id/8010251/high-school-runner-carries-fallen-opponent-finish-line\">Vogel said</a>.

And if she didn\u2019t run around the bases then it wouldn\u2019t be a home run\u2014the hit would have been ruled a single. According to softball rules, her teammates couldn\u2019t help her either, or she\u2019d be disqualified.

During his sophomore year at Penn State University, Parker and his roommate Jean Celestin, who shares credit with Parker for The Birth of a Nation\u2019s story, were charged with raping a female student while she was unconscious.

  "<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-southern-train-strike-keep-the-doors-open-for-talks\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (9 August) talks about train guards. But British Rail abolished guards on passenger trains many years ago, and changed the job to conductors. This difference in terminology is not pedantic, it is important. Guards used to share the responsibility for the safety of the train with drivers, and consequently guards had to have route knowledge \u2013 not just knowing about where stations were located, but locations of signals, signalboxes and an extensive knowledge of the rulebook. With the change to conductors the requirement for detailed route and rule knowledge was greatly diminished. The proposed change at the heart of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/talks-break-down-southern-rail-dispute-strike-threat\" title=\"\">current Southern dispute</a> is one more step along this road: from guard to conductor, and now from conductor to customer service agent. In the eyes of railwaymen and women, that this is one further step in diminishing responsibility. But railways are now very safe indeed as far as the technical business of trains and signalling are concerned; perhaps the greatest threat to the safety of a rail passenger is from another passenger, and it thus makes sense to change the conductor\u2019s focus from the train to its passengers.<br><strong>Ian Watson</strong><br><em>Carlisle </em></p> <p>\u2022 Coming back from West Dulwich to Victoria on 20 June, on a Southern train, I fell while getting on the 20.21 pm train by the door nearest the front of the train, and my legs went down the gap between the train and the platform edge. Luckily I didn\u2019t go down any further but ended up sitting on the edge of the platform. The driver did not know I had fallen and shut the train doors and his own door, getting ready to depart. One of my bags was on the train and the other went onto the track. I yelled for someone to stop the driver from driving the train away and luckily a passenger who was leaving the train did.</p> <p>I was responsible for falling, I was tired and misjudged the wide gap between the train and the platform edge, about which there were plenty of warnings. The issue for me is that the driver did not see I had fallen and had I been unable to pull my legs up, or gone down on to the track and he\u2019d driven away, I would have lost my legs or been killed. Once he knew what had happened he was extremely helpful, making arrangements for someone to get my bag back and checking I was alright. There were no staff at the station, either in the ticket office or on the platform, and nor was there a guard on the train, leaving the driver solely responsible for safety. I emailed Southern, telling them what had happened to me, asking them whether they thought their safety procedures are adequate around passengers falling while getting on and off trains, because in this incident I didn\u2019t think they were.</p> <p>They said: \u201cThe rules and regulations governing the dispatching of trains from stations have progressively changed over the years. This has mainly come about as a result of changes in train design and technological advancement, but also in response to more stringent regulations \u2026 and we have extensively reviewed our dispatch arrangements in order to comply with these requirements. When a platform is manned at a station, platform staff and the train driver carry out the train dispatch procedure. If a platform is unmanned, it\u2019s the responsibility of the train driver to carry out the procedure by using monitors and mirrors to check that the edge of the platform is clear before pulling away. In each instance, however, the train doors should never be closed and depart until the driver is sure that it\u2019s safe to do so. At no time should passenger safety be compromised.\u201d This is not a satisfactory reply!<br><strong>Christine Stammers</strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>",

It was around this time that the producer and songwriter Mike Batt \u2013 who masterminded the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/04/mike-batt-wombles-hunting-snark\">musical career of the Wombles </a>\u2013 was on the hunt for \u201can Eva-Cassidy-type singer\u201d capable of performing jazz standards and his own easy-listening compositions.

Though I think the size of the universe has changed since, it\u2019s now believed to be closer to 14 billion light years isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> <p>So what prompted her to return to Georgia, and to make a Christmas record in particular? \u201cI love winter,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful time, but also a melancholic time, a reflective time, and I\u2019d come to a point in my life where I felt I had to make certain decisions about my career. I turned 30, I got married [to former World Superbike Champion James Toseland]. But really it was hearing the Gori Women\u2019s Choir. I mean, I think I have an OK voice. But compared to these women \u2026 it\u2019s like I\u2019ve spent the last six months learning to sing again.\u201d </p> <p>It is also the first record Melua has made as a completely free agent, since her contract with Mike Batt\u2019s Dramatico label had expired. \u201cIt was a six-album deal,\u201d she explains, \u201cso when the sixth one was done, you know \u2013 it was finished and it was time for us to part ways.\u201d So was separating from her mentor a mutual decision? \u201cIt was maybe a bit more mutual on one side than the other,\u201d she says hesitantly. \u201cYeah \u2013 it wasn\u2019t easy, as you can imagine. And I\u2019m still incredibly proud of the work we did together. But it had to happen and I think it has been mutual \u2026 um, eventually.\u201d</p> <p>Melua\u2019s control over her career is now so complete that, once the session has finished, she has to assist the sound engineer in packing away the recording equipment. Back at the small house she has been renting, Melua reflects on the extent to which her life has changed. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ever since I left school I\u2019ve been so protected.

When the guards found them they started shooting around them in a circle of bullets.\u201d The guards kept firing so that they were unable to move for some time. \u201cGranddad lost only his thumb because he was in the middle of the group \u2013 those on the outside froze to death.\u201d</p> <p>She says that she wanted to pay tribute to him by recording Rachmaninov\u2019s a cappella choral composition, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?autoplay=1&amp;v=EzeifvBH_cshttps://m.youtube.com/watch?autoplay=1&amp;v=EzeifvBH_cs\">All-Night Vigil</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s the piece that most vividly makes me think of the landscape of Siberia,\u201d she says. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not the kind of music people expect me to sing, but working with the choir has given me the confidence to do it.

  "<p>More than a million workers from eastern Europe are working in Britain following a rise in the number of foreign nationals entering the labour market before the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The total number of EU workers employed in the UK increased by almost 90,000 in the three months to the end of June, pushing the overall employment rate to another record high in statistics, which were published on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/reality-check-are-eu-migrants-really-taking-british-jobs\">Part of the rise in employment was attributed to non-UK EU nationals</a>, and especially those from eastern Europe. The number of migrant workers from Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia topped 1 million for the first time. Migrant workers from these eastern European countries reached a record 1,007,000 in the second quarter of the year, up 44,000 on the previous quarter.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The number of workers from outside the UK increased by 110,000 to 3.45 million in the second quarter, compared with a rise of 58,000 in the number of UK nationals in work to 28.2 million.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/20/len-mccluskey-unite-eu-referendum-migration-experiment-uk-workers-expense\">Britain\u2019s attraction as a destination for EU workers</a> is expected to wane over the next year as the impact of the falling pound, a weaker economy and a degree of negativity about migration from some quarters act as a deterrent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-17T15:49:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Employment levels by nationality\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-17T15:49:41/embed.html\">Employment levels by nationality</a> </figure>  <p>Jonathan Portes, an economist of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, said <a href=\"http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/brexit-migration-and-labour-market#.V7SJODaU2Uk\">all three factors would lead to a sharp fall in numbers</a> and meant recent figures represented a \u201chigh watermark\u201d.</p> <p>John Philpott, the director of JobsEconomist.com, said: \u201cThere will be some migrants who think twice about coming to the UK because it could be more difficult to settle and they might feel they are more vulnerable to abuse.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/august2016\">The Office for National Statistics</a> figures also indicated that the jobs market had not been dented in the immediate aftermath of the vote. The ONS said the claimant count \u2013 the number of people claiming jobless benefits \u2013 fell by 8,600 to 763,600 in July, compared with expectations of a rise of 9,500, to leave the total number on job related benefits at 763,600.<br></p> <p>It was the first monthly fall since February 2016 and appeared to dispel fears that the Brexit vote would trigger panic among employers and widespread job losses.</p> <p>Economists welcomed the jobs report, which showed that there were 31.75 million people in work in the second quarter of the year, 172,000 more than for January to March 2016 and 606,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate, which measures the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who are in work, was 74.5%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971.</p> <p>The unemployment rate in the three months to the end of June was unchanged at 4.9%. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 2.3% over the same period, up from 2.2%.<br></p> <p>The number of people unemployed, defined as those not in work but seeking and available for employment, was 1.64 million for the three-month period, the lowest since March to May 2008. </p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said concerns about the economic impact of the Brexit vote were not supported by the data, at least in the short term.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cAhead of the referendum, speculation was that the economy would grind to a halt, hiring would stall and investment plans would be put on ice. The first two haven\u2019t happened; we will find out next week whether the third came good.</p> <p>\u201cBut this does provide a glimmer of hope that if fears of the pre-Brexit jitters proved unfounded, maybe the post-referendum doom and gloom may equally prove to have been overcooked.\u201d</p> <p>Recent surveys have shown that while many companies have shelved investment plans and industries such as construction have suffered a sudden loss of confidence, employers are reluctant to cut staff for what may prove to be a short lived period of uncertainty.<br></p> <p>A report by the Treasury collating the predictions to 2020 of independent economic forecasters found a consensus that economic growth would remain muted between now and the end of the decade. Predictions that growth will remain below 2% also meant unemployment would rise by about 350,000 to approximately 2 million people.</p> <p>Wages growth was likely to remain subdued, especially after being adjusted for inflation, which has begun to rise.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank, said that with inflation up from below zero last year to 0.6% last month and expected to climb more steeply in the coming months, \u201cBritain\u2019s poor performance on pay is a major cause for concern\u201d.</p> <p>Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe vote to leave the EU should cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether, resulting in the unemployment rate drifting up over the coming quarters. This should contain any further rises in earnings growth and keep domestic cost pressures in check.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added that the Bank of England should be able to follow through with more monetary easing to support the economy, such as interest rates and a multibillion-pound bond-buying programme, without worrying about stoking domestically generated inflation too much.</p>",

He said it was not appropriate to respond to allegations until the end of the police inquiry.</p> <p>The solicitor said: \u201cHowever, the allegations made against Mr Clarke in the Clifford Chance report are wholly untrue and unsubstantiated. Many are based on totally fabricated media reports. All these allegations are vehemently denied.\u201d </p> <p>Johnson\u2019s parents also declined to be interviewed by Clifford Chance. Their solicitors told the firm their clients \u201cwould neither support nor participate in the investigation because they had concluded that it did not appear to be independent or transparent\u201d. </p> <p>The inquiry found flaws in the party\u2019s complaints procedure, including the lack of a mechanism to make a complaint to CCHQ. No confidential telephone line or email address existed to which complaints might be directed, and no log was made of complaints. </p> <p>Clarke\u2019s candidate file from when he stood as a candidate for Tooting in the 2010 general election did not include allegations of bullying or harassment of young activists, but did include reports of aggressive and bullying conduct towards his campaign director, the inquiry report says. </p> <p>During a meeting with the then party co-chair Grant Shapps in 2014, Clarke said he had \u201csettled down and wanted a second chance to get back on the candidates list\u201d. Both Shapps and his chief of staff, Paul Abbott, believed Clarke had made a compelling case, and he was appointed director of RoadTrip2015 .</p> <p>After the 2015 election Robert Halfon, a deputy chair, lobbied Andrew Feldman, who was now the party\u2019s chair, to give Clarke a job. \u201cIn an email dated 12 May 2015 to a former CCHQ colleague, Lord Feldman said he had been approached by Mr Halfon about providing Mr Clarke with a role in CCHQ. No role was offered,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Of the 13 people identified as alleged victims of bullying, harassment or inappropriate conduct by Clarke reported to CCHQ between January 2014 and August 2015, six of the complaints had been raised in a way that they would not have been treated as formal, the report says. </p> <p>For seven of the alleged victims, the report says it is debatable whether it was truly bullying or harassment, because the issue had been quasi-political or the victim was either older or a contemporary of Clarke.</p> <p>The report notes that many interviewees who attended RoadTrip events were positive about their experiences and said they had not personally observed bullying, harassment or inappropriate behaviour by Clarke or anyone else.</p> <p>The inquiry found six specific allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Clarke. The report touches on other examples of alleged inappropriate behaviour during the RoadTrip events he organised. One separate allegation of sexual assault not by Clarke was made during a RoadTrip event. Abbott forwarded the complaint to CCHQ\u2019s secretary to the board\u2019s disciplinary sub-committee, who never met the complainant, and the issue was never investigated.</p> <p>Other complaints were made to Abbott about Clarke\u2019s behaviour, some of which he dismissed a \u201cinternal quarrelling\u201d. One involved Clarke and some of his associates allegedly threatening another party member in an attempt to influence the choice of candidates in a Conservative Future election, which Clarke denied.</p> <p>Johnson wrote a letter of complaint about Clarke after an incident in a pub when Clarke was said to have been rude and aggressive towards him while he was an employee of Conservative Way Forward, working for Abbott. The letter was accompanied by a separate document written by a colleague of Johnson\u2019s raising a variety of allegations.</p> <p>Both were raised with Feldman, Lord Gilbert, another deputy chair, and Simon Day, then chief executive. The complaint was investigated by Simon Mort, then chair of the disciplinary sub-committee. Johnson later said he wished to withdraw his complaint. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/27/elliott-johnson-young-tory-destroyed-by-party-he-loved-mark-clarke\">Elliott Johnson: the young Tory destroyed by the party he loved</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report says Clarke had become aware of the names of people being interviewed in response to the complaint, but found no evidence for the allegation that they had been leaked to him at CCHQ.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a certain degree of trepidation in the markets today, with indices selling off sharply in anticipation of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s last meeting, due out this evening. The July FOMC meeting took place after market fears had subsided in the wake of the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership, with the statement citing diminished near-term risks. If the committee no longer believes external factors are worth worrying about, then a 2016 rate hike is a distinct possibility. Given that much of the post-referendum surge in stocks has come from dovish monetary policy implications, hawkish comments are likely to exacerbate the weakness we are already seeing for markets today.</p> <p>Today\u2019s UK jobs report is significant in the post-referendum world, with Brexiteer jeers ringing out as they use the figures to back their argument that the pro-remain camp was fear-mongering with its warnings over the impact on the economy. It is certainly too early to say how the UK economy will react to the referendum result and eventual Brexit from the EU, but today\u2019s surprise decrease in July claimants suggests that businesses are waiting it out rather than making any rash judgements of the implications.</p> <p>Comments from Germany\u2019s European Affairs Minister hinting that the UK may be able to obtain a \u201cspecial status\u201d post-Brexit are an encouraging signal ahead of the exit negotiations. Once article 50 is enacted, any perceived developments within trade discussions are sure to be significant volatility drivers in the markets, raising the prospect of two years of unpredictability.</p> <p>The number one concern within the city is whether the UK will retain passporting rights, and success on this issue could define whether negotiations are perceived as a success or failure within financial markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b4757ae4b062ce4d2243fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T14:46:02.004Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks in surprise weekly drop</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And now oil is recovering some ground after the US inventory figures showed an unexpected fall last week.</p> <p>The Energy Information Administration said crude stocks dropped by 2.5m barrels compared to forecasts of a 522,000 increase.

Choudary was a man who thrived on attention, and who really believed in the hatred and twisted ideology he espoused.</p> <p>For a while I employed the unorthodox tactic of challenging him to an arm-wrestle whenever we met; he would always accept with bravado, but never actually did it.

Maybe he genuinely believed that it wouldn\u2019t be long before Isis would invade and conquer the UK and that announcing his allegiance wouldn\u2019t matter too much. Unfortunately for him it doesn\u2019t seem to be working out that way.</p> <p>All that being said, I am glad that Choudary is out of the picture, and as far as I am aware, there is nobody left in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/al-muhajiroun\">al-Muhajiroun</a> to fill his shoes.

Although they have only a few years of observations, they think they have captured a key moment in a cycle of events than can last thousands to millions of years. The ultra-dense white dwarf star increasingly steals gaseous matter from its less substantial companion, to trigger a runaway thermonuclear reaction that turns into an explosion of luminosity before resuming a long, slow hibernation. The scientists identified a series of \u201cbumps\u201d in the data before the eruption of brightness, followed by a slow falling away of luminosity that fitted all their predictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b103d52e13f9ff12439fd2d6127a099cedac8476\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b103d52e13f9ff12439fd2d6127a099cedac8476/0_0_1024_849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Upper panels: Snapshots of a nova lifecycle.

It will go on getting fainter and fainter until, many centuries from now, the cycle begins again.<br></p> <p>Five to 10 such events are observed in the galaxy every year, and novae have a central place in the history of science. The prevailing cosmology 450 years ago painted an imperfect, constantly-changing Earth at the centre of creation, observed by unchanging heavens. And then in 1572, the Danish astronomer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/nov/15/astronomer-tycho-brahe-death-scientists\">Tycho Brahe</a> observed what he reported as <em>De stella nova,</em> a new star where there had once been no star, and brighter than Venus. It was a starting gun for a scientific revolution that gathered pace in the next century with Galileo, and Newton. Tycho\u2019s star is <a href=\"http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/1998/09/supernova092898.html\">thought to have featured in the first act of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet</a> with a reference on the ramparts of Elsinore to \u201c... yond same star that\u2019s westward from the pole.\u201d</p> <p>Astronomers now think Tycho saw something much more violent, called a supernova. But ever since, astronomers have been puzzling over the mechanics of the nova phenomenon, and the hibernation hypothesis is one explanation. </p> <p>\u201cI would say it is the best hypothesis we have. It is somewhat controversial, but no one has proposed anything equally good,\u201d said Przemek Mr\u00f3z of the Warsaw University Observatory in Poland, who led the study.</p> <p> \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that our observations \u2018confirm\u2019 a hibernation scenario, rather \u2018they are in accord with hibernation predictions\u2019. The most important point is that before the 2009 eruption our system was really faint and the mass-transfer rate was low and unstable - this is why we observed small \u2018bumps\u2019 in the light curve of our object.\u201d</p> <p>The OGLE project monitors the densest sky regions, the galactic centre and the disc of the Milky Way. It has already identified 20 extrasolar planets and delivered <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101207/full/news.2010.654.html\">an explanation of another kind of nova</a>, based on the merger of two stars.

  "<p>Marcin Reszka is a nice chap. He asks me to emphasise this point. But, goodness, he can simulate viciousness when he wants to.

Parli-Training ran a course offering what the company calls \u201curban krav maga\u201d, which it defines as \u201cpractical, quickfire techniques to use against potential day-to-day attacks\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s disarming and running,\u201d says a spokeswoman for the company. \u201cAll you are doing is buying valuable time to flee.\u201d</p> <p>The distinction Parli-Training draws between urban krav maga and military krav maga \u2013 the techniques are most associated with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/11/young-gun-life-israel-defense-forces\">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) \u2013 is largely bogus. \u201cDisarming and fleeing\u201d pretty well sums up the essence of krav maga. Avoiding a fight is the best defence of all but, if a fight does start, the exponent of krav maga sets out to make it nasty, brutish and short. As I type this, I can still feel a twinge in the windpipe, which is where Marcin Reszka comes in.</p> <p>Reszka, 35, spent three years in the Polish army before coming to the UK. He has worked as a doorman, but is now a full-time krav maga instructor. Krav maga, which means \u201ccontact combat\u201d in Hebrew, was a method of streetfighting developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imi_Lichtenfeld\">Imi Lichtenfeld</a> in Bratislava in the 1930s to enable Jews to protect themselves against fascist gangs. Lichtenfeld fled the Nazis in 1940, eventually reached Palestine, became chief instructor for physical fitness with the IDF and built the techniques of krav maga into the forces\u2019 training.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a6726d81b3486079f40662ae53902c45bd896850\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6726d81b3486079f40662ae53902c45bd896850/0_795_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Moss blocks a blow.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Moss blocks a blow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lichtenfeld died in 1998, but his associates, acting rather like yoga masters, have passed on the code. Reszka learned krav maga in the Polish army and now teaches it through his company <a href=\"http://www.kravmaga-tactics.com/\">Krav Maga Tactics</a>, although he operates under the umbrella of <a href=\"http://krav-maga.com/\">Krav Maga Global</a>, whose chief instructor <a href=\"http://krav-maga.com/eyal-yanilov/\">Eyal Yanilov</a> studied with Lichtenfeld. Learning to gouge someone in the eyes or stun them with a sudden thrust to the windpipe has a long and distinguished lineage.</p> <p>Reszka is giving me an early-morning lesson in the back room of an office unit on an industrial estate in south London \u2013 very krav maga. After a conventional warmup, we get down to business. We simulate an altercation in the street. He advances; I put my hands up. He keeps coming; I shout as loudly as possible \u2013 the aim in everything you do in krav maga is to disorientate the opponent and wrest back the initiative. Shouting doesn\u2019t do the trick; he throws a punch and tries to get in a position to headbutt me; I block the punch, throw a straight right myself and kick him in the balls. Eyes, throat, groin \u2013 krav maga emphasises your opponent\u2019s most vulnerable areas and targets them mercilessly.</p> <p>Targeting the throat is incredibly effective. When the tables are turned and I do the advancing, the shock of a two-fingered jab to my windpipe sends me tumbling to the floor. It\u2019s called an \u201ceducational block\u201d because it educates me that this person is not to be messed with. It may alone be enough to defuse the danger in the situation. It certainly works with me: I am thenceforth ultra-wary of Reszka, who clearly takes his job very seriously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Krav maga is one of the best training methods for reality</p> <footer> <cite>Marcin Reszka</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cKrav maga is one of the best training methods for reality,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is more practical than traditional martial arts, and tries to give a little more edge to the drills and scenarios.\u201d The ultimate aim is to enable you to handle yourself under the sort of stress you would experience if you were attacked in the street.</p> <p>\u201cThe instructor will try to make you feel really uncomfortable to bring your heart rate up,\u201d says Reszka. When it is up, the adrenaline will be flowing and you will have great strength, but that has to be married to the defence techniques that have been drilled into you and will be retained in your \u201cmuscle memory\u201d no matter what level of stress and danger you face. That\u2019s the theory, anyway.</p> <p>We move on to headlocks. I get Reszka into one, and he demonstrates how \u2013 with my arms locked round his neck \u2013 <em>I</em> am the one who is vulnerable. He jabs the fingers of one hand into my eyes and, with the other hand, pushes me to the floor. One of the advantages of targeting the eyes and the windpipe is that it doesn\u2019t need much brute strength. It will, for instance, give a woman a fighting chance if she is attacked by a much stronger man. Speed of execution and knowing where to concentrate the attack are everything. Shouting as you launch your counter-attack is recommended: more disorientation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56cdc9761bd6eb69ffeb5354f04cb2d0232ea0e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56cdc9761bd6eb69ffeb5354f04cb2d0232ea0e2/0_595_3032_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If an attacker has a knife, you only have moments to mount your defence.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"778\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If an attacker has a knife, you only have moments to mount your defence.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reszka then shows me how to resist an attacker with a knife. Parry the thrust with your forearm, being careful to avoid the blade, throw a punch simultaneously, launch a kick or a knee to the groin and, while he is doubled up and groaning, get the hell out of there. Krav maga assumes there may be multiple attackers, so at all times you have to be scanning the area around you for sudden attacks from behind.</p> <p>When Reszka demonstrates the techniques, his speed is incredible: the counter-attack comes in a great flurry; the fight may only last seconds. If an attacker has a knife, you only have moments to mount your defence. If a couple of thrusts with a knife get through, you may be incapable of further resistance. Speed of thought and movement are everything.</p> <p>Despite the odd technical deficiency (and a dodgy knee), I have learned a lot in an hour. About 40% of Reszka\u2019s clients are learning krav maga for their jobs: police officers who want to be more streetwise; prison guards who fear knife attacks; bodyguards; doormen. The other 60% are doing it for fitness, to feel safer on the streets and to boost their confidence. Krav maga is empowering and, as I limp out of the makeshift gym, I really do feel a better, stronger person. Albeit one who, after that jab to the throat, is having some difficulty speaking.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2016 to correct the number years Reszka spent in the Polish army before coming to the UK.</p>",

  "<p>Before Sophie Dishman even started her social work degree at the University of Sunderland, she was tapping into her uni\u2019s dedicated social media groups. \u201cThe uni had Facebook groups for freshers and for students who were staying in accommodation. I used both to meet a lot of new people before I started, including two of my flatmates \u2013 so it wasn\u2019t too awkward when I moved in,\u201d says Dishman. <br></p> <p>Whether it\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat or Instagram, social media is a means to discovery, not only once you arrive at university \u2013 when you can head up societies, keep in touch with family and even run protests via your profile \u2013 but before you even choose which university you\u2019ll be going to. </p> <p>Matt Horne, digital marketing and social media officer at Newcastle University, says students can get a head start on which societies to join by checking out their Instagram and Facebook feeds, rather than waiting for the freshers\u2019 fair. It can help with accommodation choices too, he adds: \u201cSearch YouTube for your university and \u2018accommodation tour\u2019, and there\u2019s a good chance somebody will have done a guided tour of their halls, including information you won\u2019t get on an official tour. It\u2019ll give you a real feel of where you may end up living.\u201d </p> <p>On the academic side, many unis have Facebook groups for halls, WhatsApp groups for courses and LinkedIn groups to discuss modules. \u201cSome lecturers are open to connecting on LinkedIn, or have Twitter profiles to follow that give you a flavour of what your course will be like when you start,\u201d says Horne. \u201cWe have lecturers at Newcastle who run lecture roundups and revision Q&amp;As through Twitter, which you can eavesdrop on to get a feel for course content.\u201d</p> <p>However, there\u2019s a word of advice to heed regarding oversharing on social media. \u201cOnce images are out there, even on private channels, they are out of your control, so it\u2019s sensible not to share anything that you wouldn\u2019t want to become public later,\u201d says Rhiain Temple, editor at social media agency We Are Social.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I had a Skype interview from a Croatian holiday camp\u2019 </strong></h2> <p><strong>Philip Bailey managed to secured his University of Greenwich place from a resort on the Croatian coast</strong></p> <p>Philip Bailey, now in his first year on the University of Greenwich\u2019s BA in landscape architecture, was on a road trip to Croatia when he received an email from the University of Greenwich asking to see his portfolio. \u201cI remember being in the back of the car trying to organise it all and send it over,\u201d says Bailey, who had applied through Clearing to study at the university. </p> <p>Liking his work, the university asked for a face-to-face interview the following week, but Bailey wasn\u2019t due back in the UK for a fortnight or so. \u201cThey suggested a Skype interview, which was cool,\u201d he says. \u201cI was in a holiday camp on the coast near Pula [in Croatia], so I had my interview with the head of the department as I sat in the on-site restaurant. Thankfully, I passed the interview. It was good to know I had somewhere to study.\u201d </p> <p>In the run-up to getting on the course, Bailey also used the university\u2019s live chat facility to find out anything he wanted to know. \u201cI preferred to use that as it was more casual and easier than ringing up and waiting on the phone.\u201d </p> <p>He took a \u201clong-winded route\u201d to Greenwich, he admits, quitting Coventry University when he failed a module on the architectural technology course he was studying. It was then that he found his true vocation \u2013 gardening. \u201cI really got into it after getting a job looking after the lawns at Clare College, Cambridge.\u201d It was this newfound interest that spurred Bailey on to apply to the University of Greenwich last year.</p>",
  "<p>This will be a good year to be a student looking to go to university, even if you don\u2019t hit the required grades. With fewer young people (due to demographic changes) and no imposed limit on student numbers, universities are likely to have many places to fill through Clearing, building on last year\u2019s record numbers.<br></p> <p>This year, teams of friendly admissions staff \u2013 many of them recent students \u2013 will be on hand to soothe concerns and suggest courses to the tens of thousands expected to fall short of their offers or have a change of heart.</p> <p>And a record number are also using Clearing for their initial application to university; the total number of students using the service shot to 64,300 last year, compared with 38,000 10 years ago, says James Durant, professional development executive at Ucas. \u201cClearing has transformed into a respected and important route into higher education,\u201d he says, \u201cand almost all universities use Clearing for some of their subjects.\u201d Last year, the Russell Group universities \u2013 a self-selected association of 24 public research universities in the UK \u2013 announced 22,500 courses were available in July; 19 of those institutions, including Bristol, Exeter, York, Manchester and King\u2019s College London, used Clearing.</p> <p><strong>Get in early</strong></p> <p>The list of vacancies, available from early July on the Ucas website, will be continually updated this year; and students getting their results on 18 August will be able to make their choice on Ucas Track from 3pm \u2013 two hours earlier than in previous years. \u201cAbout half of those using Clearing will be placed by the Monday after results day,\u201d says Durant.</p> <p>Applying after exams has grown in popularity, says Hannah Morrish, education community manager at online community The Student Room. \u201cThis option has given students more time to think about what they want to do,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a survey by The Student Room shows that more than half of A-level students believe exam reforms have made them more likely to miss their first choice of university this year.</p> <p>For student Maduvanthi Pathmanathan, who missed her grades last year, it was a simple case of following advice and going through Clearing: she wrote down her options and was accepted into four respected universities, before opting for law at the University of Essex. \u201cThat week was probably the most intense I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut today I can say that I definitely belong here.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Clearing facts</strong></h2> <ul> <li>Ucas expects about <strong>30,000</strong> courses to advertise vacancies in Clearing this year, including those with the highest entry requirements. Last year, more than <strong>37,000</strong> courses were listed.<br></li> <li>A record <strong>49,100</strong> students found places through Clearing after missing out on their first offer \u2013 up 3% on 2014.

  "<p>You\u2019ve found your place through Clearing and decided to defer for a year, or perhaps you have simply decided to apply next year. Either way, you are now in the enviable, and perhaps slightly scary, position of having a whole year to fill. <br></p> <p>Tens of thousands of young people from the UK will head overseas to work this summer \u2013 to bolster experience, earn money to travel, and widen their skill sets \u2013 and you could now be one of them. </p> <p>Although there is, of course, something to be said for going it alone in foreign lands, a gap year of purely backpacking is becoming less common; most young people are opting to do some kind of volunteering or work while abroad. </p> <p>Tim Fryer, STA Travel\u2019s UK country manager, says: \u201cToday\u2019s young people are under more pressure than ever to have broad work experience and an impressive CV to show future employers or university admissions boards.</p> <p>\u201cHeading overseas to work somewhere such as Australia or New Zealand on a Working Holiday Visa, teaching English abroad, doing an internship, or taking part in a volunteering or conservation project \u2013 these are all great ways of doing this.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that it\u2019s not just about boosting career prospects: \u201cThese sorts of experiences also boost life skills, confidence and maturity, as they completely immerse you in a community and place.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The volunteer route</strong></h2> <p>Jennie Mann spent her gap year volunteering in Costa Rica \u2013 \u201cliving in hammocks in the rainforest and chopping down bamboo with a machete to build footpaths\u201d \u2013 and in Nicaragua, helping build an aqueduct to provide homes with running water. Her top tip is to organise your gap year through an organisation such as <a href=\"https://raleighinternational.org/\">Raleigh International</a> or <a href=\"http://www.volunteerics.org/\">International Citizen Service (ICS)</a>, both of which provide bursaries. \u201cThey give structure and safety to young people as well as the freedom to explore countries and meet new friends,\u201d she says. \u201cYou get great leadership skills that look fantastic on your CV.\u201d </p> <p>Raleigh International\u2019s Mike Butcher says joining an expedition is a good way to make friends if you\u2019re travelling alone: \u201cYou\u2019ll be in a team of about 12 volunteers, from a diverse range of backgrounds, including volunteers from the country in which you\u2019re working. Each team then has a volunteer manager, who is there to facilitate the project and support you. </p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re considering some independent travel after your programmes, volunteering first might just give you the confidence to do it \u2013 and, in all likelihood, some travel buddies.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cWhatever you choose to do, make sure you are passionate about it.\u201d </p> <h2>My amazing gap year diary</h2> <p><strong>Emily Potter from Bristol has spent her gap year working, volunteering and backpacking. At the end of August she flies home to start studying at Leeds University</strong></p> <h2>Autumn 2015</h2> <p>Having had summer off after my A-levels, I\u2019m now saving money for travelling. I mainly do events waitressing and bartending. It is definitely not boring, but it is quite unpredictable, sometimes going from no shifts for a couple of days to three in one day.</p> <h2>Christmas 2015</h2> <p>In the new year, my adventure begins. My first stop is Morocco, where I\u2019ll be volunteering with <a href=\"http://www.efamorocco.org/get-involved/volunteer.html\">Education For All (EFA) </a>which helps girls in the very rural High Atlas mountains finish their education. My own school\u2019s been supporting the organisation for years so I\u2019d heard a lot about it. It seems like a great opportunity to get to know a country and a culture I\u2019m interested in. People keep asking if I\u2019m nervous to go away but I\u2019m too excited to be nervous.</p> <h2>January 2016</h2> <p>I\u2019ve arrived in Asni, Morocco. Everyone has been very welcoming and lovely, but it was a little daunting being introduced to about 35 girls in such a short space of time \u2013 and after so little sleep. </p> <h2>February 2016</h2> <p>My main job as a volunteer is helping the girls who live in EFA\u2019s boarding houses with their English and French. I help a lot with homework, and the group \u201clessons\u201d I lead consist mainly of games and debates, but any chance to practise is useful for them. There is also always some project on the go, like repainting all the plant pots on the roof, or redoing the displays. If there is nothing to do, then we go and play football.</p> <h2>March 2016</h2> <p>Being of a similar age to the girls has helped me make really good friends. A couple of them invited me to stay with their families for the weekend, which was so much fun. I have even been to an Amazigh (Berber) wedding. They dressed me in a Kaftan and we danced until 6am and then walked home half way up a mountain. It started snowing and we were all wearing heels, and we had one torch between the five of us but because we were all so tired, we thought it was the funniest thing. That was one of my best moments.</p> <h2>April 2016</h2> <p>After leaving Asni, I travelled through Morocco to Tangier, before getting the ferry to Spain and flying to Budapest to do some interrailing around Europe with my best friend. We\u2019re in Prague now. We spent the day wandering around and there\u2019s so much to see and the city is beautiful. We had no plan so we just got lost for a couple of hours and took every opportunity to eat interesting looking food. </p> <h2>May 2016</h2> <p>I flew home from Brussels and now I\u2019m getting ready for my next adventure \u2013 Nicaragua. I first went there when I was 16 and I really wanted to come back to explore it more. I\u2019m going to do an internship at a place called Casa Xalteva in Granada. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s a non-profit Spanish school that funds an educational programme for underprivileged local children and adolescents.</p> <h2>June 2016</h2> <p>I usually have Spanish lessons in the morning and then spend the afternoons getting all my work done. My internship involves me doing all the admin, so my days are mainly spent emailing potential students and making sure everything is set up for their time studying here. </p> <h2>July 2016</h2> <p>In September, I\u2019m going to Leeds University to study French and Arabic. It\u2019s exciting, but at the moment I\u2019m more excited about being in Nicaragua and exploring Central America. Granada is close to a lot of really amazing places, including an enormous lake full of tiny islands, a crater lake, two volcanoes, the capital city Managua, and the Pacific coast. I have a lot of options for exploring so I just pick a place when I have time and visit. <br></p> <h2><strong>Gap year top tips</strong></h2> <ul> <li><strong>Do your research</strong>. If you want to volunteer, find out about the organisation, ask difficult questions, and make sure they\u2019re reputable.<br></li> <li>Go to a country where you can <strong>get a work visa</strong>. Combining work and backpacking is easy in countries such as Australia and New Zealand meaning you don\u2019t have to save quite as much. Plus working in a country is one of the best ways to get under its skin.<br></li> <li><strong>Think outside the box</strong>, initiatives such as <a href=\"https://www.helpx.net/\">Help Exchange</a> enable you to help families or businesses in exchange for food and accommodation \u2013 a really cheap way to see the world. Just check the reviews from previous helpers first!<br></li> <li><strong>Consider staying in the UK</strong> and finding a meaningful opportunity here. <a href=\"https://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/\">Volunteering Matters</a> has full-time opportunities for young people wishing to live away from home for six months or a year while making a difference in this country. <br></li> <li>Overall, <strong>think about the impact</strong> you want to make, and go out and do it.<br></li> </ul>",

The two years I spent there were plagued by gang-related violence among fellow students, discontinuity of teaching, and a general lack of resources. Despite this, I persevered there as no other local college offered my subjects.</p> <p>I felt very let down by my teachers for their failure to notice the flaws in my exam technique, and in my second year have been essentially teaching myself, refining my exam skills using tips from the internet. I have been determined to achieve the grades which I know reflect my ability, but the disruptive classes and poor teaching have inhibited my progress. Attending classes became an ordeal, and I learnt everything by reading at home. It was a lonely process.</p> <p>It goes without saying that the results day on Thursday is an important day for me. I hope my results can serve as a ticket to a better place, but I will always be mindful of those students I encountered at my sixth form college: despondent, with an underlying belief that the academic system cannot provide anything for them. The divides in society are becoming greater, and I strongly believe that more access to good quality education in deprived areas would help to address this. <br></p> <p>I have heard many people bemoan the rising number of university students - some people argue that too many new undergraduates aren\u2019t really good enough for university. I disagree. I view accessible tuition as a path to generational change; if my guardian had not been able to study with the Open University, she would not have encouraged me to take A-levels and strive academically. My college is now entirely vocational, and university has for many young people become too expensive to aspire to. </p> <p><strong>James Antonio, London </strong></p> <h2>\u2018The maintenance grants being cut have really hit hard\u2019<br></h2> <p><em>A-levels taken: History, History of Art, English Literature </em></p> <p>The maintenance grants being cut this year has really hit hard - it\u2019s sad because it\u2019s a cut that only affects the poorest. Aren\u2019t the poorest the group that should be most encouraged to go to university? After all, it\u2019s the most likely way for them to move up the social ladder, and social mobility is a key goal for the government, right? Okay, more apprenticeships are being created but do your hear of kids with affluent parents ever being encouraged to take a path like that? </p> <p>Out of all the costs for university, I\u2019m most concerned about living costs because the maintenance loan is only enough for me to survive since I\u2019ll be having no support from my parents. Whereas, other students will have money to join a number of societies and sports teams and do various things to make the most of university life. The loan is also sent to my account at a point after I have actually started university, so for the first few weeks at university I\u2019ll have to fund myself with money I\u2019ve saved up from working for the past year (which may have had a negative affect on my grades). I\u2019ll also have to pay my accommodation deposit and possibly the first month\u2019s rent myself. There is no information about any of this yet. The future looks uncertain and I really hope money issues won\u2019t interfere with the successful completion of my degree.</p> <p><strong>Imani Ali, London</strong><br></p> <p><br></p> <h2>\u2018I just want everything to be perfect\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86255bd654b30bc1fbe42698e5f8f15048729b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86255bd654b30bc1fbe42698e5f8f15048729b44/0_43_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"At least goats don\u2019t have to take exams.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At least goats don\u2019t have to take exams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasmine Ketch-Neumann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>A-levels taken: English Literature, German, Chemistry plus Biology at AS </em></p> <p>It feels like I\u2019m going to miss out on my dream because of factors beyond my control, and so will the rest of my class, so results day terrifies me.

I\u2019m glad to be going to university, but also upset that I\u2019m losing my home because of it: part of why my mum\u2019s moving is because once I leave sixth form, she won\u2019t be able to afford to keep our - or any - flat. <br></p> <p><strong>Jasmine Ketch-Neumann, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I may collide with the A-level barrier\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"929f2d08f2f916f28a8db47c54d2ecab1e53eb74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/929f2d08f2f916f28a8db47c54d2ecab1e53eb74/0_0_483_483/483.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Brisk: hoping to end up in hospital, one way or another.\" width=\"483\" height=\"483\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Brisk: hoping to end up in hospital, one way or another.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brisk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>A-levels taken: Maths, Biology, Chemistry, French, Critical Thinking </em></p> <p>During my first half-term break at college, I spent a week shadowing several doctors in a hospital.

It was only when I was 21 I discovered my passion for languages, so I decided to get back into education to pursue it. I feel much more pressure now than when I had my GCSE results at 16 as I feel at my age I\u2019ve taken more of a risk. I feel that if you mess up as a teenager you have plenty of time for a \u201cdo-over\u201d, but this is my only chance. <br></p> <p>Add in the fact I\u2019ll be the first in my family to go to university the pressure is really on.

I did French in school so I have an academic background in it, but with German I was entirely self taught before starting my A-Levels and it was quite hard to adjust. There are some advantages though, while I didn\u2019t focus a lot on grammar and accuracy when teaching myself (which examiners obviously look for!) I spent a lot of time speaking with German natives, which made me much more comfortable and confident in the language than my younger classmates.</p> <p> It\u2019s also been interesting to see how my priorities have changed since I was 16; back then I received 2 B\u2019s in my English GCSE\u2019s, but for my English A-Level I\u2019m strongly predicted an A*. A part of me is kicking myself for not doing better back then!</p> <p>Deep down I think I\u2019ll be okay come Thursday. If I drop a grade I\u2019ll probably still get in anyway - the advantages of \u201clife experience\u201d. While it\u2019s been two years of hard work, really I feel I\u2019ve been waiting for this since I was 18 when I saw all my friends leave for uni.

In June I sat the final exams at a local high school after nine months of naptime and bedtime study sessions. It\u2019s been exhausting.

Everyone in my acquaintance knows about my A level. They\u2019ve had constant updates about my home experiments, coursework and the struggle to revise while tending to a poorly toddler. A grade announcement is now expected, and I fear delivering an anti-climax to the saga. I guess a dose of humility is good for the soul.</p> <p>But I have to get the grade. I\u2019ve never felt so invested, I\u2019ve never worked so hard. The last few months have also included forward planning: setting up childcare arrangements, retrieving references (before my previous employers forget who I am), and making the bursary application. This is the last year of funded places, so there is a sense of urgency in securing my place on the course. I can\u2019t afford childcare without the financial assistance set to be revoked next year.</p> <p>I spent the entirety of my 20s feeling directionless and indecisive. Motherhood has sharpened my focus. I now know what I want to do and who I want to be. Achieving this A level is the first step in proving to myself I can put a pin on a map and reach it.</p> <p><strong>Tabetha Scott, Hertfordshire.</strong></p>",

And will eating it turn you into one? Chris Cashin, a registered dietitian who lectures in sports nutrition at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, has witnessed the peanut butter craze firsthand. \u201cI\u2019ve even got two sons who use gallons of it,\u201d she says. Athletes commonly spread it on carrot or celery sticks, add it to smoothies or eat it in its natural habitat: on toast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b146498cfa68a37fd884feadf3077872d164fd07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b146498cfa68a37fd884feadf3077872d164fd07/0_814_4204_2522/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A spoonful of peanut butter: fat, carbohydrate, fibre and protein.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A spoonful of peanut butter: fat, carbohydrate, fibre and protein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Jacobs/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, peanut butter has no magical properties in itself. Generally speaking, it is just ground-up peanuts, plus maybe a bit of oil, salt and sugar \u2013 and peanuts are just a lot of fat, carbohydrate, fibre and protein. What is special about this paste, however, is its convenience. Besides mixing easily into sweet and savoury snacks and drinks, it tastes good, requires no preparation, lives for months in your locker without rotting and, crucially, combines all those useful food groups in a very small volume, meaning that athletes can snack on it for energy and protein without getting so full they waddle around the track. The unglamorous truth about peanut butter, as Cashin puts it, is that \u201cit adds a lot of calories without too much bulk\u201d.</p> <p>Other high-density snacks are, of course, available. Cashin mentions cereal bars and energy balls (which are spherical bars, as far as I can tell) as well as something called \u201cfat bombs\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of perhaps some coconut oil, coconut and fruit.\u201d There are other nut butters, too, such as almond or cashew, which do a similar job, albeit usually with a little less protein.</p> <p>Most people already have a more mundane, and cheaper, alternative in their house. \u201cOne of the best snacks is actually some cereal and milk,\u201d says Cashin. \u201cMilk has natural whey protein, and carbohydrate, as well as in the cereal. Some athletes will actually refuel with milk. Lots of studies have shown that it is a good source of fuel, post-exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, if you\u2019re not training fairly seriously, it may be that you are by no means struggling to get enough calories in your diet. Rather, it could be the reverse. In which case, scoffing lots of peanut butter certainly won\u2019t make you any fitter \u2013 fatter is a possibility.

  "<p>We are witnessing, some&#xa0;fear, a rampant corporate takeover of our public language.

Some common words have also long been protected brand names, such as&#xa0;\u201cWindows\u201d and \u201cApple\u201d, of course, but although this latest seems peculiar, there are precedents: Carlsberg successfully trademarked the word <a href=\"https://tmdb.eu/trademark/008349227/eu/en/probably\">\u201cprobably\u201d</a>, and Chelsea football club has trademarked, er, <a href=\"https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/4/EU003344561\">Chelsea</a>, even though it is still a public area of London. Are all the terms in dictionaries and maps one day going to end up privatised?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/specsavers-application-to-trademark-shouldve-approved\">Specsavers' application to trademark 'should've' approved</a> </p> </aside>  <p><br></p> <p>Well, no.

The point is to prevent the use of the words in advertising similar products or services. Still, some companies are more aggressive than others. Sky TV, for instance, enjoys the curious benefit of owning the word \u201cSky\u201d. It successfully prevented video-calling service Skype from trademarking its own name, in particular because Skype\u2019s logo resembles a cloud and, as the EU court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/06/skype-similar-sky-tv-eu-court-rules-microsoft\">patiently explained</a>: \u201cclouds are to be found \u2018in the sky\u2019\u201d. In a particularly cack-handed move, Sky even sued the makers of new space-exploration videogame No Man\u2019s Sky for use of its word, a case eventually settled after what the head of the game studio called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nomanssky/status/743928033942315009\">three years of \u201csecret, stupid legal&#xa0;nonsense\u201d</a>.</p> <p>This all sounds rather silly and predatory in the extreme, but trademarking is necessary to protect commercial interests. In&#xa0;2012, Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 even attempted to register their new daughter\u2019s name, \u201cBlue Ivy\u201d, under the category of \u201cchild or baby products\u201d, prompting mirth at celebrity hubris. But this doesn\u2019t mean that they dreamed of single-handedly commercialising childbirth. \u201cPeople wanted to make products based on our child\u2019s name and you don\u2019t want anybody trying to benefit off your baby\u2019s name,\u201d Jay Z explained. (Except for, maybe, themselves in&#xa0;the future.) Sadly, their application <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5953736/jay-z-and-beyonce-fail-to-trademark-blue-ivy-so-dont-expect-your-official-bey-z-onesie-anytime-soon\">was denied</a>, since there was already an events-planning company called Blue Ivy.</p> <p>The breadth of English vocabulary still provides rich pickings for companies wishing to&#xa0;corner the commercial use of a&#xa0;noun or verb. You can easily check their availability at the <a href=\"https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmtext/\">Intellectual Property Office</a>. I am happy to report, for example, that the word \u201cinfuriating\u201d is still available for any smartphone or PC manufacturer who wishes to launch an advertising campaign of radical honesty. And for some reason, Southern Rail hasn\u2019t yet trademarked the word \u201cshambles\u201d to describe its train services \u2013 though it is already in use as the name of a cider, so perhaps it doesn\u2019t want to encourage the idea that it drives its customers to&#xa0;drink.</p>",

The sharp-tongued Texan, who had the misfortune to be Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s vice-president during the great man\u2019s first two terms, once <a href=\"https://www.cah.utexas.edu/news/press_release.php?press=press_bucket\" title=\"\">observed</a> that the number two job wasn\u2019t worth \u201ca bucket of warm spit\u201d.</p> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s quoted as a pitcher\u2019s worth, sometimes a quart, occasionally the liquid in question is warm piss. But everyone gets <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nance_Garner\" title=\"\">Garner</a>\u2019s drift: he regretted taking the job. Roosevelt\u2019s next veep, Henry Wallace, got dropped for being leftwing. The one after that lucked out. Unassuming Harry Truman succeeded to the Oval Office when the ailing president died three weeks before Hitler in April 1945. In August he got to drop the bomb.</p> <p>That\u2019s the whole point. A US vice-president\u2019s job is basically about hanging around, to be there just in case. You don\u2019t even get much training. It\u2019s history\u2019s posh lottery.</p> <p>The British <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">deputy premiership</a> is exactly the same but different. Like most things about our flexibly unwritten constitution \u2013 so different from all those carefully written ones \u2013 being deputy prime minister has no formal status or duties, let alone an office to call one\u2019s own. We can go for years without having one.</p> <p>Where the deputy prime minister is comparable to the Washington number two job is that the incumbent (when there is one) can make a little or a lot of it and is also well placed to pitch for the succession if that\u2019s the way he/she is inclined. Some aren\u2019t and it rarely works anyway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0159721107c83180b84721de3425aaa3d92baad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0159721107c83180b84721de3425aaa3d92baad/0_176_2723_1633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winston Churchill and his then deputy Clement Attlee. Attlee \u2018surprised everyone by trouncing the war hero in the 1945 general election\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It certainly did for the first man to be called deputy prime minister. Clement Attlee ran domestic policy in the wartime coalition while Churchill ran the war. Modest and loyal, he was bumped up to deputy prime minister in 1942 and surprised everyone by trouncing the war hero in the 1945 general election. Prime minister for the next six years, the welfare state and decolonisation of the empire are his memorial.</p> <p>Herbert Morrison, deputy prime minister during Attlee\u2019s entire tenure, was neither modest nor loyal. Peter Mandelson\u2019s grandfather thought he should have been prime minister and made no secret of it. An inveterate plotter, he even stood for leader at 67 when Attlee finally retired in 1955, but got hammered by Hugh Gaitskell, 18 years his junior.</p> <p>Never mind, Herbert. It could have been worse. You might have won and made a complete pig\u2019s ear of the job, which is what happened to Churchill\u2019s glamorous heir-all-too-apparent, Sir Anthony Eden. As an anti-appeasement ally and foreign secretary through the war, Eden had been waiting for the old boy to call it a day for years and was made deputy prime minister (and foreign secretary) when the Tories returned to power in 1951.</p> <p>Having survived a secret stroke in 1953 and resisted robust hints, Churchill, who rightly suspected the highly strung Eden wasn\u2019t up to the job, finally went at 90. Eden took over, won a snap election and ruined himself within 18 months with the doomed invasion of the Suez canal. Being deputy prime minister with high expectations was no longer looking such a good bet. Richard \u201cRab\u201d Butler, deputy prime minister (1962-63) in the dying days of Harold Macmillan\u2019s government, was a brilliant administrator who ran Keynesian domestic policy in the 50s, but was unloved. When Macmillan was forced out after the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Profumo-affair\" title=\"\">Profumo affair</a>, he helped stitch up the succession against Rab for the second time.</p> <p>No wonder everyone went off the deputy PM habit for a while. Then in 1979 the first woman prime minister shored up her position by making her defeated rival, Willie Whitelaw, her deputy. Loyal and shrewd (\u201cEvery prime minister needs a Willie,\u201d Mrs Thatcher explained in what may or may not have been her only joke), Whitelaw, who was also home secretary to start with, lasted until 1988, trusted, loved and unambitious.</p> <p>The following year Mrs T revived the office for her estranged former ally, Sir Geoffrey Howe, a consolation prize for having sacked him as foreign secretary. Howe was furious and his team boasted that he would run a chain of powerful committees. In reality he was marginalised. When he resigned and made a devastating Commons attack on her increasingly autocratic style it was a rare example of a dormouse killing a lion. Thatcher was out within a month.</p> <p>John Major, after moving into No 10, also had a deputy PM for tactical, back-protecting party reasons. Michael Heseltine, whom he had defeated, proved a loyal ally against the Eurosceptic \u201cbastards\u201d and was given the title after Major fought off a leadership challenge by one of them, John \u201cVulcan\u201d Redwood, in 1995.</p> <p>What could be more natural than that Tony Blair, a novice to high office, should do the same for John Prescott, his own defeated rival and New Labour\u2019s ambassador to the northern working class, when he moved into Downing Street in 1997. Prezza started out with a mega-ministry, gradually disassembled amid political and personal turbulence. But he kept the deputy prime minister title and left with Blair in 2007. Again, core loyalty was a key to survival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ead944eedb6c5a4ef51f5d06b0ee589a7b1ddf86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ead944eedb6c5a4ef51f5d06b0ee589a7b1ddf86/0_58_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair and deputy prime minister John Prescott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair and then deputy prime minister John Prescott. \u2018Core loyalty was a key to survival.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gordon Brown was his own deputy prime minister, but David Cameron found it expedient to make Nick Clegg, his Lib Dem coalition partner, deputy PM with a big office and team. Clegg\u2019s error was not to insist on having a real department like the Home Office to run. It left him out of too many loops, as he realised too late.</p> <p>Theresa May shows no sign of flattering rivals, since she sacked so many of them. As for \u201cacting PM\u201d Johnson, his few days of glory \u2013 chancellor Philip Hammond had the train set last week \u2013 serve to remind voters that modern communications mean a prime minister is never really out of touch or control. Johnson is there to open the post, probably steaming open her private correspondence while officials make the tea for the special poisoned chalice May has given him \u2013 the Brexit negotiation cup.</p> <p>So Boris\u2019s prospects depend on what happens next and whether he can dodge the usual falling scenery. The White House offers lessons there too. Eisenhower\u2019s vice-president, Richard Nixon, lost to Kennedy in 1960, but JFK\u2019s, Lyndon Johnson, succeeded when the president was murdered in 1963. Vietnam proved to be Johnson\u2019s Suez, forcing him out of office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2016/aug/16/boris-johnson-acting-pm-five-guideline-run-the-country\">'Avoid diplomacy': five guidelines to help Boris Johnson run the country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, couldn\u2019t distance himself enough from Vietnam and Nixon took the White House in 1968 at his second attempt. Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice-president, George Bush Snr, pulled off the succession in 1988 against hopeless Michael Dukakis, as Al Gore, Bill Clinton\u2019s number two, did not against crafty Bush Jnr in 2000. Vice-presidents usually get delegated far more real responsibilities now than in John Garner\u2019s day. It\u2019s more of a proper school for presidents.</p> <p>As for Barack Obama, the cerebral outsider, and his vice-president Joe Biden, much older and the ultimate Washington insider/dealmaker, they have unexpectedly become real friends, not just expedient business partners. When Obama expressed surprise at this development, Biden is said to have replied: \u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> fucking surprised?\u201d But Biden decided not to run in 2016 all the same.

That finding has prompted accusations of a \u201cwhitewash\u201d by Johnson\u2019s family.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s father, Ray, who declined to take part in the inquiry owing to concerns over its independence and transparency, told the Guardian: \u201cThe summary seems that we will get what we feared \u2013 a whitewash.

Shapps\u2019s resignation came a day after the Guardian revealed he had received a letter from Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi complaining about Clarke\u2019s conduct in January 2015. The party had until that point claimed that it was first made aware of Clarke\u2019s alleged behaviour in August 2015.</p> <p>Feldman and Crosby, as well as former deputy chairman Lord Stephen Gilbert, were among senior Conservatives who raised concerns about Clarke when it emerged he was falsely using the job title of \u201cdirector in CCHQ [Conservative Campaign HQ]\u201d, the inquiry found. In one email exchange between Shapps and Crosby, Shapps admitted Clarke was a \u201cdifficult individual who delivered\u201d and keeping him as RoadTrip director was a \u201ccalculated risk to be taken to help build the campaign network up\u201d.</p> <p>A month before he killed himself, Elliott Johnson complained to CCHQ about an alleged altercation with Clarke in the Marquis of Granby pub in Westminster. The Clifford Chance report reveals that upon receiving the complaint, Feldman said he had \u201calways had the gravest possible reservations\u201d about Clarke \u2013 but in relation to his \u201ccompetence as a campaign organiser\u201d.</p> <p>Clifford Chance reviewed 60,000 documents and interviewed 62 individuals over seven months for the inquiry. It received written evidence from a further four individuals. The law firm said there were at least 12 individuals with whom it particularly wished to speak but who did not provide evidence, including alleged victims of bullying and alleged perpetrators.</p> <p>Thirteen individuals were identified who were alleged to be victims of bullying, harassment and inappropriate conduct by Clarke between January 2014 and August 2015. Three of the alleged victims were older party members.</p> <p>Six allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour relating to Clarke were identified, the report says. \u201cThese included allegations that Mr Clarke propositioned activists or tried to kiss them,\u201d it adds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/27/elliott-johnson-young-tory-destroyed-by-party-he-loved-mark-clarke\">Elliott Johnson: the young Tory destroyed by the party he loved</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has also emerged that Clarke was accused of uploading a list of ineligible voters to the party\u2019s voter database ahead of the 2014 election held by the official youth wing, Conservative Future. Clarke denied the allegation, which was also brought to the attention of Feldman.</p> <p>The report concludes that there was no written, published procedure or common practice for party members to raise a complaint with CCHQ. \u201cThis places staff in the position of having to exercise discretion in how to deal with complaints that [are] received,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Ben Harris-Quinney, chair of rightwing thinktank the Bow Group, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said: \u201cIt would appear from the report that CCHQ officials were happy to overlook Mark Clarke\u2019s track record and behaviour because he was able to deliver positive campaigning results using nefarious tactics.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the report, the Conservative party said it would set up a hotline for complaints made by volunteers and overhaul its system for reporting complaints.<br></p> <p>McLoughlin, who was appointed chair of the party by prime minister Theresa May last month, said: \u201cThe death of Elliott Johnson was a tragedy and our thoughts remain with his family and friends.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs we address the findings of this report, I want to make clear that there can be no place for bullying behaviour in our party and we all have a responsibility to act when it occurs.

He left three letters, one of which said Clarke had bullied him and that a political journalist, Andre Walker, had betrayed him.</p> <p>His death triggered an explosive chain of events in which whistleblowers came forward and revealed a number of political figures \u2013 some young, some senior \u2013 to be tangled up in sleaze and scandal.

Over time, he brings along bits of furniture and crockery on his horse and cart, and eventually he brings his new wife Amy. They are as innocent and isolated as Adam and Eve. Over time, people build on neighbouring plots. Children are born, the bush is ravaged by fire and a neighbour murders her brother. Stan and Amy both hope for revelation and meaning in their lives. The constant to-ing and fro-ing of their (often mistaken) understanding of one another is held steadily in focus. </p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rainbow.html\">The Rainbow by DH Lawrence</a> (</strong><strong>1915)<br></strong>A Nottinghamshire farmer falls in love with a Polish widow, and marries her. She already has a daughter, and they go on to have two more. The novel spans 30 years. Like Patrick White, Lawrence uses free indirect style to fully reveal his characters\u2019 thoughts, but what is more extraordinary is how he manages to convey tectonic shifts of emotion, of distance and closeness, that neither character can articulate. <strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rabbit-run.html\">Rabbit, Run by John Updike</a> (1960)<br></strong>I\u2019m really recommending four books here. The three that follow are Rabbit Redux, Rabbit is Rich, and Rabbit at Rest, which together span the lives and lifelong marriage of Janice and Harry \u201cRabbit\u201d Angstrom. For much of Rabbit, Run, Updike puts Harry centre stage and restricts the novel to his point of view, chronicling his edgy hunger for freedom and sex, his affair with buxom Ruth, his frustration with his job and his dozy alcoholic wife. So when the novel switches to Janice\u2019s point of view \u2013 hurt, betrayed, drunk and utterly incapable of looking after a baby daughter \u2013 the effect is electrifying. Janice\u2019s character gains strength as the novels progress, and this blackly comic version of marriage is as eye-opening and sexy and convincing as any I have read.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/28/middlemarch-george-eliot-martin-amis-as-byatt\">Middlemarch by George Eliot </a>(1871-2)<br></strong>This great classic<em> </em>contains an impressive variety of long marriages, each finely drawn and in contrast to its fellows. There\u2019s Lydgate, with his idealism and adoration of Rosamond\u2019s beauty, who is brought up short against her simple selfishness; Dorothea, whose self-sacrificing devotion runs aground on the shallows of Casaubon\u2019s self-importance; ruined Bulstrode with his loyal wife; practical Celia and generous Sir James, and sensible Mary Garth with feckless Fred Vincy. Eliot plays with the idea of marriage, the illusions that initiate it, the deceptions and self-deceptions that damage it, the humour and loyalty and selflessness that enable it to survive.<strong><br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2098063318d06e164831a736f1ffdf2b85934eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2098063318d06e164831a736f1ffdf2b85934eb/0_169_4076_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Newall (Casaubon) and Georgina Strawson (Dorothea) in Dorothea\u2019s Story from in The Middlemarch Trilogy by George Eliot at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-importance and self-sacrifice Jamie Newall (Casaubon) and Georgina Strawson (Dorothea) in Dorothea\u2019s Story from in The Middlemarch Trilogy at the Orange Tree Theatre in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5.<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/15/anne-tyler-interview-i-am-not-a-spiritual-person-spool-of-blue-thread\">A Spool of Blue Thread by Anne Tyler</a> (2015)<br></strong>Tyler often writes about marriage, and always writes true. The first 10 pages of this novel are almost entirely dialogue and reveal Abby and Red Whitshank brilliantly. They are arguing helplessly over how to handle a phone call from their son Denny announcing he is gay. Abby theorises that his getting a girl into trouble while he was still at school might have been a symptom of homosexuality. Red asks, \u201cCome again?\u201d \u201cWe can never know with absolute certainty what another person\u2019s sex life is like.\u201d \u201cNo, thank God.\u201d Their love for one another is as comfortable and worn as the old slippers and colourless dressing gown each wears.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ghana-must-go.html\">Ghana Must Go by Taiye Selasi</a> (2013)<br></strong>This is not really about a long marriage, because Kweku abandons his family in the US after being pressurised into conducting surgery on a dying woman. He is unjustly blamed for her death and can\u2019t bring himself to tell his wife. He vanishes. They move back to different destinations in west Africa and their children scatter; they never meet again. Yet they are always present in one another\u2019s lives. A romantic, enduringly loving version of marriage, that is paradoxically (inevitably?) only sustained through absence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/15/top-10-books-about-middle-age\">Top 10 books about middle age</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/children-act-283455.html\">The Children Act by Ian McEwan</a> (2014)<br></strong>McEwan very cleverly reveals just how much the turmoil in Fiona\u2019s marriage is affecting her work as a high court judge.

The long marriage itself is not precisely the subject of Woolf\u2019s great novel, but the question of what a marriage might give and what it might take away from a woman is a key component.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/21/features.weekend\">Things My Mother Never Told Me by Blake Morrison</a> (2002)<br></strong>This is biography: the story of Morrison\u2019s mother\u2019s life, revealing all she gave up for her marriage (her Irish family background, her Catholicism, her work as a hospital doctor) and how she reinvented herself for a man whom many might call domineering and who went on to be unfaithful to her. And yet it was a long, solid marriage. Towards the end of it she told her son, \u201cI\u2019ve had a good life.\u201d A fine exploration of the complexity and conundrums of marriage.</p> <p><strong>10.

Released under a flurry of unsubtle alternative titles, including OK Connery, Operation Kid Brother and Operation 007, Alberto De Martino\u2019s movie pitches plasterer Neil (his performance entirely dubbed by an unknown American actor) as Dr Neil Connery, a plastic surgeon bizarrely recruited by a tired-looking Lee (here named Commander Cunningham) for a mission to take down the evil THANATOS organisation. As if the Bond allusions weren\u2019t enough already, two of the main villains were played by Adolfo Celi (Thunderball\u2019s Emilio Largo) and Anthony Dawson (Dr No\u2019s Professor Dent).

  "<p>A quarter century after the end of the cold war, Donald Trump has proposed restoring ideological tests for immigrants, a move that legal experts say raises a tangle of practical and even constitutional concerns.<br></p> <p>In a speech on Monday devoid of policy details or specifics, the Republican nominee called for the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/donald-trump-immigration-test-isis-islamic-state-foreign-policy\">extreme vetting</a>\u201d of immigrants, including a screening process to root out applicants who do not uphold \u201cAmerican values\u201d. </p> <p>Laurence Tribe, a liberal constitutional law professor at Harvard University, said Trump\u2019s proposal was \u201ca nonstarter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe proposal ... is very deeply un-American, is probably unconstitutional, would almost certainly fail in Congress and is another example of Trump having no idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Restricting immigrants on the basis of ideology is anathema to American values, Tribe argues. Freedom of speech and religion are enshrined under the first amendment of the constitution and the enduring symbol of freedom is the Statue of Liberty welcoming weary immigrants to its shores. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/donald-trumps-extreme-vetting-plan-immigration\">McCarthyism redux: the long view of Trump's immigration plan  | James Nevius</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though immigrants outside the US would not receive the constitutional right to due process, Tribe said family members could bring challenges on their relatives\u2019 behalves. </p> <p>Trump has long called for tightening immigration controls as part of his plan to defeat Islamic State. In 2015, Trump vowed<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration\"> to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US</a>. In his speech on Monday, Trump appeared to revise that policy, calling for a temporary ban on immigrants from countries subject to terrorist attacks, though the original blanket ban on Muslims is still featured on his website. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposal is not unprecedented. America has a long history of extreme vetting \u2013 which includes ideological tests \u2013 dating back to its foundation, when the leaders of the young nation worried anarchists would arrive and undermine the fledgling democracy.<br></p> <p>One of the earliest and most flagrant immigration laws was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which barred Chinese workers from entering the US. The ban, which was passed amid anxiety over job scarcity and a depressed economy, was later extended at the turn of the 20th century to in effect deny entry to all Asian immigrants. </p> <p>But Trump\u2019s proposal draws from more recent history \u2013 the anti-communism measures employed during the cold war.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn the cold war, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,\u201d he said during a speech at Youngstown State University in Ohio. \u201cI call it extreme vetting.\u201d</p> <p>In 1952, Congress passed the McCarran\u2013Walter Act, authorizing the federal government to refuse admission to classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs in an effort to keep members, former members and sympathizers of the communist party from entering the US. As the cold war came to a close, Congress revisited the law and in 1990 voted to greatly narrow the president\u2019s ability to deny immigrant visas based on ideological grounds.</p> <p> Trump has claimed, citing the act, that he would have the authority as president to suspend entry to any class of person who would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d. While the law grants the executive branch broad discretion over matters of immigration, the president would not have \u201cabsolute\u201d authority \u2013 Congress could act to limit the president\u2019s power.</p> <p>And yet if Trump managed to clear the initial hurdles and his proposal either passed Congress or survived the legal challenges experts say would surely arise, he would then have to contend with the operational difficulties of implementing such a sweeping proposal. </p> <p>\u201cIf he does try to implement an ideological test, that leads to a question which came up early in the cold war: how do you administer that? Is that a questionnaire? Do you investigate the answers? And if you do, how do you do that? Who does that?\u201d said Carl Bon Tempo, author of Americans at the Gate: The United States and Refugees during the Cold War. </p> <p>\u201cEnforcing an ideological litmus test takes an incredible amount of manpower and historically the result has been that it greatly slows the process.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University, is skeptical of Trump\u2019s promise to enhance a process that is already extensive and lengthy. Immigrants applying to come to the US are already asked to respond to a questionnaire and are subject to a background check that vets for, among other things, links to terrorist or extremist groups.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How is a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently \u2018American\u2019 in his or her thinking?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cImmigration to the United States would grind to a near halt if millions of people are subject to background checks based on subjective criteria,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is a consular officer or a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently \u2018American\u2019 in his or her thinking?\u201d</p> <p>Based on Trump\u2019s speech on Monday, Yale-Loehr speculated that the Republican might propose screening applicants\u2019 social media pages as part of the routine background check. Currently, officials only run social media checks in certain cases. He could also add requirements that family members be brought in for interviews as part of the application process. But he said it would be impossible to implement these changes, since they would require a vast mobilization of resources and manpower. <br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has said it would expand on his immigration proposals in the coming weeks, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment. <br></p> <p>Still, experts say that on its surface, the proposal poses major logistical and practical problems that agencies grappled with during the cold war in the 1950s and, more recently, in the post-9/11 years. </p> <p>In vilifying the immigrant, Trump is using a familiar playbook from American history, said Erika Lee, a professor of immigration history at the University of Minnesota. Throughout history, politicians exploited public anxiety over a scarcity of jobs and threats to national security to push through exclusionary laws. <br></p> <p>\u201cFor many Americans, when they think back to America\u2019s history, it\u2019s the Ellis Island story. This is the way our mythology works,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut that has created some rose-colored glasses and helped to obscure the other side of the story, the one where we exclude whole groups of people based on race, ethnicity or ideological belief.\u201d</p>",

He also said tax changes would lead to increased revenue of \u00a313bn.</p> <p>Asked about his spending and borrowing plans, Corbyn cites his policies of the national investment bank and transport policies which he said would help grow the economy, as well as tax rises.

In turn, Williams had her credit card, fuel and 12 holidays a year paid for, plus a \u00a3320 weekly stipend. </p> <p>In the summer of 2013, Williams became involved with Johnston. \u201cIt was very quick, there was no dating, and she turned up at my house having been invited, in a short skirt and red high heels, and there was immediate intimacy,\u201d Johnston told the court. </p> <p>He told the court he had been \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cflattered\u201d but there was \u201cnever any kind of permanence in the relationship\u201d.

In August 2014 an entry in the diary of Katrina Walsh \u2013 the \u201centhralled\u201d friend and accomplice of Williams \u2013 marked the start of the pair\u2019s murderous plot to kill \u201cthe evil bitch\u201d. </p> <p>That month Hartley and Johnston\u2019s house was broken into and both cars stolen.

We have never been able to get enough of each other.\u201d </p> <p>Johnston admitted the affair and repaired his relationship with Hartley, but the unannounced visits and presents from Williams continued. She even broke into his house and set off the alarm while he was away on holiday. </p> <p>The court heard Johnston felt \u201cstalked\u201d, while Williams had recruited her \u201cawestruck\u201d friend Walsh to help prepare for murder. They travelled to Germany for the stun gun and bought mobile phones, men\u2019s boots to throw police off the scent and a car, in cash. Walsh \u2013 described in court as \u201cweak-willed\u201d \u2013 kept all this information in her diary. Those private notes would become the backbone of the police investigation. </p> <p>Walsh had proven a loyal and dedicated partner in crime for Williams in a previous revenge mission \u2013 pouring foam into the car exhaust of a Thai boxer and ski instructor, Somapat Sitiwatjana, and stalking his wife, Janet, after he jilted Williams.</p> <p>At one point in 2015, with their murderous plan still in its infancy, the duo tentatively approached Walsh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/17/sadie-hartley-killer-katrina-walsh-ex-husband-interview\">ex-husband Kevin to assist with something \u201cnefarious\u201d</a>.

A record 1,007,000 migrant workers came from these countries in the second quarter of the year, up 44,000 on the previous quarter.</p> <p>The number of non-UK nationals in employment increased 110,000 to 3.45 million in the second quarter, compared with a rise of just 58,000 in the number of UK nationals in work to 28.2 million. The employment rate, which measures the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work, was 74.5%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971.</p> <p>Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said concerns about the Brexit vote were not supported by the data. He said: \u201cAhead of the referendum, speculation was that the economy would grind to a halt, hiring would stall, and investment plans would be put on ice. The first two haven\u2019t happened; we will find out next week whether the third came good. </p> <p>\u201cBut this does provide a glimmer of hope that if fears of the pre-Brexit jitters proved unfounded. Maybe the post-referendum doom and gloom may equally prove to have been overcooked.\u201d</p> <p>But several economists warned that cutbacks over recent months by firms to their investment plans and a freeze on new hiring by many employers were early indicators of a worsening employment picture over the next year, dampening annual pay rises.</p> <p>Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe vote to leave the EU should cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether, resulting in the unemployment rate drifting up over the coming quarters. This should contain any further rises in earnings growth and keep domestic cost pressures in check.\u201d</p> <p>He said the Bank of England should be able to follow through with more monetary easing to support the economy, without worrying about stoking domestically generated inflation too much.</p> <p>The unemployment announcement comes hot on the heels of Tuesday\u2019s inflation update, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/first-post-brexit-data-shows-uk-inflation-rose-to-06-in-july\">the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to a higher than expected 0.6% in July</a>. CPI was up from 0.5% in June, according to the ONS, with economists expecting the figure to be unchanged. </p> <p>But while there was no sign of the plunge in the value of the pound having an impact on CPI, the ONS said the producer prices index (PPI) showed that sterling\u2019s slump had pushed up the cost of imports for British manufacturers, which could fuel inflation down the line. </p> <p>Input prices rose 4.3% in the year to July, compared with a drop of 0.5% in the year to June, as the PPI was affected by the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote, which drove up the cost of imported metals and chemicals. </p>",

  "<h2>Donald Trump shakes up campaign</h2> <p>Donald Trump has hired Stephen Bannon of the conservative website Breitbart News as campaign CEO and promoted pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager in his latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">campaign shakeup</a>.

For everyone.</p> <p>That might not be the case with theatre. There are plays you can sit in the dark and watch, barely noticing that there are only a handful of people there. But this is comedy. There\u2019s a direct correspondence between performer and audience \u2013 and pity or embarrassment isn\u2019t a good starting point. In comedy, performers depend on a responsive audience to make their shows work. No comic likes the sound of less-than-10 people laughing \u2013 it makes their jokes sound lame. But here, that\u2019s the best they can hope for.</p> <p>Every audience member wants to be part of a big crowd, too. It makes you feel you\u2019ve backed a winner.

Most comics acknowledge it: addressing the elephant in the room is on their job description. Some comics can\u2019t stop talking about it, which seldom works. Some see an opportunity in the audience\u2019s lowered expectations; others may take comfort that nervous laughter, after all, is still laughter. Campbell treads those lines pretty adroitly \u2013 but even then, the gig seldom feels more than an attempt, on all our parts, to simply get through this with dignity intact.</p> <p>Now and then you hear stories about unforgettable performances, when gifted comics rise to the challenge of a tiny audience, refashioning their shows into intimate, you-had-to-be-there treats for the lucky few in the crowd. Super-confident acts may sometimes style it out. Surely, a fallback strategy for dealing with single-figure audiences is a necessity on the fringe, even if the festival\u2019s oft-quoted average crowd of six is, I think, a myth. For all those comics who have to put that strategy into action, well, they deserve sympathy \u2013 which is, of course, part of the problem \u2013 and so do their audiences.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sam-campbell-the-last-dreamer\">Sam Campbell</a> is at Assembly Roxy, Edinburgh, until 28 August. </p>",
  "<p>Documentary film-maker Michael Moore has said he knows \u201cfor a fact\u201d that Donald Trump does not want to be president of the United States and claims the Republican nominee is now sabotaging his own campaign in order to avoid the Oval Office. </p> <p>Moore, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/trump-self-sabotage_b_11545026.html\">writing on The Huffington Post</a>, says that Trump ran for president as a negotiating tactic, hoping to leverage a higher pay packet from NBC. The broadcaster had formerly employed Trump as the star of the reality TV show The Apprentice, but fired him after he called Mexican immigrants \u201cdrug dealers\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d at his campaign launch. </p> <p>According to Moore, who does not name his source, Trump continued his campaign only to increase his stock with other television networks. </p> <p>\u201cAnd then something happened,\u201d Moore writes. \u201cAnd to be honest, if it happened to you, you might have reacted the same way.

  "<p>If you were bitten by a mosquito, and within two weeks had a fever, bloodshot eyes, a rash and felt generally achy, you would have four classic symptoms of Zika. But if you or your sexual partner didn\u2019t travel to Latin America, you might also have a hard time getting tested. </p> <p>That\u2019s because Zika tests are complicated, time-consuming, sometimes inaccurate and expensive. These obstacles have led some scientists to believe that several states at risk for spread of the disease may already have Zika outbreaks, without even knowing it.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not active surveillance going on in the at-risk states in the United States,\u201d said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. \u201cI think there\u2019s not just Zika transmission going on in Miami, it\u2019s going on all up and down the Gulf Coast and in Arizona, it\u2019s just that nobody\u2019s looking.\u201d</p> <p>The only confirmed cases of Zika caused by local mosquitoes in the continental US are in Miami, Florida. Federal officials have since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/florida-zika-cases-transmission-neighborhood-miami-dade-county\">issued a travel warning</a> for the area, asking pregnant women or those hoping to become pregnant to avoid the Wynwood neighborhood. There, local mosquitoes infected 15 people with the virus. </p> <p>Other Gulf coast states are also considered to to be at high risk for local transmission of Zika virus. That is because <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes are endemic, and multiple travelers have returned with the infection. But with laboratory limitations, even states with disease-spreading <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes may not be able to surveil non-travelers for the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a limitation, and local transmission could slip through, but it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Frank Welch, the medical director for Louisiana\u2019s center for community preparedness. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/zika-virus-miami-florida-cases-mosquito-wynwood\">Zika virus scare is turning Miami's hipster haven into a ghost town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Louisiana, long known to be a haven for mosquitoes, is considered a state at-risk of Zika transmission. There, 22 cases of travel-related Zika has been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p> <p>\u201cThe big fear, of course, is we\u2019ll figure this out seven, eight, nine months from now, in the spring of 2017, when we start seeing babies show up with microcephaly,\u201d said Hotez.</p> <p>Meanwhile, for community health centers in another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/zika-mosquito-hunters-houston-scientists\">Gulf Coast state</a>, Texas, the virus recalls an earlier epidemic that left public health officials flat-footed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never faced something like Zika before. We faced, what was it? H1N1,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Camacho, executive director of the Texas Association of Community Health Centers. Member clinics serve about 1.3 million low-income Texans. \u201cOvernight we were overwhelmed, and I guess nobody was ready for that either. And we\u2019re fearful that some of the same things are playing out here.\u201d</p> <p>When H1N1 broke out in Texas, the CDC told doctors that they were required to test for the flu strain before prescribing antivirals, Camacho said. He recalls the first H1N1 case occurred on a Friday night. By the weekend, the CDC arrived. Then, it was discovered a standard flu test couldn\u2019t detect the strain.</p> <p>So the CDC provided new H1N1 tests. Five of them. For all 1.3 million of the Texans served by Camacho\u2019s member organizations.</p> <p>\u201cNumber one, in terms of screening, there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/zika-funding-bill-us-house-paul-ryan\">very limited resources</a>,\u201d Camacho said. \u201cWe saw the same thing in H1N1, where the flu test did not work. They actually had to develop a test and eventually change the protocols to not require a test, but delegate it more to the physician\u2019s knowledge at screening.\u201d</p> <p>Officially, the CDC recommends that patients with three of the aforementioned Zika symptoms be tested if the patient is a pregnant woman, or a woman trying to get pregnant, who lives in or has traveled to an area where Zika is being actively spread.</p> <p>That means that many people who do not fit this profile, especially men, may be left untested even though the disease is spread sexually.</p> <p>Some public health officials, like Welch, said testing more Americans would require exorbitant resources. </p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say this test was incredibly available \u2013 we would have to test every single person in the US where there is the possibility of Aedes,\u201d said Welch. \u201cWe would not only have to test them today, we would have to test them for the duration of the summer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA once a week Zika test for everyone in the southern United States and California \u2013that would be more expensive than building a wall across both our Mexican and Canadian borders,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you would have to decide, since the test is in fact limited in availability and expensive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b5ce67d7d45dee0f12c1f2cebfed1d6d2712cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b5ce67d7d45dee0f12c1f2cebfed1d6d2712cdd/0_88_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton talks to a pregnant woman during a health center visit in Miami, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton talks to a pregnant woman during a health center visit in Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Keane/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Scientists don\u2019t expect large-scale outbreaks in the continental US, like those that have taken place in Puerto Rico or Brazil. Texas also recently updated its guidance to include recommendations to test people who are symptomatic, but haven\u2019t traveled to Latin America.</p> <p>Even so, Zika presents its own challenges. Only one in five people infected with the disease are symptomatic. So in order for public health officials to locate a Zika case transmitted by local mosquitoes, a symptomatic patient (already just 20% of the infected population) would need to seek medical treatment. There is no guarantee a patient would even feel the need to see a doctor, since symptoms are generally mild. Then, doctors would have to rule out all other causes of such common symptoms. </p> <p>\u201cSay, for example, that person did show up at a healthcare provider,\u201d posits Welch, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be automatically turned away,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] you probably know the symptoms of Zika are pretty close to about 6 million other diseases.\u201d </p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/zika-virus-miami-florida-cases-mosquito-wynwood\">Wynwood neighborhood of Miami</a>, for example, clinicians went over and above CDC guidelines to test a symptomatic patient who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/health/zika-virus-florida.html\">showed up at an emergency room</a> without traveling abroad.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going into community health centers, we\u2019re not going into emergency rooms, we\u2019re not going into clinics identifying people with fever, or a rash, and seeing if they have Zika,\u201d said Hotez. \u201cIt\u2019s not being done.\u201d </p> <p>In part, this is because of the limitations on Zika testing methods. The two most common ways to test for the virus are both manpower intensive.</p> <p>\u201cThey absolutely take a specialized skill,\u201d said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases for the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Tests for past infections can be particularly tricky. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get more false positive results, that\u2019s just the way it works with any kind of assay.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, Camacho is rationing 50,000 bottles of donated mosquito repellant to the roughly 400,000 women of child-bearing age served by his organizations. Hotez is meeting about testing guidelines, and cities and states are increasingly broadening their testing guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still patchwork quilt,\u201d said Camacho. </p>",
  "<p>Whenever the future of advertising is discussed, thoughts often turn to the sci-fi image of a stalked Tom Cruise in Minority Report being recognised and served intrusive, personalised advertising as he tries to escape a futuristic city.</p> <p>Hence, recent claims by Russian app <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/17/findface-face-recognition-app-end-public-anonymity-vkontakte\">FindFace</a> that it could identify people in public by their profile picture on a Russian social media site were met with a combination of awe and concern.

At <a href=\"http://www.axis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Axis</a>, which develops facial recognition technology, business development manager Andy Martin points out facial recognition is already being used to enable advertisers to count how many people have viewed their outdoor advertising. The results are even split by gender and age. In a well-known outdoor campaign for domestic abuse charity <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women\u2019s Aid</a>, a model\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/bruised-woman-billboard-heals-faster-more-passersby-look-her-163297\" rel=\"nofollow\">bruises disappeared from her face</a> as more people watched the screen, getting across the message that if people take notice, domestic violence could be halted.</p> <p>\u201cWhere I think we\u2019ll start to move on and actually see people individually recognised is customer loyalty schemes,\u201d says Martin.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already working behind the scenes with some well-known retailers who are interested in spotting their loyal shoppers when they walk through the door. It would allow a sales assistant to be alerted and offer some a truly personalised shopping experience.\u201d</p> <p>While customer loyalty might be the first opportunity, individual adverts, targeted through facial recognition, could be arriving sooner than you think. Robin Arnold, director at Digital Media Technologies, which consults on outdoor campaigns, has used camera technology in projects to enable digital posters to change when they are being watched. A recent example was a J20 advert in which an on-screen predator played a game of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGC6EY0AXPk\" rel=\"nofollow\">What\u2019s the time Mr Wolf?</a> with onlookers. He has also worked on campaigns where the technology was used to subtly personalise car adverts when an advertising screen\u2019s camera spotted a driver of a rival brand.</p> <p>\u201cThe technology used number plate recognition software to find out what type of car [was] waiting at the lights and then changed the message on the digital screen,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>\u201cSo, when the client was Renault they would spot a Citro\u00ebn car and say something like, \u2018Hey, Citro\u00ebn driver, check out this Renault\u2019.

Say, there\u2019s a guy waiting for a bus for ages in front of digital screen running a beer campaign. If that person likes that brand on Facebook you can foresee either the screen saying \u201chi\u201d and giving him or her a voucher code for a free beer or triggering a voucher to be delivered to their Facebook inbox.\u201d</p> <h2>Too many faces, too many laws</h2> <p>That kind of facial recognition is going to be far more likely than the sci-fi image of all advertising being individually tailored, according to Scott Ross, CTO at advertising agency DigitasLBi. He suggests those who imagine facial recognition happening en masse should consider exactly how much computing power would be needed.</p> <p>\u201cJust on an escalator at a tube station you\u2019d need to recognise a hundred people at the same time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd each of those faces would have to be retrieved from a database of millions in the split second it takes them to pass from one screen to another. It\u2019s a possibility but highly unlikely.\u201d</p> <p>As one would imagine, it\u2019s not only a technological issue but a legal one. Nick Johnson, partner at Osborne Clarke and member of its advertising law team, points out that the law is moving towards tougher opt-in rules as the EU general data protection regulation moves from approval to becoming law in May 2018.</p> <p>\u201cThe new data privacy laws are very specific about any biometrics belonging to a new, distinct type of data deemed as extra sensitive, alongside health and religion,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt means brands will need very clear, explicit opt-in permission in which they make it very clear exactly what will be done with the data and offer very clear choices to consumers to opt out. So, it\u2019s a very sensitive area.\u201d</p> <p>En masse, then, facial recognition looks to be a way off and will possibly never be accepted because of privacy concerns. However, as a special feature for customer loyalty schemes, recognition systems are already being tested behind closed doors. If you\u2019re a high flyer, expect to be asked to be recognised soon: but if you are just one of the crowd, expect your face to be counted, but not recognised, next time you stop to stare at an ad on a digital screen.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>Can this really be the right place? I wave my phone around above my head, but I\u2019m out of luck \u2013 no signal, no map location. On this quiet country lane just outside Truro there\u2019s no signpost to direct me and all I see are empty fields.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to find the entrance to Wild Fal, a new getaway on the banks of Cornwall\u2019s river Fal which aims to offer adults an escape from city life by disconnecting from technology and reconnecting with nature.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t have opened at a more timely moment. An Ofcom report out this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/more-than-a-third-of-uk-internet-users-have-tried-digital-detox-ofcom\">has revealed the nation\u2019s obsession with being online </a> \u2013 almost half of the 2,550 people surveyed said they felt lost when they couldn\u2019t access the web and a third said they found it difficult to disconnect. More than a third of UK internet uses had also taken a \u201cdigital detox\u201d break from the web to cope with their addiction in the last year, whether that was just a few hours offline or a web-free holiday.</p> <p>I give up on my phone and fortunately co-founder Sheldon Stansfield soon appears, waving at me across the field. Set up by three young creatives \u2013 cabinet-maker Louis Antoine, film graduate Izzie MacQueen, and 3D design graduate Stansfield \u2013 Wild Fal opened its doors in spring 2016. Accommodation for up to 16 people is divided between a treehouse, a potting shed, a hunting lodge and a tipi. Optional activities range from wilderness retreat staples such as foraging and bushcraft, to creative pursuits \u2013 pottery and furniture making, with wood sourced on site.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad3da9149c268d7b93d3f0b343b7398dd527a832\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad3da9149c268d7b93d3f0b343b7398dd527a832/0_20_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"the \u2018treehouse\u2019 at Wild Fal\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the woods \u2026 the \u2018treehouse\u2019 at Wild Fal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about engaging with the wild and getting people away from computers to explore, switch off and reimmerse in the calm of nature,\u201d says Stansfield. \u201cWe want to create a buzz about life \u2013 making time to appreciate the great outdoors and the arts.\u201d</p> <p>For me it works almost immediately. We\u2019ve only walked a few hundred metres, but as we emerge from the fields into oak woodland and see the 300-year-old cottage the site is based around, the rest of the world feels a million miles away.</p> <p>My stay is quiet, with just two other guests \u2013 a young film-maker and a yoga teacher, but I\u2019m told that recent weekends have been busy, with a stag do and 30th birthday party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"631642b6b42362c5a13b3593ac77463064eba817\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/631642b6b42362c5a13b3593ac77463064eba817/0_20_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"The kitchen at Wild Fal\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kitchen at Wild Fal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no Wi-Fi on site, so I\u2019ve left my laptop at home, and seeing just one fluctuating bar of signal on my phone, I opt to switch it off. It feels like a relief.</p> <p>The accommodation and washing facilities (a choice of solar shower or a wild swim) are basic, with minimal comforts on offer. For meals, there\u2019s the option of self-catered or semi-catered. The food provided is simple, but delicious, with the emphasis on local produce such as seasonal veg and game: we dine together on foraged nettle soup and rabbit with vegetable stew. For breakfast there\u2019s locally baked bread, honey and fruit.</p> <p>Self-caterers can also cook over the fire or use the wood-fired clay oven. Aside from weekend indie film screenings among the trees, nighttime entertainment is DIY: a chat and a drink around a fire with other guests, or a peaceful evening reading - not a mobile phone or iPad in sight.</p> <p>The next morning, I\u2019m woken by daylight flooding into my treehouse room and the sound of birds and a trickling stream.</p> <p>The creative vibe is everywhere: the treehouse is insulated with multicoloured wool held in place with old fishing nets, a glass bottle wall runs alongside the vegetable patch, and in the woods there\u2019s an old, soon-to-be-revived charcoal kiln.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c56e81cca567babc5a7cae23d74afc618a7737a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56e81cca567babc5a7cae23d74afc618a7737a1/0_20_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Foraging for edible plants along the river\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foraging for edible plants along the river</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My first workshop is a half-day foraging trip with local expert Stuart Woodman (the programme of half-day and full day workshops varies, so it\u2019s worth checking online before booking if you\u2019re keen on a particular activity). We scour the river bank and woodland for edible plants, my two favourites being the asparagus-like rock samphire and sweet and succulent wall pennywort. We stop every few yards, because the place is brimming with useful plants. To try and commit what I\u2019ve learned to memory, I follow up the workshop with some time sketching what we\u2019ve gathered, but it\u2019s on day two that the creativity really kicks in \u2013 with a pottery workshop led by a local ceramicist.</p> <p>We collect clay from the riverbed (although we\u2019ll be using material that\u2019s already been collected and processed, it reminds us that we\u2019re working with the local earth). With only our hands and a few manual tools, we sit in the open air creating simple thumb pots and small square boxes, using the sea shells and leaves around us as our decorative inspiration.</p> <p>With nothing to distract me, I notice the softness and warmth of the clay through my fingers and become lost in the flow, with all sense of time gone \u2013 something I\u2019m rarely able to experience in my day-to-day life of email notifications and city noise. I feel calm and focused, the urge to check my phone every five minutes vanished. I spend my last hours at Wild Fal gathering edible leaves, and as I nibble away at my wild salad from my newly crafted bowl, I can\u2019t help but contemplate the simple fulfilment that creating with nature can achieve: a reminder that some things really can\u2019t be connected to digitally.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by <a href=\"http://www.wildfal.co.uk/\">Wild Fal</a></em><a href=\"http://www.wildfal.co.uk/\"></a><em>.

  "<p>Coral reefs are probably Earth\u2019s most life-packed ecosystem; those who\u2019ve had the privilege of diving in the tropics know the reef as an orderly riot of colour and flow, size and shape. </p> <p>Which is why a white, dead reef is so shocking \u2013 as shocking in its way as a human corpse lying on the street, which still takes the form of the living breathing person it used to be, but now suddenly is stopped forever, the force that made it real suddenly and grotesquely absent.</p> <p>When a body falls on the street, the police come to investigate. Did this person die of natural causes, or was there foul play involved? When a reef dies, we ask the scientists. And this year they\u2019ve told us the answer in no uncertain terms.</p> <p>The amazingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/08/worlds-oceans-facing-biggest-coral-die-off-in-history-scientists-warn\">rapid die-off of a huge percentage of the world\u2019s coral reefs</a> is not a sad but normal tragedy; it\u2019s a crime. Perhaps the fastest, most widespread crime of the global warming era.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\">The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vast swaths of coral were bleached this spring, much of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/coral-bleaching-event-now-biggest-in-history-and-about-to-get-worse\">damage done in a matter of weeks</a> as a wave of warm water swept across the Pacific and west into the Indian Ocean. The immediate culprit was clear: the ongoing rise in global ocean temperatures that comes from climate change. But that\u2019s like saying \u201che was killed by a bullet\u201d. The important question is: who fired the gun?</p> <p>We know the biggest culprits now, because great detective work by investigative journalists has uncovered key facts in the past year. The world\u2019s biggest oil company, Exxon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/14/exxons-climate-lie-change-global-warming\">knew everything there was to know about climate change</a> by the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its scientists understood how much and how fast it was going to warm, and how much damage that was going to do. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding\">the company knew the scientists were right</a>: that\u2019s why they started \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d their own installations, for instance building their drilling rigs to accommodate the sea level rise they knew was coming.</p> <p>What they didn\u2019t do was tell the rest of us. Instead, they \u2013 and many other players in the fossil fuel industry \u2013 bankrolled the rise of the climate denial industry, helping fund the \u201cthinktanks\u201d and front groups that spent the last generation propagating the phoney idea that there was a deep debate about the reality of global warming. As a result, we\u2019ve wasted a quarter century in a phoney argument about whether the climate was changing.</p> <p>Had Exxon and its ilk merely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/28/imagine-if-exxon-had-told-the-truth-on-climate-change\">told the truth</a>, that argument would have been over: no one would have accused them of being \u201cclimate alarmists\u201d. We would have gone to work to solve the problem. Our work wouldn\u2019t be over by now, but it would be well advanced; the atmospheric level of CO2 wouldn\u2019t have topped 400 parts per million, and the temperature rise wouldn\u2019t be flirting with 1.5C. There would be coral bleaching, but there likely wouldn\u2019t be a coral massacre on the scale we\u2019ve seen this year.</p> <p>Which means that the victims should be angry as well as sad. The people who depend on the reefs for food, and for shelter from the waves; the economies <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/great-barrier-reef-tourists-will-go-elsewhere-if-bleaching-continues-poll\">that count on tourist dollars</a>; the people who take spiritual sustenance from the ongoing drama beneath the waves. The reefs can\u2019t be made whole again: if they recover at all it will be slowly, and in the face of ongoing warming that seems unlikely. But at the very least, the nations that sustained this damage should be compensated. Exxon and its brethren made record profits in the last decades of denial and deceit; that money should rightfully go to pay for the damage it caused, and to build the energy systems that can power our lives without destruction.</p> <p>We need to remember that there\u2019s nothing natural about this horror. It was caused, as so many crimes are, by greed. And that greed is ongoing \u2013 Exxon continues to search for more hydrocarbons, and to reject even modest changes to its policies.</p> <p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re wrapping crime scene tape this week around those bleached coral heads, those dead staghorns. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking crime scene photos with underwater cameras. That\u2019s why we\u2019re protesting on the reefs. We\u2019re not going to let them get away with murder.</p>",
  "<p>For a storyteller, the English public school is a&#xa0;generous gift. Like the ocean-locked ship or the medieval monastery, it presents the novelist with the kind of closed system that is ideal for testing hunches about the workings of human hearts. When traditions of how to think and behave have been established over centuries, there is a settled inevitability that things will keep on being done the way they\u2019ve always been done. Just by turning up to lessons, you\u2019re deepening the conspiracy.</p> <p>That\u2019s true of the teachers as much as the pupils. In poet Sean O\u2019Brien\u2019s second novel, Stephen Maxwell has recently retired from an unremarkable career teaching history at Blake\u2019s, \u201ca&#xa0;church in light disguise\u201d on the outskirts of a North Sea port. Ostensibly charged with writing the school\u2019s official history, his leisurely obsession is&#xa0;reconstructing the events of 40 years earlier, when the spirit of late-60s revolution unleashed monsters that had little to do with Paris or free love. It is a chronicle of deaths foretold, opening with the cadences of a confession.</p> <p>Blake\u2019s is the only home Stephen has ever had, its inmates his only family. Orphaned young, he is dumped there aged eight, into the care of the dependably charismatic teacher Carson. Stephen discovers girls, intellectual passions and the world beyond the school woods, and hones a talent for romance that belies his semi-monastic upbringing. Embarrassed at university by an affair with a don\u2019s wife, Stephen finds history repeating itself when, as a young teacher returning to the fold, he starts rattling the headboard with the spouse of the school\u2019s mysterious absent headmaster. With her \u201cferal nobility\u201d and age-defying good looks, Maggie is&#xa0;caught up, like everyone else in the&#xa0;novel, in&#xa0;the dealings of General Allingham, Yorkshire\u2019s answer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/19/oswald-mosley-blackshirts-uniform-1935\" title=\"\">Oswald Mosley</a>. An old-school fascist with an eye on a by-election seat, Allingham enlists the unscrupulous energies of Charles Rackham, another denizen of the Blake\u2019s staffroom. When Carson\u2019s body floats to the surface of the school pond, the trail of ex-Blakeans hurrying to investigate seems to extend up to the higher echelons of government. If you get the feeling that everyone in the novel is connected to Blake\u2019s, that\u2019s part of the stifling recursiveness that O\u2019Brien needs for his narrative.</p> <p>This is a bookish book. Within a few early pages, we\u2019ve had quotes from Larkin, Eliot, Hopkins, Dante and Stevenson. Even the villain, Rackham, is defined in terms of his qualities as a poet, which in his case are a mark of irredeemable moral affliction. Characters are individuated by what they like to read, and much of the action unfolds in libraries and bookshops. Pubs make for a welcome change of scene, and the funny banter between young Stephen and his buddy Smallbone contributes to the sort of intellectual slacker feel I enjoyed in O\u2019Brien\u2019s previous novel <em>Afterlife</em>. The dark shadow around Stephen\u2019s university exploits is dexterously handled, and gives the novel an emotional centre that is oddly lost amid all the killings. We are in the territory of Lindsay Anderson\u2019s <em>if\u2026</em>, but instead of an armed insurgence from the pupils, it is the masters who are manning the guns.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to manage this mix of violence and absurdity without occasionally straying into the Pythonesque. But having almost all of the characters connected to the school means that the plot can struggle to breathe, and the control of this oddly overdetermined narrative is not always entirely assured. Stephen is a strangely emotionless protagonist, even when horrors are unfolding. The author seems to be interested in a particular distillation of Englishness: \u201cbravery, endurance, an ironic obedience to necessary authority, a readiness to kill for the cause given half a chance\u201d. Where a nationality crystallises as an idea, there will inevitably be people who want to defend it and impose it on others. It\u2019s no comfort to learn from this subtle, compassionate, quietly outraged novel that English fascists in 1968 campaigned to join Europe. As Stephen traces the link between Rackham\u2019s petty English nastiness and his wartime dealings with those who would industrialise racial hatred, he reminds us how readily the&#xa0;conspiracy of the institution can become a refuge for the unspeakable. If&#xa0;the machinery of Blake\u2019s is inexhaustibly able to assimilate and forget, we can thank its fussy self-absorption, its isolation and what Arnold Bennett called a \u201cgrim passion for the status quo\u201d. Which are, of course, just the conditions you need for the rivers-of-blood rhetoricians to slouch into action.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Once Again Assembled Here</em> for \u00a312.29 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/once-again-assembled-here.htmlutm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<p>Insurance companies keep pretending that participating in the Affordable Care Act exchanges is killing their business model.

Premiums have long outpaced wage increases and underinsurance is rife even among those with insurance.<br></p> <p>So while staying wouldn\u2019t have drastically endangered their bottom lines, the decision may, however, cause uninsured Americans looking for Affordable Care Act coverage have even fewer subpar options to pick from. One <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/291615-aetna-departure-could-dry-up-obamacare-market-in-arizona-county\">county</a> in Arizona is slated to not have a single option available next year. These withdrawals could hurt Americans and the ACA in a way Republicans have only dreamed of.</p> <p>If business is booming, why penalize Americans seeking healthcare? The picture becomes clearer when looking at the state of the health insurance industry at large. In short: politics.</p> <p>The past few years have seen unprecedented consolidation between insurance companies as they\u2019ve merged and become behemoths. In an endless quest to have unlimited negotiating power, insurance companies big and small have been joining together. The big five \u2013 Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealthCare \u2013 now control a disproportionate chunk of the market. Most recently, Aetna and Humana announced a bid to merge, threatening to make the American health insurance market <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2014/2014-10-09-wellpoint-competition-health-insurance-market.page\">even more</a> uncompetitive. The justice department filed suit to block it. </p> <p>It\u2019s possible, then, that the mass withdrawal from ACA participation is a political chess move. Or, as Elizabeth Warren wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/posts/630223030473527\">Facebook post</a> last week: \u201cThe health of the American people should not be used as bargaining chips to force the government to bend to one giant company\u2019s will.\u201d </p> <p>Aetna and Humana\u2019s holdout from the exchanges is further evidence of just how important it is to hold them accountable, particularly since recent <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/Final-Risk-Pool-Analysis-8_11_16.pdf\">data</a> shows that the risk levels of patients enrolling in the exchanges was starting to slow. (One of the excuses companies used to walk away from the exchanges was that they didn\u2019t budget for the large percentage of sick Americans, rather than a mix of sick and well, who rushed to sign up when the ACA\u2019s ban on discriminating against pre-existing conditions went into effect.) Insurance companies aren\u2019t the only ones out to give Americans a raw deal: in an <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp1515769\">analysis</a> I published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, I detailed how an inability to negotiate prices effectively with pharmaceutical companies could bankrupt Medicare.</p> <p>But the fact is, insurance companies want to have their cake and eat it too. They love the ACA when enrolling young, low-risk people who would otherwise be penalized for not having insurance. But they want to deny care to patients who are actually sick and need the coverage. Watching their <a href=\"https://www.ispot.tv/share/7r8Z\">advertisements</a> on television, it is easy to be lulled into thinking that all health insurance companies care about is the health and wellness of ordinary Americans, but we\u2019re really just entries on an accounting sheet.</p> <p>These attempts to weaken the ACA need to be battled. An analysis I am in the process of publishing with my collaborator, Khurram Nasir, shows that the ACA reduced the number of uninsured Americans with heart disease by a fifth in just its first year of implementation. </p> <p>Healthcare is a responsibility shared by many \u2013 physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, government agencies and patients \u2013 but we need to make sure that the unabated, unbridled, corporate ambitions of insurance companies are kept in check.</p>",

For the first time, players can enter a version of the world explicitly changed by events, as the Cosmodrome becomes the Plaguelands. The Russian outpost where players of the first game start has been transformed by the arrival of mutated Fallen, twisted into new forms by the mysterious Siva technology which is at the heart of the game\u2019s plot. The wall has collapsed, the area has doubled in size, and there are Fallen everywhere. But for those who want to visit the Cosmodrome of yore, don\u2019t worry: it will still be accessible. Bungie aren\u2019t keen to remove content from the game just yet.</p> <p>The new strike, The Wretched Eye, offers a chance to see Siva up close. Demoed at Bungie\u2019s studios in Washington state, it takes players on a tour through the Plaguelands as they seek out and destroy Siva nodes, which the mutated Fallen are using to empower themselves. The ongoing battle between Fallen and Hive continues around you, as you dig deeper into the corrupted zone before arriving in a gigantic battlefield where you face off against a Fallen Kell \u2013 and the Hive Ogre that the Siva technology has enslaved.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fast-paced ride, and shows the Destiny team continuing to incorporate in the strikes some of the lessons learned from the best part of the game: the raids. The huge vaults in which the second half of the strike takes place are vertiginous, and place with verticality well enough to make the seemingly simple task of hunting out the Siva nodes (big glowing red things that you shoot) a tricky game of hide-and-seek. Meanwhile, the Ogre in the final battle is less \u201csecond enemy\u201d and more \u201cenvironmental hazard\u201d: it can\u2019t be damaged, requiring the fireteam of three to fall into loose roles for the fight, with one person drawing off the Ogre while the other two damage the main threat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c41489c06fa30c3b2b6167682b7206af32136a69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c41489c06fa30c3b2b6167682b7206af32136a69/0_18_1440_864/1000.png\" alt=\"A Siva node in the process of destruction.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Siva node in the process of destruction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bungie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, of course, even the best designed strike falls into the same routine as all the others; there\u2019s only so many times three people can shoot a massive alien in the head before it becomes rote. But at first glance, the Wretched Eye is more <a href=\"http://destiny.wikia.com/wiki/Sunless_Cell\">Sunless Cell</a> than <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/wikis/destiny/Dust_Palace\">Dust Palace</a>.</p> <p>One strike doesn\u2019t an expansion make, of course. The two new multiplayer arenas also shown by the team look \u2013 and play \u2013 nice enough, but it\u2019ll take a good deal more time than the hour and bit we were given before the real features become clear. Icarus, a Sony map exclusive set on Mercury, was visually impressive but felt like it was slightly out of balance, with most of the combat taking place in the wide arena outside, leaving half the map unused. Floating Gardens, a Vex outpost, played more coherently, but that might be because it was heavily reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/10/destiny-the-dark-below-should-players-stomach-the-cost\">The Dark Below</a>\u2019s Pantheon.</p> <p>Also added to the Crucible\u2019s line-up is a new mode: Supremacy. A twist on Rumble (Destiny\u2019s version of a death-match), Supremacy sees freshly killed players drop glowing engram-style tokens. Those tokens can be picked up by the opposing team \u2013 giving them a point \u2013 or by the defeated player\u2019s own team, denying the enemy the point for the kill. Its team version encourages players to stick together and move around the map in squads, while the free-for-all offers a neat twist on kill stealing from traditional death-matches: getting the last hit no longer matters if you can\u2019t make it to the token to secure the point. It also rewards close combat, as opposed to hanging at the back with a scout rifle and taking potshots at people\u2019s heads.</p> <p>There will be more strikes and crucible arenas coming, of course. Taken King, the last expansion of this size, launched with four strikes and eight arenas, so we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of the launch. Destiny is rapidly becoming the sort of huge game that you can fall into for weeks on end. That fact is not lost on Bungie, which will sells Destiny: The Collection, containing the base game and all four expansion packs, alongside the Rise of Iron, for just \u00a350 \u2013 the company is clearly hoping to pull in a few new players before it launches Destiny 2.</p> <p>But they won\u2019t be able to stroke the wolves. </p>",

Produced by Chris Whitworth with footage provided by Nekton</em></li> </ul> <p>Schizas is part of a new research mission that will, for the first time, provide a comprehensive health check of the deep oceans that future changes will be measured against. The consortium of scientists and divers, led by <a href=\"https://nektonmission.org/\">Nekton</a>, is backed by <a href=\"http://xlcatlin.com/\">XL Catlin</a>, which has already funded a <a href=\"http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/\">global analysis</a> of shallow water coral reefs. The new mission is looking far deeper \u2013 onwards of 150m down, further than most research that is restricted by the limits of scuba divers.</p> <p>We already know of some of the creatures of the deep \u2013 such as the translucent <a href=\"http://www.seawater.no/fauna/ctenophora/infundibulum.html\">northern comb jelly</a>, the faintly horrifying <a href=\"http://www.seasky.org/deep-sea/fangtooth.html\">fangtooth</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/in-defense-of-the-blobfish-why-the-worlds-ugliest-animal-isnt-as-ugly-as-you-think-it-is-6676336/\">widely derided blobfish</a> \u2013 where the pressure is up to 120 times greater than the surface. The deep sea was further illuminated during the film director James Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/?source=hp_dl1_dsc20120325\">cramped solo \u201cvertical torpedo\u201d dive</a> to the 11km deep Mariana trench in 2012.</p> <p>Yet only an estimated 0.0001% of the deep ocean has been explored. The Nekton researchers are discovering a whole web of life that could be unknown to science as they attempt to broaden this knowledge. The Guardian joined the mission vessel Baseline Explorer in its survey off the coast of Bermuda, where various corals, sponges and sea slugs have been hauled up from the deep.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time we look in the deep sea, we find a lot of new species,\u201d said Alex Rogers, an Oxford University biologist who has previously found a new species of lobster in the deep Indian Ocean and huge hydrothermal vents off Antarctica. </p> <p>In Bermuda, the scientists have found fossilised beaches \u2013 a remnant of the last ice age when sea levels were much lower \u2013 and large black coral forests that the locals were unaware of. \u201cThere are probably three or four new species of coral here, and some of the critters on the corals may be new too,\u201d Rogers said. </p> <p>Rogers is leading the scientific effort during a month-long survey of the three underwater volcanoes, known as seamounts, that lie near Bermuda \u2013 itself a volcano that pokes out of the north-west Atlantic. The Nekton mission, which will also include analysis of the deep sea off Nova Scotia, is recording indicators such as temperature, salinity, currents and discarded plastics.</p> <p>Mapping via sonar has also provided new data on previously unknown depths. Peer-reviewed research from the trips will be accelerated and available, it\u2019s hoped, by early next year. Nekton\u2019s next mission will be to explore the Mediterranean.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to a get a big-picture understanding because no one knows the state of the deep ocean,\u201d said Oliver Steeds, cofounder and mission director of Nekton. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to a point where the most important part of the planet is the least known, which isn\u2019t healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Steeds, a former journalist, said he was inspired by the \u201cYuri Gagarins of the deep sea\u201d \u2013 William Beebe and Otis Barton. During the early 1930s, the duo plunged into the depths in the \u201cBathysphere\u201d, essentially a hollow steel ball, after realising that submarines of the time were useless for viewing marine creatures. The bathysphere, lowered by steel cables from a ship, surveyed sites around Bermuda and descended beyond 3,000ft.</p> <p>The Nekton mission is a far cry from this. The Guardian squeezed into an extremely cosy <a href=\"http://www.tritonsubs.com/products-services/all-subs/t10002/\">two-person Triton submersible</a> lowered from the Baseline Explorer to survey the sloping face of a Bermuda seamount. The 2.5-tonne Triton vessel, comprised of a tough goldfish-bowl-like pod with ballast and thrusters that control movement, is a nimble craft initially aimed at wealthy super-yacht owners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/coral-bleaching-event-now-biggest-in-history-and-about-to-get-worse\">Coral bleaching event now biggest in history \u2013 and about to get worse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dragooned into the service of science, two Triton vessels \u2013 the Nemo and the Nomad \u2013 have been taking multiple dives down to 300m to assess this patch of the Atlantic. A mechanical grabbing arm picks up samples of sponge and coral, with tubes capturing water samples.</p> <p>The light blue of the surface turns a more navy hue as we descend further, with the sun becoming hazy as if it were obscured on a very smoggy day. The warmth disappears and the light fades the further you go \u2013 by 4,000m the temperature is a little above freezing and all is dark around. </p> <p>At 150m, however, it\u2019s still possible to see the enormous walls of the Bermuda volcano, formed more than 30m years ago and, even at this depth, dotted with life. Curly whip coral is strewn across the moon-like surface. Small fish flit across the surface. Depressingly, several lion fish, a voracious invasive species that has spread from Florida, can be seen. </p> <p>The experience is much like exploring another planet in a slightly claustrophobic air bubble. And given our lack of knowledge about the deep sea, the otherworldliness felt particularly apt. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44b04090f72ce599be3b3ec734c468de235d0b20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b04090f72ce599be3b3ec734c468de235d0b20/0_122_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coral bleaching on the Great Barrier reef, Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coral bleaching on the Great Barrier reef, Australia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Conlin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The state of the deep sea has been somewhat overshadowed by alarm at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/coral-bleaching-event-now-biggest-in-history-and-about-to-get-worse\">vast coral bleaching event</a>, which has decimated shallow water corals on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\">Great Barrier Reef</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/el-ni%C3%B1o-revs-coral-bleaching-threat-caribbean\">Caribbean</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/01/coral-bleaching-spreads-to-maldives-devastating-spectacular-reefs\">Maldives</a>. Schizas says the \u201chorrible\u201d bleaching, in which prolonged high temperatures cause corals to whiten and ultimately die, has spread to Honduras and could soon reach Bermuda \u2013 the far north limit of the coral zone in the Atlantic.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/environment-climate-change-records-broken-international-report\">warming seas</a> have also become riddled with more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/full-scale-plastic-worlds-oceans-revealed-first-time-pollution\">5tn pieces</a> of discarded plastic, which cause damage throughout the food chain and have inspired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/22/dutch-prototype-clean-up-boom-brings-pacific-plastics-solution-a-step-closer\">ambitious inventions</a> to clean up the huge patches of seaborne garbage.</p> <p>Visible problems near the surface can percolate downwards, given the dynamic nature of life that moves up and down the water column. While coral bleaching isn\u2019t an issue for deeper corals, the excess heat being sucked up by the ocean, as well as its increasing acidity, is altering the deep sea before we even know what we are changing.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is a significant problem because it affects the means of primary food production, so there is less food going to deep water,\u201d said Rogers. </p> <p>\u201cYou also start getting more zones without oxygen. This is a worry because the deep sea carries out important ecosystem services for us, such as food production, carbon sequestration, moderating the temperature of the planet and the gases around us. They do a number of critical things that are more or less invisible to the average person on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists are still thrashing out a theory about how coral, the building block for 25% of all marine life on the planet, is replenished. If, as thought, deep sea corals help spawn replacements for shallow water corals that bleach and die, then any deterioration of these hidden creatures could trigger even steeper declines than expected as bleaching events become more common. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/environment-climate-change-records-broken-international-report\">Environmental records shattered as climate change 'plays out before us'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Working this out will require ambitious scientific enquiry, something that has been sparse since the financial crash of 2008.

Norris says he \u201cwas looking for that light at the end of the tunnel after everything had been taken away.</p> <p>\u201cI had already seen that guy in a wheelchair who looked like me, and I figured we would have to have that conversation, but I didn\u2019t want to confront the real world.\u201d A few weeks later \u2013 prompted by his mother \u2013 Norris turned up at Velasquez\u2019s door as he was \u201cthrowing some beats\u201d on a drum machine. Instead of discussing their disabilities or their traumas, the two men started a conversation about the hip-hop business.</p> <p>Within a few months they launched 4 Wheel records, with Velasquez producing Norris as a solo artist. Following two albums, in 2006 Norris finished his degree at Lehman College and the pair started the non-profit 4 Wheel City. Their mission: \u201cguns down, four\u2019s up\u201d, illustrated by four fingers which stand for a pledge to \u201cinspire, educate, advocate, and entertain\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhere we come from, people don\u2019t talk things out \u2013 they shoot it out, they fight it out, and they end up in wheelchairs or dead,\u201d Norris said. \u201cThe problem is the mentality of young people in the community that I come from wanting to be tough. Back in the day it used to be bats or knives, but guns are so easily available. And if you have a gun it\u2019s like you\u2019re cool and you\u2019re bad.\u201d</p> <p>Velasquez feels a bit differently. \u201cI hate guns,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to get rid of all of them. But what are people using them for? They want to shoot somebody and they miss their target. That\u2019s what happened to me. I\u2019m sitting here, and I had nothing to do with guns.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbQ8YdVwakA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbQ8YdVwakA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>4 Wheel City</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Besides touring and making records, 4 Wheel City runs two core programs: Welcome 2 Reality, a school series in which Norris and Velasquez deliver motivational talks and rap montages to encourage teenagers to stay in school and away from guns; and Rap Therapy, which are inspirational and instructional hip-hop concerts at rehabilitation hospitals. </p> <p>\u201cI was immediately drawn to their talent and positive mission to use hip hop to spread awareness about gun violence and its relationship to disability \u2013 their unique perspective and musical talent was something I had never seen before,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/nyregion/how-victor-calise-disabilities-commissioner-spends-his-sundays.html\">Victor Calise</a>, the commissioner of New York City mayor Bill De Blasio\u2019s office for people with disabilities, who met the men at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital, where they had both received treatment. \u201cEspecially for people with disabilities, the members of 4-Wheel City show that when you work hard enough at your dreams, you can accomplish anything \u2013 no matter the restrictions and expectations society may impose on you.\u201d</p> <p>The men, assisted solely by Norris\u2019 cousin and sponsored by the New York City chapter of United Spinal Association, have nonetheless largely created their own success from rhyme to recording. \u201cNo one was coming to give us a record deal, so we decided to go out and do our own thing \u2013 be our own bosses,\u201d said Velasquez, the more muted point-man to Norris.</p> <p>Despite their challenges, the men are starting to reach their intended audience. Early successes included appearances at VH1\u2019s Hip Hop Honors Awards in 2006, nominations for an Underground Music award, a <a href=\"http://realeconomicimpact.tumblr.com/post/134865024135/hip-hop-duo-pushes-to-get-more-americans-with\">50 Unsung Heroes designation from the New York Daily News</a> and the opportunity to work with Snoop Dogg on a remix of Welcome to Reality. Still, as Velasquez points out, \u201cwe\u2019re the only act that has accomplished so much and not received a call from a record producer\u201d.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cI think most people look at us and don\u2019t believe two guys in wheelchairs can do what we do. You might see some musicians with disabilities, but it\u2019s not usually a black person. That\u2019s what I thought before I was in a wheelchair. But how can someone have a vision of something they\u2019ve never experienced before? So we just keep going and proving them wrong.\u201d</p> <p>As the sun bears down on Mott Street and a Chinese singer wraps up the afternoon with a traditional prosperity song, Velasquez and Norris gather their CDs and T-shirts and make their way up to the Access-A-Ride pickup point four blocks north. As Norris carries the plastic boxes in his lap and films the surroundings with a DSLR camera, Velasquez hitches a ride by grabbing the back handle of his partner\u2019s electric wheelchair. Along the way, the men stop, listen to their surroundings for inspiration and banter. </p> <p>\u201cI used to think that you do something and it will propel you to where you want to be in life \u2013 I hit those checkpoints and I\u2019ll win that Grammy,\u201d Norris said.</p> <p>\u201cNow we just work and don\u2019t look back,\u201d Velasquez adds. \u201cInstead of being, we just want to be doing.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/06/two-south-east-london-teenagers-murdered-knives-three-days\" title=\"\">teenagers</a> were stabbed to death in south-east London last week. The city has now witnessed 10 such deaths since January, while crime figures last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/20/metropolitan-police-say-knife-up-18-in-london\" title=\"\">showed an 18% rise</a> in knife offences. Despite the government\u2019s commitment following the riots of 2011 to end serious youth violence, with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/youth-violence-falls-in-areas-targeted-by-governments-ending-gangs-programme\" title=\"\">new funding directed towards 33 areas</a>, what these grim statistics indicate is that the current policies are not working. Some historical context can help us understand why.</p> <p>In 2002 I was commissioned by the Home Office and Metropolitan police to work in Lambeth, south London, to explore an explosive rise in street crime in the borough. The immediate crisis was a wave of muggings in which knives were routinely used, by young disadvantaged males, to separate victims from the mobile phones they were beginning to carry. This provoked other young people to start to carrying knives for protection. This is where the current problem began and when knife carrying began to be normalised among groups of young people in London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/16/zombie-knife-seller-urges-shoppers-buy-before-ban-hunters-knives-swords\">'Zombie knife' seller urges shoppers to buy before ban takes effect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With my colleague Dan Silverstone I began to examine the culture of the febrile, subterranean street world in which knives were being used. What we found were people living precarious, makeshift day-to-day lives, many of whom eked out a living in the burgeoning drug economy. Many spoke of themselves as being \u201con-road\u201d.</p> <p>In this world, weapon use was terrifyingly normalised and violence could erupt due to a variety of motives. Knives were often carried as a protective measure, to ward off muggers or gangsters intent on seizing the assets of street-level drug dealers.</p> <p>But while self-defence was often the initial reason behind people carrying knives, situations often arose that led to them being used for more offensive purposes. Often the violence was not pre-planned. Someone might look at you the wrong way and such disrespect would lead to knives being used. With many people territorially affiliated, being caught in the wrong territory could also lead to weapon use. In a world where \u201cbeef\u201d could break out over trivial issues and where there is widespread distrust of law enforcement, knives could be used to dispense \u201cjustice\u201d. Often such conflicts took the form of vendettas, in which violence begets violence. As we know from too many tragic cases, bystanders and other third parties could be caught in the crossfire.</p> <p>This hyper-violent street culture is not confined to the capital and reproduces itself in poor, multiply deprived areas of our inner cities; predominantly among young men locked into a highly precarious existence.</p> <p>Unfortunately, in a society where upward social mobility for the urban poor is desperately limited, and where many young men churn between low-paid work and what has now become a coercive workfare system designed to fail them, this street world is not so much a destination they choose but one into which they find themselves decanted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/15/as-gang-violence-rises-again-drugs-legislation-screaming-out-for-reform\">As gang violence rises again, drug legislation is screaming out for reform | Deborah Orr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ending such violence is incredibly difficult in a society where poverty and its consequences are rarely spoken about and where disadvantage is considered by many to be a self-inflicted condition. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/zombie-knife-sellers-face-jail-as-ban-comes-into-force\" title=\"\">the ban on \u201czombie knives\u201d</a> that came into force this week is certainly justified, any expectation that this will curtail the implosive violence of the street is likely to be misplaced.</p> <p>Could more stop and searches make a difference? Only if they are better targeted and less indiscriminate. Can they be made so? I\u2019m not optimistic. More imprisonment? We\u2019ve tried that and it\u2019s not working. While gangs are certainly part of the problem, the situations in which knives are used extend beyond gang violence. Given this, making gang suppression the key policy response to serious youth violence in the wake of the 2011 riots \u2013 which were not caused by gangs \u2013 was to miss the bigger picture.</p> <p>There are many innovative projects undertaken by dedicated practitioners designed to persuade young people against knife crime. But unless these are supplemented by a comprehensive programme of urban renewal, the problem of knife-related violence will unfortunately continue.</p>",

Others want to know but are dissuaded by their loved ones. \u201cWhen you mention dying, you stop fighting,\u201d one woman admonished her husband. The case of a young patient is seared in my mind. Days before her death, she pleaded with me to tell the truth because she was slowly becoming confused and her religious family had kept her in the dark. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re dying,\u201d I began, as I held her hand. But just then, her husband marched in and having heard the exchange, was furious that I\u2019d extinguish her hope at a critical time. As she apologised with her eyes, he shouted at me and sent me out of the room, then forcibly took her home.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUBoHrBAsWQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vUBoHrBAsWQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Metastasis: essential facts about cancer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s no wonder that there is reluctance on the part of patients and doctors to discuss prognosis but there is evidence that truthful, sensitive communication and where needed, a discussion about mortality, enables patients to take charge of their healthcare decisions, plan their affairs and steer away from unnecessarily aggressive therapies. Contrary to popular fears, patients attest that awareness of dying does not lead to greater sadness, anxiety or depression. It also does not hasten death. There is evidence that in the aftermath of death, bereaved family members report less anxiety and depression if they were included in conversations about dying. By and large, honesty does seem the best policy.</p> <p>Studies worryingly show that a majority of patients are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/the-news-isnt-good-doctors-patients-and-the-confronting-conversation-about-terminal-cancer\">unaware of a terminal prognosis</a>, either because they have not been told or because they have misunderstood the information. Somewhat disappointingly, oncologists who communicate honestly about a poor prognosis may be less well liked by their patient. But when we gloss over prognosis, it\u2019s understandably even more difficult to tread close to the issue of just how one might die.</p> <p>Thanks to advances in medicine, many cancer patients don\u2019t die and the figures keep improving. Two thirds of patients diagnosed with cancer in the rich world today <a href=\"http://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/breast-cancer/news/online/%7B68c032a9-a6a3-459e-8034-3088827269e6%7D/two-thirds-of-patients-with-invasive-cancer-likely-to-survive-5-years\">will survive five years</a> and those who reach the five-year mark will improve their odds for the next five, and so on. But cancer is really many different diseases that behave in very different ways. Some cancers, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/breast-cancer\">colon cancer</a>, when detected early, are curable. Early breast cancer is highly curable but can recur decades later. Metastatic prostate cancer, kidney cancer and melanoma, which until recently had dismal treatment options, are now being tackled with increasingly promising therapies that are yielding unprecedented survival times.</p> <p>But the sobering truth is that advanced cancer is incurable and although modern treatments can control symptoms and prolong survival, they cannot prolong life indefinitely. This is why I think it\u2019s important for anyone who wants to know, how cancer patients actually die.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cac3f2daf54c53d300026664afab216aef101b31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cac3f2daf54c53d300026664afab216aef101b31/0_53_3721_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cancer cells\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Cancer cells release a plethora of chemicals that inhibit appetite and affect the digestion and absorption of food\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phanie / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFailure to thrive\u201d is a broad term for a number of developments in end-stage cancer that basically lead to someone slowing down in a stepwise deterioration until death. Cancer is caused by an uninhibited growth of previously normal cells that expertly evade the body\u2019s usual defences to spread, or metastasise, to other parts. When cancer affects a vital organ, its function is impaired and the impairment can result in death. The liver and kidneys eliminate toxins and maintain normal physiology \u2013 they\u2019re normally organs of great reserve so when they fail, death is imminent.</p> <p>Cancer cells release a plethora of chemicals that inhibit appetite and affect the digestion and absorption of food, leading to progressive weight loss and hence, profound weakness. Dehydration is not uncommon, due to distaste for fluids or an inability to swallow. The lack of nutrition, hydration and activity causes rapid loss of muscle mass and weakness. Metastases to the lung are common and can cause distressing shortness of breath \u2013 it\u2019s important to understand that the lungs (or other organs) don\u2019t stop working altogether, but performing under great stress exhausts them. It\u2019s like constantly pushing uphill against a heavy weight.</p> <p>Cancer patients can also die from uncontrolled infection that overwhelms the body\u2019s usual resources. Having cancer impairs immunity and recent chemotherapy compounds the problem by suppressing the bone marrow. The bone marrow can be considered the factory where blood cells are produced \u2013 its function may be impaired by chemotherapy or infiltration by cancer cells.Death can occur due to a severe infection. Pre-existing liver impairment or kidney failure due to dehydration can make antibiotic choice difficult, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/may/12/i-am-dying-want-talk-family-carer-doctors-death\">I am dying and I want everyone to talk about it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You may notice that patients with cancer involving their brain look particularly unwell. Most cancers in the brain come from elsewhere, such as the breast, lung and kidney. Brain metastases exert their influence in a few ways \u2013 by causing seizures, paralysis, bleeding or behavioural disturbance. Patients affected by brain metastases can become fatigued and uninterested and rapidly grow frail. Swelling in the brain can lead to progressive loss of consciousness and death.</p> <p>In some cancers, such as that of the prostate, breast and lung, bone metastases or biochemical changes can give rise to dangerously high levels of calcium, which causes reduced consciousness and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/07/waiting-list-effects-kidney-failure\">renal failure</a>, leading to death.</p> <p>Uncontrolled bleeding, cardiac arrest or respiratory failure due to a large blood clot happen \u2013 but contrary to popular belief, sudden and catastrophic death in cancer is rare. And of course, even patients with advanced cancer can succumb to a heart attack or stroke, common non-cancer causes of mortality in the general community.</p> <p>You may have heard of the so-called \u201cdouble effect\u201d of giving strong medications such as morphine for cancer pain, fearing that the escalation of the drug levels hastens death. But experts say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/09/opioid-addiction-appalachia-tennessee\">opioids</a> are vital to relieving suffering and that they typically don\u2019t shorten an already limited life.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to appreciate that death can happen in a few ways, so I wanted to touch on the important topic of what healthcare professionals can do to ease the process of dying.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lhGpfWb0eM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6lhGpfWb0eM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Palliative care at home</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In places where good palliative care is embedded, its value cannot be overestimated. Palliative care teams provide expert assistance with the management of physical symptoms and psychological distress. They can address thorny questions, counsel anxious family members, and help patients record a legacy, in written or digital form. They normalise grief and help bring perspective at a challenging time.</p> <p>People who are new to palliative care are commonly apprehensive that they will miss out on effective cancer management but there is very good evidence that palliative care improves psychological wellbeing, quality of life, and in some cases, life expectancy. Palliative care is a relative newcomer to medicine, so you may find yourself living in an area where a formal service doesn\u2019t exist, but there may be local doctors and allied health workers trained in aspects of providing it, so do be sure to ask around.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s your life and your death: you are entitled to an honest opinion, ongoing conversation, and compassionate care</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Finally, a word about how to ask your oncologist about prognosis and in turn, how you will die. What you should know is that in many places, training in this delicate area of communication is woefully inadequate and your doctor may feel uncomfortable discussing the subject. But this should not prevent any doctor from trying \u2013 or at least referring you to someone who can help.</p> <p>Accurate prognostication is difficult, but you should expect an estimation in terms of weeks, months, or years. When it comes to asking the most difficult questions, don\u2019t expect the oncologist to read between the lines. It\u2019s your life and your death: you are entitled to an honest opinion, ongoing conversation and compassionate care which, by the way, can come from any number of people including nurses, social workers, family doctors, chaplains and, of course, those who are close to you.</p> <p>Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Epicurus observed that the art of living well and the art of dying well were one. More recently, Oliver Sacks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/oliver-sacks-on-learning-he-has-terminal-cancer.html?_r=0\">reminded us</a> of this tenet as he was dying from metastatic melanoma. If die we must, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of the part we can play in ensuring a death that is peaceful.</p>",

She seemed relieved as much as excited; she had looked close to throwing up earlier when officials were dithering over whether to disqualify Kenny after his derny-passing transgression.</p> <p>Kenny insisted the right decision had been made. \u201cUsually when they shoot the gun it means someone has got disqualified and I know it was really tight between me and Awang, and Eilers wasn\u2019t far behind.

  "<p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/octopuses-squid-cuttlefish-warming-oceans-climate-change\">apparent rise in the numbers of some cephalopod species</a> and perhaps with a disdain for human governance systems, many people are expressing their enthusiasm for <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-insect-overlords\">welcoming our new cephalopod overlords</a>. If we are to toil under our new suckered rulers, it may be prudent to examine where they came from, especially the octopuses who will likely make up the ruling class in the new mantled hierarchy. </p> <p>Living cephalopods include roughly 1000 species of octopuses, cuttlefish, nautiluses and various distinct groups of \u201csquid\u201d; ram\u2019s horn squid, bobtail squid, bottletail squid, teuthidian squid and the not-even-a-squid vampire squid. </p> <p>Cephalopods are molluscs, and weird ones at that when compared to the other mollusc groups: chitons, solenogastres, caudofoveatans, bivalves, scaphopods, gastropods and monoplacophorans. With the exception of nautiluses, living cephalopods lack an external shell. They are free-living active hunters, possess a well-developed brain and nervous system in addition to a famed reputation for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/oct/26/paul-octopus-predict-own-death\">predicting the outcome of sporting events</a>. Their intelligence has earned them a level of protection under <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://cephalove.southernfriedscience.com/?p=626\">EU law as \u201chonorary vertebrates\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Just as cephalopods are weird molluscs, octopuses are likewise weird cephalopods. With the exception of the beak, small rod-like shells in some species and a toothed radula, they lack hard parts like the cuttlebone and guard found in cuttlefish and squid respectively. Despite what popular culture may have you believe, octopuses do not have tentacles (tentacles are appendages in addition to the eight arms that only have suckers at the tips). Their bodies are gelatinous and are famously versatile, allowing them to change in colour, texture and overall shape, making identification of living octopuses from morphology alone very difficult.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/jan/29/the-secret-colourful-and-dramatic-lives-of-octopuses-uncovered-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4g8kk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2447084\"            data-video-name=\"The secret, colourful and dramatic lives of octopuses uncovered \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Peter Godfrey-Smith\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/29/1454025759937/KP_1534294_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56aaac2ee4b02808d5f289fe\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/29/1454025759937/KP_1534294_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/01/29/160129octopus_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/01/29/160129octopus_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/01/29/160129octopus.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/01/29/160129octopus_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/01/29/160129octopus_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>A small demonstration of how quickly octopuses can change shape, size and colour in the gloomy octopus <em>Octopus tetricus</em>. Source: Peter Godfrey-Smith</figcaption> </figure>   <p>So where did octopuses come from? How do they fit in with the rest of the cephalopods?</p> <p>Cephalopods have a long fossil record, the earliest certain cephalopod fossils are loosely coiled or straight shelled nautiloids found in the Cambrian of China 515 million years ago. It is hypothesised that all other cephalopods diverged from these ancestors. Nautilidan cephalopods, represented today by the six living species of nautilus are thought to have diverged from other nautiloids in the Devonian period. Around the same time as this split, geologically speaking, the straight-shelled cephalopods <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactritida\">Bactritida </a>diverged. Bactritidans are thought to be the ancestors of the ammonites, goniatites, ceratites, belemnites and all of today\u2019s major groups.</p> <p>Surprisingly, however, the palaeontology textbooks are silent when it comes to the appearance and evolution of the octopuses. My undergraduate text book, Invertebrate Palaeontology and Evolution by E.N.K Clarkson, only mentions octopuses in passing. <em>The</em> work on invertebrate palaeontology, the 50 volume series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Invertebrate_Paleontology\">Treatise on Invertebrate Palaeontology</a> <em> </em>started in 1953, still doesn\u2019t have a complete octopus section. This is because fossils of soft-bodied octopuses are incredibly rare. So rare are octopus fossils that one of the few people to write an accessible history of fossil octopuses, Phil Eyden, suggested in 2004 that the entire fossil record of octopuses would fit inside a suitcase. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In almost three hundred million years of octopod existence ... our entire record would fit inside a suitcase!</p> <footer> <cite>Phil Eyden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The oldest fossil octopus at 300 million years old is <em>Pohlsepia mazonensis </em>from Carboniferous Mazon Creek fossil beds in Illinois. Frustratingly, the only known specimen resembles modern octopuses with the exception of possessing eight arms and two tentacles (Kluessendorf and Doyle 2000). Until the discovery of this specimen, the oldest octopus fossils were from the Jurassic period. The discovery of a much older octopus with many features of modern octopuses indicates that they have an even longer history, albeit one that is fossil poor.</p> <p>From this isolated data point, the presence of tentacles in this specimen could mean that this was the ancestral state of the group (all octopuses derived from ancestors with tentacles). Alternatively, tentacles were lost or evolved multiple times in the group. </p> <p>The second oldest species is <em>Proteroctopus ribeti </em>a single specimen from the Jurassic of France was published in 1982. This specimen does not possess tentacles but does have clear fins leading to speculation that it may be related to deep sea species such as today\u2019s dumbo octopuses or alternatively, this is a member of the vampire squid group, Vampyromorphida.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7392cccfb32a1033b217296aada240a36d98e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7392cccfb32a1033b217296aada240a36d98e79/0_312_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Living dumbo octopus Grimpoteuthis sp. with fins as the would be elephant ears.

These three species are differentiated by the position and shape of paired \u2018gladial vestiges\u2019 supposed to be vestigial remnants of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladius_(cephalopod)\">gladius</a> found in modern squids and which may have supported fins found in modern groups. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Fossil_Sites/Lebanese-Lagerstatt/Paleoctopus-newboldi/Paleoctopus.htm\"><em>Palaeoctopus newboldi</em></a><em> </em>from the same region in Lebanon was described in 1896, the first fossil octopus discovered, and slightly younger in geological age than the aforementioned Lebanese species. <em>Palaeoctopus </em><em>newboldi</em> is known from a number of specimens and was thought to be ancestral to modern octopuses until the 2009 Lebanese specimens showed there was already a diversity of octopus forms in the Cretaceous. A second species, <em>Palaeoctopus pelagicus</em> is known from a single gladius vestige from Mexico (Fuchs et al. 2008). </p> <p>Only one other genus of octopuses is known, two species of <em>Paleocirroteuthis </em>from the Upper Cretaceous of Canada and Japan have been described from fossil jaws alone (Tanabe et al. 2008). </p> <p>This material, alongside a few ambigious remains which defy classification and some tricky egg case trace fossils thought to made by extinct argonauts is the sum total of the palaeontological evidence of these groups. </p> <p>Returning to the original questions about where octopuses came from, this is one group where, to date, the fossil record raises more questions than it does provide answers. It\u2019s possible to dig through the (mostly freely accessible) entire literature in a day and be as informed as the experts. </p> <p>For groups of organisms like these, the lack of our knowledge about their evolutionary histories can be as interesting as what we do know about them from less than a suitcase full of fossils. At the borders of scientific knowledge, that\u2019s where the fun (educated) speculation has a part to play. Are octopuses distinct cephalopods or a weird kind of squid? What events in the past caused the extinction of most externally shelled cephalopods but lead to the modern diversity of squishier animals? Lastly, if we\u2019re not happy with life under the new cephalopod overlords, what tools might we use to bring them down? </p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p>Eyden, P. 2004 (2010) Fossil Octopuses. <em>The Octopus News Magazine Online</em> <a href=\"https://www.tonmo.com/pages/fossil-octopuses/\">https://www.tonmo.com/pages/fossil-octopuses/</a> Accessed 10/08/2016</p> <p>Fuchs, D., Bracchi, G. and Wies, R. 2009.

  "<p>In many trusts, the only way to find out something like how long people are waiting in accident and emergency is to phone the department and ask. \u201cThere are not many people at any one time who know what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Marc Farr, director of information at East Kent hospitals university NHS foundation trust. \u201cA hospital has lots of people phoning people all day for information,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>The trust has ended the need for such phone calls.

As well as informing the public, the business intelligence system helps the trust know when to redirect emergency patients to manage demand.</p> <p>Farr tells of one situation where they arranged for ambulances to be diverted from one hospital. For six hours, some ambulances that would normally have used Margate\u2019s Queen Mother hospital went to Kent and Canterbury hospital. \u201cYou need that type of data and those types of predictions to make those kinds of decisions,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jun/20/nhs-strong-dose-tech-investment\">The NHS needs a strong dose of tech investment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chris Dodgson, head of information for the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch hospitals NHS foundation trust, says that real-time information also helps meet the target for 95% of patients to be seen by emergency departments within four hours. This is often affected by other wards being full, preventing patients being moved on from an emergency bed. \u201cYou want to know roughly where your blockages are, and this is where real-time information really helps to unpick those questions.\u201d</p> <p>East Kent shares data with external organisations, including a nursing agency which it pays to support those leaving hospital to return home. \u201cHaving a data flow between us prompts us to discharge patients more quickly ...\u201d, Farr says. \u201cHaving a mobile, real-time view of how many patients they can take at any one time is really helpful.\u201d </p> <p>East Kent sells the information-sharing systems it has developed through Beautiful Information, a company jointly owned by the trust, Farr \u2013 its founder \u2013 and other individuals. Its customers in the NHS and private healthcare sectors access up-to-date data on areas such as bed usage, finance and the workforce through online systems including a smartphone app.</p> <p>Providing data through smartphones means managers can react quickly, but small screens require clear and simple presentation. The information dashboards use the common traffic light code, with green indicating few problems, amber some and red a serious situation.</p> <p>However, it also offers black for the worst cases and blue for measures that continually meet targets, meaning \u201cyou don\u2019t need to keep checking up on these people,\u201d according to Farr. Users of the system can set their own thresholds for each colour code, which he says is important in getting them to trust its warnings.</p> <p>Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch, which is working on developing its own data visualisations, uses business intelligence to monitor its progress on treating strokes. The Royal College of Physicians works out a grade for hospitals based on more than 50 clinical measures every four months. The trust puts the same data into the same formula to calculate the grade as often as clinicians want to check it, allowing them to redesign the service and see improvements far faster. \u201cThe impact of that over the last few months is that if you plot our scores we\u2019ve gone from being at the lower end up to the very top end,\u201d says Dodgson.</p> <p>The trust has just installed a Microsoft SQL 2016 data warehouse to improve its work in this area. In his previous job at Salisbury NHS foundation trust, Dodgson established a business intelligence system that greatly speeded flows of information. Demand on beds varied significantly throughout the year, so Dodgson and colleagues used three years of data to predict availability for each week. As a result, more staff were placed on-call for the weekend after New Year\u2019s Eve: \u201cIt was a really busy weekend,\u201d he says, adding that by publishing what actually happened as well as predictions, staff gained confidence in the accuracy of the forecasts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jul/19/caredata-closure-bad-news-nhs-society-data-sharing\">Why the closure of care.data is bad news for the NHS and society</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dodgson says business intelligence can be hit by poor-quality information if staff do not have the time to collect it.

It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially for the sake of those living in the affected communities,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>\u201cThe main victims of these riots are law-abiding African American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It\u2019s their job, it\u2019s their homes, it\u2019s their schools and communities which will suffer the most as a result.\u201d</p> <p>Trump said he was asking for \u201cthe vote of every African American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democratic party has failed and betrayed the African American community.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-in-fourth-place-among-black-voters/\">Recent analysis</a> has indicated that Trump is polling at around 2% with the African American electorate \u2013 worse than almost every Republican candidate since 1948 \u2013 and is even behind the Green party nominee, Jill Stein, and libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, placing him fourth overall among black voters. </p> <p>Party insiders have<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters.html?_r=0\"> begun urging their nominee to increase his outreach</a> in African American communities nationwide. He has done little to court the demographic, most recently rejecting invitations to speak at the annual conventions of the <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/07/13/Donald-Trump-rejects-offer-to-speak-to-NAACP/8751468393067/\">NAACP</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/blog/journal-isms/donald-trump-campaign-turns-down-nabjnahj/\">National Association of Black Journalists</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s rally on Tuesday evening had been scheduled before unrest broke out in Milwaukee but he seized on the opportunity to accuse his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, of being \u201cagainst the police\u201d and suggested she and other Democrats were directly responsible for rioting in the city and others around America.</p> <p>\u201cThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society \u2013 a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent \u2013 share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within our country,\u201d Trump said in a speech that was delivered using a teleprompter.</p> <p>The billionaire accused Clinton of preferring to \u201cprotect the offender [rather] than the victim\u201d, suggested that \u201ca vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunities\u201d. He argued that African Americans had been \u201churt worst\u201d by Clinton\u2019s immigration policy.</p> <p>Trump reiterated claims first made<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\"> during his acceptance speech at the Republican national convention in July</a>, suggesting that \u201claw and order must be restored\u201d amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">rising homicide rates in America\u2019s largest 50 cities</a>. Despite this recent rise the rate of violent crime <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/dueling-claims-on-crime-trend/\">has in fact declined to historic lows</a> under the Obama administration.</p> <p>The Republican, who had earlier spent time meeting privately with law enforcement leaders in Milwaukee, proposed introducing more police into communities, appointing \u201cthe best\u201d prosecutors and judges and pursuing \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of federal laws.</p> <p>This combative approach, nakedly opposed to the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as Clinton herself, is perhaps unlikely to draw many more black supporters. The protest movement, which rose to prominence after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, enjoys 65% support among African Americans, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/08/how-americans-view-the-black-lives-matter-movement/\">according to recent polling</a>; while a survey published in 2015 indicated that Americans\u2019 support for police <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183704/confidence-police-lowest-years.aspx\">was at a 22-year low</a> and especially weakened among the African American population.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s appeals to African American voters received a lukewarm response inside the Washington County Fair Conference Center on Tuesday evening. Many attendees stayed silent throughout much of speech, with some growing visibly bored. The confederate battle flag, to many a lasting symbol of America\u2019s slave-owning history, was on sale outside of the rally.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to a dozen rally attendees, all of whom were white, and all of whom lived within a 40-mile radius of the unrest in Milwaukee. Most expressed little if any sympathy for black residents of the city, one of America\u2019s most racially segregated metropolitan areas.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way they (black people) are in that city,\u201d said Ken Schladweiler, a 61-year-old from the small rural town of Neosho. \u201cAll of that (unrest connected to Smith\u2019s death) was just a case so they could riot, loot buildings. They have no jobs. They\u2019re all on welfare. There are murders down there almost every night. That\u2019s just the way they are.\u201d</p> <p>His wife, Nancie, 62, agreed: \u201cAfter all this crap (unrest) happened, I went to work Monday and thought: don\u2019t they (black people) have work? They\u2019re just out there shooting people, blowing up buildings. Don\u2019t they have work?\u201d</p> <p>Julie Wanie, a 50-year-old healthcare professional who works in Milwaukee, said she simply didn\u2019t visit the Sherman Park neighborhood at all.</p> <p>\u201cI know it quite well. I know it enough to stay out of that area. Anybody that lives around here and goes to Milwaukee just knows that\u2019s a certain area you stay out of.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what she thought may have contributed to the rising tensions in the neighbourhood, Wanie replied: \u201cI think Obama has done a lot to incite race wars.\u201d</p> <p>In an earlier interview with Fox News, Trump had indicated he believed the shooting of Smith on Saturday was a justified response by law enforcement despite no body camera footage of the incident being released.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 The gun was pointed at his (a police officer\u2019s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That\u2019s what the narrative is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not true. If it is true, people shouldn\u2019t be rioting.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump\u2019s hardline law and order stance enjoys support among certain sectors of conservative law enforcement, he has also been criticised by a growing number of progressive reformists.</p> <p>Just hours before Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday, Ronal Serpas, the former New Orleans police chief and chairman of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, issued a pre-emptive statement urging the Republican candidate to drop unfounded claims of a surge in crime.</p> <p>\u201cNow more than ever it\u2019s important to have level-headed conversations about crime and the vital relationship between law enforcement and the communities we serve. Mr Trump\u2019s recent claims that our country is experiencing a crime wave are highly misleading,\u201d Serpas said.</p>",

  "<p>Laura Trott became the first woman in British history to win four Olympic gold medals and it took her only four events across two Games to do so. The 24-year-old was triumphant in the omnium, adding to the Rio gold she had already won in the women\u2019s team pursuit in defending the titles.</p> <p>She led going into the final test of the multidiscipline event, the sometimes baffling blur of bewilderment that is the points race, and was never challenged. On a night that will be largely remembered for the record-breaking success of Trott and her fiance Jason Kenny, their team-mates Becky James and Katy Marchant had to settle for the role of proud footnotes. In time they will hog the limelight but they settled for silver and bronze respectively in the women\u2019s individual sprint here. Germany\u2019s Kristina Vogel beat the British duo in successive knockout rounds to win gold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/jason-kenny-wins-dramatic-keirin-for-sixth-olympic-gold\">Jason Kenny takes sixth gold medal in dramatic keirin win in Rio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo do what I did in London and to come here and do it again, honestly I cannot believe it,\u201d Trott said. \u201cWhen you see people who I idolise backing up in successive Olympics, like Sir Chris Hoy and my fiance Jason, I wondered how on earth these people do it. So for me to be able to come here and do it just makes me feel so proud.\u201d</p> <p>With so many points on offer in the final race, victory was by no means a foregone conclusion. And yet somehow it was. Trott\u2019s performance over two days was masterful, and she is far too savvy to have blown such a big lead at the final hurdle. Her American rival, Sarah Hammer, claimed silver ahead of the Belgian Jolien D\u2019Hoore.</p> <p>\u201cYou go through ups and downs,\u201d said Trott. \u201cAnd I know the next three years are going to be just as hard as after London. You step up to the world championships the year after and you\u2019re back to your non-Olympic kit and equipment and you get your feet slammed back on the ground, I guess. It\u2019s a lot of hard work and I think people often forget that because Great Britain win a load of gold medals and they think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s easy.\u2019 It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s so hard and so stressful, and right now the thought of doing it all again freaks the hell out of me. But it\u2019s something that I would like to take on, the idea of winning six gold medals. I\u2019m just going to enjoy the moment for now.\u201d</p> <p>This much we knew already: Trott hails from Cheshunt in Hertfordshire. She suffers from a stomach condition that occasionally causes her to throw up following races and training. She lives in Cheshire with her fellow gold miner and several dogs. She loves the music of Bruce Springsteen and <em>really</em> loves the lactic burn that comes from racing. She once nearly started a house fire while attempting to bake a potato. She won her first race and its \u00a32 purse at the age of eight. She thinks she might once have seen her grandmother\u2019s ghost sitting in a chair.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/16/jason-kenny-takes-historic-gold-in-mens-keirin-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5v568\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2661020\"            data-video-name=\"Trott, James and Kenny enjoy glorious night at the velodrome \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b38f96e4b0178756b5d546\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/17/trackwrap_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/17/trackwrap.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/17/trackwrap_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/16/jason-kenny-takes-historic-gold-in-mens-keirin-video\">Trott, James and Kenny enjoy glorious night at the velodrome</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>We know all this because it was she who told us. An interviewer\u2019s dream, she is prone to the kind of self-deprecating, joke-littered babble that makes for great copy. But there is also a serious, steely side: she is not inclined to suffer fools and as much as anything else \u2013 the Boss, the boyfriend, the burn \u2013 she just really loves riding her bicycle.</p> <p>\u201cI was so nervous before the start of the points race,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that countries like Holland and Belgium might gang up on me, because obviously if Jolien took a lap then she\u2019d be right up there with me. So I was a little bit nervous that they might attack me like you wouldn\u2019t believe, but I felt in control and I felt strong out there. I\u2019ve done so much hard work for the points race.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/british-cycling-head-coach-hits-back-rivals\">Team GB cycling head coach hits back at rivals questioning Olympic success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After three events she had slept soundly, having taken 128 points out of 130 available. Second in the scratch race, first in the individual pursuit and the elimination race. A frantic affair of cycling fits and starts, Trott dominates The Devil Takes the Hindmost to such an extent that one could be forgiven for presuming it is not the movements of rivals she analyses through that perspex visor, but a torrential matrix-style downpour of green digital rain.</p> <p>By lunchtime on day two, she was further ahead after the time trial. Returning for the afternoon session, she sat where she always sits: headphones on in the same corner of the Team GB cabin, next door to the Aussies. Her victory in the flying lap was peerless, putting her into an incredibly commanding position going into the final race. At 100 laps of 250 metres each, it was quite the victory parade. At its conclusion she was overcome with the emotion of it all and broke down in floods of tears.</p> <p>Before these Games, Trott joked that she hoped Kenny would win three gold medals and earn a knighthood, so that she would become ennobled through marriage. Despite his impressive hat-trick, it is fair to say she looks a certainty to blow through Buckingham Palace under her own steam.</p> <p>\u201cIt just seems mad to me, honestly,\u201d she said. \u201cThings like that obviously come with winning gold medals, I get that. But I just feel like that eight-year-old that started cycling because she absolutely loved it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The frenetic, isolating nature of city life can be a day-to-day struggle for millions of people. An environmental cocktail of densely packed streets and homes, cramped and lengthy commutes and noise pollution as well as significant pockets of poverty and deprivation can take their toll. As a result, mental ill health and urban life are inextricably linked.</p> <p>With urban areas expected to house two-thirds of the world\u2019s population by 2050 and some cities, such as in China, undergoing <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/happiness-and-health-in-china-the-paradox-of-progress/#https://www.brookings.edu/research/happiness-and-health-in-china-the-paradox-of-progress/\">unprecedented expansion</a>, the relationship between urban environments and mental health \u2013 and what to do about it \u2013 is rapidly coming to the fore. </p> <p>\u201cPublic health is an important component of the built environment, but all too often this focuses only on physical health,\u201d says Layla McCay, founder and director of the <a href=\"http://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com/#http://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com\">Centre for Urban Development and Mental Health</a>. The thinktank was set up in 2015 to bring together researchers, policymakers and planners across the globe to push for urban space designs that create mentally healthier cities.<br></p> <h2>Projects paving the way</h2> <p>A well-designed urban space can have a positive influence on people\u2019s wellbeing and help prevent mental health problems developing or becoming worse, according to McCay.</p> <p>\u201cMental health plays a huge role in the overall burden of disease around the entire world,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s prevalent in every country. The statistics do tell us that people who live in cities have a 40% increased risk of depression, a 20% increased risk of anxiety and double the risk of schizophrenia.\u201d<br></p> <p>So far, projects paving the way have tended to be small. Examples include one in Sheffield, England, says McCay, where a <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/landscape/news/improving-wellbeing-through-urban-nature-nerc-iwun-1.571819#https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/landscape/news/improving-wellbeing-through-urban-nature-nerc-iwun-1.571819\">green space parks</a> initiative, the <a href=\"http://valuing-nature.net/improving-wellbeing-through-urban-nature\">Improving Wellbeing Through Urban Nature </a>project, is aiming to promote well-designed urban green spaces as a cost-effective way to boost mental and physical health. Another is the network of <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/dementiafriendlycommunities#https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/dementiafriendlycommunities\">Dementia Friendly Communities</a> across the UK.</p> <h2>Urban living takes its toll</h2> <p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2010-peen.pdf#https://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2010-peen.pdf\">considerable body of evidence</a> (pdf) internationally suggesting that urban living, especially poorly designed environments, can have negative effects on mental health. For example, substandard, overcrowded, damp housing has been proven to affect people\u2019s capacity to cope, while the lack of something as basic as a play area can influence children\u2019s wellbeing.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, compared with non-urban areas, cities around the world have an increased prevalence of acute mental illnesses, as well as other problems such as stress and isolation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_lonely_society_report.pdf#https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_lonely_society_report.pdf\">A recent report</a> (pdf) from the Mental Health Foundation (MHF) in the UK concluded that cities becoming more crowded and the rising proportion of people living alone (up from 6% in 1972 to 12% in 2008) contributes to higher levels of loneliness, which is a risk factor for mental ill health.</p> <p>Another study, <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/poverty-and-mental-health\">Poverty and Mental Health</a>, published by the MHF for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation emphasised the adverse connections between mental health and deprivation, which tends to be most concentrated in urban areas. The report\u2019s recommendations included that policymakers consider mental health as a core part of the urban planning process, saying it \u201cshould be promoted as good practice\u201d.</p> <h2>The role of planners and architects</h2> <p>It makes sense, McCay says, to take into account, for example, that improving street lighting and housing layout might reduce fear and anxiety about safety.

  "<p>One of Australia\u2019s leading members of the Jewish community has described any attempt to water down the Racial Discrimination Act (RDA) as a government signal that the public promotion of racism would be tolerated.</p> <p>Peter Wertheim, executive director of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said if the Coalition backed a bill by Liberal senator Cory Bernardi to remove \u201coffend\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d from section 18C of the RDA, it would be the worst possible message.</p> <p>\u201cThe removal of the words \u2018offend\u2019 and \u2018insult\u2019 from section 18C would send a signal from government that the public promotion of racism will be tolerated in Australia and will no longer be considered to violate community standards,\u201d Wertheim told Guardian Australia. </p> <p>\u201cThat would be the worst possible message to send at a time of increasing fear, insecurity and polarisation. </p> <p>\u201cIt would be a serious abrogation of principled leadership by government.\u201d</p> <p>Dissident Liberal senator, Cory Bernardi, has declared he will <a href=\"http://Fixing%20this%20problem%20begins%20with%20fixing%20Section%2018C%20of%20the%20RDA.%20While%20some%20want%20to%20abolish%20it%20in%20its%20entirety,%20a%20good%20start%20would%20be%20to%20remove%20the%20words%20%E2%80%98offend%E2%80%99%20and%20%E2%80%98insult%E2%80%99%20from%20the%20act.%20This%20has%20even%20drawn%20strong%20support%20from%20across%20the%20political%20divide.%20In%20the%20last%20parliament%20a%20Bill%20to%20this%20effect%20(which%20I%20co-sponsored)%20was%20introduced%20but%20was%20never%20voted%20upon.https//www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/14/proposed-bill-to-tone-down-australias-racial-discrimination-act-set-to-fail\">re-introduce a bill</a> to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the Racial Discrimination Act when parliament returns at the end of August.</p> <p>Wertheim also voiced concerns that if a bill passed, opponents of 18C could go further, removing the section altogether. </p> <p>\u201cIt is also clear from the comments of some opponents of section 18C that the removal of \u201coffend\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d would only be a preliminary step towards the wholesale repeal of section 18C and related sections of the Act,\u201d Wertheim said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe idea that vulnerable people should be left without any legal remedy to defend themselves against the most serious cases of racist denigration is repugnant to the principle of a fair go.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>The move will reignite a difficult debate in the Coalition party room in Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s first parliamentary week since winning his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/13/labor-declares-victory-in-hindmarsh-but-falls-behind-in-herbert\">narrow election victory</a>. </p> <p>In the past week, a number of Coalition backbenchers have spoken out about the need to revive changes to the act, which were first promised by Tony Abbott ahead of the 2013 election. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/if-malcolm-turnbull-cant-fix-this-mess-tony-abbott-is-available\">If Malcolm Turnbull can't fix this mess, Tony Abbott is available | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The changes were dropped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/tony-abbott-faces-internal-backlash-over-racial-discrimination-law-change\">after widespread opposition</a>. At the time, Abbott said the reforms needed to be dropped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/race-discrimination-commissioner-backs-tony-abbotts-race-law-decision\">preserve \u201cnational unity</a>\u201d as the government planned wider security legislation in response to the global terrorism threat. </p> <p>Bernardi, who has been a regular critic of the Turnbull leadership, said section 18c of the RDA needed to change because it was \u201cOrwellian\u201d. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhile some want to abolish [18C] in its entirety, a good start would be to remove the words \u2018offend\u2019 and \u2018insult\u2019 from the act,\u201d Bernardi wrote in his weekly newsletter.</p> <p>\u201cThis has even drawn strong support from across the political divide. In the last parliament a bill to this effect (which I co-sponsored) was introduced but was never voted upon.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for that to change. In the first week back in parliament I\u2019ll be reintroducing the same bill with the expectation that this parliament will finally get a vote and expose very clearly who among your elected representatives is interested in protecting our freedoms and way of life.</p> <p>\u201cIt will also indicate those who have been captured by and surrendered to Orwell\u2019s frightening vision characterised in his book Nineteen Eighty-Four.\u201d</p> <p>The assistant agriculture minister Anne Ruston agreed in her weekly newsletter that \u201csome of the words in this section should probably go, at least\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201c\u2018Offend\u2019, \u2018insult\u2019, and \u2018humiliate\u2019 are highly subjective terms open to all manner of interpretations. Laws governing our behaviour towards others should be objective in their working as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The comments come after senator James Patterson said on Monday the senate was only \u201cone or two votes away\u201d from a passing a bill to remove \u201coffend\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d from the section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act. </p> <p>A number of Liberal sources told Guardian Australia that if a bill to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d were put to the Coalition partyroom, it would win majority support. The Bernardi bill will present a challenge for the Coalition, which will have to decide whether to allow the bill to go to the floor of the senate for debate. </p> <p>The attorney general, George Brandis, who when selling the original reforms said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/george-brandis-people-have-the-right-to-be-bigots\">everyone had the right to be a bigot</a>, has since consistently said that any change is off the table. </p> <p>The issue is building again for a number of reasons. The election of One Nation senators who support the change has emboldened Coalition senators in favour of changing the act. </p> <p>And senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/david-leyonhjelm\">David Leyonhjelm</a> has launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/david-leyonhjelm-racial-discrimination-complaint-angry-white-male-fairfax-18c\">discrimination complaint</a> over an opinion article describing him as an \u201cangry white male\u201d, saying it shows why the race speech law is absurd and needs to be repealed.</p> <p>While One Nation\u2019s four senators would support any bill to water down 18C, Nick Xenophon, who has three votes in the senate, is against any attempts. Of the remaining senators, Derryn Hinch of the Justice Party and Bob Day of Family First support the changes, while Jacqui Lambie is against. </p> <p> Bill Shorten has called on Turnbull to confirm whether he did a deal with the right wing of the party to change 18c, after an <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/racial-discrimination-act--malcolm-turnbull-promised-18c-changes-ahead-of-tony-abbott-spill/news-story/122263f1da4583a9cb5506a08a6eb45e\">unsourced report</a> in the Daily Telegraph. </p> <p>\u201cDid Mr Turnbull do a deal with his own right wing to undermine protections against hate speech or not? \u201c Shorten said. <br></p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s office had no comment.</p>",

Or, even more unthinkably, whip gold out of the clutches of Simone Biles? Performing to the strains of Nessun Dorma\u2019s a good idea from where I\u2019m sitting. I\u2019d give her gold for that alone. The judges might not be so smitten, but it was a very experienced performance from a gymnast who\u2019s desperate to end her wait for an Olympic medal at the age of 25. It\u2019s going to be close. 14.933 is what she needs to beat to get bronze. And she\u2019s not done enough! She finishes with a score of 14.766! All of which means that Simone Biles is the Olympic champion in the floor exercise and it\u2019s an American one-two, with Aly Raisman in second. And how about Team GB\u2019s Amy Tinkler, the youngest British athlete in Rio? The 16-year-old\u2019s won a very impressive bronze medal with a score of 14.933! And she\u2019s the youngest British Olympic medalist in 32 years.

The consensus among other riders in the race who commented on the matter seemed to be that it was just one of those things that can happen in the pell-mell of race-riding, but I notice that Cavendish has been getting no end of abuse in the comments section under my report on the event and elsewhere from readers who clearly know far more about track cycling than the world\u2019s best track cyclists. <br></p> <p>Cavendish exchanged angry words with one Dutch journalist last night, who asked him if he thought he should have been disqualified from the race. The newsman in question claimed that Cavendish was getting an easy ride from British journalists who hadn\u2019t brought up the matter. They did bring up the matter, at which point the cyclist admitted the crash was entirely down to him and wished the stricken Park well.\u201d <br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/mark-cavendish-silver-rio-olympics-cycling-omnium?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Read Baz\u2019s report from last night here</a>. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:20:08.726Z\">at 4.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b32e35e4b0c23bfed8a0b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:16:56.725Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Qualification for the women\u2019s pole vault final is over - 4.60was the highest jump, and one of those who managed it was Holly Bradshaw of GB. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b32d19e4b062ce4d223ea4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:12:17.381Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ilia Zakharov, the defending champion, is out of the springboard diving.

It\u2019s not just sportspeople doing really well, such as with Van Niekerk, as that wasn\u2019t expected. It\u2019s the knowledge in advance that if you watch Biles you know basically all you need to for (all) gymnastics. Ditto Bolt and short distance running, Phelps and Ledecky for anything water. Farrah, and (not that I\u2019ve seen it) Rudisha too I guess.

We know that she is a specialist in the long, sustained, streamlined effort of the pursuit (having already won gold in the team pursuit); and sure enough she came first out of the 18 riders in that leg of the Omnium. She also won the elimination race, a sustained effort ramping up every two laps for a sprint. AND, she won the bunch sprint at the end of the points race to take second place (behind a rider who had already taken a lap over the field). Which other athletes, in any sport, consistently come out on top in disciplines with such different demands?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, agreed - I was lucky enough to be on the blog for that, and these ease with which she destroyed the field in that elimination race was awesome and bizarre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62125afefe4d5bc6452746e1f7d73e0117ac3b0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62125afefe4d5bc6452746e1f7d73e0117ac3b0a/712_653_4480_2851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Trott: imperious in the omnium so far.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Trott: imperious in the omnium so far.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s tricky to find a similar kind of all-rounder because not much demands as much as the omnium.

Tunisian Oussama Mellouli won in the Serpentine last time around. This time, it\u2019s at the Copa, Copa Copacobana. American Jordan Wilimovsky is the one the smart people fancy. </li> <li>Wrestling! Greco Roman Wrestling. More on that in a tic with a nice little explainer for you. Flick between the velodrome and this to catch the men\u2019s 98kg div medal rounds. Armenian Artur Aleksanyan picked up bronze in London and has a couple of world champs since then. Iranian veteran Ghasem Rezaei won in London and he\u2019s there too.

The sun is through in Rio, twitter suggests. Good signs. </p> <p>Roger Kirby has some perspective on the whole topic: </p> <p>\u201cYou ask us to tell you about watching these games on tv but what about Olympics pre Internet? Depending on time zone you might have had to wait 2 days to find out results of certain events not covered on tv by buying a newspaper, your only reference was the Guinness book of records and apart from the big events, you only saw the event once, if you missed it, you had missed it forever. The difference is so vast, how far we have come in 20 years is truly amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Poses an interesting question about how we gather to watch events. Is it a more meaningful experience going through it together in places like this and social media? Or are we missing a trick by not having to be somewhere at a certain time to emphasise the importance of what we\u2019re tuning in for? Take that as a comment, like I said, forward looking from now. </p> <p>Oh, and Polly - a Londoner in Australia - says nice things about the blog like \u201cvery funny\u201d and \u201chighly informative\u201d (presumably in reference to Claire) before thinking about having a crack at the Australian TV but holding back.

Quite interesting, to those (like me, to be fair) who follow the sport once an Olympiad. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The mistake that Armour and many others have made is assuming that men\u2019s and women\u2019s gymnastics are directly comparable, when they\u2019re barely the same sport. The men compete in six events, the women in four. There is only direct overlap on two apparatuses \u2013 the vault and the floor exercise \u2013 though in the latter, the women have dance requirements in addition to the tumbling. The uneven bars is similar to the high bar though not exactly the same, and the women don\u2019t perform on any apparatuses like the pommel horse or rings.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/16/mens-womens-gymnastics-comparison-olympics\">Comparing men's and women's gymnastics is futile: they're barely the same sport</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b2e447e4b0c23bfed89f43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T10:12:35.627Z\">11.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fair bit of feedback</strong> below the line on where GB might medal (it\u2019s a verb now, I know, I hate it too) by week\u2019s end.

A special moment from the stadium, documented for us by Sean Ingle. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was the night before the Olympic 800m final, and the world\u2019s greatest middle distance runner had a message for his nation. After three years of frustration and only occasional elation following keyhole surgery on a serious knee injury, that old unmistakable tingle had returned. And he was ready to show it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And some lovely words on this topic from reader Tom Cameron</strong> about the lot in life of the 800 metre runner:</p> <p>\u201cIs the 800m the most gut wrenching of the track events? It surely is. I can recall meeting a nice fella who was the Australian 800 meter champion back circa 1996. He was the strapping boyfriend of a mate\u2019s sister who I rowed first crew with back at Ballarat Grammar - so it goes. Anyway I\u2019ve long forgotten his name but I remember him telling me success in the 800 meters is really about \u201cthe deep dig\u201d because it\u2019s quite simply just flat out, all the way round, two laps. The 800 is rare in that sense isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s all turbo but you have to reach right down into the bowels of human fortitude to find it, especially in that second lap. Hope that now middle ageing champion is doing well anyway, and watching Rio in happy comfort.

This is precisely what I\u2019m talking about. </p> <p>Here\u2019s his (edited!) story:</p> <p>\u201cUp until 2012, the BBC was the only place I had ever watched the Olympics. I watched the London Olympics on TV in the USA and it has to be my single most disappointing sports viewing experience ever. Now I live in France and I have to say that I am rather taken by the way the French cover the Olympics on TV.\u201d</p> <p>Wall to wall coverage from getting up to going to bed, one never has to be without the Olympics. I have watched events I never even knew existed - the 25m rapid fire pistol final was gripping. And ones that I did, fencing, but had never watched - who knew you could do it as a team. </p> <p>And don\u2019t let anyone ever tell you that the French hate the British. They may call the athletes competing \u201cl\u2019anglais\u201d most of the time (although they did call Andy Murray \u201cl\u2019escosse\u201d) but they seemed to be genuinely happy when a British competitor wins, especially in the cycling, really caring about how \u201cle Cav\u201d was doing. They have seemed to be happy when Murray won the tennis, Rose won the Golf and Sir Bradley Wiggins (as they insist on calling him) won his gold. And we got a bi-lingiual interview with Mo Farrah after his win on Sunday morning, which he rather sweetly ended in French.</p> <p>Right, I\u2019m off to see how they have reacted to winning silver in the Mens Pole Vault and see what todays Brazilian \u201ccooking with the presenters\u201d recipe is (hey, its France).\u201d<br></p> <p>Where are you tuning in from? <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.freelance@theguardian.com\">Tell me</a> about your experience.

  "<p>Environmentalists and indigenous reindeer herders are calling on the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Stephen Fry to disassociate themselves from a charity contracted to help a mining operation in a national park in Finland.</p> <p>Fauna and Flora International (FFI), whose patron is the Queen, has been hired by the British-listed mining company Anglo American to assess the environmental value of Viiankiaapa, a stunning 65 sq km (25 sq mile) habitat for 21 endangered bird species in the Arctic circle.</p> <p>The research includes an assessment of whether equivalent land could be offered as \u201ccompensation\u201d for wetlands damaged by the extraction of massive deposits of platinum, nickel, copper and gold.</p> <p>But Jukka Kaaretkoski, a reindeer herder of Sami ancestry from nearby Kersil\u00f6, told the Guardian that the drilling would take a heavy environmental toll and be a \u201cterminal\u201d blow for local herders whose animals graze there.</p> <p>\u201cMines cause traffic, noise, grit, pollution and contamination of water supplies,\u201d he said. \u201cMany young reindeer herders are in danger of losing their future livelihoods because of it. We cannot even plan for the future because of the fear and insecurity. \u201d </p> <p>Riikka Karppinen, a Green party councillor in the local Sodankyl\u00e4 municipality, added: \u201cI think this is colonialism, because the big mining company has come here from another country and we are in too weak a position to protect our homeland.\u201d</p> <p>About 90 bird species live in Viiankiaapa \u2013 including pygmy owls to broad-billed sandpipers \u2013 many nesting amid the bogs and moors that host a variety of endangered plant species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c823ffd93d1da15c4175e7ab3e4e4dc5c9542cf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c823ffd93d1da15c4175e7ab3e4e4dc5c9542cf4/0_0_2231_3347/667.jpg\" alt=\"The ruff is among 90 bird species living in Viiankiaapa, many of which nest amid the bogs and moors that host a variety of endangered plant species.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ruff is among some 90 bird species living in Viiankiaapa, many of which nest amid the bogs and moors that host a variety of endangered plant species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timo Helle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But tailings \u2013 toxic waste from ore extraction \u2013 from other mining operations have been seeping into lakes and rivers around the town of Sodankyl\u00e4, according to <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/mining-boom-underway-in-finland-in-the-search-for-mineral-deposits-a-864561.html\">Der Spiegel</a>.</p> <p>Anglo American has already drilled 180 holes in the territory \u2013 more than half within a designated conservation area \u2013 although this work has been paused pending a ruling by the Finnish supreme court on an environmental appeal, now expected this autumn.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to ask the Queen and those celebrities [endorsing FFI] whether they truly know what they are supporting,\u201d Kaaretkoski said. \u201cThey may think they are helping nature, or people like us to protect our land, but this work is helping to destroy these things. We would like them to disassociate themselves from it.\u201d </p> <p> Neither Fry nor Attenborough, vice-presidents of the charity, were available to respond, while Buckingham palace declined to comment, referring enquiries to FFI. </p> <p>Pippa Howard, FFI\u2019s director of business and biodiversity, said: \u201cWe are opposed to extraction in protected areas and do not promote it, but where such activities are taking place with the support of host governments, one makes sure that best environmental practice is being applied.\u201d </p> <p>FFI believes that Anglo American is committed to best environmental practice but conceded that there was \u201ca reputational risk\u201d involved in the partnership.

  "<p>I had the birds and the bees conversation with my daughter when she was around four years old.

Many of the women are educated and considered liberal in their way of thinking. They say their daughters are equal to their sons. However, they also say they want their daughters to remain virgins to protect them from harm and so that future husbands will respect them.</p> <p>What interests me about these conversations is that the women openly talked about being cheated on or beaten by their so-called respectful husbands. I nudged the women to reflect. \u201cDid remaining a virgin work for you?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid it prevent the violence and betrayal he had caused you?\u201d Many were baffled by my questions. By our second session some of the women were starting to realise that cultural patriarchy was alive and well in their homes, and they were complicit in committing the oppression they had endured against their own daughters. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Society high-fives men with multiple sexual partners</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sadly I only had two sessions with these women, and they left me questioning this universal obsession with virginity. I remember newspaper articles about Kate Middleton, being slut-shamed in newspaper articles for not being a virgin before marriage and rumour has it Diana had to prove her virginity before marrying Prince Charles. If a woman is sexually free or has multiple partners, society shames her and makes her feel bad about herself.</p> <p>While dating I\u2019ve been asked how many men I\u2019ve slept with. This idea of being judged based on the history of my vagina is absolutely ludicrous and another form of control of women\u2019s sexuality. My brother and all the men in my life are never asked such questions yet alone judged on them. Society high-fives men with multiple sexual partners. </p> <p>I had my first sexual experience at the age of 18 with my then husband (I\u2019m currently happily divorced). I didn\u2019t make the choice to stay a virgin. I did so for two reasons. Firstly, I wasn\u2019t the girl boys were lining up to date. I was a super nerd who didn\u2019t wear makeup or pluck her eyebrows. So, no temptation or struggle for me. Secondly, my mother told me sex was great and nothing to be ashamed about. As a teenager I wasn\u2019t keen to try something my mother enjoyed (remember that trick, parents). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/29/leyla-hussein-the-women-who-made-me\">Anti-FGM campaigner Leyla Hussein: the women who made me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I remind my daughter that whenever the day comes that she wants to lose her virginity (why is it something you lose, like a precious possession?), it is no one\u2019s business but hers. If anyone tries to judge her based on her genitals, I tell her to just walk away. </p> <p>I tell her that our vaginas are very special and powerful, we bleed and give birth from them, and it\u2019s her right as a woman to enjoy sex one day. It\u2019s a beautiful and enjoyable act.

There\u2019s a guy with his leg cut open, let\u2019s go wrap him up. There\u2019s a burning building, we have to help the people out before it falls down.

Marczyk and Kudriavtseva wrote a chunky 20-character script with multiple narratives, but it only seemed to diminish the enormity of what they\u2019d gone through. Instead, they drew on Kudriavtseva\u2019s six years as an actor and singer with Kiev\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dax.com.ua/en\">Dakh centre of contemporary art</a>. The music-theatre productions of her avant garde director, Vlad Troitsky, seemed a better template, and so Counting Sheep became an impressionistic collage in which traditional song expresses the conflicting emotions of turbulent times. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The audience may not understand the words, but they understand the feeling</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gorgeously sung and passionately played, these winter-solstice songs, partisan army songs and traditional wedding songs are performed in the original language. \u201cOne of the ideas was: what if we drop all of the dialogue?\u201d says Marczyk. \u201cWhat if we just tell the story using these 1,000-year-old songs in which the weight of Ukrainian history is embedded in every single note?\u201d <br></p> <p>Kudriavtseva chips in: \u201cThe audience may not understand the words, but they understand the feeling \u2013 because you cannot describe it in a way that can be understood.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2016/aug/12/edinburgh-festival-shows-alan-cumming-2016-in-pictures\">Club Cumming, dystopias and talking dolphins: Edinburgh festival 2016 shows \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Polyphonic voices, sometimes dissonant, sometimes harmonious, were also a way of expressing the sense of community central to everything Marczyk and Kudriavtseva do.

As many as 30 musicians have contributed to the joyful collective expression of the Lemon Bucket Orkestra, which fields up to 17 members at a time. Likewise, Counting Sheep turns the audience from passive observers into vigorous activists, dancing, feasting and protesting in the theatre, just like the community that formed on the streets of Kiev.<br></p> <p>\u201cFor me, community was the No 1 important thing,\u201d says Marczyk. \u201cI came to Ukraine, I didn\u2019t know anybody and my language was not that good, and I found a connection to people through music.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s why Counting Sheep is less a polemic against any particular politician than an evocation of human solidarity. Marczyk sees it as a provocation. \u201cThe show is a choice,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you choose to react when you\u2019re faced by these kind of questions?

Several Brussels insiders think this is overoptimistic, which is why many also expect an interim deal to ease the transition.</p> <p>Next on the government\u2019s to-do list is re-establishing trading links with all major trading partners outside the EU. The UK will have to regain full membership of the WTO, and re-sign the 39 trade deals covering 65 countries negotiated by the EU. </p> <p>Britain joined the WTO in 1995 under the umbrella of the EU, which represents its member states in international trade talks. Roberto Azev\u00eado, the WTO director general, warned in the run-up to the 23 June vote that \u201ckey aspects of the EU\u2019s terms of trade could not simply be cut and pasted for the UK\u201d. When asked about Brexit, a WTO official referred back to <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spra_e/spra126_e.htm\">those remarks</a>, where Azev\u00eado stressed \u201ctrade would continue [but] could be on worse terms\u201d. He also said British exporters could face \u00a35.6bn in extra duties on goods they want to sell abroad.</p> <p>In order to re-establish credentials in the WTO, the UK needs the approval of 164 members from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Most observers do not see this as an insurmountable hurdle, but some countries could use the opening to seek better trade terms or as leverage on something else. \u201cThe history of the WTO shows that things can move very slowly and other factors, beyond the intrinsic merits of whatever the trade deal is, can come into play,\u201d said Hannah White, the Brexit lead at the <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\">Institute for Government</a> thinktank.</p> <p>British trade negotiators will have to get into the mind-boggling arcana of WTO agreements governing tariffs and subsidies, known as schedules. One of the first questions is what happens to the EU schedules. The EU, for example, can import 58,000 tonnes of top-quality steak from South America under WTO rules, but no one knows how much of that share belongs to the UK. \u201cThere will be a three-way negotiation between us, the WTO and the EU,\u201d White said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d52c27c718254c43b836109e9bd977d1ce71291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d52c27c718254c43b836109e9bd977d1ce71291/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The EU imports 58,000 tonnes of steak from South America\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The EU imports 58,000 tonnes of steak from South America under WTO rules, but Britain\u2019s share is unknown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile officials from the newly created trade department will be jetting around the globe to keep British ties with the 65 countries that have a trade agreement with the EU. </p> <p>Before the Brexit vote, leave campaigners assumed these deals would continue seamlessly.

But every single one could be reopened. In an ideal world countries would keep existing deals going, Hood said. \u201cBut will most countries want to do that? If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking hard about how I get the best deal for my country.\u201d</p> <p>Brexiters have enthused about selling more to the US and China, but about two-thirds of British trade is done either with the EU or countries that have signed a trade deal with the bloc.

She needs a broader agenda to discuss what we have to offer as a strategic partner to the European project. The UK\u2019s assets are denominated in power, hard and soft, from our capital city\u2019s role in global&#xa0;finance to our status as a nuclear-armed Nato member.</p> <p>But the pitch in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Warsaw must aspire to more than tariff elimination. It must include promises to engage with continental challenges: Isis-inspired terrorism, Russian territorial expansion, energy security.

That is the terrain on which the best deal is struck.</p> <p>Brussels-baiting Euroscepticism and the internal dynamics of the Tory party have for a generation set the terms of the debate about Britain\u2019s status as a European nation. Yet history, geography and global diplomacy dictate that we can be no other kind. A stark irony of the Brexit vote is that it demands of the prime minister a more thorough, ambitious and diligently applied vision of Britain\u2019s strategic relationship with the rest of the continent than has been possessed by any of her predecessors since Ted Heath. Leaving the EU will involve diplomacy as ardently and explicitly pro-European as that required for joining in the first place. In the intervening years we have spent a lot of energy arguing about what Europe means to Britain. It is time to consider what the rest of Europe might see in us.</p>",

In August of that year, the Norwegian freight ship Tampa rescued 438 asylum seekers on their way Australia. The government refused to allow the ship to dock, requesting it return them to Indonesia.<sup> </sup> </p> <p> Australia asked Nauru, a former protectorate, to accept the asylum seekers, triggering the \u201cPacific Solution\u201d. At the time, Nauru was not a signatory to the refugee convention. Under this policy, which lasted until 2008, asylum seekers bound for Australia were intercepted and detained on Nauru, or another Pacific country, Papua New Guinea, while their protection claims were processed.</p> <p> In 2012, Australia reopened detention centres in Nauru and on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island as a \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d to stop relatively high number of asylum seekers arriving by boat and the accompanying deaths at sea. By this time, Nauru had signed the refugee convention.</p> <p> However, these offshore arrangements became permanent pillars of Australia\u2019s asylum policy, one based on deterring future asylum seekers through turning back boats and detention offshore. Under this policy, at least 28 boats have been turned back since 2013.</p> <p> When boats carrying asylum seekers cannot be turned back, Australia intercepts asylum seekers at sea and transfers them to Nauru and Papua New Guinea under bilateral agreements with both countries. Asylum seekers have been held in closed immigration detention for indefinite periods, though it is important to note that since October 2015 Nauru has operated as an open centre.</p> <h2><strong>Context to the Nauru files</strong></h2> <p> Even before the release of the Nauru files, significant evidence of human rights concerns had been reported in both offshore centres. Last year the UN Committee Against Torture reported conditions of \u201covercrowding, inadequate health care; and ill-treatment\u201d in Nauru and a report commissioned by the Australian government found evidence of sexual assault of asylum seekers in detention. Earlier this year, two refugees self-immolated in protest. In Papua New Guinea, there have been repeated demonstrations and rioting among the 900 all-male asylum seekers. In 2014, two staff at the detention centre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/19/reza-barati-men-convicted-of-asylum-seekers-to-be-free-in-less-than-four-years\">murdered an asylum seeker</a> during one such protest.</p> <p> Secrecy is a large part of Australia\u2019s model. Operations that occur on the high seas or Australia\u2019s territorial waters are confidential. Nauru introduced a non-refundable visa fee for journalists of $8,000 dollars in 2014 and regularly refuses visa applications to foreign journalists. As a result, just two journalists have visited the detention centre in the past four years.</p> <p> Against this backdrop, the Nauru files can best be understood as another blow to the Australian offshore regime. The Australian government has repeatedly stated that while it will not tolerate abuse in detention, what occurs in Nauru is out of Australia\u2019s control.</p> <h2><strong>The beginning of the end?</strong></h2> <p> There are three factors that suggest Australia\u2019s offshore asylum model faces an existential threat: legal challenges; practical problems; and the question of responsibility. </p> <p>Firstly, the offshore regime is under legal pressure. As well as international criticism from UN human rights bodies, earlier this year the supreme court of Papua New Guinea found the detention of asylum seekers an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">unconstitutional violation of the right to liberty</a>. The court ordered both Australia and Papua New Guinea to \u201ctake all steps necessary to cease and prevent the continued unconstitutional and illegal detention.\u201d The Papua New Guinean government is currently working to find appropriate arrangements in accordance with this ruling. A second legal challenge to the Manus detention regime is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/08/asylum-seekers-manus-island-police-presence-stepped-up-as-second-challenge-heads-to-court\">currently underway</a>.</p> <p> Secondly, the current policy appears fundamentally unsustainable from a practical perspective. Neither Papua New Guinea nor Nauru can provide durable solutions to those asylum seekers found to be refugees. Under the bilateral agreements, refugees are in theory allowed to remain in these countries permanently. However, Papua New Guinea has already declared itself unable to resettle refugees on its territory. Those found to be refugees in Nauru are allowed to live in the community on five-year visas. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/australia-fails-the-same-lesson-every-time-the-nauru-files-show-how-secrecy-hides-abuse\">Australia fails the same lesson every time.

The deal has delivered little: just five people have been settled in Cambodia, of which four subsequently chose to return to their countries of origin. This leaves unanswered the question of what to with refugees left in Nauru and Papua New Guinea for years.</p> <p> Finally, the Nauru files highlight Australian responsibility for what happens offshore. Though the Australian the government denies jurisdiction over the detention centres in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, its indirect responsibility is increasingly clear. Australia instigated the opening of the centres, selected the contractors that run them, provide all funding, and choose who is transferred there. Hiding behind the sovereignty of another state is becoming increasingly untenable. </p> <p> These three factors, together with the realities portrayed in the Nauru files, should make it quite clear to European politicians that the \u201cAustralian Solution\u201d is no solution at all.</p> <p><em>Nikolas Feith Tan is a PhD fellow for the Danish Institute for Human Rights and advisor at the Danish Refugee Council.</em></p>",

In 2011, Australia co-sponsored a UN Human Rights Council resolution that unanimously endorsed the UN g<a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">uiding principles</a> on business and human rights.</p> <p>The guiding principles represent the global standard for preventing and addressing the negative impacts of business on human rights. They provide a common global platform for action on corporate accountability. The principles require businesses to respect human rights and governments to protect individuals from corporate human rights abuses. </p> <p>Since 2011, the guiding principles have been widely adopted by both governments and businesses themselves, here and internationally. Their rapid and widespread uptake indicates a clear recognition that the corporate sector is, increasingly, expected to act responsibly. </p> <p>The development of business and human rights NAPs is a corresponding, UN-supported process. These policy statements are used by governments to translate the guiding principles into practice. In 2014, the Australian government supported a resolution of the UN Human Rights Council calling on countries to adopt<strong> </strong>NAPs as a vehicle for implementing the guiding principles.</p> <p>In backing these UN resolutions, the Australian government has voiced its support for international initiatives aimed at achieving greater corporate respect for human rights. </p> <p>Australia is also campaigning for a seat on the Human Rights Council \u2013 the powerhouse of the international human rights system \u2013 for its upcoming 2018-20 term. The success or otherwise of Australia\u2019s bid will be decided by a vote of the UN General Assembly in November 2017, so the eyes of the international community are on us. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">The Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia is clearly making the right noises, in the right places, but is failing to back up these gestures with action. It is time the government took concrete steps to hold itself to the standards that it claims to support and translate its rhetoric into reality.</p> <p>Despite co-sponsoring the original UN Human Rights Council resolution, in reality the Australian government has been slow to engage. It has yet to take steps integrating the principles into national law and policy. </p> <p>Unlike comparable global players, Australia remains without an implementation plan. Nearly forty such plans have either been launched or are under way in other countries around the world, including the UK, Germany and the US. </p> <p>This has created impetus for greater corporate responsibility in adopting countries. It has levelled the playing field for business by providing it with direction and guidance on how to respond to the guiding principles and incorporate them into business practices.</p> <p>While the Australian government has <a href=\"https://business-humanrights.org/en/australian-govt-announces-natl-consultation-on-business-human-rights\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced its intention</a> to hold public consultations in 2016 on implementing the guiding principles, it has yet to set dates for these talks.

An expert advisory body, including the voices of all stakeholders, should also be established to harness and share valuable expertise for maximum benefit.</p> <p>The government should respond to public and private sector calls and adopt a National Action Plan.The plan should include measures demonstrating the government\u2019s intention to lead by example \u2013 incorporating human rights requirements into public procurement practices is a good place to start.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/03/my-super-my-future-australians-put-their-money-where-their-morals-are\">My super, my future: Australians put their money where their morals are</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It should also include clear guidance for business on what is expected of it in terms of respecting human rights. It should address existing gaps in Australia\u2019s legal and policy frameworks that permit businesses to continue to commit human rights abuses and flout the law. The lax regulation of unscrupulous labour hire companies and lack of franchisor accountability provide good examples of such gaps. </p> <p>And it must also address the issue of access to justice for those suffering business-related harm. Existing mechanisms, such as our OECD National Contact Point \u2013 a grievance system that is woefully under-resourced and under-utilised in Australia \u2013 should be strengthened and new ones explored.</p> <p>If Australia wants to be counted amongst the world\u2019s leading nations and hopes to be treated as such, it needs to act the part.
