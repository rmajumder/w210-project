  "<p>Plans to compel professionals to report their concerns that children are being abused have been rejected by the UK\u2019s leading child protection charity, provoking fury from a victim support group.</p> <p>A proposal to introduce \u201cmandatory reporting\u201d, which is observed in many other countries, has exposed a schism among groups representing doctors, nurses, police and social workers, with some expressing fears that they would struggle to cope with the increase in abuse investigations that it would generate.</p> <p>The government\u2019s consultation on reporting and acting on child abuse and neglect was launched amid concerns about past abuse in some of the country\u2019s major institutions. High-profile inquiries, such as that into the paedophile Jimmy Savile, revealed how many people suspected abuse but failed to report their fears.</p> <p>Under the new proposal teachers, doctors and other employees in regulated professions who work with children would be legally obliged to report suspicions that a child was being abused.</p> <p>However, the plan has been rejected by the NSPCC. It warns that<a href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/consultation-responses/nspcc-2016-consultation-reporting-acting-child-abuse-neglect.pdf\" title=\"\"> victims might be deterred from opening up to adults if they know what they say will </a>automatically trigger an investigation. The charity gives the hypothetical example of a teacher who is worried about a child because he or she is turning up to school hungry or unkempt, a sign that the child is at risk of neglect.</p> <p>According to the NSPCC, under mandatory reporting teachers would be bound to raise their concerns with the local authority immediately. This would trigger a child protection investigation, one that might be unnecessary if the teachers had been able to use their professional judgment and talk to the children and their parents to establish what was happening.</p> <p>The NSPCC is in favour of mandatory reporting for \u201cclosed institutions\u201d such as hospitals and boarding schools, on the grounds that they have smaller networks of adults for children to confide in and are likely to place greater pressure on their employees to protect their reputation. But for other institutions the NSPCC backs a proposal for a duty to act, which would allow professionals not to automatically report their concerns but to consider \u201cappropriate\u201d action that they believe to be in the best interests of the child. In all cases, however, the decision would be recorded and the professionals would be held accountable for their actions.</p> <p>\u201cWe think that this may make it more likely that children are given the support they need according to their circumstances and it leaves professionals with some discretion to decide what action is appropriate,\u201d the NSPCC says in a briefing that accompanies its submission to the consultation.</p> <p>The issue is becoming deeply divisive. Submissions to the consultation reveal that the children\u2019s commissioner is against mandatory reporting, as is the National Police Chiefs Council, the British Association of Social Workers and the Royal College of Nursing. But both the National Association of Head Teachers union and the British Medical Association say they are broadly in favour.</p> <p>Tom Perry, founder of Mandate Now, a victim support group that campaigns<a href=\"http://mandatenow.org.uk/govt-secures-nspcc-support-for-child-protection-proposal-designed-to-fail/\" title=\"\"> for a change in the law, branded the duty to act option, favoured</a> by the government, \u201cunworkable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt suggests a legal duty should exist at all points in the child protection system to act in an \u2018appropriate\u2019 manner,\u201d Perry said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t define what it means by \u2018appropriate\u2019 and acknowledges it will vary from case to case. The government then suggests most cases would be addressed by disciplinary rather than criminal sanctions, meaning there would be no change since disciplinary sanctions already exist and don\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Perry said mandatory reporting had been shown to work in other countries. \u201cPeople faced with having to report suspicions of abuse naturally ask themselves, \u2018What if I\u2019m wrong?\u2019 Gaze aversion is a significant challenge. The culture of child protection has to change and mandatory reporting in institutional settings will help make that happen. It has in the majority of countries on all four continents which have some form of the law.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The north London derby is more important than ever for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, but not in the way you might expect. The Wenger Out contingent are currently becalmed, while the ascent of Spurs seems not to trouble him. No, the Frenchman says he wants to win this north London derby because of what he will learn about the development of his Arsenal side. In this most open of Premier League seasons, can they really be champions again?</p> <p>Of course, it is early in the season, and of course Wenger would play down any threat from Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s young side (asked if last season\u2019s Spurs were the best he has seen in his 20 years at Arsenal, Wenger replied: \u201cThey were not in the Champions League\u201d). Furthermore, Arsenal have looked in a good state heading into November before, only to look far less healthy come the end of it. But a sense has taken hold that Arsenal have successfully strengthened their squad over the summer, while those already on their books \u2013 most notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/arsenal-theo-walcott-attitude-centre-forward\" title=\"\">Theo Walcott</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/arsenal-ludogorets-razgrad-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Mesut \u00d6zil</a> \u2013 are assuming more responsibility. Now comes the time to prove it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/03/arsene-wenger-granit-xhaka-disciplinary-record-concerns-arsenal-tottenham-derby\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has Xhaka disciplinary concerns before north London derby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into a period when we will be playing big games. And we want to win big games,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI am convinced that we are better equipped [to deal with big games] but we also want to show it with our performances on the pitch. Also with the effectiveness of our performances on the pitch, and that means with points.</p> <p>\u201cThis is more than the derby. We\u2019re in a strong position in the league but we want to strengthen overall, as do Tottenham. It\u2019s very tight at the top of the league and it\u2019s a home game, so we are very focused on winning it. Be it Spurs or anyone else, we want to win our home games.\u201d</p> <p>In November last year Arsenal scraped together only two points in the league. The season before that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/09/swansea-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">lost to Swansea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/22/arsenal-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester United</a> in consecutive games and in 2013, well, they beat everyone bar United. But, November curse or not, Wenger is asking his players to prove that they can lose a reputation for being a team that are weak at the crucial moments. And that means not losing control in high-pressure fixtures like this one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/04/harry-kane-tottenham-north-london-derby\">Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane ready for comeback against Arsenal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that you prepare to be at your best,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThat you prepare for the intensity of the game, mentally as well as physically. You have to keep your discipline and composure despite the fact that it is a big game. Sometimes you can have games that are heated from the first to the last minute, sometimes there are just two or three moments in the game when it becomes absolutely heated. No matter when it happens, though, you have to master the situation. Don\u2019t get carried away by this. Just keep focused on what you have to do.\u201d</p> <p>Wenger pointed to statistics to further his case. \u201cIf you look at the number of fouls we have made in the Premier League, I think we are the best. So we have just to keep doing what we\u2019re doing well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Arsenal, in fact, have conceded the second fewest fouls in the division, behind Manchester City. They are also second best in the disciplinary table, behind Bournemouth. As for goals conceded, they are fourth best. This time though, the leaders are Tottenham. Wenger will mind that particular gap, and take any narrowing of it on Sunday as a sign his side are moving in the right direction.</p>",

On Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/news/local/elections/mc-pa-poll-trump-clinton-toomey-mcginty-20161105-story.html\">a Morning Call poll</a> put Toomey up just 43% to 42% against the Democrat, Katie McGinty, in a race that could be key to deciding control of the Senate.</p> <p>Obama also admonished Toomey for his role in the current impasse over his supreme court nominee, Merrick Garland, saying: \u201cVoting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn\u2019t courage.

Ibrahim\u2019s lawyers claim crucial forensic evidence was destroyed or ignored and that police failed to properly investigate witness sightings and possible suspects. In a letter written to the commission, her legal team allege that Cumbria police spent \u00a3153,990.95 to \u201cprove\u201d their hunch she had invented the entire account.</p> <p>During her trial in July 2010, the prosecution accepted that Ibrahim had sustained significant injuries to her breasts and genitals before police had been called to see her on 4 January 2009. She had turned up distressed at her sister\u2019s house in Carlisle in the early hours, saying she had been attacked on her way back from a night out with friends. She was in a dishevelled state, with her dress, bra and leggings showing signs of damage. She had also suffered a blow to her head, which may have been caused when she was knocked to the ground, and had lacerations, scratches and bruising to her knees, breasts and face, and was bleeding from the vagina.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f71e216a7d0de5202fef5069d37bc9122c7c563c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f71e216a7d0de5202fef5069d37bc9122c7c563c/0_263_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Layla Ibrahim is fighting to clear her name after her claims of being raped were not believed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Layla Ibrahim is fighting to clear her name after her claims of being raped were not believed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A forensic physician, Dr Jason Payne-James, gave evidence at the trial suggesting most of her injuries \u201ccould\u201d have been self-inflicted, with the intimate bruising perhaps caused by consensual sex of some sort. But Ibrahim\u2019s new legal team argue Payne-James\u2019s evidence was \u201chighly speculative\u201d and unreliable. It was challenged in court at the time by another forensic expert, Dr Catherine White, who has now written questioning the conviction.</p> <p>When interviewed by police, Ibrahim said she had been attacked by two strangers and had lost consciousness but was not sure if she had been sexually assaulted. She talked only of recalling a \u201cthud\u201d in her vagina which she described as being like having an object in her vagina that was too big.</p> <p>She told officers she had defended herself against the men with a pair of scissors from her handbag, swinging them at one of her attackers. The second man had taken the scissors from her, she said, and used them to cut her hair, before both men fled the scene. They took one of her shoes, perhaps to slow her escape.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There can be little worse than suffering an attack of this nature and then being disbelieved, prosecuted and imprisoned</p> <footer> <cite>Layla Ibrahim's legal team</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She was taken for a forensic examination, in which a blond pubic hair was discovered \u2013 strongly suggesting intimate contact between her and another. But this potentially vital piece of evidence was destroyed in the lab during DNA testing, her lawyers say. Bloodstained leaves were found near the scene \u2013the blood came from a male and was capable of forming a complete profile; however, this did not match any profiles on the DNA database at the time. Ibrahim told police she had fought off her attackers with her hands, yet her lawyers assert that her bloodstained ring was not tested for DNA, despite one of the officers writing in their notebook that this should be done. Ibrahim says she was later told the ring had been lost and it formed no part of the court case.</p> <p>Her shoes and leggings were also not tested for DNA, according to her legal team. In their submission to the review commission, they note: \u201cThere can be little worse than suffering an attack of this nature and then being disbelieved, prosecuted and imprisoned. If Ms Ibrahim\u2019s account is true (and, for the avoidance of doubt, we believe that it is) the injustice of her wrongful conviction is one of the most serious failures of the criminal justice system in recent times. We would ask you to note that our client has now served her sentence and has been released \u2013 this is not an attempt to appeal by a person seeking release from custody, but by a person seeking justice.\u201d</p> <p>The CCRC has the power to send cases to the appeal courts if its experts think there is a real possibility that appeal judges will quash a conviction or change a sentence. Usually the CCRC only considers cases where someone has already tried to appeal, unless there are \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Ibrahim did not appeal while in prison, claiming her barrister told her there was no point. She was also preoccupied inside with being a first-time mother, after her daughter was born in August 2010.</p> <p>Her lawyers believe her circumstances are exceptional, because her name could be cleared with fresh evidence they cannot obtain but which may fall within the CCRC\u2019s special investigative and information gathering remit.</p> <p>Her solicitor, Nigel Richardson, from Hodge Jones and Allen, argues that three local suspects were not investigated thoroughly. \u201cMore information about these suspects \u2013 namely their involvement in other sexual assaults \u2013 has come to light since the conviction. This information demands further scrutiny and investigation,\u201d he writes in the submissions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One day it could be your sister, your auntie or your cousin being told they have \u2018wickedly fabricated a grave crime\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Layla Ibrahim</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One possible suspect was a paranoid schizophrenic from the local area. Shortly after Ibrahim claims she was attacked, a 25-year-old man was jailed for grabbing and violently raping a woman. According to Thompson, by the time the man was arrested for that crime, Cumbria police were no longer investigating Ibrahim\u2019s rape, having decided she had made it all up.</p> <p>Yet Ibrahim insists the efit she provided to police bears a \u201cstriking\u201d resemblance. The manner of his attack also bears the same hallmarks as her own.</p> <p>Unused evidence bundles from the trial have yielded witness statements from members of the public who reported men seen the area at the time of the attack. Their descriptions matched those given by Ibrahim yet were not followed up by police.</p> <p>During Ibrahim\u2019s trial in the summer of 2010, no real motive was offered by the crown. In his draft opening note, the prosecuting barrister, Tim Evans, makes reference to a text conversation Ibrahim had with her ex-boyfriend a few hours before the attack. The ex \u201cfobbed her off\u201d, Evans told the jury. In the judge\u2019s summing up there was also mention of an argument over a tomato sandwich with her ex a few days before the attack.</p> <p>Evans also suggested she was cross because her friends refused to share a taxi home with her. A year after the incident, one of those friends, Richard Dent, told police he remembered her saying, shortly before walking home, \u201cwhat would you do if something happened to us?\u201d According to Ibrahim\u2019s lawyers, Dent sent texts to her saying the police had pressed him and her ex to make her look bad in their statements.</p> <p>Opening the case, Evans suggested Ibrahim may have faked the attack in order to teach Dent and her ex \u201ca lesson\u201d and gain some sympathy. Much emphasis was placed on inconsistencies in her evidence \u2013 perhaps unsurprising considering she had been drinking on the night in question and claimed to have been knocked out during the attack. The prosecution also said that clumps of her hair were found too far away from where she claimed to have been attacked, suggesting she cut her own hair, as well as her dress, on her way home.</p> <p>Almost eight years on from that night Ibrahim is now happily married with three children. But she remains furious at what she insists was her wrongful conviction. \u201cThis is my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has ruined my life.\u201d</p> <p>She said she was speaking out to raise awareness of others prosecuted for making false rape allegations \u2013 figures compiled by campaigners in 2014 suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/dec/01/109-women-prosecuted-false-rape-allegations\">109 women had been in that position in the previous five years</a>. \u201cI want people to understand that this does happen.

There will be some way to clear my name. My kids deserve that too. That\u2019s all that matters to me,\u201d she said, insisting she had no interest in compensation. \u201cThere\u2019s no money in the world that would justify what happened to me.\u201d</p> <p>Her application to the review commission is being supported by Women Against Rape. Director Lisa Longstaff said in her submission: \u201cIt is our considered view that a number of miscarriages of justice have resulted from negligent and biased investigations into the original rape complaints. Ms Ibrahim\u2019s is such a case. We believe that her conviction is unsafe and should be quashed, and that there should be a new investigation so the men who attacked her can be brought to justice and stopped from attacking others.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Never mind <em>The Play That Goes Wrong</em>, the longest running farce in London is playing in the east rather than the West End. The Olympic Stadium Mystery took another twist this past week when it emerged that not only had the overall cost of converting the venue to (supposedly) make it suitable for football as well as athletics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/02/west-ham-olympic-stadium-deal-explained-london-mayor-sadiq-khan\">risen further to \u00a3323m</a> but that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/02/west-ham-stadium-losses-retractable-seating-problems\">unlikely to make an operational profit for many years</a> to come \u2013 if ever.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> understands West Ham United\u2019s new home, now renamed the London Stadium until a long delayed and increasingly elusive naming rights deal can be struck, was originally projected to be making a seven-figure operational surplus by the time it reached a \u201csteady state\u201d in 2018-19. It was on those projections that the case for the \u00a3752m stadium was made \u2013 that even at the favourable terms awarded to West Ham, the plan was the best way of ensuring the venue did not have to be subsidised by the taxpayer in perpetuity.</p> <p>But at the point at which the bill for moving the so-called retractable seats to host athletics and concerts in the summer rose from \u00a3300,000 to a staggering \u00a38m per year, all those sums went out of the window. And at no point did those in charge give any indication to the wider world of the scale of the problem \u2013 or, indeed, that the \u201cretractable\u201d seating solution chosen was not a state-of-the-art arrangement of rollers and air beds but literally rested on scaffolding and breeze blocks.</p> <p>Under the deal, signed in 2013 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/west-ham-olympic-stadium-club-pay-per-season-rent\">revealed in full only</a> this year following a dogged freedom of information campaign by a coalition of fan groups, West Ham agreed to pay \u00a315m towards the overall conversions costs plus \u00a32.5m in rent a year. The costs of the conversion have rocketed as the scale of the architectural challenge has become clear.</p> <p>Initially the cost of installing a new roof to replace the temporary canopy in place for the Games and putting in those 21,000 \u201cretractable\u201d seats was slated at \u00a395m. It then rose to \u00a3160m, before shooting up to \u00a3272m and now \u00a3323m. Those huge increases, largely requiring the stadium to be essentially rebuilt from the inside out on a site and foundations that were not designed for the purpose, will form part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/01/sadiq-khan-mayor-london-west-ham-stadium-inquiry\">inquiry announced last week by Sadiq Khan</a>, Boris Johnson\u2019s successor as London mayor.</p> <p>It is worth noting that when the \u00a3272m figure was published, in the final months of the Conservative Johnson\u2019s tenure, there would have been a desire to keep the figure as low as possible, while the motivation of Labour\u2019s Khan may have been to ensure it was as high as possible.</p> <p>One overlooked factor is the extent to which that original stadium, which eventually cost \u00a3429m, was to all intents and purposes entirely temporary, storing up trouble for the future. Even the white struts that appear to have remained from the old design had to be taken out and replaced, because they were not strong enough to support the new design.</p> <p>The only bit that remained was the part that was supposed to be temporary \u2013 the so called \u201cdemountable\u201d upper tier that under the original plans was due to be removed to leave behind an athletics stadium with a capacity of 25,000.</p> <p>Year zero for any serious analysis of what went wrong is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/feb/01/Olympics2012.politics\">the decision in 2007</a> not to consider a football future for the stadium, though it is possible to pull the lens back further and return to earlier schemes to make a joint-use stadium in the east end a centrepiece of any Olympic bid. Once the decision was made to press ahead with a stadium that could be converted into a smaller athletics venue but would be hugely challenging as a football arena, partly because of distaste at the idea of Premier League clubs getting their hands on a public asset for nothing but also the promises made to the International Olympic Committee to win the bid, the die was cast.</p> <p>Andrew Boff, the Tory London Assembly member who has been a critic of the handling of the stadium saga throughout, says: \u201cAt the end of the day this all boils down to one political objective \u2013 and that was to keep the running track at the Olympic Stadium. If we\u2019d said we weren\u2019t going to keep the running track, this could all have been avoided. Instead we have hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money being burned in front of Londoners\u2019 eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWe ended up with something that was neither fish nor fowl and suited to neither, desperately throwing taxpayers\u2019 money at it to cover the arse of some bad political decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from the consequences that flowed from that original decision, hamstringing the revolving cast of executives who would be charged with making a success of a flawed concept, there is plenty else for Khan\u2019s review to chew over. At regular intervals the goalposts have shifted at the behest of the politicians directing traffic \u2013 most obviously when Johnson became mayor in 2008, resolving to make the stadium work at a larger capacity and signalling a shift in strategy for the wider project.</p> <p>The entire history of the stadium is studded with disharmony, taking in sackings, resignations, industrial espionage and mud throwing. But it is impossible to overstate the levels of discord that still exist among the various bodies involved.</p> <p>It is hard to blame West Ham for behaving exactly as you would expect a modern Premier League club to. But it is also impossible not to wonder whether West Ham\u2019s vice-chair, Karren Brady, in her sharp-elbowed drive to get the best possible deal for the club, did not also sow the seeds for the dysfunctional state of their marriage of convenience.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/25/west-ham-fans-give-their-verdict-clubs-new-stadium-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54k4m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2750647\"            data-video-name=\"West Ham fans give their verdict on the club's new stadium \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e82ee0e4b0f55a9f4032bf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/25/160925hammers_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/25/160925hammers.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/25/160925hammers_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/25/west-ham-fans-give-their-verdict-clubs-new-stadium-premier-league-video\">West Ham fans give their verdict on the club\u2019s new stadium</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet there are pressing questions for all those others, too, who have slipped seamlessly from one senior position to another at the alphabet soup of bodies responsible, since 2005, for delivering the Olympics and their legacy. And for those politicians at national and local level driven by often competing priorities to the detriment of the whole. For those left to make sense of operating the stadium, the huge cost of moving the retractable seats in and out \u2013 and the fortnight it takes to do so \u2013 makes an already headache inducing game of 3D chess immeasurably harder. It is hard to see how either the West Ham tenancy or the 50-year agreement with British Athletics can be unpicked.</p> <p>As for what happens now, some have begun to wonder whether there might be a Millennium Dome style exit strategy \u2013 finding a private operator to take it off their hands and find a way to make sense of it. But the only likely buyer would be West Ham themselves \u2013 which would reignite criticism at an even greater ferocity.</p> <p>All parties are locked in their awkward embrace and must try to make it work \u2013 unless, that is, David Gold and David Sullivan do eventually sell up, as they have repeatedly insisted they will not.</p> <p>In her incomplete but often instructive account of being a fly on the wall, the anthropologist Dr Gillian Evans observes how the shifting political tides led to a constant turnover of senior staff and shifting sands. \u201cRather than watching people pushing a boulder up the mountain, studying the Olympic legacy is suddenly beginning to feel a bit like watching a surreal game, in which serious-minded people are trying desperately to construct a new piece of city on top of a merry-go-round that turns violently with each change in the political landscape,\u201d she notes in her recently published book <em>London\u2019s Olympic Legacy: The Inside Track</em>.</p> <p>It is probably a forlorn hope, given the desire to heap blame on Johnson\u2019s regime, but it would be a pleasant surprise if Khan\u2019s review also shed light on how political interference in major projects such as this warps priorities and how a combination of lack of transparency and overweening bureaucracy bends even the best intentions out of shape in the often opaque world of local government, quangos and development zones.</p> <p>On the one hand the London Legacy Development Corporation (which co-owns the stadium 65/35 with Newham council) is presented as eminently accountable \u2013 its website is full of varnished minutes of official meetings. Yet it battled for two years at huge cost to keep its contract with West Ham secret and any search will be in vain for mention of the problems that have sent costs to the taxpayer soaring.</p> <p>The LLDC occasionally, and largely in vain, tries to shift the focus to those areas of the Olympic Park where it believes praise is due for progress made. But when such chaos envelops its centrepiece it is little wonder that the stadium, more money pit than white elephant, continues to grab all the attention \u2013 for all the wrong reasons.</p>",
  "<p>There are times in football when you hear a story that sounds so daft, so utterly inconceivable, that if it happened in just about any other sport you would probably think it might be too far-fetched to be true.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this is football, land of the absurd, and it all fits into the narrative to learn that Coventry City, under the permanently bewildering Sisu regime, briefly discussed the idea \u2013 no kidding \u2013 of being the first club in England to introduce a \u201ctext\u2011a\u2011substitute\u201d option during matches. Supporters would be given a number they could text, at premium rates, to say who the manager should take off and who should come on. An announcement would be made at the appropriate time about the most popular vote and the manager, the poor patsy, would be under instructions to comply with the crowd\u2019s wishes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/xxxx\">The London Stadium: an unloved venue resulting from expensive mistakes | Owen Gibson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be fair, the idea did not get far, but it does you give you an example of the boardroom buffoonery that is prevalent within the sport and it did make me wonder whether the supporters of Southampton, experiencing the kind of joys the modern-day Coventry can scarcely imagine, ever contemplate how life might have been entirely different but for one of those <em>Sliding Doors</em> moments that has sent the two clubs in their respective directions.</p> <p>When the story of Southampton\u2019s success is told, it tends to be forgotten that Sisu, the hedge fund that has brought Coventry to their knees, was once on the brink of buying the south\u2011coast club and closing a deal that, 125 miles north, would have spared another club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/12/coventry-city-decline-despair-league-one\">the distress it has endured over the last nine years</a>.</p> <p>How close was it to happening? Very close. On 19 October 2007, the directors of Southampton Leisure Holdings, the club\u2019s parent company, voted 5-2 in favour of accepting the \u00a340m deal that Sisu had put forward. Everything was in place until the proposals were rejected by three of the major shareholders \u2013 Rupert Lowe, Michael Wilde and Leon Crouch \u2013 to spark a falling-out that eventually split the board in two. The announcement of Sisu taking control at Coventry came eight weeks later and within three days Southampton\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hone, the chairman, Ken Dulieu, and the commercial director, Andy Oldknow, had quit, blaming \u201ca major difference of opinion between them and certain major shareholders\u201d.</p> <p>Knowing what we do now, we can all probably agree which club made the wiser decision, and who was offering the best advice, even if Southampton did have to endure some prolonged pain, including a spell in administration and relegation to League One, before Markus Liebherr\u2019s 2009 takeover began the recovery we see now.</p> <p>Dulieu was so embedded to Sisu he turned up at Coventry proclaiming himself to be the man who would save the club and announcing he used to \u201clook after security operations in Northern Ireland\u201d. Orange Ken, as he became known because of his perma\u2011tan, became chairman, then head of football operations, and started attracting suspicion when he ordered himself a training kit bearing his own initials. He invited himself into the dressing room when the manager, Andy Thorn, was giving his team talk and watched one game from the dugout, apparently living out some childhood fantasies, before the stink it caused led to his resignation. He left Coventry in the Championship\u2019s relegation zone, proudly claiming to have \u201cturned the club around\u201d and, unless someone can tell me otherwise, he has not worked in football since.</p> <p>It is amazing the kind of people this sport attracts and, unfortunately for Coventry, they have suffered more than most when it comes to the list of those passing through with big ideas, little expertise and the general sense that they think running a football club must be a doddle.</p> <p>Another was Leonard Brody, a Canadian entrepreneur and social media guru, who joined Coventry at the same time as Dulieu, forming part of the club\u2019s \u201cbest-ever board\u201d and in one meeting announced he had a master-plan to stop the club haemorrhaging so much money.</p> <p>The details are recounted in <em>A Club Without a Home</em>, a splendid new book telling the story of the Sisu years in the words of Simon Gilbert, the <a href=\"http://www.coventrytelegraph.net\"><em>Coventry Evening Telegraph</em></a>\u2019s award-winning chief reporter. \u201cLeonard Brody said he had 10 ideas, so I said: \u2018What is your best idea?\u2019\u201d Gary Hoffman, the former vice-chairman, tells the author. \u201cThat was when he talked about \u2018text a substitute\u2019. I said even if that was allowed under Football League rules, how do you think that\u2019s going to transform the revenues of Coventry City?\u201d</p> <p>Another idea was to make a Sky Blue Rolls-Royce available for wedding hire. Then, at the end of the meeting, someone asked if there was any other business and Hoffman remembers Sisu\u2019s representative, Onye Igwe, raising his hand. \u201cOnye said: \u2018Yes, I want to raise the subject of our mascot.\u2019 The club was going bust and he said: \u2018I think Sky Blue Sam is too fat and it\u2019s not setting a good example for children.\u2019 That\u2019s when Ray Ranson [the former chairman] said: \u2018Onye, it\u2019s a fucking elephant.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>We are all probably aware of what has happened to Coventry since and why Southampton should thank their lucky stars that Sisu (who also expressed an interest in Derby County and looked at Manchester City before Thaksin Shinawatra\u2019s takeover) ended up somewhere else.</p> <p>On the one hand, there is a Southampton side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/03/southampton-internazionale-europa-league-match-report\">that have just beaten Internazionale</a> to show, again, why they should be regarded as the prime example of what can happen at a medium-sized club that applies common sense, a sound business structure, makes shrewd appointments and understands what a football team means to the local community.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is a desperate, grieving club where the supporters old enough to remember the crumbling terraces of tatty, homely Highfield Road must pine for more innocent times and the scandal runs so deep John Sillett, one of the great names from Coventry\u2019s past, has shed tears while talking about it publicly.</p> <p>Coventry have already suffered the indignity of a 68-mile round trip to Sixfields, Northampton Town\u2019s ground, to play their \u201chome\u201d matches and the really galling part is that however much the supporters protest, however many frothy column pieces are written, and whatever you or I might like to do about it, the owners still continue with the same cold detachment.</p> <p>The club have no stadium agreement beyond next season, the training ground could be sold off for housing and their academy is at risk of closure. Coventry look like they have been dragged through a hedge fund backwards and the scary thing is it might get even worse. The club, in Gilbert\u2019s opinion, face the \u201cvery real possibility of dropping out of the Football League completely in the coming years unless something dramatic happens to change their fortunes for the better\u201d.</p> <p>When we spoke on Friday it was the morning after Southampton had beaten Inter, six years to the week since the south-coast club faced Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in League One. \u201cMost supporters probably thought Coventry City had got one over on Southampton by attracting Sisu,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cIn reality, Southampton dodged a bullet.\u201d</p> <p>It all feels incredibly sad and unsatisfactory when next May ushers in the 30th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2014/may/16/fa-cup-final-tottenham-coventry-classic-1987\">that sun-drenched FA Cup final</a> against Tottenham Hotspur, Keith Houchen\u2019s diving header, Brian Kilcline\u2019s wild hair and Sillett swigging imaginary champagne, back in the days when it felt like that competition meant everything.</p> <p>There are Coventry supporters of a certain generation who can remember when it was their team making similar headlines to the ones Southampton now attract and, in 1970, winning 2-1 against Bayern Munich in the Inter\u2011Cities Fair Cup, the equivalent of the Europa League (albeit having lost 6-1 in the first leg).</p> <p>These days, however, they are just trying to make sure \u201cplay up, Sky Blues\u201d is not heard in the fourth tier next season. The fitness coach, it transpires, had to find a lawnmower and cut the grass after the team arrived for one match at the Ricoh to discover nobody else had bothered. And a once-proud club must look back at the day the deal was signed with Sisu and wish, desperately, it had been another way.</p> <h2>United put beds ahead of football </h2> <p>Three years have passed since Ed Woodward, Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, said he would look at returning the words \u201cfootball club\u201d to the team\u2019s official badge and made it clear he did not agree with the decision, taken during the Peter Kenyon years, to remove it in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like that change of badge,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cJoel [Glazer] didn\u2019t like that change. We will look at that and have a think about that. We are a football club, not a business.\u201d</p> <p>The two can go hand in hand, of course, but if United were serious about changing it back they appear to have quietly abandoned the idea and it is tempting sometimes to suspect their priorities might be somewhat blurred when they do not even hold a press conference after making Paul Pogba the world\u2019s most expensive footballer but arranged one last week to plug a bedding company from Shanghai.</p> <p>Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Luke Shaw looked absolutely thrilled, as you can imagine, to go through their carefully rehearsed lines about \u201cthe cutting-edge technology\u201d of the mattress that had just been lugged on stage and I have it on good authority the players, as a whole, have been complaining behind the scenes about the increasing amount of time they are expected to devote to these kind of commercial events.</p> <p>They get paid well enough, you might think, to suffer in silence but equally they probably have a point when they returned from one night game in London in the early hours and, rather than resting, had to clock in the following morning to film a go-kart race outside Old Trafford, driving a fleet of miniature Chevrolets.</p> <h2>Andrew\u2019s elbow met by silence</h2> <p>The video footage of Calvin Andrew elbowing an opponent to the side of his head is the most brutal piece of violence I have seen on a football pitch since the night, in 2006, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/sep/29/newsstory.sport7\">Ben Thatcher</a> appeared to overdose on his own testosterone and delivered the forearm smash that left Pedro Mendes unconscious on the side of Manchester City\u2019s pitch.</p> <p>Andrew\u2019s assault on Peter Clarke while playing for Rochdale against Oldham Athletic last weekend has left him with a 12-match ban, one of the longest punishments ever meted out by the Football Association. It was a pity, though, that the announcement was not accompanied by any statement from his club making it clear what they thought of his behaviour, or any form of public contrition from the player, and it hardly reflects well on Andrew that he admitted the charge of violent conduct but also had the gall to argue it did not deserve more than the standard three-match ban.</p>",
  "<p>For half an hour it appeared as if England were incapable of actually beating Scotland, let alone running up the points required to give themselves a fighting chance of making the Four Nations final. Time will tell whether the 26-point margin of victory is enough but, if nothing else, this was at least a victory for Wayne Bennett\u2019s side that keeps their hopes of progression alive.</p> <p>Scotland were comfortably beaten 54-12 in Hull by Australia last week, but for most of the opening 40 minutes in Coventry, England looked anything like the side tipped by many to reach the final at Anfield.</p> <p>Crucially though, they eventually found their rhythm \u2013 and, in the process, Bennett will have learned a few lessons as he looks to finalise his team for their must-win game against Australia in London. George Williams excelled at half-back and now looks the favourite to partner Gareth Widdop while Mark Percival and Liam Farrell also look to have done enough to be given a chance against the Kangaroos.</p> <p>Bennett was unimpressed, telling the BBC: \u201cWe were bad, we weren\u2019t good first 20. We got closer to what I expect in the second half. I want them to play to their ability and they were a way off that. They have got a bit of thinking to do, they need to have a look at themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland were 22-0 down to Australia after 15 minutes in their opening fixture but they were much more composed here and the better side by some distance.</p> <p>England briefly threatened in the opening minutes but, as the influence of the Scotland captain, Danny Brough, grew on the game, the Bravehearts quickly got on top, taking a deserved lead when a wonderful pass from Brough created the space for Kane Linnett to dive over.</p> <p>That should have been the catalyst for England to wake up; instead, they fell further behind. It was again their right side the Scots targeted, this time gaining success when the Warrington wing Matty Russell produced an incredible piece of individual play to touch down in the corner and double Scotland\u2019s lead as the prospect of a major upset began to grow.</p> <p>Even though Brough \u2013 the Dewsbury-born half-back who was constantly overlooked for the England side during Steve McNamara\u2019s tenure \u2013 could not convert, his reaction to Russell\u2019s try said it all: Scotland were not just in front, they were in control.</p> <p>As half-time approached, England eventually managed to spring into life when Luke Gale\u2019s delicate pass close to the line sent Elliott Whitehead charging over, with the scrum-half\u2019s conversion narrowing the gap to two.</p> <p>The balance of play begin to shift in England\u2019s favour and the Gale-Whitehead partnership bore further fruit when the Castleford half-back teed up Whitehead for his and England\u2019s second.</p> <p>Whether England deserved the four-point lead opened up by Gale\u2019s second conversion mattered little but having somehow forged an advantage at half-time their attention now had to turn to not just holding on but running up a comfortable margin of victory.</p> <p>England\u2019s fluidity drastically improved after half-time and Percival and Ryan Hall crossed for straightforward tries.</p> <p>Brough was sent to the sin-bin just before the hour mark and that enabled England to run in tries through Jermaine McGillvary, Gale and Farrell which, come the conclusion of the group stage, could prove crucial if points difference comes into play.</p> <p>Steve McCormack, the Scotland coach, told the BBC: \u201cI am really proud we tested them. In the second half the sin bin didn\u2019t help but I am really proud.\u201d</p>",

Eden Hazard\u2019s two goals, both scored after trademark solo bursts forward, make him man of the match by a whisker, but Pedro and Diego Costa were equally lethal going forward, while Victor Moses, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Marcos Alonso and Nemanja Matic all deserve a name check for their relentless midfield efforts. <br></p> <p>As good as Chelsea were, Everton simply didn\u2019t turn up. The game was up after 20 minutes, and Ronald Koeman\u2019s tactical tweaks had no impact, with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku cut out of the game completely. They face Swansea after the international break before tests against Southampton and Manchester United.</p> <p>Chelsea face Middlesbrough (A), Tottenham (H) and Man City (A) next. We\u2019ll have a better idea of their title credentials in a month, but they\u2019re top of the table, with five wins and five clean sheets in a row.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/29/mike-godwin-nazi-analogies-meme-update\">Godwin\u2019s Law</a> does not apply in dangerous times. If you want to hear echoes of today\u2019s threats against liberal democracy, turn to Nazi Germany. It denounced everyone, from Germans who sympathised with Jews to the \u201cclique of criminals\u201d in the army who failed to assassinate Hitler, as <em>Volksverr\u00e4ter</em>. In the Soviet Union, from Lenin via Stalin to the fall of communism, the same sentiment found a different expression. The millions who failed to please the glorious socialist motherland were <em>vrag naroda,</em> who deserved exile and death in Siberia for the sabotaging the workers\u2019 paradise.</p> <p>The English translation of <em>Volksverr\u00e4ter</em> and <em>vrag naroda</em> is \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, which was how the <em>Daily Mail</em> described three judges, who decided that the law required the prime minister to seek the approval of parliament before triggering Brexit. \u201cThe most fundamental rule of the UK constitution is that parliament is sovereign,\u201d they said. It was hardly a controversial argument. Britain had fought civil wars in the 17th century to make the point clear, after all.</p> <p>For this assertion of a fundamental conservative principle, the <em>Mail </em>said the judges were the enemies of the people, the <em>Telegraph</em> said they were frustrating the will of the people and the <em>Sun</em> said they were a \u201cloaded foreign elite\u201d defying the will of \u201cBrit voters\u201d.</p> <p>It is true but still not accurate enough to say the British right is on the rampage for the first time since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s day. (Those too young to remember Thatcher will soon learn why you should must never allow the right out of its cage.) But the analogy does not hold. The Thatcher generation of conservatives subscribed to a comforting story about Britain that was not wholly a lie. Unlike the continentals, it ran, the sensible British did not have the guillotines of the French Revolution or the terrors of Nazi Germany and communist Russia. We believed in gradual change, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the sovereignty of parliament, not totalitarian theories with genocidal consequences.</p> <p>You cannot say the same about the new demagogic right now in power. When checks and balances stand in its way, it wants to smash them in the name of \u201cthe people\u201d. To escape the Europe of the present, it is reviving the language of the Europe of the past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/30/theresa-may-lie-and-lied-to-become-prime-minister\">Theresa May lied and lied again to become PM | Nick Cohen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the judges had tried to overturn the referendum result, or parliament was threatening to keep us in the EU, you could at least excuse them.</p> <p>But the court merely said Theresa May had no power to implement one of the most complicated tasks modern Britain has attempted without the authority of the sovereign legislature.</p> <p>You might object that I am building a grand theory on a few press cuttings.

May and her justice secretary had to be forced to defend the judges even when the yobs of Ukip demanded their dismissal. Stephen Phillips, one of May\u2019s own MPs, who supported Britain leaving the EU, incidentally, could nevertheless smell the faint but sharp stink of Putinism coming from Downing Street.

Journalists, political scientists, sociologists and economists have written with care about the pessimism and xenophobia of the left behind and the power lusts of the leaders of the radical-right middle class.

  "<p>Manchester City failed to avoid anticlimax after the thrill of beating Barcelona when they conceded a late Marten de Roon equaliser that left Pep Guardiola disgusted in the technical area.</p> <p>The Dutch midfielder\u2019s added-time header came as City scintillated before the break and seriously ran out of gas after it. Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s 43rd-minute finish \u2013 a 150th goal in 223 appearances for the club \u2013 appeared to be the winner until Adama Traor\u00e9 was left free to run across almost the whole field from the right, George Friend was allowed to float the ball in and De Roon beat City\u2019s jumpers to finish past Claudio Bravo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/bournemouth-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\">Jermain Defoe spot-on at Bournemouth to give Sunderland first win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Kevin Friend blew for time moments later the referee\u2019s whistle was accompanied by boos \u2013 perhaps to tell Guardiola that when any opposition is not killed off a smash-and-grab can occur.</p> <p>This meant City have drawn their last three home league games, having also shared the points with Southampton and Everton. A frustrated Guardiola said: \u201cDo you think it is a problem when the opponent arrives two times a game and we arrive 10 times? In all three games we are much better than the opponent. Now we talk and analyse, is it a problem in the box [not finishing and conceding].

Everton and Southampton as well, when you see all three games, we drop six points, they arrive maybe four or five times in our box.

Overall he could be pleased by a first half-hour of domination but anxious his team had not capitalised.</p> <p>From the side that downed Barcelona, Guardiola made three changes. Out went Willy Caballero, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, and Raheem Sterling and in came Bravo (who had been suspended), Aleksandar Kolarov and Jes\u00fas Navas. Otamendi and Sterling were rested. Of particular interest was how Kolarov, a left-back by trade, beat Vincent Kompany to a centre-back berth, the captain having to settle for a replacement role.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/03/football-transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-to-leave-city-for-real-madrid\">Football transfer rumours: Sergio Ag\u00fcero to leave City for Real Madrid?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ag\u00fcero continues to be in a challenge to convince Guardiola of his enduring worth and all he can do is keep on scoring and contributing as he did again here on Saturday.</p> <p>During City\u2019s first-half onslaught Guardiola bent to his knees in anguish as David Silva blazed at V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s and the Spaniard\u2019s reflexes impressed as they had previously.

Wales 8-32 Australia</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A day to forget for Wales and a 12th consecutive loss to Australia</strong>. A bit more fight in the second half and a well-taken try from Scott Williams, but in a cohesive attacking sense, it was dross. Utter dross. Significant backwards steps have been taken since the summer tour in New Zealand. They have a habit of starting autumn campaigns slowly but that\u2019s no excuse for the abject defending, in the first half particularly. Ross Moriarty at least put in a shift and can take a bit of credit, Tipuric too in patches, everyone else \u2026 nope. Not after their heaviest defeat by Australia since 2007 and the heaviest against the Wallabies in Cardiff since 1991.</p> <p><strong>Take nothing away from Australia though</strong>. They were marvellous. They speed, the fluidity with which they attack is a delight to watch. The chasm between the north and south in that sense remains as big as ever. Australia ruled the breakdown and as a result Foley had plenty of front foot ball and he had a field day. That probably doesn\u2019t do him justice \u2013 he was magnificent, at the level he was when ripping England to pieces last year. Outside him Hodge, Kuridrani and Folau also enjoyed themselves and after a difficult year, Australia will be buoyant that their November tour can ensure it finishes on a high.</p> <p><strong>A first Grand Slam since 1984?</strong> That may be getting ahead of ourselves a touch and they did leave plenty of points on the pitch but they will head to Scotland now full of confidence and deservedly so.</p> <p><strong>Next for Wales</strong>, Argentina are the visitors and Howley will hope, pray, that he has Warburton and in particular Liam Williams available. Still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/japan-argentina-international-rugby-union-match-report\">Argentina showed Japan no mercy</a> earlier today and if they are in the mood they can be very difficult to leave with. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ad408fe8a2bb80dc31f2276af944e85e313cf9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ad408fe8a2bb80dc31f2276af944e85e313cf9c/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dejected Wales captain Gethin Jenkins leads his team off the pitch following their 32-8 defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dejected Wales captain Gethin Jenkins leads his team off the pitch following their 32-8 defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T16:41:29.417Z\">at 4.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581e05ace4b07ceadb3a2c23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T16:18:03.451Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Quade Cooper is on and flicks an inside pass.

Australia have played with a speed and accuracy that Wales simply cannot live with. Some of the Wales defending has been abject but the Wallabies have toyed with the hosts.</p> <p><strong>They\u2019ve scored three excellent tries</strong> through Moore, Hodge and Kuridrani and if Foley \u2013 who has been magical with ball in hand \u2013 had his shooting boots on it could be worse. Wales should have seen it coming. Michael Cheika warned that Australia would be targeting the breakdown and the speed at which they are recycling possession is meat and drink for Phipps and Foley. Wales are defending too narrow and Folau, Hodge and Kuridrani are having a field day.</p> <p><strong>Positives for Wales? </strong>They should be further behind. Much further. They can\u2019t be as bad as this in the second half, can they? Shaun Edwards will be reading the riot act at present and Wales always begin the autumn rusty right?

Kurtley Beale\u2019s last-gasp try in 2012 \u2013 and the added ignominy of Nathan Sharpe taking the conversion \u2013 or the series Down Under earlier that year when late penalties from Berwick Barnes and Mike Harris condemned them to consecutive narrow defeats.</p> <p><strong>Of course there\u2019s also last year\u2019s World Cup</strong> pool encounter when Wales failed to break down the Wallabies\u2019 defence despite playing against 13 men for nearly 10 minutes before Bernard Foley kicked Australia clear with Welsh spirits crushed.</p> <p><strong>The good news for Welsh fans</strong> is that over the summer in New Zealand there were signs that a move away from Warrenball was beginning to pay off.

  "<h2>NEYMAR V MESSI</h2> <p>And you thought England v Scotland was this week\u2019s big grudge match. The giants of South America meet in Belo Horizonte on Thursday night in a <strong>key World Cup qualifier </strong>with Barcelona team-mates Neymar and Lionel Messi carrying the weight of their respective nations. Brazil lead the 10-team table with 21 points after 10 games. The top four go through and fifth-place face a play-off. Worryingly for Argentina they currently sit sixth, but it is tightly packed with six games to go and a win over their old rivals could take them into third. Defeat, though, would be very problematic indeed.</p> <h2>GATHERING IN LONDON</h2> <p>The draw for the <strong>ATP World Tour Finals</strong>, the big-money season closer, at the O<sub>2</sub> is made in London this week before the action kicks off next Sunday. New No1 seed Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka, Milos Raonic (if he is fit), Kei Nishikori, Gael Monfils, Marin Cilic and Dominic Thiem have qualified to compete for a prize pot worth $7m (\u00a35.6m). The draw will form two groups of four, from which the top two will qualify for the semi-finals.</p> <h2>KINGS OF THE OCHE</h2> <p>Expect tributes to the broadcaster Dave Lanning, who passed away last week, as 32 of the world\u2019s best players gather in Wolverhampton for the 10th staging of the <strong>Grand Slam of Darts</strong>. Twenty-four of the PDC\u2019s arrow slingers will be joined by eight of the BDO\u2019s tungsten chuckers and it would be a surprise if any of those from the latter reached the final. Michael van Gerwen, the reigning champion, is the one to watch again but Phil Taylor will be there, too. He has won six of the previous nine outings.</p> <h2>BAIZE BONANZA</h2> <p>In a similar vein, Coventry\u2019s Ricoh Arena plays host to snooker\u2019s <strong>Champion of Champions </strong>from Monday, where 16 players will battle it out for the \u00a3100,000 winner\u2019s pot. Neil Robertson is the reigning champion having overcome Mark Allen\u2019s challenge 12 months ago. The unmissable Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan withdrew then, but he has qualified this time as No3 seed, beginning with a tie against Finland\u2019s Robin Hull in a quickfire best of seven shootout.</p> <h2>CHECK MATE</h2> <p>Another round of <strong>Checkatrade Trophy awkwardness </strong>\u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/08/new-efl-trophy-premier-league-academy-teams-fans\" title=\"\">reformatted, rebranded Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy</a>, now featuring the glamour and credibility of top-flight U23 sides, and widespread fan boycotts. Among the ties: Everton\u2019s U23s at home to Blackpool, Chelsea U23s v Oxford, and Wolves U23s v Accrington. Last month Accrington tweeted after their 4-1 win at Chesterfield: \u201cReports of an away following of 2 at Chesterfield last night are untrue. We counted at least 6.\u201d</p> <h2>LOOK OUT FOR \u2026 A CRICKET SCORE</h2> <p><strong>We\u2019re on cricket this week? </strong>No, World Cup football \u2013 but it could feature a cricket score on Friday. As in a mauling, a thrashing, a romp, a trouncing. It\u2019s San Marino versus the world champions.</p> <p><strong>Could be messy. </strong>It\u2019s a proper mismatch. Germany are the toughest opponents Europe\u2019s most-loved minnows have faced for a while and the two times they\u2019ve met before, a decade ago, ended 6-0 and 13-0. On the other hand, San Marino are on a high of their own after a landmark moment last month.</p> <p><strong>They won? </strong>No, but they scored an away goal in a qualifier against Norway. They still lost 4-1, but it was a special moment for the 201st-ranked side \u2013 Mattia Stefanelli equalised, sparking wild celebrations, and provoking an instant viral clip of the reaction in the Norwegian broadcaster\u2019s studio. It was San Marino\u2019s first away goal in World Cup qualifying in 15 years. The icing on the cake: Stefanelli won CNN\u2019s goal of the week competition.</p> <p><strong>Isn\u2019t all this a bit patronising? </strong>Yes, but the team and the fans rise above it and they boast one of the most entertaining unofficial official Twitter feeds in international football. @Soccersanmarino reacted to their goal in Norway with: \u201cWE [EFFING] SCORED AN AWAY GOAL. STEFANELLI YOU [EFFING] LEGEND!\u201d \u2013 a message that retweeted more than 37,000 times. The writer later reflected: \u201cI have more retweets on this tweet than there are inhabitants in San Marino. Madness.\u201d</p> <p><strong>But even with all that positivity, Friday will be a cakewalk for the visitors? </strong>Surely. Then again, England thought the same when they went there in 1993, and they conceded after 8.3 seconds. It made for a classic piece of high-pitched breathless commentary from Jonathan Pearce, who was covering it for London\u2019s Capital Gold radio: \u201cWelcome to Bologna on Capital Gold Sport for England versus San Marino with Tennent\u2019s Pilsner brewed with Czechoslovakian yeast for that extra Pilsner taste and England are one down.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Germany would never let that happen\u2026 </strong>Seems unlikely. They\u2019re at their slickest right now: top of Group C and lifted by having newly retired record-scorer Miroslav Klose on Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s coaching team. L\u00f6w, meanwhile, plans to celebrate his recent contract extension by taking his squad to meet the pope before they play Italy on the 15th. \u201cIt does not matter which religious ideologies you have,\u201d L\u00f6w says. \u201cThis will be great day.\u201d</p>",

There was no other option.</p> <p><strong>Nothing ever felt like a sacrifice at the time. </strong>But looking back I can see that I never took vacations, I missed babies being born and I missed funerals. I realised that if I stayed in LA over Thanksgiving I\u2019d get jobs because everyone else had left town. I was always working.</p> <p><strong>I have no major regrets. </strong>I\u2019ve made the conscious decision not to look at life that way.

Though American women have made some political gains during that period, there has only been one woman so far with a real chance of smashing that glass ceiling: Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>And yet some women, especially young women, have greeted Clinton\u2019s historic candidacy with muted enthusiasm.</p> <p>\u201cI want there to be a woman president, of course,\u201d said Maria Alcivar, a graduate student at Iowa State University and reluctant Clinton supporter. \u201cI just don\u2019t see why it had to be <em>her.\u201d</em></p> <p>Across the country over the last 18 months, several women have expressed similar sentiments: a wish that the potential first female leader was someone less flawed and less polarizing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because women have higher and harder barriers to clear, the women that win need to exceed expectations</p> <footer> <cite>Adrienne Kimmell, Barbara Lee Family Foundation</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Experts say there is no predictable route to the presidency for a female candidate, not least because the trail is still being blazed. But there is a case to be made that the first woman to get this close to the presidency would probably look a lot like Clinton: a nationally recognizable figure with an extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and close proximity to power.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a saying, the first into battle needs to wear the most armor,\u201d said Adrienne Kimmell, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.barbaraleefoundation.org/\">Barbara Lee Family Foundation</a>, which studies women running for executive office.</p> <p>She continued: \u201cBecause women have higher and harder barriers to clear the path to executive office, the women that win need to exceed expectations \u2013 so by comparison they tend to be more qualified than their opponents.\u201d</p> <p>A 2011 <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00512.x/abstract\">study</a> identified what the researchers called the \u201cJackie (and Jill) Robinson effect\u201d, a reference to the first African American player in Major League Baseball.

The most common route to the US presidency is through the Senate or a governor\u2019s mansion, which greatly narrows the pool of prospective female candidates, since there are currently only 20 women serving in the 100-strong US Senate, 84 congresswomen (19%) and six female governors.</p> <p>Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 1987, has spent a lot of time over the last 18 months thinking about what has changed for women since she first entered Congress in 1973.<br></p> <p>\u201cSexism is a lot harder to pinpoint than it was but it\u2019s clearly still there,\u201d she said.</p> <p>When Schroeder first arrived in Congress she faced questions from her male colleagues about how she managed to raise two small children while being a lawmaker.

It\u2019s Pozzi\u2019s first time working on a presidential campaign. He responded to a volunteer callout on Twitter and drove up from his home in Washington DC, planning to stay at a nearby hotel until election day.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump is not my first choice,\u201d says Pozzi as he steers his Buick through the suburban streets. A registered Democrat (he voted for Obama twice) and former Bernie Sanders fan, he\u2019s now an active member of the alt-right. But rather than the Twitter troll stereotype, he\u2019s friendly and open, immediately willing to let me tag along with him and regularly cracking jokes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bb8a812414c0338ef573a72ca2aea14cced3796\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb8a812414c0338ef573a72ca2aea14cced3796/0_536_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ernie Pozzi: \u2018We have owners.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ernie Pozzi: \u2018We have owners.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amber Jamieson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pozzi believes the entire system of government is corrupt, and this election has radicalized him. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.

Pozzi believes certain billionaires \u2013 such as the Rothschild family and George Soros \u2013 are the \u201cowners\u201d of society and chose Obama as a candidate because he was black and therefore guaranteed to lose, ensuring Clinton would become president. He thinks a similar thing happened in this election: the owners chose Trump as a candidate, assuming he had no chance of winning against Clinton.</p> <p>I head out with him and Mills to \u201csurvey\u201d voters in nearby East Norriton, a predominately white middle-class neighborhood. They take to the streets armed with two questions: \u201cCan Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/trump-pennsylvania-senate-race-pat-toomey-kate-mcginty\">Senator Pat Toomey</a> and the rest of the Republican ticket count on your vote this election?\u201d and if the reply is yes, \u201cWhat time of the day are you planning to vote?\u201d (Campaign staff can then follow up throughout the day with voters who haven\u2019t cast their ballots.)</p> <p>At the first few houses we try, no one is home \u2013 although every home seems to have a vicious guard dog inside barking at us. Mills, wearing a \u201cProud to be a Trump deplorable\u201d T-shirt, leaves pamphlets hanging from their door handles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If they took to the streets, I\u2019d go and and fight with them.

Most houses are decorated with pumpkins, scarecrows and leftover Halloween cobwebs. Redundant exercise bikes and strollers sit on balconies. Lawns are tidy. </p> <p>Finally, someone answers our knocking. A woman in her early 40s opens the door. Is she backing Trump? \u201cProbably not. I don\u2019t like him\u201d. </p> <p>The list of voters we\u2019re working from comes from an app that doesn\u2019t always show the homes in logical geographical order. Even though it\u2019s just days before the election, our list includes people who range from \u201chard Democrat\u201d to \u201chard Republican\u201d (with \u201cweak Democrat\u201d, \u201cswing voter\u201d and \u201cweak Republican\u201d the other available categories).</p> <p>After we knock on a dozen doors, jumping in and out of the car continuously, we finally find a Trump backer. A man says he\u2019ll head to the polls early on Tuesday morning and asks if we have a Trump sign for his yard. After the voter closes his front door, Mills notes the app says that \u201cMary\u201d, a \u201chard Democrat\u201d, lives there. Moments later, a woman down the street tells us: \u201cSorry, I\u2019m voting the other way.

  "<p>The finding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/rolling-stone-rape-story-lawsuit-ruling-sabrina-rubin-erdely\">Rolling Stone magazine defamed a University of Virginia administrator</a> is the latest in a series of legal decisions that experts say signal a hardening attitude to the media and other institutions. </p> <p>A jury on Friday found that Rolling Stone and writer Sabrina Rudin Erdely met the extraordinary standard of acting with \u201cactual malice\u201d in their depictions of Nicole Eramo, the university\u2019s former associate dean.</p> <p>In her lawsuit for $7.5m, Eramo claimed the publication\u2019s story cast her as the \u201cchief villain\u201d who \u201csilenced\u201d Jackie or \u201cdiscouraged\u201d her from reporting her alleged rape to police.</p> <p>The story published in November 2014 told the story of a University of Virginia student identified only as \u201cJackie\u201d who claimed that seven members of Phi Kappa Psi raped her in a gruesome fraternity initiation. The story initially spurred an outpouring of outrage <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/05/rolling-stone-uva-rape-story-columbia-school-journalism-review\">until it fell apart under scrutiny</a> from other news outlets. Within weeks, Rolling Stone had to apologize for not thoroughly fact-checking it.</p> <p>Jurors in this case had to find that the magazine\u2019s reporter and editors not only made a mistake but had knowledge of the falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.</p> <p>\u201cIt has to be egregious,\u201d said Samantha Barbas, a law professor specializing in media at the University at Buffalo. \u201cThe press has to know that something is false and print it anyway.\u201d</p> <p>The verdict comes on the heels of several recent high-profile cases where juries have found against institutions in cases involving invasion or privacy or defamation issues.</p> <p>Last month the News &amp; Observer of Raleigh was ordered to pay about $6m in a state bureau of investigation agent\u2019s libel lawsuit.</p> <p>Earlier this year a jury in St Petersburg, Florida, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/18/hulk-hogan-awarded-115m-in-damages-in-gawker-sex-tape-lawsuit\">delivered a $115m verdict against Gawker Media</a> after it posted a sex tape of Hulk Hogan with his best friend\u2019s wife. The verdict forced the sale of the company, and last week Hogan and Gawker\u2019s former owners settled for $31m \u2013 but not before the now-defunct site filed for bankruptcy. </p> <p>A month earlier, US sportscaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/07/erin-andrews-awarded-55m-in-lawsuit-over-nude-video-case\">Erin Andrews was awarded $55m</a> against Marriott Hotels after a Tennessee jury found the chain had not protected her from being filmed in the shower by a stalker.</p> <p>Barbas argued that the series of decisions signal that juries, reflecting public sentiment, are \u201cdisenchanted with freedom of speech\u201d since many had personally experienced, through social media, the damage that online speech can have.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve entered an anti-media cycle and we\u2019re seeing people, particularly public figures, getting a lot more litigious about what appears in the media, whether that\u2019s libel or invasion of privacy.\u201d At the same time, Barbas said, \u201cPublic figures are becoming more confident juries will be more sympathetic to them.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike the Gawker case, which claimed invasion of privacy, Eramo sued the magazine for allegedly casting her as the \u201cchief villain\u201d in its article. Because the judge ruled that Eramo was a \u201climited-purpose\u201d public figure, she couldn\u2019t simply claim that Rolling Stone was negligent in its reporting \u2013 she had to argue that the publication acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d.</p> <p>While Rolling Stone went to great lengths to unpick the failures of its reporting and fact-checking, including commissioning a report from the Columbia School of Journalism, it did not retract its characterization of Eramo. </p> <p>Mary-Rose Papandrea, a University of North Carolina law professor, said the greatest surprise in the case was that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a greater awareness to the high risk of litigation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis can only happen when journalists are too trusting in their sources and seemed to be hiding their heads in the sand to the truthfulness of what they\u2019re publishing,\u201d Papandrea said.</p> <p>In finding Rolling Stone liable, jurors accepted Eramo\u2019s claim that Erdely, the reporter, acted with actual malice on six claims \u2013 two statements in the article and four statements to media outlets after the story\u2019s publication. Barbas said the statements in the original article went from being inaccurate to libelous when Rolling Stone republished the article with corrections.</p> <p>\u201cRolling Stone knew that Jackie was not a credible source yet despite that they published the story and let it stay on their website. They reaffirmed the truth of it despite, by that point, having serious doubts about Jackie\u2019s credibility. So that was enough to constitute actual malice.\u201d</p> <p>In one objectionable statement, Erdely wrote that Eramo had a \u201cnonreaction\u201d when she heard from Jackie that two other women were also raped at the same fraternity. Another was Erdely\u2019s statement to the Washington Post days after the story was published that the University of Virginia administration chose not to act on Jackie\u2019s allegations \u201cin any way\u201d.</p> <p>Barbas believes the consequences of this verdict could be farther-reaching than the Gawker verdict, which was based on the broadcast of a sex tape on a site known for sensationalistic or gossipy material.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a sex tape, it\u2019s reporting on a legitimate subject. For a jury to say there\u2019s actual malice \u2013 a reckless disregard of the truth \u2013 is pretty strong and that\u2019s why this may have a stronger impact on the media than the Gawker case.\u201d</p> <p>For Rolling Stone, once at the forefront of 60s social upheavals, the verdict will come as a bitter blow. Not only has its reputation suffered, but it still faces a $25m defamation lawsuit from the University of Virginia\u2019s Phi Kappa Psi fraternity \u2013 where Jackie claimed her sexual assault took place. That case is set to go to trial next year.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>",

His former ghostwriter, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\">Tony Schwartz</a>, has pointed out how Trump\u2019s attacks on others aren\u2019t random, but constitute a precise inventory of his own faults: \u201cunstable\u201d, \u201creckless\u201d, \u201cbigoted\u201d, \u201ctrigger-happy\u201d, exhausted and prone to lying. </p> <p>As Sheena Monnin, the former Miss Pennsylvania sued by Trump after she criticized his Miss USA pageant, put it in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/10/25/former-miss-pennsylvania-sheena-monnin-intv-sued-by-trump-sot-cooper.cnn\">an interview</a> with CNN: \u201cI have a degree in psychology, and I understand that underneath the bullying tactics, there\u2019s usually a lot of emptiness, and a strong need to feed the ego.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-alt=\"{&quot;chart&quot;:&quot;trump&quot;}\"> </figure>  <p>Trump told his biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio: \u201cI don\u2019t like to analyse myself, because I might not like what I see.\u201d But the rest of us haven\u2019t had much choice. Like a traffic pile-up, the candidate\u2019s involuntary self-exposure has been impossible not to gawp at. (On that note, the October APA survey found that the election was having a significant negative impact on productivity.)</p> <p>Yet throughout this intensely psychological election, psychology professionals have been restrained by a widespread, though fragmenting, consensus that Trump\u2019s mental health ought not to be discussed at all. </p> <p>This stance is most clearly expressed in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s so-called <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/psychiatrists-cant-tell-us-what-they-think-about-trump/\">Goldwater rule</a> \u2013 the prohibition on diagnosis-at-a-distance introduced following the incident in 1964 when 1,100 psychiatrists told a news magazine they believed that Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for president, was unfit for office. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2016/08/the-goldwater-rule\">finger-wagging statement</a> released in August (\u201cThe Goldwater rule: why breaking it is unethical and irresponsible\u201d), the APA\u2019s president, Maria Oquendo, reaffirmed the ban. But while there are certainly strong arguments in favour of it \u2013 it risks undermining public confidence in psychiatrists, and stigmatising people with mental illness \u2013 it\u2019s been far from obvious, in 2016, that these outweigh the ethical arguments for flouting it. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/12/12447742/diagnosing-trump-sham-psychology\">Writing in Vox</a>, the psychologist Cedar Riener compared psychiatrists disregarding the rule to a doctor diagnosing cancer \u201cjust by looking at my behaviour or public statements\u201d. But in the case of psychological disorders, unlike physical illnesses, behaviour and speech are always the primary sources of diagnostic data. And it has often seemed as if we might have more direct access to the darkest recesses of Trump\u2019s mind than to some of our closest friends.</p> <p>\u201cLike many Americans, I was more amused than alarmed by Trump at the beginning,\u201d says <a href=\"http://dohertyrelationshipinstitute.com/\">Bill Doherty</a>, a marriage and family therapist from Minnesota. But as the Trump movement picked up steam, Doherty happened to be travelling in Austria, where he encountered a neo-fascist political demonstration and visited a concentration camp. \u201cSo I did some reading about the responses of mental health professionals in Germany and Austria in the 1930s, and they were largely silent, and some were complicit.\u201d </p> <p>Upon his return, he wrote a manifesto \u2013 <a href=\"http://citizentherapists.com/\">Citizen Therapists Against Trumpism</a> \u2013 which more than 3,300 of his colleagues have now signed. Doherty insists this doesn\u2019t violate the Goldwater rule \u2013 he\u2019s condemning Trumpism as a threat to public health, not diagnosing Trump as, say, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/22/is-donald-trump-a-textbook-narcissist/\">narcissist</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/07/trump-and-sociopathy/491966/\">sociopath</a>, the disorders most frequently attributed to him. </p> <p>As \u201ccitizen therapists\u201d, Doherty says, \u201cwe must be willing to speak out on issues that affect the mental health of our clients, instead of just sitting in our offices and dealing with the fallout.\u201d </p> <p>Trump-induced distress is especially acute, he says, for anyone who has been exposed to a personality style like his \u2013 focused on bullying, scapegoating and the kneejerk demeaning of critics \u2013 earlier in their personal lives. His status as a presidential candidate \u201cbrings legitimacy to his way of relating to other people. There have always been personalities like Trump, but his power and the hundreds of people at his rallies say to anyone who has any psychological vulnerability that, yes, their fears were legitimate, and that there\u2019s no accountability for anyone who says and does these things. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened in their lives: there\u2019s been no accountability for the people who harmed them.\u201d</p> <h2>Daddy issues: \u2018a fantasy of being rescued by a powerful father figure\u2019</h2> <p>Beyond the confines of therapy, the rise of Trump has demonstrated more broadly how bad we are at understanding politics in psychological terms. For months, an <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/15/12462760/trump-resentment-economic-anxiety\">almost entirely futile debate</a> between pundits has sought to establish whether Trump\u2019s supporters are motivated by economic anxiety or by racism, as if the two could be neatly distinguished and measured. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-alt=\"{&quot;chart&quot;:&quot;clinton&quot;}\"> </figure>  <p>For Jonathan Shedler, professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado school of medicine, his appeal is better understood through the lens of \u201ctransference\u201d: in times of stress, whatever the complex blend of causes for that stress, people revert to a childhood desire for an omnipotent protector \u2013 an understandable need in young children, but dysfunctional in adulthood. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is benefiting from a childlike fantasy of being rescued by an all-powerful, larger-than-life father figure, so all of these qualities get attributed to Trump,\u201d he says. If the candidate\u2019s serially outrageous behaviour fails to alienate them, that\u2019s at least partly because the appealing qualities they\u2019re seeing aren\u2019t really in him; instead, \u201cthey\u2019re in the minds of the people who are doing the attributing, expressing their not-quite-conscious yearnings.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the question of whether Trump himself is suffering from a personality disorder is beside the point, Shedler argues \u2013 the consequence of trying to force our thinking about personality into a \u201cmedical model\u201d in which narcissism or antisocial attitudes, like cancer, are discrete diseases, invading an otherwise healthy body. But Trump\u2019s narcissism, insecurities and viciousness are intrinsic components of who he is, and they\u2019ve already damaged the world\u2019s wellbeing \u2013 whether or not they\u2019re best thought of as formal disorders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/voters-experiences-us-2016-election-trump-clinton-campaign\">Pain, anger and fear: US voters deprived of a serious presidential election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a rally in Henderson, Nevada, earlier this month, Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-waste-time-money-energy-if-lose-229206\">told supporters</a>: \u201cIf I don\u2019t win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime, by a factor of 100.\u201d</p> <p>It was a fairly typical statement from Trump, in its profound self-absorption and total lack of interest in the impact of his victory or defeat on the country he proposes to lead.

  "<p>A Texas police officer has been fired for allegedly giving a sandwich filled with feces to a homeless man.</p> <p>Matthew Luckhurst lost his job for what the San Antonio police chief, William McManus, described as a \u201cvile and disgusting act\u201d.</p> <p>The incident is said to have taken place in May.

Luckhurst is a five-year veteran of the department who had been working downtown on bike patrol for a year.</p> <p>Police said that an internal affairs investigation was launched in July after an officer reported Luckhurst to his supervisor, and the case was presented to police and civilian review boards in October. Both recommended an indefinite suspension that was upheld after McManus met with Luckhurst last week.

They\u2019re sick and tired of the promises from these politicians,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Strimbu isn\u2019t the only one shilling for Trump with his sign. The election is inescapable in Youngstown. Local TV and radio is dominated by ads for the campaigns. Both candidates have been through town several times, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Between 1904 and 2004, the presidential candidate who won in Ohio also won the presidency 24 of 26 times. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/21/trump-ohio-democrats-working-class-voters-anywhere-but-washington\">Ohio is a swing state</a> and Mahoning is a swing county within a swing state.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df/0_115_4199_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Campaigns In Youngstown, Ohio on August 15, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump campaigns In Youngstown, Ohio, in August. \u2018Even though he\u2019s not intellectually there on a lot of things, if he surrounds himself with the right people, we\u2019re going to have this government running like a company,\u2019 says Bill Strimbu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A casual look at the economic numbers suggests things are going OK-ish in Ohio. Unemployment across the state has fallen dramatically under Obama (although here John Kasich, Ohio\u2019s governor, a former Trump rival and a current critic, gets more credit) and in the state as a whole is just below the 4.9% national rate. In Mahoning County, unemployment is down from close to 14% in 2010 but is still close to 6%, and that number <a href=\"http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/oct/26/valleys-unemployment-rate-up--in-septemb/\">has risen close to a percentage point</a> in the last year.</p> <p>But for Clinton\u2019s opponents, this election is more about existential economics than macro trends. Rightly or wrongly, Democratic critics in the county question whether they can survive four more years of business as usual, as dictated from Washington by denizens of either stripe. Trump, at least, promises change.</p> <p>\u201cEven though he\u2019s not intellectually there, I don\u2019t think, on a lot of things, if he surrounds himself with the right people, which I\u2019m hoping and praying he does, if he gets elected, we\u2019re going to have this government running like a company, and that\u2019s the way it needs to be, I think,\u201d says Strimbu.</p> <p>This was once steel country.

They cost $6m-$8m each and the company used to make four a year. It shipped two in 2015 and hasn\u2019t made one this year.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy biggest frustration is this: in 2007, before President Obama even became president, he ran on the platform that he was going to bankrupt the coal industry. He had a press conference where he literally declared war on coal. I do not believe in leading through punitive regulations, or punishing an industry into compliance with your agenda,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>Mitchell believes in climate change and agrees it should be addressed but, she says, business should be incentivized to change. \u201cPunishing an industry into bankruptcy, leaving hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans out of work. That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d she says. Clinton, she fears, will simply continue in Obama\u2019s footsteps.<br></p> <p>At the same time as business has slowed, War Fab\u2019s costs have risen. The company\u2019s healthcare costs increased by 14% following the introduction of Obama\u2019s signature healthcare policy, the Affordable Care Act. A rule that covers the dependent children of insured workers up to the age of 26, touted as a boon for parents of college kids, has also led to the coverage of many of her workers\u2019 adult offspring even though they are not in school. If those legal adults don\u2019t have their own coverage, they turn to their parents\u2019 insurance. The average number of dependents on War Fab\u2019s insurance in 2012 was 2.2; in 2016 it is almost 4.9, and some of the ensuing costs have had to be passed on to workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\" data-alt=\"unemployment chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\">unemployment chart</a> </figure>  <p>The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to dig its way out of the last recession with record low interest rates has also hurt War Fab. Low rates have led to a strong dollar and for the first time ever, the company is losing bids to Canada in terms of costs. \u201cI would lose whatever to China based on the labor and regulation rates. I used to always win those quotes from Canada. Now all that work is going north,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>The cost of doing business in the US has become too high even for those who want to, says Mitchell. During the election, Trump has been hit several times for using Chinese steel in his building while railing against their trading practices. \u201cWell, we use Chinese steel too,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to to survive.\u201d<br></p> <p>War Fab has remodeled and reshaped its business to meet the trends and Mitchell is confident she can do it again. But she says the federal government has done precious little to help and in the meantime she is denying work to a community crying out for it.

After a dozen initial friendlies the tradition of meeting every year was continued via the now defunct British Home Championships, which ran for exactly a century, interrupted only by the two wars.</p> <p>Following the demise of home internationals in 1984 the Rous Cup was contrived to ensure Anglo-Scottish matches took place for another five years, until the long tradition ended in 1989 with the score standing at 43 English wins, 40 Scotland wins and 24 draws.</p> <p>There have been five meetings since, with England winning at Wembley during Euro 96, in the first leg of their 1999 play-off at Hampden Park and in two more recent friendlies.

The prosaic truth of the matter is that Jack Charlton was a passenger for most of the game, sent to hang around upfield after injuring himself in an early challenge with Bobby Lennox, and though Scotland won the game they failed to top their group and it was England who made it instead to the 1968 European Championship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ba9aefba5d39c4a2bf677c44947924853015962\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ba9aefba5d39c4a2bf677c44947924853015962/0_155_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u2019s Denis Law in action at Wembley during the meeting in 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s Denis Law in action at Wembley during the meeting in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bentley Archive/Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet that is not how the game is remembered north of the border.

My friend bought his nephew an own-brand supermarket version of the Micro and his brother picked it up and put it in the bin.</p> <p>The adult version was an inevitability, and I have always scorned it as wilful infantilism, like taking up dummies or nappies because they look fun when your kid has them. But the EMicro One is a scooter with a motor, and a different beast; when you reach 5km an hour, the electric motor kicks in, then you are in a truly new transport space, somewhere between a three-year-old and a person with a mobility buggy.

  "<p>It is one of life\u2019s ironies that hotel rooms don\u2019t often encourage you to linger. You sleep and shower there. But laze around? Rarely. At the budget end, bedrooms are frequently stark, alienating shells with furniture seemingly designed to keep you moving. At luxury level, rooms can feel like pristine stage-sets \u2013 admirably chic but where do you flop down and put your feet up without worrying you might break something?</p> <p>That the solution to this might be a B&amp;B in York may sound absurd.

Their welcome is warm and chatty and, if you need insight, they are experts on York\u2019s attractions. Otherwise, they maintain a discrete \u2013 and discreet \u2013 presence.

They are a (not unpleasant) mishmash of furnishing styles and unfashionable textured wall coverings, which Matthew and Paul are gradually modernising (splashes of designer wallpaper and contemporary art; Freesia is one of the newer rooms). That homely style and the thorough heating, however, give the Bloomsbury an unusually cosy feel and there is no stinting on detail (iPod docks, safes, mist-free mirrors, UK-made Ebony toiletries). The rooms are well-maintained, too. My brass and enamelled iron bed is no rickety bone-shaker. The mattress is thick and firm.

The perpetual fog of American forgetting-gas had done its work. If two years are all it took to erase the memory of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, then we shouldn\u2019t hope for much awareness of that earlier crisis some 80 years ago, though there are a few old heads still around who lived it, and the experience of those times can be found readily enough in the archives and histories of the era. </p> <p>The country, to put it mildly, was different back then. Life was harder, and in places like the Texas hinterland \u2013 which today forms the big beating heart of the state\u2019s Republican base \u2013 it was a close approximation of 14th-century European peasant hell. The vast majority of rural Texans lived without electric power, which meant no refrigeration, no water pumps, no indoor plumbing, no furnaces, no electric stoves, no incandescent lights, no motors to power machines for milking or shearing. </p> <p> Even for those of us only one or two generations removed from the farm, it\u2019s almost impossible to conceive just how different life was, although the phrase \u201cnasty, brutish, and short\u201d comes to mind. Among the best guides to that time is \u201cThe Sad Irons\u201d chapter of The Path to Power, the first volume of Robert Caro\u2019s biography of Lyndon Johnson, which delivers a harrowing portrait of life as a medieval slog plunked down in the middle of 20th-century America. To take just one aspect of the slog: water. \u201cPacking water\u201d from the source \u2013 a stream or a well \u2013 to the house was a daily beatdown that often fell to the farm wife. As Caro writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A federal study of nearly half a million farm families \u2026 would show that, on the average, a person living on a farm used 40 gallons of water every day. Since the average farm family was five persons, the family used 200 gallons, or four-fifths of a ton, of water each day \u2013 73,000 gallons, or almost 300 tons, in a year. The study showed that, on the average, the well was located 253 feet from the house \u2013 and that to pump by hand and carry to the house 73,000 gallons of water a year would require someone to put in during that year 63 eight-hour days, and walk 1,750 miles.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/28/donald-trump-endless-war-memorial-day\">Endless war: Trump and the fantasy of cost-free conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Laundry was done outside, an all-day, muscle-intensive process that began with a huge vat of boiling water suspended over a roaring fire \u2013 imagine that on a July day in Texas \u2013 next to which someone \u2013 almost always the farm wife \u2013 would stand \u201cpunching\u201d clothes with a paddle or broomstick, the human equivalent of an automatic washing machine. Cooking was done with wood stoves, which were kept burning most of the day \u2013 summer and winter \u2013 for meals and baking, which in turn required constant tending \u2013 firewood in, ashes out. Because of the lack of refrigeration, most meals had to be prepared from scratch. In order not to starve in winter, a family had to can fruit and vegetables in summer, a hellishly hot process that went on for days and required the utmost precision. The wood stoves were also used to heat irons for pressing clothes, actual six- or seven-pound slabs of iron that had to be scrubbed, sanded, and scraped every few minutes to remove the soot. Farm wives dreaded the tedium of ironing day; hence, \u201cthe sad irons\u201d. Caro goes on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> A Hill Country farm wife had to do her chores even if she was ill \u2013 no matter how ill. Because Hill Country women were too poor to afford proper medical care they often suffered perineal tears in childbirth. During the 1930s, the federal government sent physicians to examine a sampling of Hill Country women. The doctors found that, out of 275 women, 158 had perineal tears. Many of them, the team of gynecologists reported, were third-degree tears, \u201ctears so bad that it is difficult to see how they stand on their feet.\u201d But they were standing on their feet, and doing all the chores that Hill Country wives had always done \u2013 hauling the water, hauling the wood, canning, washing, ironing, helping with the shearing, the plowing and the picking.</p> </blockquote> <p>Because there was no electricity. </p> <p>This state of affairs wasn\u2019t limited to Texas. In the early 1930s, more than six million of America\u2019s 6.8m farms were without electricity. From sundown to sunup these farmers and their families practically lived in the dark. Most kerosene lamps provided 25 watts of light at best, barely sufficient for reading, and they were dirty, difficult to use, and dangerous. Many farmers preferred to do their pre-dawn chores in the dark rather than risk having a kerosene lamp in the barn. Radio, of course, was out of the question. The news and entertainment available to urban America were effectively blacked out in rural areas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/nra-annual-meeting-guns-american-dream-hunter-s-thompson\">Fear, loathing and firearms: sensory overload inside the NRA's Mall of Death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then the Great Depression transformed what was an extremely hard life into an impossible one. With prices for crops, in real terms, falling below what they\u2019d been in colonial times, financial disaster began to overwhelm rural America. By the end of 1931, 20,000 farms a month were being foreclosed, with even greater numbers on the horizon. Farmers\u2019 pleas for relief \u2013 among them, a moratorium on foreclosures \u2013 were rejected by President Hoover, who in effect told America to quit whining and go chew on its moral fiber. Hoover seemed ignorant of a basic fact of human nature: people tend not to be models of obedience when they\u2019re starving to death. \u201cThey had put their faith in government,\u201d as one contemporary reporter said of the farmers, \u201cand government had failed \u2026 they reached a point where they could stand the strain no longer and moved toward open rebellion.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019re not likely to find this episode of American history in the school books. In Iowa, the Farmers\u2019 Holiday Association organized a strike in which farmers refused to bring food to market for 30 days. The strike soon spread to the Dakotas, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and beyond. Roads were picketed, then blockaded to enforce the strike. Telephone operators coordinated with striking farmers to warn them when soldiers or lawmen were headed their way. When 60 strikers were arrested in Council Bluffs, Iowa, a thousand farmers marched on the jail and forced their release. Four thousand men occupied the Lincoln, Nebraska, statehouse, and another 7,000 marched on the statehouse in Columbus, Ohio with the intention of establishing a \u201cworkers\u2019 and farmers\u2019 republic\u201d. Across the midwest, farmers began to band together in armed groups to stop foreclosures; lawyers and judges were threatened with hanging, stripped and beaten, and in at least one case, murdered. \u201cRebellion in the Cornbelt: American Farmers Beat Their Ploughshares Into Swords\u201d was the title of a December 1932 article in Harper\u2019s that described the farmers\u2019 increasing desperation and militancy.</p> <p> The cities were no calmer. Five thousand men took over the Municipal Building in Seattle. Thousands of unpaid teachers in Chicago mobbed the city\u2019s banks, and in New York, a Communist party rally in Union Square drew 35,000. Twenty-five thousand \u201cBonus Marchers\u201d\u2013 first world war veterans \u2013 occupied Washington, setting up camp with their families on the Mall; Hoover had them routed by US soldiers using teargas and fixed bayonets. Campaigning for re-election that fall, the president was greeted by snarling crowds and chants of \u201cHang Hoover!\u201d A gridlocked Congress dithered and bickered, inspiring one columnist to label it, \u201cThe Monkey House\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>To scholars it\u2019s known as \u201cthe mixed economy\u201d, the combination of dynamic free markets, effective government, and a strong labor movement that characterizes the world\u2019s most prosperous nations. Strict laissez-faire capitalism created extraordinary wealth in late 19th- and early 20th-century America. It also created extraordinary concentrations of economic and political power that threatened to undermine democracy, along with such virulent side-effects as frequent bank panics, wild vacillations of boom and bust, extreme social and income inequality, and monopoly control of major industries. The Gilded Age robber barons \u2013 the Goulds, the Vanderbilts, the Morgans and Rockefellers \u2013 did quite well under laissez-faire. Most of the rest of Americans were still stuck in the ditch, with little to no economic security, life expectancy of roughly 45 years and horrific infant mortality rates that claimed 300 babies per 1,000 in the cities.</p> <p>Recognition was growing that the extraordinary pressures of industrial capitalism required an updating of the social contract. Theodore Roosevelt acknowledged as much when he said in 1910, \u201cThe citizens of the United States must effectively control the mighty commercial forces which they have called into being.\u201d But it took the leadership of another Roosevelt, Franklin, along with the existential crisis of the Great Depression, to galvanize the political will that brought about this transition from laissez-faire capitalism to the mixed economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"192e81140b75f24c218da8eafa7176b4180f01c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/192e81140b75f24c218da8eafa7176b4180f01c1/0_0_2966_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural fresco titled The New Deal, at the Leonardo Da Vinci art school in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"979\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural fresco titled The New Deal, at the Leonardo Da Vinci art school in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt gave it a name, the New Deal, and it transformed American life so thoroughly that it\u2019s become invisible to us, as taken for granted as the air we breathe and the ground beneath our feet. Or as, for instance: electricity. As Caro shows in The Path to Power<em>,</em> 30 million farmers and their families lived in the preindustrial dark not because of technological obstacles \u2013 many lived within sight of power lines \u2013 or prohibitive cost to the utility company \u2013 plenty of farmers offered to pay the expense of running a line out to their homes \u2013 or that utility companies couldn\u2019t make a profit on rural lines \u2013 studies in Minnesota and Alabama showed that rural lines were profitable \u2013 but because rural electric service wouldn\u2019t be as profitable for utility companies as the urban market. The companies based their decision, as companies do, on capital risk and rate of return. Considerations of fairness, fellow feeling, or the greater social good simply didn\u2019t factor into the corporate calculus.</p> <p>This is known among economists as \u201cmarket failure\u201d. Sam Rayburn, the Texas congressman who led the legislative fight to bring electricity to rural America, stated it plainly during debate on the House floor: \u201cWhen free enterprise had the opportunity to electrify farm homes \u2013 after 50 years, they had electrified 3%.\u201d The Public Utilities Act of 1935 and the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 \u2013 crucial New Deal legislation \u2013 \u201cbrought the lights\u201d to rural America over the strenuous opposition of the utility lobby, which put out fake \u201cspontaneous\u201d mass mailings to members of Congress (one of the first instances of astroturfing in American politics) and pushed a whisper campaign alleging that President Roosevelt was insane. John Carpenter, president of Texas Power &amp; Light \u2013 there\u2019s a freeway named after him in Dallas \u2013 so loathed Sam Rayburn that he offered to spend any amount of money to defeat him in the next election.

When Roosevelt took office, the banking industry was in freefall, a \u201cmarket failure\u201d that threatened to finish off what was left of the US economy. The system of government support and regulation established by the New Deal over banks \u2013 deposit insurance, capital requirements, the Glass-Steagall Act (separating commercial and investment banks) \u2013 and over the financial industry in general \u2013 such as the Securities Act of 1933, AKA the \u201cTruth-in-Securities Act\u201d, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (if you think Wall Street is a rigged game these days, it\u2019s a seminary compared with the fraud-fest of the Roaring Twenties) \u2013 made bank panics and market crashes a thing of the past. From the mid-1930s into the early 1980s, the US financial industry enjoyed remarkable stability. Bank failures were rare, isolated events. The bipolar booms and busts of laissez-faire capitalism became the much more manageable phenomenon of the business cycle. This began to change with deregulation, starting with the bipartisan overhaul of the savings and loan industry in the early 1980s. \u201cAll in all, I think we hit the jackpot,\u201d said President Reagan as he signed the Garn-St Germain Act into law. Not quite. Within a few short years, there was no savings and loan industry, thanks to the frenzy of speculation and self-dealing that followed passage of Garn-St Germain. The biggest bank crisis since the Great Depression had erased an entire sector of American finance, leaving the American taxpayer on the hook for $160bn \u2013 a huge amount of money at the time, chump change compared with what was coming. The New Deal framework continued to be dismantled through the 1990s \u2013 Glass-Steagall bit the dust in 1998 \u2013 and, just as importantly, regulation was never extended to new markets in financial exotica like credit default swaps and derivatives. Banking and finance grew increasingly volatile, culminating (so far?) in the Great Recession of 2008, when only massive government intervention saved the economy.</p> <p>The air we breathe. The ground beneath our feet. New Deal initiatives produced much of the infrastructure that we rely on to this day, the roads, waterways, airports, bridges, sewers and water mains, courthouses, libraries and communications networks. The omnibus Farm Relief Act of 1933 saved and stabilized American agriculture, and began establishing the institutions that would make farming an economically feasible way of life for future generations. The national framework of social insurance \u2013 social security, unemployment and disability benefits, work programs and workers\u2019 compensation \u2013 protected citizens from the kinds of risks that private markets couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t insure. The final piece of the mixed economy got its due with the Wagner Act (1935), which established the rights of workers to unionize and bargain collectively with employers, helping to ensure that rising productivity would be reflected in rising wages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e323c5894e50f07ed060f0d13ddc2cf8fa99452a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e323c5894e50f07ed060f0d13ddc2cf8fa99452a/0_77_3498_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Works Progress Administration (WPA) crew rebuilding the Morris Canal in New Jersey.

Fred Koch, the multimillionaire father of the future multibillionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, had this to say in 1938: \u201cthe only sound countries in the world are Germany, Italy, and Japan.\u201d He found Germany to be a heartening counter-example to Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal: \u201cWhen you contrast the state of mind of Germany today [1938] with what it was in 1925, you begin to think that perhaps this course of idleness, feeding at the public trough, dependence on government, etc, with which we are afflicted is not permanent and can be overcome.\u201d</p> <p>The comparison is instructive. Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in January 1933. Five weeks later, Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as US president. Two leaders, both taking office at the same time, both faced with the economic and social chaos of the Great Depression. To say that they took vastly different approaches, with correspondingly divergent outcomes, would be an understatement on the order of a piano falling on your head. History shows that Fred Koch was about as wrong as a human being can be, and Nazi Germany is only the half of it. By every measure \u2013 life expectancy, infant mortality, income, education, productivity, corporate profits, scientific and technological innovation \u2013 the mixed economy ushered in by the New Deal was a huge success. Within a generation, the United States was enjoying the fastest sustained growth in recorded history, and, moreover, the prosperity was shared broadly, with income rising faster at the bottom and middle of society than at the top.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/american-politics-election-voters-suckers\">The phony in American politics: how voters turn into suckers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the 1950s, there was broad consensus in America that the mixed economy was \u201can established and useful reality\u201d, to borrow a phrase from a Roosevelt-era president of the US Chamber of Commerce (he was referring to collective bargaining). President Eisenhower, Republican, five-star army general and no big liberal, much less a communist (though he was accused of being one by the John Birch Society, which counted Fred Koch \u2013 him again \u2013 among its founders) broadened social security, expanded federal support of science and technology, and pushed for major infrastructure programs. Such was the political consensus that his legislation initiating the interstate highway system passed Congress with one dissenting vote in the Senate, and by voice vote in the House. In private, he mocked the arch-conservatives who dreamed of dismantling the New Deal. \u201cThere is a tiny splinter group \u2026 that believes you can do such things,\u201d he wrote in a letter to his brother Edgar. \u201cAmong them are HL Hunt \u2026 a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t miss your water till your well runs dry,\u201d the late, great Sam Cooke sang in one of his more melancholy songs. Around 2009, 2010, around the time we were crawling out from under the wreckage of 2008 and saw that the Wall Street crowd had come through just fine, thank you, that seems to be when a critical mass of the American population began to realize that, hey, we were missing something; that maybe our well was running dry. People were angry. We had good reason to be. We saw great prosperity at the top, scant trickle-down toward the bottom. In Texas, and especially in rural Texas \u2013 where, by the way, electricity and access to electronic media have been settled facts of life for years \u2013 the Tea Party rose with a mighty roar to rage against liberals, the government and the newly elected Democratic president.</p> <p>If that rage seems somewhat misdirected, here\u2019s an explanation: 40 years of well-funded, highly organized laissez-faire proselytizing and government-bashing have done a number on the American mind. The country got conned by a profound ideological shift, starting in the early 1970s as hardcore free-market, anti-government advocates launched a concerted effort to change the political landscape. Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson\u2019s recent book American Amnesia ably tells the story, from the business elite who funded the movement (Charles and David Koch prominent among them), to the conservative thinktanks that developed the ideology, to the political actors who machined it into policy. The movement\u2019s shock troops included tough-talking ideologues like Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, who said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d Ayn Rand, author of romance novels for business moguls, became a movement icon with her depictions of rugged capitalist heroes taking on wimpy liberals and overbearing governments. One of Rand\u2019s inner circle, Alan Greenspan, would serve as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank from 1988 to 2006, where he presided over the broad deregulation of the financial system. (Later he would profess \u201cshocked disbelief\u201d at the meltdown of 2008, and allow that he\u2019d \u201cfound a flaw\u201d in his Randian ideology.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5432a911d1ac9d6db2ea7cd263401d0e5e5b0399\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5432a911d1ac9d6db2ea7cd263401d0e5e5b0399/0_151_2992_1795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in Zuccotti Park to voice and discuss their frustration with the economy and Wall Street in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators in New York voice their frustration with the economy and Wall Street in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KeystoneUSA-Zum/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A very narrow slice of America \u2013 the 1% \u2013 reaped spectacular wealth from this political sea change. When Forbes magazine published its first annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans in 1982, there were two billionaires on the roster, and the entire 400 had a combined net worth of $225bn in today\u2019s dollars. By 2014, 113 billionaires were left off the list because they didn\u2019t make they cut ($1.55bn); the combined net worth of the Forbes class of 2014 was $2.3tn. Meanwhile, earnings for working- and middle-class Americans stagnated even as we worked more hours, took fewer vacations and kept increasing our productivity. These days it\u2019s not uncommon for hedge fund managers to make $1bn a year. CEOs routinely pull in annual compensation in the tens of millions of dollars. Even assuming these people are very good at what they do, you have to wonder: is anyone really that good?</p> <p>According to them, yes. What\u2019s more, they\u2019re liable to tell you they did it all themselves. Sanford Weill, Citigroup\u2019s former chairman who clocked $785m over a five-year period, declared, \u201cWe didn\u2019t rely on somebody else to build what we built.\u201d A few years later, Citigroup would be rescued by the government to the tune of $476bn in cash and guarantees. More recently, tech venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya asserted, \u201cIf companies shut down, the stock market would collapse. If the government shuts down, nothing happens, and we all move on, because it just doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>Granted, a thriving mixed economy depends on individual initiative, innovation and risk-taking. But it also depends on the institutions and social structures that only well-functioning governance can provide, such as: laws, both civil and criminal. Private property rights. Secure and enforceable contracts, copyrights and patents. Stable banks. Well-regulated international commerce, including treaties, trade agreements, secure borders and customs controls. \u201cI can guarantee that if you don\u2019t have a legal structure you will not have innovation,\u201d said Jim Dempsey, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, in a 2015 article in Wired. \u201cInstead you will have chaos \u2026 every innovator survives on the oxygen of multiple regulatory systems.\u201d</p> <p>The wealth that results from private enterprise is very much a social construct. President Obama famously overstated the case when he said in 2012, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a business \u2013 you didn\u2019t build that.\u201d Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain\u2019s ideological twin to Ronald Reagan, equally overstated the case with her famous pronouncement, \u201cThere is no such thing as society.\u201d The truth is it takes both, and there\u2019s no readier example than the cellphone most of us are never without. In American Amnesia we find the story of Dr Vannevar Bush, FDR\u2019s science czar during the second world war, and how Bush, at Roosevelt\u2019s urging and with strong bipartisan support from Congress, set the path for America\u2019s huge postwar spending on research and development in science, technology, and medicine. As Hacker and Pierson write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fruits of these investments ranged from radar and GPS, to advanced medical technology, to robotics and the computing systems that figure in nearly every modern technology. Far from crowding out private R&amp;D, moreover, these public investments spurred additional private innovation. The computer pioneers who developed better and smaller systems not only relied on publicly fostered breakthroughs in technology; they also would have found little market for their most profitable products if not for the internet, GPS, and other government-sponsored platforms for the digital revolution.</p> </blockquote> <p>If, as the authors of American Amnesia point out, you crack open that smartphone, you\u2019ll find that every component is the product of research that the US government either funded or carried out directly: lithium-ion batteries, GPS, cellular technology, touch-screen and LCDs, internet connectivity, algorithmic applications. The internet itself is a government creation; the Department of Defense developed its precursor, the Arpanet, in order to connect with computing centers at major universities. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43f846fac98238750248115eecdd4d9a31ae31b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43f846fac98238750248115eecdd4d9a31ae31b3/0_0_4458_2675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The smartphone: a triumph of US government investment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The smartphone: a triumph of US government investment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">American exceptionalism: the great game and the noble way</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So we can only stand amazed at the Olympian chutzpah of Silicon Valley billionaires when they talk about creating libertarian utopias that will transcend government. Venture capitalist Tim Draper has proposed making Silicon Valley its own semi-autonomous state. Google\u2019s Larry Page wants to construct a \u201cGoogle Island\u201d where tech research can proceed free of government meddling. PayPal\u2019s Peter Thiel, whose fortune was built not just on the internet but through helpful government regulation (such as the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s rule limiting losses on identity theft; how many of us would put our credit card information on the internet if the downside was losing everything we own?) is a prime mover of the Seasteading Institute, dedicated to the creation of manmade island nations beyond the reach of government.</p> <p>When faced with this sort of nonsense, one can\u2019t help but think of the little boy who declares independence from his family, and runs away as far as the tree house in his backyard. The worldview of Thiel and company is about as juvenile as that, a kind of nerdy romanticism that recalls the capitalist fantasies of Ayn Rand. If not for the collective (Randians break out in hives when they encounter that word) efforts of American society, the industry in which tech moguls have so fantastically prospered wouldn\u2019t exist. But it\u2019s even more basic than that. The development and widespread availability of vaccines and antibiotics following the second world war are due in large part to initiatives carried out by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Agriculture, and other government agencies. Longevity, quality of life \u2013 like wealth creation, these are social constructs. But it\u2019s even more basic than modern medicine, and reaches back before the New Deal, to some of the very first initiatives of progressive government. The sharp improvement in mortality that began in the early years of the 20th century was largely the result of many more children surviving into adulthood. The cause was simple, though it took huge investments by government to make happen: cities began to clean up their water supplies. Filtration. Chlorination. Basic stuff we take for granted. If a good many of us are alive today, breathing and walking and talking and in some cases making a career out of raging against the government, it\u2019s because our great-granddaddy didn\u2019t die from cholera or typhoid way back in the day.</p> <p>The air we breathe.

By virtually every measure relative to other rich nations, the US has lost ground since the 1970s. We\u2019re shorter (height is an excellent indicator of social conditions), we don\u2019t live as long, more of our babies die before their first birthdays, wages and educational achievement have stagnated, and inequalities of wealth and opportunity are higher than at any time since the late 19th century. Mortality rates for middle-aged white Americans have actually risen the past 15 years, especially for non-college-educated whites. Maternal mortality rose 27% nationwide between 2000 and 2014. In Texas, the maternal mortality rate doubled between 2010 and 2014.</p> <p>The very rich, of course, can buy what they need \u2013 healthcare, clean water, political clout. They have their walled compounds and private islands to retreat to. As for the rest of us \u2013 for instance, all the good citizens out there in rural Texas, Tea Party Texas, the hard country that was transformed by the New Deal \u2013 one tries to imagine how it might look in 70 or 80 years if current trends continue. Crumbling roads, jerry-rigged bridges, worn-out farms. A grudging, \u201cmarket-based\u201d energy grid. Clean water a rarity, and healthcare that\u2019s hit and miss. Perineal tears, perhaps, are once again commonplace. A far-fetched scenario, surely, but no harder for us to imagine in 2016 than the lived reality of rural Texas 80 years ago.</p>",

A big couple of days for the West Australian. The beauty of his all-round craft is that he has more than one redemption opportunity, today\u2019s with the ball. It\u2019s essentially what happened last summer, he wasn\u2019t making any runs but at Melbourne in particular he was the best of Australia\u2019s bowlers in the second dig. And it is a good start from him here, hitting a consistent line and presumably successful in hitting the crack a couple of times - one going low, the other high. That\u2019s his job from that Prindiville Stand end: hit the crack. Oh and a ripper to finish the set, legitimately too good for Duminy across his body. Say what you will about Marsh\u2019s batting, he\u2019s a competitor. I\u2019d back him in today. A maiden. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581d4d80e4b0d073c27d1ad5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T03:13:40.225Z\">3.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 144-2 (Elgar 61, Duminy 52) </strong>Siddle repeats the crime that got Starc dragged, falling onto the pads of Elgar first ball, who makes no mistake.

When Starc strayed onto the same man\u2019s pads next ball he takes him away with perfect timing through midwicket to <strong>bring up his half century</strong>. 130 balls at the crease, he\u2019s going really well. Worth noting that he looked excellent until getting the faintest feather the first time around as well. And it\u2019s Elgar again for three more when Starc misses his mark for a third time in the wayward over, midwicket once again the destination.

There\u2019s a bit of a risk in losing in that just how impressive the South African trio of Philander, Rabada and debutant spinner Maharaj were. A trio on the basis that Dale Steyn is no more on this tour, it confirmed overnight that he\u2019ll be going home with a \u201cvery rare\u201d should injury at the end of this Test. An injury that, according to reports from South African media and questioning of team management after play last night, may have emanated from a surfing injury. Anyway, Philander was utterly brilliant, Rabada legitimately quick and exciting, Maharaj controlled and confident. Their job is half done, but you\u2019d be bold to back against them.</p> <p>As for Australia, on the TV pre-game show they are right into them. Michael Clarke went through the significant collapses of late (which, granted, he was a member of most) observing that the focus on batting away from home in particular means their failings are \u201cin their heads.\u201d Interesting. </p> <p>On the Smith dismissal in particular, where he danced a couple metres down the track to be given out lbw (and upheld by DRS), the consensus on the panel was that they got it right. But, in Warne\u2019s view, it reinforces why every country (read, India) need to play by the same DRS rules at all times. Hard to argue against. </p> <p>Pietersen was particularly insightful here, saying he had to change his entire game after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liQ0qnnJ7fs\">Monty Panesar nabbed Sachin Tendulkar</a> in 2006 with an arm-ball when well forward.<br></p> <p>We\u2019re about five minutes away from seeing the players here.

Getting there, at least. Where the first couple of days of this Test felt a bit more Perth-like as far as the track was concerned, the weather wasn\u2019t following suit with a couple of relatively mild days. But with it forecast to reach 37 of the best today, it\u2019ll be a timely reminder that we\u2019re only an hour or so from the desert. </p> <p>Another will be the fact that a big old crack looks to be opening up at the Lillee-Marsh Stand end. If you can\u2019t get excited about that, with the first Test Match of the summer well in the balance, then you\u2019re following the wrong sport. This is set up beautifully. </p> <p>I\u2019m Adam Collins and I\u2019m once again your OBO for the first session today. Looking out the window at the WACA, there isn\u2019t a cloud in the sky. There\u2019s a real buzz about the place this morning.</p> <p>22-and-a-half hours ago it wasn\u2019t so much the case, with David Warner and Shaun Marsh having tallied an unbroken 150-run stand by drinks on the second morning, a monster first innings lead looking a lock. A 4-for-25 collapse in the second hour changed that. By tea, that collapse totalled 10-for-86, Australia\u2019s worst on home soil since the mid-1980s. </p> <p>Defending a lead of two, the Australian bowlers held up their end of the bargain with the opener Cook and talisman Amla back in the sheds by time the Proteas were 45. But the last 90 minutes brought together Elgar and Duminy, who navigated them safely through to stumps with an unbeaten 59-run stand, their lead now 102. </p> <p>So that\u2019s the state of play. If it is anything like the first couple of days you won\u2019t want to miss a moment.

Meanwhile, Labour\u2019s Gisela Stuart, who chaired the Vote Leave campaign, said those in her party and others who were demanding that the UK remain inside the single market were effectively trying to scupper the will of the people. </p> <p>Raab, the former justice minister who now sits on parliament\u2019s select committee on leaving the EU, said: \u201cAs Lib Dem and Labour peers and MPs are now making clear, the ruling will be exploited by those in denial of the referendum verdict, who want to see us stay in the EU via the backdoor. Bluntly, they want to steal the referendum, not deliver on it.\u201d</p> <p>Stuart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/03/referendum-vote-leave-labour-people-have-spoken\">who chaired the campaign to take Britain out of the EU</a>, said the courts were entitled to rule on their interpretation of the process. \u201cBut I think it is incumbent on parliamentarians to then also recognise that they don\u2019t have sovereignty over the people. The people have made it quite clear they want to leave,\u201d said the MP who now leads Change Britain, a group that includes prominent Brexiters such as Michael Gove.</p> <p>In an interview for Radio 4\u2019s Week in Westminster to be broadcast on Saturday, Stuart warned against MPs using debates about the single market or customs union \u201cin pursuit of negating the people\u2019s will\u201d. Asked if she thought any politician calling for Britain to remain in those organisations was trying to scupper the Brexit vote, she replied: \u201cYes, I think I do, because what people made quite clear during that referendum is that democratic accountability for them was far more important than anything else.\u201d</p> <p>The former Cabinet minister John Whittingdale agreed, arguing that the referendum result meant that even if the supreme court upholds the decision then parliament should either overturn it or every MP should vote in favour of triggering article 50. \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be any conditions on the outcome of the negotiations,\u201d he said, adding that even if European countries block economic access, Britain must still leave the EU.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ba50d3cc150f99fd34de7e8202f8dfb8da1597d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ba50d3cc150f99fd34de7e8202f8dfb8da1597d/0_153_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Kerslake, former head of the civil service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Kerslake, former head of the civil service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said the government had been caught out trying to avoid a difficult debate in parliament. \u201cThe government would be much better off thinking how to tackle the issue,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>The peer, who has been active in his scrutiny of legislation since joining the House of Lords, said the British public voted to leave the EU but that left many unanswered questions. \u201cWhatever else it changed, I don\u2019t think the referendum changed the fact of parliamentary democracy or that we operate under the rule of law.\u201d <br></p> <p>Meanwhile, the legal and political complications facing May intensified on Friday after the Welsh government\u2019s counsel general, Mick Antoniw, said it would formally join the complainants\u2019 side in the supreme court case next month.<br></p> <p>Scottish government sources said Antoniw\u2019s intervention increased the chances that Nicola Sturgeon would also join the action. Both devolved governments are concerned that their legal and parliamentary interests are being overlooked in May\u2019s rush to push through article 50 without a vote. </p> <p>The move would force the UK government to explain why it believed leaving the EU was only a matter for Westminster, even though it would have a direct effect on the powers of all three devolved parliaments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.

In Arizona, more than 1,000 local Republicans have signed up to be poll watchers, a fivefold increase since the last presidential election, state party spokesman Tim Sifert said, though it\u2019s not clear how many will actually show up. </p> <p>In Fort Worth, Texas, the county Republican party office has been fielding calls from supporters about poll watching, and they now have enough volunteers to put a Republican in some role in all of the county\u2019s 346 voting locations, county chairman Tim O\u2019Hare said. The number of Republican volunteers in previous years was \u201cnot even close\u201d, he said. \u201cIn any modern time, we\u2019ve never had somebody at every spot.\u201d</p> <p>In Virginia, Reagan George, a voter fraud prevention advocate who leads Republican poll watcher training sessions, said: \u201cFrom what I\u2019m gathering from the people I\u2019ve made contact with, they\u2019ve probably trained more people with this election than they have in 30 years.\u201d The state party did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>In Pennsylvania, where Trump has repeatedly made wild allegations of voter fraud, a state GOP spokeswoman said they had measured \u201ca small uptick\u201d in poll watcher registration since 2012. Local Republican officials in other battleground states downplayed the issue, with an Ohio Trump campaign spokesman saying the campaign would monitor voting activities \u201cas candidates from both parties in Ohio have done in every recent statewide and presidential election\u201d, and a Republican party spokeswoman from Michigan saying there was \u201cnothing different\u201d about poll watching this election cycle. </p> <p>The Republican National Committee is still being monitored by a federal judge over past alleged intimidation of minority voters. In 1981, the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers wearing \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d arm bands to patrol the polls in minority neighborhoods. Under a federal consent decree, the RNC is still banned from participating in any \u201cballot security\u201d programs \u201caimed at preventing voter fraud\u201d.</p> <p>The Democratic National Committee has been battling in court this week to prove that the RNC has violated this ban. In legal filings, lawyers for the RNC said it has nothing to do with Trump\u2019s proposed poll watching efforts and that it is abiding by its consent decree. It slammed what it called the Democrats\u2019 \u201ctabloid litigation tactics\u201d.</p> <p>While small-scale voter fraud has been documented, there is simply no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud or \u201celection theft\u201d, as others describe it. The Bush administration\u2019s own crackdown against the practice, led by the former attorney general Gonzales and lasting five years, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/us/how-charges-of-voter-fraud-became-a-political-strategy.html?_r=0\">resulted in just 86 convictions by 2007</a>, many of which were for minor infractions such as completing multiple voter registration forms. Researchers at the Loyola Marymount University <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\">found just 31 instances of voter impersonation out of a billion votes cast</a> in numerous US elections between 2000 and 2014.</p> <p>Voting rights advocates have warned that 2016 will be the first presidential election <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">since a 2013 supreme court ruling</a> severely weakened the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which offered significant legislative safeguards to African American, Latino and other minority voters. The ruling has also weakened the Department of Justice\u2019s authority and resources to monitor local polling places. The DoJ will still send \u201chundreds\u201d of monitors across the country and work \u201ccooperatively\u201d with local jurisdictions to \u201ckeep an eye on the proceedings\u201d, Vanita Gupta, the head of the department\u2019s civil rights division, told the Guardian in a statement.</p> <p>Some voters have already reported tense interactions at the polls during early voting. Alyssa Day, a New York Times-bestselling author who lives in Florida, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alyssa_day/status/793083990076952576?refsrc=email&amp;s=11\">she watched</a> an older white man scream insults at a young black woman inside a polling place on Monday in St Johns County. \u201cHe started yelling, \u2018She\u2019s a racist, she\u2019s a racist,\u201d and she was trying to explain he had said something offensive to her in the parking lot and she told him, basically, \u2018Leave me alone,\u2019\u201d Day told the Guardian. Inside the polling place, she said the man was shouting: \u201cI\u2019m going to sue you.\u201d</p> <p>The man appeared to be just another voter, not a poll watcher or affiliated with a campaign, Day said. A sheriff\u2019s deputy at the polling place quickly intervened, Day said, and the young woman was able to vote. But Day offered to walk the woman back to her car afterwards, she said. \u201cShe was shaken. I was very shaken,\u201d Day said. \u201cI think this election year has been so incredibly divisive, and that\u2019s carrying right into the polling places.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jason Wilson contributed reporting. </em></p>",
  "<p>When Jane Goodall observed chimpanzees making tools in 1960, humans lost their self-aggrandizing status as the world\u2019s only tool makers. Now scientists are beginning to realise there may be much more \u2018intelligent life\u2019 in the universe than previously thought, but it\u2019s just here: on our planet. Since Goodall\u2019s discovery, researchers have found numerous other mammals displaying high levels of intelligence, including the great apes, elephants, dolphins, orcas and many canine species. But only in the last couple decades has scientists\u2019 attention turned to intelligence in non-mammals, including birds. </p> <p>\u201cStudies of avian intelligence have been hampered by the old fashioned idea that birds are stupid, and not worth considering in terms of intelligence,\u201d said Nathan Emery, author of the new book, <a href=\"https://www.quartoknows.com/books/9781782403142/Bird-Brain-An-exploration-of-avian-intelligence.html?direct=1\">Bird Brain: An Exploration of Avian Intelligence</a> and senior lecturer at Queen Mary: University of London. </p> <p>An in-depth look at recent research and fascinating lab experiments, the book published by <a href=\"https://www.quartoknows.com/Ivy-Press\">Ivy Press</a> overturns any notion that birds are somehow dumb. Instead, it argues with an overwhelming amount of evidence that a number of bird species should be considered more as \u201cfeathered apes.\u201d </p> <h2>No bird brains here </h2> <p>The idea that birds are unintelligent was initially proposed by looking at the brains of birds. Birds lack a cerebral cortex, which allowed scientists for decades to assume they were incapable of any higher thinking. However, researchers now know that a different part of the bird brain \u2013 the pallium \u2013 has evolved to do many of the same tasks as the cerebral cortex. </p> <p>\u201cAvian and mammalian brains seem to be functioning the same way, but interestingly their hardware is completely different,\u201d said Emery, who noted that bird brains generally have shorter connections between specific parts of their brains than mammals. </p> <p>\u201cThis structure means that birds might make decisions more rapidly then mammals, but we don\u2019t know what implications this might have for their intelligence.\u201d</p> <p>But what is intelligence? It\u2019s a question, really, for philosophy. Researchers rarely agree on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/aug/04/plants-intelligent-sentient-book-brilliant-green-internet\">exact definition</a>. But for his purposes, Emery described intelligence as \u201cthe ability to flexibly solve novel problems using cognition rather than merely instinct or learning.\u201d <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I told you that day old chicks can count...would you think twice about eating chicken?</p> <footer> <cite>Nathan Emery</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In other words, to Emery intelligence goes beyond rote learning to the ability to tackle a problem never before seen by an individual. This strict definition includes attributes usually connected to humans like plasticity and creativity. Still, Emery said that we need to start thinking of intelligence as species-specific and not compare apples to oranges or humans to crows. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really appropriate to pit one species against another, as each has evolved different skills or ways of thinking that provide them with an advantage in one test, but a disadvantage in another. There isn\u2019t an IQ test for animals to rank their intelligence.\u201d</p> <p>For example, lab tests have shown that rooks and crows are better than eight-year-old children at reaching a treat by making a wire hook, but of course there are many things eight-year-old humans can do that rooks and crows can\u2019t. </p> <h2>Tool-making and other kinds of intelligence</h2> <p>Ever since Jane Goodall\u2019s chimp discovery, tool use has been a gold standard for dubbing a species intelligent. In recent decades, scientists have discovered that a number of bird species employ tools in the wild, usually to get at food they can\u2019t reach with their beaks. <br></p> <p>But for a long time birds had only one known tool-maker: the New Caledonian crow.</p> <p>These island crows have become famous for making a wide variety of hook tools out of twigs and leaves. In the laboratory, they are capable of making tools out of objects they\u2019ve never encountered before and even rival primates in their ability to craft tools. But just this year, scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/15/endangered-hawaiian-crows-join-elite-list-of-animals-known-to-use-tools\">discovered</a> that the \u2018alal\u0101, or Hawaiian crow, is also capable of making and using tools. The \u2018alal\u0101 is actually extinct in the wild, but 109 individuals survive in captivity today. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/aug/04/plants-intelligent-sentient-book-brilliant-green-internet\">Are plants intelligent? New book says yes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the \u2018alal\u0101 had gone totally extinct \u2013 at one time there were only 30 or so left \u2013 we would never have known about its remarkable abilities. </p> <p>According to the IUCN Red List, we\u2019ve lost 140 species of birds to extinction since the year 1500 (although more probably vanished without our knowledge) \u2013 and none of these, of course, were ever studied for their intelligence. Today, five additional species are extinct in the wild \u2013 including the \u2018alal\u0101 \u2013 but survive in captivity. Meanwhile, 1,375 birds are currently listed as threatened with extinction (ie vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered) and another 971 species as near threatened. In all, about 14% of the world\u2019s birds are currently threatened with extinction. </p> <p>Worryingly, only a handful of bird species (out of 10,000-plus) have actually been systematically tested on their intelligence. Even whole bird families have never been tested, including most of the world\u2019s raptors.</p> <p>\u201cMy prediction for other families of avian geniuses are the hornbills, woodpeckers, and falcons, based on their relative size of their brains, and what we know about their natural behaviour,\u201d said Emery. \u201cThese are not common birds to keep in the lab or they may be endangered, so the key to success is going to be our creativity in finding populations to be tested in a systematic, controlled manner.\u201d</p> <p>And of course tool-use isn\u2019t everything. Bird song \u2013 and the ability of some birds to even mimic human speech \u2013 lends itself to high levels of intelligence as does the extreme sociability seen in many birds, requiring them to keep track of a complex avian hierarchy. Birds can also do incredible things that humans can\u2019t, such as find their way home after migrating thousands of miles or remembering where they hid thousands of pieces of food even after the landscape has been covered in a metre of snow. </p> <h2>Eating and shooting the intelligent</h2> <p>All this means we need to rethink how we treat birds, according to Emery. </p> <p>\u201cThe domestic chicken is the most populous bird in the world, which we consume in massive numbers. But, if I told you that day old chicks can count or they can tell if two objects are the same or different, a so-called abstract concept, would you think twice about eating chicken?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d92de36afa815500276b9a3939bca3910dcee0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d92de36afa815500276b9a3939bca3910dcee0e/0_140_2592_3238/800.jpg\" alt=\"African grey parrots are known for their incredible ability to mimic human speech.

If so chimps, why not crows?\u201d </p> <p>The problem may be one of likeness: we look at chimpanzees and it\u2019s like viewing ourselves in a slightly crooked mirror. But seeing a crow and recognising a fellow clever, sentient and creative being means further diminishing our own superiority and considering life differently. It means recognising that smarts comes in all shapes, sizes and species. </p>",
  "<p>It is autumn in Stars Hollow. There is a chill in the air and the gazebo in the town\u2019s central square is decorated with pumpkins, porcelain pigs and cockerels that nestle among haystacks and horns of plenty. On one side of the square stands the white clapboard steepled church; across the way is the traditional, red-brick school building. The bookshop, diner and grocers are framed by wrought iron gaslights, all adorned by golden leaf wreaths and decorative ears of corn.</p> <p>This place, which has come to mean so much to me, is the epitome of festive New England. I may have grown up in suburban Manchester, England, but it feels like home. In my mind, I\u2019ve escaped here so many times, and now here I am, drinking in a town as picturesque as a film set \u2013 which is exactly what it is, on the Warner Brothers studio lot in Burbank, Los Angeles. Stars Hollow, the fictional home of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/aug/24/gilmore-girls-new-episodes-netflix-reboot\">Gilmore Girls</a>, the noughties TV series about a mother and daughter, is a quiet, eccentric town where nothing bad happens. Unlike the big television dramas of recent years (The Fall, The Bridge, The Missing) there are no murders; no one is kidnapped or abused. Instead the show follows the life of Lorelai Gilmore, who got pregnant at 16 and ran away from her wealthy, overbearing parents, and Rory, her daughter and closest friend, who is turning 16 as the story begins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I first watched Gilmore Girls around the same time I first saw my mum cry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is sunny and safe here. There is no dramatic music to make you uncomfortable, only the beat of a soft snare to signify oncoming drama. When a character is upset, it is usually because a town meeting, held in Miss Patty\u2019s dance studio, has not gone their way, or because someone they love failed to show up. When there are tears, they are warranted.</p> <p>It\u2019s all grounded in the community of the town. Stars Hollow is to Gilmore Girls what New York is to Sex And The City \u2013 just with more fairy lights and (much) less fellatio. The drama is played out in episodes that can feel surreal verging on the ridiculous (a town dance marathon, a cat\u2019s wake, an all-night civil war re-enactment in the snow). Now, nine years after it ended, the show is back for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGGNNSmGDpU\">four feature-length episodes</a> \u2013 and it still feels different from anything else on TV. Sure, we have the pastel-hued utopia that is The Great British Bake Off, and Strictly Come Dancing with its feel-good factor, but that\u2019s reality TV. Drama-wise, there is nothing quite like the comfort of Stars Hollow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c65ebaef4ddc0c07b881bef7d46aba9bf7f3948b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c65ebaef4ddc0c07b881bef7d46aba9bf7f3948b/108_161_2565_1539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madeleine Albright and Alexis Bledel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madeleine Albright and Alexis Bledel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Br/Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first watched Gilmore Girls around the same time I first saw my mum cry. I was 21, newly returned to Manchester after a year spent studying at an American university, and I was, as my mum would say, \u201cfull of it\u201d: overflowing with excitement and not shutting up. She was driving and I was in the passenger seat; I had just picked up a set of photographs of the best year of my life, and was using them as visual prompts to enthuse about the friends I had made, the places I had been, the ludicrous frat parties I had gone to. Mum was silent for the most part, until she burst into tears. I was dumbstruck. There is nothing more terrifying than seeing the strongest person you know overcome by sadness. Eventually she said, \u201cI am just so jealous\u201d, words I could never have imagined she would say.</p> <p>The last 12 months had been markedly different for her. My father, after a bumpy few years, had finally been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s that winter. I had cried confused, angry tears and swiftly gone into denial, easily achieved when you are living 5,000 miles away and readily distracted by weekends on the beach, southern Californian boys and jello shots. Mum, on the other hand, had been on the frontline, trying to cope as her husband of 25 years deteriorated into a frustrated, aggressive shadow of his former self. She was emotionally battered and I had failed to notice. We had always been so close and yet here we were, in a car on the way home from Snappy Snaps, canyons apart. I didn\u2019t know what to say and feared I never would. I was already losing my father; I couldn\u2019t cope with losing my mother, too.</p> <p>To say Gilmore Girls was our salvation might sound nonsensical but, looking back, it was (especially when accompanied by crisps and wine). My mum was very different from Lorelai (she isn\u2019t 16 years older than me for a start). And if I was a bit like Rory, in the sense that I always cared a lot about school, my hair has never been that shiny. Our home in Cheadle, with its John Lewis and TGI Fridays, was no Stars Hollow, where <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/FeliciaFitzpatrick/13-stars-hollow-town-events-wed-like-to-participa-jbnr?utm_term=.dx56YXGoy#.jidRNqkvp\">every season is marked by some kind of elaborate festive jamboree</a> (a hay maze for spring, a carnival for the end of summer). But the show spoke to us because of that deep bond between mother and daughter.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792371/\">Amy Sherman-Palladino</a>, Gilmore Girls\u2019 creator and writer, thinks her show would never get commissioned today. \u201cNot in a million years. Wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d she tells me. \u201cNot unless the mother and daughter could fly or solve crimes.\u201d She was a writer on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/03/roseanne-your-next-box-set\">Roseanne</a> before she was asked to pitch her own show to the Warner Brothers network. \u201cI had come into this meeting with a bunch of hungry executives \u2013 it was just before lunch \u2013 with a lot of extensive, thought-out pitches that were making them yawn and think about their laundry. At the last minute, I said, \u2018Well, there is this thing I haven\u2019t really worked out yet, but I always liked the concept of a mother and daughter being friends more than they are mother and daughter.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Great, that\u2019s it, let\u2019s lunch.\u2019\u201d On the way out, she confessed to her manager that she hadn\u2019t really thought this through; he told her to \u201cgo figure it out\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92a8a35369f4eaf4785bca0c295fc0b2febb9cda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92a8a35369f4eaf4785bca0c295fc0b2febb9cda/0_222_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore and Alexis Bledel as her daughter, Rory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore and Alexis Bledel as her daughter, Rory, who is just 16 years her junior, in an episode from season two in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo:The WB/Ron Batzdorff</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That weekend, Sherman-Palladino happened to be visiting Connecticut with her husband (and collaborator), Dan. They had never been before, and were thoroughly charmed. \u201cIt was autumn, and there were pumpkin patches and beautiful people who were driving by asking, \u2018Excuse me, which way to the hayride?\u2019 And we were like, \u2018Are you kidding me? Who lives like this?\u2019\u201d She figured that this was exactly the sort of place a smart 16-year-old deciding to raise a child on her own would settle \u2013 \u201csome place safe, where everyone is going to keep an eye on me and my kid\u201d. By the end of the weekend, the show had fallen into place.</p> <p>Gilmore Girls first aired in 2000 and managed to hold its own in the same time slot as that little-known sitcom, Friends. As the series progressed, it became a hit, attracting fans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/georgelucas\">George Lucas</a>, who was somewhat starstruck when he visited the set with his daughter \u2013 \u201cHe sat there for like two hours talking about how great it feels to be in Stars Hollow,\u201d Dan Palladino tells me. But it never really took off in the UK in the same way \u2013 when I mention it now, people often think I am banging on about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/feb/28/my-favourite-tv-show-the-golden-girls\">The Golden Girls</a>; it wasn\u2019t until 2006 that I sat down to watch a box set of the first season with my mum.</p> <p>We were enchanted. Here were two quick-witted women who spoke a mile a minute \u2013 the show is famous for its fast-paced dialogue, which is all Sherman-Palladino (at one point, there was <a href=\"http://moveablefest.com/moveable_fest/2012/06/amy-sherman-palladino-interview-gilmoregirls.html\">a rumour circulating on the internet</a> that she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a>, writing under a pseudonym, because a woman couldn\u2019t possibly be that sharp). The Gilmores loved books, films, magazines, fashion and making each other laugh. Their verbal sparring was littered with <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/12/gilmore-girls-pop-culture-references-by-the-numbers.html\">cultural references</a> from high (Lorelai points out that the cold makes people do odd things: \u201cHey, did anyone ever think that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\">Sylvia Plath</a> wasn\u2019t crazy, she was just cold?\u201d) to low (Rory on her mother\u2019s turn in a charity fashion show: \u201cMy mom\u2019s a model. Maybe you\u2019ll get to date <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> now\u201d). Sherman-Palladino kept the schmaltz, or what she calls \u201ctreacle matter\u201d, to a minimum: \u201cWe don\u2019t want a lot of \u2018I love you\u2019 or hugging because I feel the love was shown through the way people treated each other.\u201d</p> <p>Rory, played by a fresh-faced <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088127/\">Alexis Bledel</a> in her first acting gig, was a smart, funny, serious teenager. I had never seen a character so concerned about homework not cast as the typical nerd before. I realised Rory was different 10 minutes into the pilot. She is sitting in class, quietly working on an essay about Huckleberry Finn, seemingly unaware of the \u201ccool\u201d girls mocking her for getting on with her assignment while they paint their nails. The camera zooms in on her, she looks up briefly and smiles to herself, unperturbed. Here was a character who got off on doing well in school and hanging out with her mum. My schooldays were well behind me, but I could definitely relate.</p> <p>Over the next two years, my mum and I watched all seven seasons together. Dan Palladino tells me we are far from the only mother and daughter to connect with Gilmore Girls in this way. \u201cWe got tons telling us they watched it together, sometimes because they are really close, but also those who didn\u2019t have much in common and found they both liked it.\u201d Nor were we the only ones who used it as a means of escape. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many times we\u2019ve heard from people whose mothers were going through something like cancer, and the daughter would bring the shows over to watch,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mum and I would spend 45 minutes in Stars Hollow and everything would feel a little better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is how it was for us. When things got tough, one of us would ask, \u201cShall we do a Lorelai?\u201d and pop an episode on. My dad would recognise the Warner Brothers music, familiar to him from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-west-wing\">West Wing</a>-watching days, and get confused when he heard the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdd7REkQoCU\">Carole King Where You Lead theme tune</a>, as opposed to the stirring drum roll of The West Wing. He\u2019d take himself off to another part of the house to sit by himself and stare into space. After helplessly watching him leave the room, Mum and I would spend 45 minutes in Stars Hollow and everything would feel a little better; it was the televisual equivalent of a large glass of wine after a hard day. I didn\u2019t know how to protect my mother, and we didn\u2019t know how to discuss emotions because we\u2019d never really had to: we had always been so happy. All we could do was sit and watch a TV programme about a rock-solid relationship and hope that the same applied to us.</p> <p>When it first aired, Gilmore Girls was refreshing television. While Sherman-Palladino didn\u2019t set out to break ground, exactly, she was aware of the climate in which she was writing. \u201cWomen at the time, in TV, were split into two groups: there was the popular pretty girl, or the angry girl who wore combat boots. As the cries of \u2018make women stronger\u2019 came out, all they did was take the same pretty woman and put a gun in her hand and have her run around in heels. The concept of strong women is still, and was especially then, a terrifying concept to a lot of the networks, because they were afraid that that\u2019s not how people want to see women. But it is how women wanted to see women.\u201d</p> <p>Of course there are love interests and heartache, but they are never front and centre. Rory\u2019s dream is to go to Harvard and work for a major daily newspaper (\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many women tell me they wanted to go to an Ivy League college because of the show,\u201d says Bledel, whose eyes are as ludicrously blue in real life as they are on screen). She hero-worships CNN reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/15/christiane-amanpour-interview\">Christiane Amanpour</a>, who makes a cameo appearance, as do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/madeleine-albright-campaigns-for-hillary-clinton\">Madeleine Albright</a>, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/10178/\">Norman Mailer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth\">Sonic Youth</a> and Carole King (as Sophie, who owns the music shop). Lorelai dreams of opening her own inn with her best friend, played by the then little-known Melissa McCarthy, and (spoiler alert) ends up doing exactly that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67f99d899cf298a43469873fcab28ea5be6e63aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f99d899cf298a43469873fcab28ea5be6e63aa/67_292_4829_2898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gilmore Girls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham and Bledel in the new series: \u2018It\u2019s a quiet show.

But in Lorelai, Sherman-Palladino simply wrote a woman she liked: \u201cShe was pretty tough, made her own money, but she also liked men. She wasn\u2019t demonising them. Her problems did not stem from men. They stemmed from her upbringing, mistakes she made and miscommunications with her mother. The real places that problems stem from.\u201d</p> <p>Since this month\u2019s revival was announced last October, there has been <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a18783/gilmore-girls-boyfriend-debate/\">endless</a> <a href=\"http://www.refinery29.uk/2016/09/124653/rory-gilmore-boyfriends#slide\">speculation</a> as to who Lorelai and Rory will end up with. It\u2019s an irritating framing of the show\u2019s return; personally, I\u2019m more interested to know which newspaper Rory ends up writing for (in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL4MP2HHd6A\">series finale</a>, we left her covering Barack Obama\u2019s campaign trail for an online magazine). \u201cThe boys are sort of incidental,\u201d agrees Lauren Graham, who plays Lorelai, as we chat under the town\u2019s gazebo while my inner fan girl does a jig. \u201cIt\u2019s more about their relationship, their work \u2013 it\u2019s just a piece of their life.\u201d When she says this, I\u2019ve never wanted to go for a martini with her more. (That is what Lorelai drinks to get through dinners with her parents. It\u2019s also how I came to be that 22-year-old tosser who ordered martinis wherever I could.)</p> <p>Fans didn\u2019t get the ending they wanted when Gilmore Girls wound up in 2007, as the Palladinos, who had<a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2006/04/24/amy-sherman-palladino-leaving-gilmore\"> failed to reach an agreement on contracts and staff with the network</a>, left before the final season was written. The show missed their voice, and played out without the finale Amy Sherman-Palladino <a href=\"http://www.tvguide.com/news/gilmore-girls-what-are-the-final-four-words/\">had in mind</a>; later this month, we will get to see it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a place to go in between watching Donald Trump trying to take the world down into the fourth rung of hell</p> <footer> <cite>Sherman-Palladino</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the last couple of years, the Gilmores have found a fresh teenage audience. In 2014, Netflix put all seven seasons on air again in the US (and, this summer, in the UK). Graham explains why she thinks it has struck a new chord: \u201cI just think it is a really welcoming world. My boyfriend has a 14-year-old and I\u2019m like, \u2018Get your face out of your phone!\u2019 and I wonder if this is almost like a period piece.\u201d And it\u2019s true: already the show feels dated, a world of flip phones, where the only filters are those used for coffee. Sherman-Palladino thinks the timing is key for the revival: \u201cIt\u2019s a place to go in between watching Donald Trump trying to take the world down into the fourth rung of hell.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-04-15/the-gilmore-girls-reunion-was-inspired-by-sherlock\">Inspired by the Sherlock format</a>, Sherman-Palladino has written the series in the form of four 90-minute films. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTnU5MG5Edw\">first trailer</a>, released in July, features updated cultural references \u2013 for instance, the leads debating whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">Amy Schumer</a> would like Lorelai (answer: no, because of the comedian\u2019s love of water sports \u2013 the Gilmores do not do sport).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGGNNSmGDpU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kGGNNSmGDpU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I ask Sherman-Palladino to pick an episode that best sums up the show for anyone unfamiliar with it. She chooses Road Trip To Harvard from the second season: Lorelai has called off an engagement and suggests a trip to Harvard to Rory, as a cover for running away. \u201cThen she sees that in a couple of years her whole life is going to change, because her daughter is going to be gone in this wonderful place. It\u2019s a quiet episode, but it\u2019s about these two women and how they belong to each other.\u201d</p> <p>In autumn 2010, my mother and I set out on a road trip \u201cto find Stars Hollow\u201d. My dad was living in a care home and my brother was living in New York. We flew to Boston in November, and my brother drove up to meet us. We knew it was the wrong state, but one afternoon we asked him to drive us out of the city in an attempt to find a little town that might be like the set of Gilmore Girls. He was bemused but obliging. We ended up in Salem, which was just creepy, and asked my brother to drive us back to the city so we could make the free wine and cheese hour at the hotel. I sense Lorelai and Rory would have done the same.</p> <p>Recently, I asked my mum why she enjoyed Gilmore Girls so much. \u201cI loved the relationship between Lorelai and Rory, and hoped that our relationship was similar,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw the parallel between you and Rory \u2013 determined, sensible, ambitious, with journalistic hopes, but not too nerdy.\u201d Thanks, Mum. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m like Lorelai,\u201d she continued, \u201cthough I did work behind the bar at a Berni Inn in 1976.\u201d Then she turned serious. \u201cI think I saw how the relationship flourished despite the lack of a permanent father figure in Rory\u2019s life, at the same time as we were losing our own male lead.\u201d And with that, we popped a Lorelai on.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80109415\">Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life</a> is released on Netflix on 25 November</p>",
  "<p>Serious tensions are emerging between the health service and local government.<br></p> <p>There are three sources of conflict \u2013 centrally-imposed secrecy over the sustainability and transformation plan (STP) process, whether the aim of STPs is to fix the NHS or develop an integrated health and care system, and disputes over whether the financial plans being sent to NHS England are fact or fantasy.</p> <p>At least five councils have now published the STP, despite NHS England asking local areas to keep them hidden until the central bodies have given their verdict.</p> <p>This pointless subterfuge has put local politicians in an invidious position; if they do as they are told they run the risk of being accused of conniving in a cover-up of plans to shut services. Faced with incurring the wrath of either NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens or local voters, it is not a difficult choice. The surprise is that more councils have not taken the same step.</p> <p>The first local authority to reveal one of the plans was Birmingham city council. Its chief executive, Mark Rogers, articulated publicly the frustrations many in local government express privately. He complained in the Health Service Journal that Stevens and NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey were pressurising NHS organisations to sort out the health service debt crisis rather than make the entire health and care system sustainable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/oct/21/sustainability-and-transformation-plans-least-bad-option-nhs\">Sustainability and transformation plans are 'least bad option' for NHS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the Ncas social care conference on Friday, NHS England operations director, Matthew Swindells, was forced to apologise after he said that councillors needed to be \u201cmanaged\u201d in the STP process.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I said \u2018managed\u2019 I meant brought into the whole of the conversation,\u201d he responded to angry lead members for adult social care, who protested that they had been shut out of local STP discussions. \u201cThat was not our intention. If that has happened, that is not satisfactory and I apologise for that.\u201d</p> <p>Swindells admitted that NHSE\u2019s handling of the STP process had been \u201cnot our finest hour\u201d, explaining that while \u201cmost\u201d of the 44 plans were good work, \u201ca lot\u201d needed rewriting before they were understandable by a wider audience. They would all be published before Christmas.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5yfv-web.pdf\">Five Year Forward View</a> held out the prospect of moving the centre of gravity of the health and care system at least a few inches towards primary and community services. But the STP process is now in danger of reinforcing the domination of the hospital sector rather than reforming it. The implications of that are far more serious than simply maintaining a system that is failing to cope; it will require even more money to be pumped into hospitals to expand the number of beds.</p> <p>Arguably the biggest weakness of the STP process is that the pressure on hospitals to get their finances under control is so intense that some are offering up plans for savings that have virtually no chance of being achieved. One council chief executive said a local deeply-indebted hospital was claiming that it would save millions but did not have a credible plan for making it happen.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Rogers took to the Today programme\u2019s airwaves to ram the point home, pointing out that the funding gap will not be closed by \u201csimply using the transformation word endlessly\u201d.</p> <p>Another local government chief I spoke to was visibly angry at the failure of his local hospital to take even the most basic steps to improve their estatesmanagement, back-office systems and procurement, while his authority was being eviscerated by another round of cuts \u2013 with public health taking a big hit.</p> <p>There is a cultural chasm between the NHS and local government when it comes to handling public money. It is illegal for local authorities to run a deficit on their services spending, so they are compelled to make tough decisions to live within their means. Chief financial officers have extensive powers to intervene if they believe unlawful expenditure is going to be incurred.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/09/lethal-combination-secrecy-jargon-overshadowed-nhs-plans\">A lethal combination of secrecy and jargon has overshadowed NHS plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast, in some trusts there appears little connection between the financial decisions of the board and what actually happens.

Going to an incident in a small area, like a cul de sac, can be particularly challenging. If we\u2019ve been called to put a bonfire out because it\u2019s out of control we can be met with a lot of animosity from people still enjoying the party. On the other hand, there will be those with young children or dogs, or elderly residents who are getting frightened, keen for us to extinguish the blaze quickly. </p> <p> Our main goal is to keep everyone safe. Luckily I have a great crew behind me who understand our mission and who are great at engaging with people in challenging situations.</p> <p>I admit that at the start of my career bonfire night worried me a little, as I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. But, after being with the service for six and a half years, I now approach this period raring to go.</p> <p>I absolutely love my job and I\u2019m ready to serve and protect the community once again this year. However, my crew and I cannot always do this alone so I\u2019d ask that if you see a crew of firefighters out tackling a fire or incident please try and be respectful. Our job is to keep you and your local community safe.

  "<p>Picture a child entering the world, around the time that a new social networking venture known as thefacebook.com<strong> </strong>is making its own entrance to the world. It is 2004, and the child is easy to picture. Her parents have photographed their daughter\u2019s first breath, first smile, first spoonfuls and first steps. When she reaches school age, she is snapped in uniform, probably outside the front door, and one parent, probably her mother, shares the image with friends. The child learns to read, write her name. She wins certificates, excels at sport. When Twitter, Instagram and later Vine arrive, her public identities multiply. She starts secondary school.</p> <p>In a few months, this child and her classmates will begin to turn 13 and, perhaps, create their own Facebook accounts. When they do, they will come face to face with their digital shadow. They may step into it easily, or try to sever themselves from it, but it won\u2019t let go, this pre-existent media identity, because it has logged their lives from the moment they left the womb. Some will recognise their digital shadow, but what of those whose online identity bears little relation to their sense of self, or to the public identity they want to share? For years, parents have fretted about their children\u2019s posting activities, while continuing to post as they wish about their offspring. Is it time they stopped \u2013 or at least asked for permission first?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/05/do-parents-overshare-pictures-of-their-children-on-social-media\">Do parents overshare pictures of their children on social media?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today these questions are on the minds of the children at Kingsford community school in Beckton, east London, where the 13-, 14- and 15-year-old members of the Debate Mate after-school club are filing into a classroom on the first floor, slinging down school bags and glancing at the motion on the whiteboard. \u201cThis house would ban parents from posting about their children on social media,\u201d the debate leader writes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird your parents are still posting pictures of you on social media,\u201d someone says. One boy, Malachi, bows his head and writes a single word on his notepad: reputation. \u201cThis is really about consent,\u201d his friend says. \u201cDo I want to be seen by a larger, broader range of people?\u201d There is a loud hum of agreement and one girl raises her voice: \u201cParents! We don\u2019t want them invading our privacy. Because some of us, the only privacy we get is through social media.\u201d</p> <p>These pupils often discuss social networking sites, their attractions and perils, but this is the first time they have turned their scrutiny on their own parents. And yet parents are the object of an increasingly aggressive interrogation. This spring a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/12186495/12-year-old-bully-shamed-by-mother-in-viral-Facebook-post.html\">mother from Shropshire called out her son\u2019s bullying on Facebook</a>, only for the post to go viral; the criticism of her became so intense she removed it and changed her Facebook page and phone number. Next came <a href=\"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/14436381.Meet_Scotland_s_baby_fashionista_who_has_over_120_000_followers_on_Instagram/\">the 20-year-old mother from Balloch, Scotland</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/viral/893907/scots-mum-accused-sexualising-baby-daughter-fashion-pictures-go-global-instagram/\">photographs of her 11-month-old daughter in tiny high fashion outfits</a> attracted an Instagram following that included Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian \u2013 until critics claimed the woman was sexualising her baby. She has since locked the account and gone to ground. After her came the Arizona father who nakedly cradled his naked, feverish baby in the shower, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-36322279\">an image his wife snapped and shared</a>, before Facebook removed it as offensive.</p> <p>Excessive sharing about your children has long incited disapproval, but recently the disapproval has begun to acquire a proto-legal tinge. In March, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gendarmerienationale/posts/1046288785435316\">French police warned parents against posting photos of their children</a> on social media; according to social media analyst Eric Delcroix, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/french-parents-told-their-children-might-sue-them-for-pictures-put-on-facebook-a6906671.html\">the children could soon be able to sue them for posting inappropriate pictures</a>, under the country\u2019s privacy laws. The treasurer of the UK\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.hrla.org.uk/\">Human Rights Lawyers Association</a>, Leanne Targett-Parker, echoes the idea that it is only a matter of time before children mount legal challenges against oversharing parents. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine it not being something that starts to develop within the next five to 10 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how there <em>can\u2019t</em> be attempts at suing people for putting up posts that they\u2019re unhappy with.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One day my hair was all raggedy, sticking up all over. My auntie put it\u00a0on Facebook. I was so embarrassed I\u00a0cried</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some parents may shrug off the shaming stories \u2013 and the professionalised sharing of family vloggers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SHAYTARDS\">the Shaytards</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUOfKuaLb04\">Brataleys</a>, the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BallingersPresent\"> Ballingers</a> \u2013 as beyond the range of their own moderate social media activity. But listen to the children in the Kingsford classroom and it becomes clear how many degrees there are of shame. To these teenagers, even small instances of sharing can be divisive. When I ask if anyone has experienced being overshared themselves, hands shoot up, but the answers are a long way from the public shaming that normally grabs headlines. They are exactly the sort of infringements that many parents will commit without a second thought.</p> <p>\u201cI was eating a Subway. Chicken teriyaki. Eating that and my mum just took the picture and posted it on Facebook,\u201d one pupil says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was little my parents took a picture of me being potty-trained. Three weeks ago they posted it on Facebook. Me on the toilet. It was really embarrassing,\u201d another adds.</p> <p>\u201cI was with my aunt in the park. I was wearing my scarf but I didn\u2019t have a pin. It flew off and my hair was all raggedy, sticking up all over the place. My auntie put it on Facebook. I was so embarrassed I was crying. I asked her to take it down but she said, \u2018No, it looks cute.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy uncle posted when his daughter had diarrhoea: \u2018Pray for her.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One girl, 14, raises her hand. \u201cParents love to post things about you, personal information that you might not like,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich kind of affects your relationship with them. Now, when you want to speak to them about certain things, you\u2019re worried they might post it.\u201d</p> <p>Her classmate Erin stands up. Her team supports the motion on the whiteboard \u2013 that parents should be banned from posting \u2013 and they have an idea. \u201cWe want to pass a law that requires open forms of social media to put a consent button on their pages, so a child can report whether their parents have posted about them without consent,\u201d she declares. \u201cIf parents refuse to cooperate, they will be fined the amount of \u00a31,000.\u201d</p> <p>These suggestions may sound excessive and unfeasible; in fact they lie squarely within the recommendations made by a number of adults campaigning in this field. Erin\u2019s idea of a penalty, for instance, echoes the attempts by a Democratic state representative in Illinois, <a href=\"http://www.lashawnkford.com\">La Shawn K Ford</a>, to make the shaming of children on social networking sites an offence. Offending parents should face a penalty, he has argued, which, just like Erin\u2019s, would be a fine paid directly to the child. As for the apparently far-fetched idea of a \u201cconsent button\u201d, this sounds uncannily similar to the \u201cdelete button\u201d proposed by <a href=\"http://5rightsframework.com/\">5Rights</a>, the campaign steered by the peer and film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/beeban-kidron\">Beeban Kidron</a> to protect and empower children online.</p> <p>More generally, the debaters\u2019 irritation chimes with research published in March by a team at the University of Michigan. After interviewing 249 parent-children pairings across 40 US states, the researchers found that children were more than twice as likely as parents to say that adults <a href=\"http://media.wix.com/ugd/a0f093_3ca344c37a2a4271a32a8670eeec5abf.pdf\">should not post information online about them without permission</a>. Would the Kingsford children concur? Class E11 rings with shouts of, \u201cYes!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen,\u201d their teacher, Miss Alimi, says.</p> <p>\u201cMiss!\u201d one of her students cries. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing called wishful thinking.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Miss Alimi is right: children are unlikely to gain control over their parents\u2019 posting habits. But there is still scope for a conversation about what constitutes fair sharing, and each family will draw its lines differently. Consider the case of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heatherwhittenphoto/\">Heather Whitten</a>, the Arizona-based photographer and teaching assistant who took the photograph of her husband and son in the shower that Facebook didn\u2019t like. Whitten saw the moment, and the image, as the height of parental care. Their toddler, Fox, had had a temperature for hours. Her husband, Thomas, was trying to cool the child\u2019s fever. For two years, Whitten kept the image private, finally posting it in May after Facebook removed other pictures she had shared of her children. She wanted to take a stand, \u201cto show that it\u2019s just innocent pictures that people are twisting and getting offended by\u201d.</p> <p>She was unprepared for the response \u2013 for the way in which Facebook removed images from her page every time it received sufficient complaints, for the level of disapproval the image provoked, including <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fatherhood/is-this-image-of-a-man-showering-with-his-severely-ill-son-inapp/\">claims that it was \u201csexual\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d</a>. But Whitten\u2019s stand had one other unexpected consequence. As the interested and the outraged followed the link to her blog, some began to question the legality, as well as the sense, of showing children naked. \u201cI just thought you were free to post what you wanted on the internet,\u201d Whitten says now. But then she discovered that in the state of Arizona, \u201cyou can\u2019t show any naked images of children\u2019s pelvic area or butt, and I realised I was technically breaking a law.\u201d</p> <p>She removed the blog \u2013 \u201ctook everything down\u201d \u2013 but \u201cin the bigger, moral sense, I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve done anything wrong. I\u2019m not exploiting my children. I\u2019m not abusing my children. I\u2019m just sharing our lives exactly how they are.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She saw how many pictures there were of her and she didn\u2019t like it. Now any time you see Lily, it is with her permission</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whitten\u2019s experience shows just how nebulous and fraught the territory of sharing can be. Sure, her experience would never befall those for whom posting naked images of children is strictly out of bounds. But the case of Whitten is complicated. She and her partner are raising their children \u201cto not be ashamed or embarrassed of their bodies\u201d. They are living online within the offline boundaries they have set for themselves. \u201cPeople don\u2019t show nudity a lot of times because they think it will have a negative impact on their child. Your footprint is for ever on the internet,\u201d Whitten says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s absurd. I just hope to combat that a little. Who knows how it will actually turn out, but I hope that my children won\u2019t ever look back and see pictures of themselves as children and feel embarrassed by other people seeing them as well. Because there is nothing to be embarrassed about.\u201d</p> <p>Fox, the toddler in the shower, is still too young to veto or cherish the photograph that caused such controversy, but his older sister Lily, nine, \u201cloves it\u201d, according to her mother. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t really wrap her head around why people would think there was anything wrong with it.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, while Lily was comfortable with the image of her baby brother, she was deeply unhappy with other photographs her mother had uploaded \u2013 the apparently harmless kind that many parents post. One day at around the age of six, Lily began to scroll through her mother\u2019s Instagram. \u201cShe saw how many pictures there were of her and she didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Whitten says. For months, whenever Lily saw Whitten with the camera, she hid. \u201cThat really opened up a conversation about why I take pictures, why I share pictures, who I share pictures with.\u201d Now, Whitten says, \u201cany time you see Lily, it is with her permission\u201d.</p> <p>Alicia Blum-Ross, <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/parenting4digitalfuture/2016/09/14/where-and-when-does-a-parents-right-to-share-end-online/\">a researcher at the London School of Economics</a>, believes we are entering a crucial moment. \u201cWe are starting to see kids who have grown up, whose parents have shared images, and who are beginning to say: \u2018Wait a minute. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable with that.\u2019\u201d What families need, she thinks, is a coming-of-age conversation. After all, it was Lily Whitten herself, at six, who instigated the dialogue with her mother that earned her the right to veto content. Does Lily have advice for other children? \u201cThey should say, \u2018Please don\u2019t take any pictures of me \u2013 it makes me uncomfortable,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd \u2018I might change my mind one day, but today I don\u2019t want to have to hide from your camera.\u2019\u201d Soon this \u201cdigital rulebook\u201d chat might become as standard as the one about the birds and the bees. Blum-Ross sees nothing to fear. Both parties, she points out, are united by being the first generation \u2013 of parents and children \u2013 to negotiate this path. \u201cIt can be a really shared experience,\u201d she says enthusiastically. \u201cThe dilemmas are shared dilemmas, the pleasures are shared pleasures. It\u2019s a moment of overlap.\u201d</p> <p>Blum-Ross, who has three-year-old twins, says she is \u201cnot a person who advises total protection. I certainly wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t share things about your children online.\u2019 It\u2019s important that parents are able to claim their own space about that. It\u2019s OK to say, \u2018I need this community.\u2019\u201d Whitten, too, has always seen her sharing in those terms: \u201cI feel I share everything as my story \u2013 this is my perspective on my life as a mother with these children. I\u2019m not trying to put words in their mouth, or tell the story from their perspective.\u201d</p> <p>It is one of the oldest questions of storytelling: who does the story belong to? Blum-Ross, Whitten and countless others believe they are telling their own stories, and sharing posts about their children where they fit that perspective. But it\u2019s complicated. \u201cI never had a filter before,\u201d says Whitten, sounding forlorn. \u201cI love the idea of having connections with other mothers and people. But I can\u2019t share the way I used to.\u201d After the Facebook furore, she is still fathoming whether to photograph differently or simply stop sharing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2819599aa5bd8855bc23ff24cf7f04fb5d2b70ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2819599aa5bd8855bc23ff24cf7f04fb5d2b70ad/129_191_489_666/367.jpg\" alt=\"Child making a mess with spaghetti in tomato sauce\" width=\"367\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Whitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For other parents, such as the author Amy Webb, who has written about <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/data_mine_1/2013/09/facebook_privacy_and_kids_don_t_post_photos_of_your_kids_online.html\">her commitment to post nothing about her daughter online</a>, the same process of consideration deters them from sharing altogether. They have the big conversation \u2013 with themselves, each other, sometimes their children \u2013 and decide the best answer is silence.</p> <p>When the Guardian asked readers about their experiences, Apricot, who is 30 and lives in the north of England, wrote: \u201cWhen I started to Facebook my own child\u2019s pictures, I began to feel intensely uncomfortable. How could I instil in her a principle of privacy when I had essentially devalued hers from the beginning?\u201d She stopped posting. \u201cWhat we post is facets of ourselves,\u201d said Tamasine Preece, a teacher in Bridgend, whose PhD includes a chapter on oversharing. \u201cI think there is a morality to using children to explore parts of ourselves. My children are not me. They are separate.\u201d</p> <p>Kidron, who says she has never interacted with her children on social networking sites (they are now 19 and 21), thinks that her behaviour reflects the idea that \u201coversharing is inappropriate when the whole point of the journey to adulthood is to self-define \u2013 to work out who you are, what your values are, how you\u2019re going to fit in. I think we have not thought hard enough about what that process might be like, if so much is shared and so much is public.</p> <p>\u201cThere are three issues here,\u201d she says. \u201cOne is the right to a certain sort of privacy. The second is the need of young people to transgress and bump into their edges, and for that to be somewhat safe. The third is the need to break away from the model of your parents.\u201d</p> <p>My own Facebook posts dried up as I researched this article. Of course, I can ask my children for consent, but I am not sure they are ready for a responsibility with permanent consequences. If an eight-year-old consents to a post, is it fair to act upon that consent, or should a parent second-guess how those feelings might evolve? After all, posts are eternal and a child cannot speak for his or her future self.</p> <p>In any case, a child\u2019s consent can be capricious, even within one given day. My daughter, at eight, would prefer her photo not to appear on Facebook, but would be more than happy to see a video of herself playing Swingball on YouTube. My six-year-old, meanwhile, says he is sad that \u201cGoogle doesn\u2019t know me\u201d. Even the teenagers at Kingsford are conflicted. In the end, they vote against Erin\u2019s suggestion of a fine for parents who share without their children\u2019s consent, but they squirm in their seats, clawing the air for a turn to speak when I ask what rules they would lay down for their parents:</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say embarrassing jokes \u2019cos that\u2019s too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs far as the world is concerned, we\u2019re not related.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPost pictures of me when I look amazing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t post baby pictures unless I\u2019m happy and fully clothed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever comment on my pictures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stalk my profile waiting for me to load pictures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t follow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t add me. Or my friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell dad jokes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t take pictures of me eating food, \u2019cos my friends take it out of context.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and use internet slang on our wall. On your friends\u2019 profiles you can embarrass yourselves all you want, but when it\u2019s on our profiles it looks like we\u2019ve taught you to say that. And it makes us look really bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay behind the times.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Of course, every family is different. In a quiet cul-de-sac in Newton Abbot, Devon, with sunlight pouring into the lounge, Molly Povey and her 11-year-old son Roman are sitting on the sofa discussing their experience of going viral.</p> <p>In April 2015, with Roman desperately unhappy at school, Molly posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cardsforroman/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE&amp;fref=nf\">plea on her Facebook page</a> for his classmates\u2019 parents to send her \u201cbeautiful son\u201d birthday cards. \u201cRoman doesn\u2019t have any friends and often cries himself to sleep,\u201d the post began. It was shared around the world. \u201cMaybe 40,000 times,\u201d Molly says. (Interestingly, her post breaks only the second of the Kingsford rules, by disclosing that Molly and Roman are related.)</p> <p>Neither Molly nor Roman, nor his two brothers, nor his dad Ian, who says he hates social media, were prepared for what happened next. Thousands of people left birthday greetings online. At the office of a friend \u2013 whose address was hastily borrowed to protect Roman\u2019s privacy \u2013 cards and gifts began to arrive. Molly formalised the chaos into a Cards For Roman Facebook page.</p> <p>Friendships were made, and some of them have lasted \u2013 to the extent that in April, a year after his mother\u2019s plea for help, Roman celebrated his 12th birthday with 150 friends, strangers and Facebook friends at a Nando\u2019s in Exeter and at a second party in London. They have even met up with well-wishers in Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22ffa6dbd86c634b80ff7290207557fb67e1bb2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22ffa6dbd86c634b80ff7290207557fb67e1bb2a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Povey and son Roman with cards he was sent by strangers all over the world after she posted on Facebook about his loneliness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly Povey, whose post about her son\u2019s loneliness went viral, with some of the birthday cards he was sent by strangers all over the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Rees/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Molly tells this story, talking quickly because there is a lot to fit in, Roman scurries to and fro with his gifts: a Star Wars chess set from someone in the Netherlands, pictures from Brazilian schoolchildren (Molly says he is very big in Brazil), wicker baskets of cards.</p> <p>But sometimes Molly worries. \u201cA bit. I think, what happens in years to come if he Googles himself and finds \u2018Lonely boy with no friends\u2019?\u201d Last year the local paper ran a front-page headline saying just that. \u201cI thought, oh my God, what have I done?\u201d Roman was with her, and comforted her. \u201cBut it is true,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really lonely.\u201d</p> <p>For the Povey family, the benefits of Molly\u2019s post are visible each day. His tearfulness has declined. The whole household is happier. Molly herself has found, in the Facebook page, a community that makes her feel supported and which, in turn, needs her. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve got a responsibility,\u201d Ian says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing.\u201d He himself has never read the initial post, usually declines to appear in photographs, and thinks that when it comes to sharing, \u201cIt\u2019s best to err on the side of caution.\u201d Occasionally, Molly tells her community that Roman is having a bad day, or that she is: she doesn\u2019t want to pretend to people who know loneliness that loneliness doesn\u2019t happen. And yet, as Ian says, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know sometimes what Roman really thinks about it.\u201d</p> <p>Molly leads the way up to Roman\u2019s bedroom, to show more of the gifts people sent. There is James Bond notepaper from the actor Andrew Scott, who played the baddie in Spectre, and a crew T-shirt from Star Wars: Episode III.</p> <p>I wonder if Roman minds thousands of strangers knowing he\u2019s sad. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d Molly asks him. \u201cDo you mind that people know you get really lonely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Roman replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go yes: I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Molly repeats, incredulous.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, that people around the world know you are lonely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it now?\u201d she asks again.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Molly says. She sounds deflated.</p> <p>\u201cIt just feels weird, it does,\u201d Roman tells her.</p> <p>Although Molly has publicly revealed aspects of her son\u2019s emotional life that other parents might hesitate to share, she is not incautious. For months she withheld Roman\u2019s full name and has only recently felt comfortable disclosing that he is autistic. Before her heartfelt post, she deleted baby pictures of Roman\u2019s older brother because he was about to start secondary school; surely the Kingsford debaters would approve.</p> <p>Like Alicia Blum-Ross and Heather Whitten, Molly has rules. \u201cThink about whether it\u2019s appropriate \u2013 if in a year or five years your child would be embarrassed by anything you\u2019ve done. And just why are you actually doing it? Is it a positive thing, or is it to give you a social boost as opposed to the children?\u201d Molly might appear to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from Tamasine Preece, who never posts, but the morals that underpin their behaviour are remarkably alike. And while Molly thinks \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be posting pictures of kids in the bath\u201d, in some ways her posts are as exposing as Whitten\u2019s.</p> <p>Later that evening Molly emails to say that the conversation with Roman had troubled her. After I\u2019d left the house, she offered to take down the page, she says, but Roman said not to. \u201cTurns out he was confused in his room and was talking about not liking being lonely, and not his page.\u201d</p> <p>Or maybe Roman, in that moment, wished no one knew he was lonely. Then, later, when his mother checked, he minded less. Or maybe he understands that the community his mother has created has benefited him and his family. But these are only guesses. It is impossible to know. He is young, and the world changes many times a day. His parents have his best interests at heart, but like any who share news of their children, every time they post, they cross a line between privacy and publicity. Where each parent sees the line is an unsteady, unsettleable question. For Roman, and others like him, the truth may be something they are still working out, or simply prefer not to share.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve gone online after a few glasses of wine and said things I shouldn\u2019t have\u2019: parents and children talk social media </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08a1eceb61b2b567c83fbe784ef07628311a5544\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08a1eceb61b2b567c83fbe784ef07628311a5544/0_0_5305_3537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Star (on left) and her daughter Sadie in the garden of their home their home in Kemp town, Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Her posts can be really personal\u2019: Sadie Star with her mum, Elaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Browning/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Elaine Star, 47, a PA and poet, and her youngest daughter Sadie, 17, a student, live in Brighton </strong><em><br></em></p> <p><strong>Elaine </strong>I\u2019ve had a Facebook account for about 10 years, so Sadie was probably seven when I first joined. I use it to keep in touch with different groups of people \u2013 old friends, my poetry group, the puppet show I work with. I\u2019m also friends with a lot of my kids\u2019 friends, because it\u2019s often the best way of locating where mine are. I don\u2019t think it bothers them. All their friends are happy to come to the house and sit around my kitchen table and chat, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s odd. I don\u2019t post on their friends\u2019 pages \u2013 maybe just a \u201cHappy birthday\u201d message. But I\u2019m really impressed by the sorts of things they share about science, politics \u2013 they\u2019re very funny and insightful.</p> <p>I have definitely made mistakes online. I\u2019ve gone on after a few glasses of wine and said things I shouldn\u2019t have. There have been some angry messages about the state my kids and their friends have left the house in. And they have all asked me to take down various photos. I get it: I\u2019m sensitive to the fact that they\u2019re trying to be cool or whatever.</p> <p>I think I\u2019m past the stage of worrying too much about embarrassing my kids. I write poems that are very personal, and I share them on Facebook. But that\u2019s how I express myself. The kids have occasionally said, \u201cStop living your life on Facebook\u201d but I\u2019m an open person.</p> <p>They\u2019re all fairly streetwise. We have a very open dialogue in our house. They have occasionally posted things that I think are a bit questionable \u2013 showing off a bit about drinking with their friends, that sort of thing. I might have said, \u201cHmm, you might want to think about that\u201d but I\u2019ve never said, \u201cTake that down.\u201d I\u2019m glad Facebook wasn\u2019t around to record my teenage years, though. I\u2019d hate it.</p> <p><strong>Sadie</strong> My siblings and I all use Facebook in different ways. Stevie posts a lot of pictures; Maisie likes to talk about stuff. Me and Joe post a lot of news stories, and I like posting videos or songs. I don\u2019t like to put up personal pictures, or get too emotional on Facebook. My mum\u2019s posts can be really personal.</p> <p>At the beginning, I didn\u2019t really want to be friends with her on Facebook. I didn\u2019t really want her seeing pictures of me that my friends had posted. They weren\u2019t anything bad; they just felt like a bit of my life that was separate from her. Now I don\u2019t mind as much \u2013 I\u2019m more open. She\u2019s also friends with a lot of my friends on there. That\u2019s not a problem, except that she\u2019s quite free with what she writes. Something would happen between us, and she\u2019d put it in a poem, and post it to Facebook, and I wondered whether my friends would see her in a different way. I think maybe I felt protective of her. But no one has ever said anything.</p> <p>She has a lot of photos of us when we were little. When I was a bit younger, I hated seeing some of them online. I remember there was one where I was holding my pet hamster and I just thought I looked greasy and rough. And once my room was really messy and my mum said, \u201cI\u2019ll take pictures and put it on Facebook.\u201d I would have hated it if she\u2019d actually done it. Now I\u2019m a bit older, I\u2019ve learned to let go of it all a bit more. I think I\u2019m OK with what\u2019s out there about me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578f0779fb5404c4cc177d4e36aa289dba7ca232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578f0779fb5404c4cc177d4e36aa289dba7ca232/0_730_4725_5176/913.jpg\" alt=\"Nell Redelsperger-Talbot with her mother, Juliet, in their garden in Suffolk\" width=\"913\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t feel like the same person I was when I was little\u2019: Nell Redelsperger-Talbot <strong></strong>with her mother, Juliet.

One of my followers on Instagram, someone I knew, turned on me, then a couple of others who I\u2019d thought were friendly were making comments on my posts. It wasn\u2019t nice, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to handle it. In school they give you lessons about what to do if it happens to you, but when it comes to it, the reality is very different. But the school did deal with it.</p> <p>After that, I became a lot more careful about who I accept as friends, and what people can see. Now I have one account for my photography and a separate one for my closest friends.</p> <p>I have looked briefly at Mum\u2019s Facebook account, but I don\u2019t have a clue about how Facebook works. I don\u2019t think I mind that there are photos of me. If you know the people that can see those photos, then that\u2019s OK. If it\u2019s not private, I\u2019m not so sure about that. But I don\u2019t find it embarrassing. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t feel like the same person I was when I was little. It doesn\u2019t feel as if those pictures are of me.</p> <p><strong>Juliet</strong> The cyberbullying was a harrowing time for Nell, but what was good was that some of her friends were supportive and took screenshots of the comments as proof of what was happening. Nell was worried I would be angry, so she didn\u2019t come to me until after it was over. It was awful, but in a way, I think it helped her understand what you\u2019re exposed to online.</p> <p>Nell is a great photographer, and she sends me pictures, but I<strong> </strong>check that she is happy before I post anything on Facebook. Your children have every right to veto what you put online, although they have to be a certain age before they understand what it means. Neither of mine have ever had an issue with something I\u2019ve posted, but then they\u2019re the generation that are used to having photos of themselves everywhere. I think it meant something different for my generation. It took so long to get photos developed that seeing yourself was so much more important.</p> <p>The children were very little when I first signed up. I don\u2019t remember thinking much about privacy then. It wasn\u2019t until I read in the paper how posts about your children might be seen by complete strangers that I changed my settings.</p> <p>As time went by, I began to feel uncomfortable about posting. It felt like everything online was becoming more about \u201cLook how wonderful I am\u201d and it made me feel quite down. So I left for a while. Eventually I rejoined because it was hard to keep up with everything. So now I\u2019ve started again but in a very different way.</p>",

Even a \u201cdivorcee\u201d with children was looked upon with a mixture of pity, disdain and sneaking admiration. So there are many more of these awful tales than we have heard.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t surprising that for so many of the people affected by this policy, the apology means little. It has come in the wake of great societal change. The people taught the church the error of its ways, not the other way round. It\u2019s good that the church acknowledges that what it did, again and again and again, was grotesque. One rather suspects, however, that the apology has been made to allow the church to draw a line under the matter as much as to make amends.</p> <p>It\u2019s astounding, of course, that such moralistic barbarity was occurring on these shores just 40 years ago. In truth, the girls who had their babies taken were simply the most egregious example of general attitudes that insisted not only that the sole fulfilling role for a woman was to be a mother, but also that the context in which motherhood could be attained was narrow, prescriptive and financially dependent. My own mother, who married at 26 and had her first baby within the year, said many times that before she met my father, people feared that she had been \u201cleft on the shelf\u201d. My mother had feared it too. In the early 1960s, a first baby at 27 was considered rather elderly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that a woman has plenty of time to establish her career before starting a family is beloved of feminism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet, even though a revolution in attitudes to women and their babies has been achieved since the last home for morally repugnant teenage sex maniacs closed, the motherhood issue remains fairly fraught.</p> <p>Women have escaped from the ghastly idea that they must find a partner and start a family, strictly in that order, so that they can properly begin their lives. But they haven\u2019t escaped from the uncomfortable fact that in one respect the church was right. Biologically, the perfect time to have babies is when you\u2019re in your 20s. The church didn\u2019t go around controlling the lives and reproduction of women without keeping a shrewd eye on what served it best, in the way of producing a new generation of recruits.</p> <p>The sad stories of reproductive regret and anguish are different now; but they\u2019re still around. This week, the <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority</a> announced that the number of babies born through IVF in the UK has now passed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/04/more-than-250000-uk-babies-born-ivf\" title=\"\">quarter of a million mark</a>.

The latest figures put the proportion of treatments that result in a live birth at 26%. The procedure leaves a lot of people bitterly disappointed; and the older you get, the more likely you are to suffer. The proportion of successful treatments is 14% for women aged 40-42; just 5% for women aged 43-44; and a crushing 2% for women aged 45 and over.</p> <p>The idea that a woman has plenty of time to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/24/is-it-getting-tougher-for-women-to-have-babies-and-careers\" title=\"\">establish her career</a> before starting a family is beloved of feminism. Biology\u2019s not so keen. In fact, biology is even less keen than these figures let on. We know that female ova are present in the female body from birth. I spent my youth believing that they sat there, undamaged by time and environment until their turn came for a go at fertilisation. But that was just silly.</p> <p>Everyone knows, and has known for years, that the older the mother, the greater the risk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/downs-syndrome\" title=\"\">Down\u2019s syndrome</a>.

It\u2019s not uncommon to see families in which learning and social difficulties become more pronounced in the younger children.</p> <p>None of this is what ambitious young women want to hear. Of course, people like to believe they have many choices in their lives and that starting a family shouldn\u2019t have to be something that\u2019s factored in at an early stage in adulthood, like it was in the days when such preoccupations were considered the absolute centre of female existence.</p> <p>But plenty of women find themselves surveying their years spent putting themselves through a string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/27/ivf-where-all-grief-going\" title=\"\">unsuccessful IVF treatments</a> and wish someone had told them how things might turn out, back at a time when they still had their choices to make. I wish it wasn\u2019t so. But it is.</p> <p>Of all the testimony from the women whose babies were taken, most touching are the stories of reconciliation. These women didn\u2019t nurture their children as babies and didn\u2019t see them growing up. But they did get to know them and to love them. Which is something.</p> <p>Women fear being put back in their box, treated as reproductive vessels who have to follow strict rules in order to be allowed to achieve their mothering destiny. Sometimes, however, the tendency is to see realism as an attempt to regain control over women, their bodies and their choices. But we retain control over our own bodies by heeding the rules of nature \u2013 not of church, establishment or man.</p>",

It joins the likes of <em>Show Boat</em>, <em>Oklahoma!</em> and <em>West Side Story</em> as game changers, innovative productions that forever redefined what came after them. Unlike most of its predecessors, however, <em>Hamilton</em> was created by one man, Lin\u2011Manuel Miranda, who wrote the music, lyrics, and book about the musical (only Stephen Sondheim can claim as much, and none of his shows were such blockbusters). <em>Hamilton</em> fuses American history with current politics, using a soundtrack of American popular music and one of the most inventive librettos ever written. The result is that nearly every song in the show works as a complex historical concert, layering musical pasts with the musical present, just as the historical past mingles with the political present. In less than two years, it has exploded all box office records \u2013 it has sold $1bn worth of tickets \u2013 and won every theatrical prize (including the Pulitzer prize for drama), garnering the kind of hyperbolic praise that no production can possibly live up to. But <em>Hamilton</em> exceeds its own acclaim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4aa0c75db7075e2e9ca87e5de3976536b1dc347\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4aa0c75db7075e2e9ca87e5de3976536b1dc347/0_179_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phillipa Soo as Eliza and Lin-Manuel Miranda as Hamilton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillipa Soo as Eliza and Lin-Manuel Miranda as Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miranda had already created a successful musical (<em>In the Heights</em>) when he impulsively decided to read Ron Chernow\u2019s prize-winning biography <em>Alexander Hamilton</em> on holiday (Miranda\u2019s whim has made Chernow, who reportedly gets 1% of Hamilton\u2019s profit, a very wealthy man). Hamilton represents something of an anomaly in American history, a founding father who never transferred from official histories into popular mythology. There are many reasons for this, not least that Hamilton\u2019s positions were incompatible with many of our myths \u2013 he was avowedly elitist, for example, and supported the idea of a president for life \u2013 while his expansion of the federal government prompted the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, which he brutally suppressed. Neither of these facts makes it into Miranda\u2019s musical, which is the story of a \u201cyoung, scrappy and hungry\u201d immigrant from the West Indies who became the quintessential American success story through a combination of brains, hard work and audacity. Miranda creates a myth for Hamilton by celebrating him as a symbol of immigrant inclusiveness, egalitarianism and meritocracy: historically it\u2019s a stretch, but theatrically it\u2019s genius.</p> <p>Eventually Hamilton became a hero of the American revolution, George Washington\u2019s right-hand man, the nation\u2019s first secretary of the treasury, the co-author (with James Madison) of <em>The Federalist Papers</em>, and the primary proponent for federal government over state government. He argued for a national bank, created the national reserve as well as the national debt, and laid the foundations for the US\u2019s economic success. His dramatic life came to a melodramatic end when he was killed in a duel by the sitting vice president, Aaron Burr. And yet, despite all these achievements and dramas, Hamilton has been marginalised by most popular accounts of American history. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/28/culture.peterbradshaw3\">Washington</a>, Jefferson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/26/john-adams-next-box-set\">John Adams</a> have been the subject of countless books, films, miniseries and even their own popular musical, <em>1776</em>. But <em>1776</em>, which tells the story of the battle over writing the Declaration of Independence, does not even mention Hamilton.</p> <p>That sidelining resonated with Miranda, himself the son of Puerto Rican immigrants, as an emblematic instance of the nation\u2019s treatment of immigrants, both as individuals and as a collective part of the nation\u2019s history. Those twin intuitions sparked a musical about historical, cultural and political inclusion, in which an almost entirely non-white cast plays the founding fathers (and a few of the mothers, although the cast is also overwhelmingly male). The result is the most unexpected of phenomena: a Broadway hit that is about political, economic and racial history while also offering an implicit but acidic running commentary on the racial and cultural politics of the US today. Everything about the show is \u201cmeta\u201d, as layered references compound meaning like interest: Hamilton is metatheatrical, metahistorical, metamusical, metamorphic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10e9aa1e66aede05e449114fd59064b430ff5893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10e9aa1e66aede05e449114fd59064b430ff5893/0_281_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Groff as George III.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Groff as George III.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much has been written about Miranda\u2019s wide-ranging but acute musical references, from a Britpop-inflected George III (\u201cWhen you\u2019re gone, I\u2019ll go mad / So don\u2019t throw away this thing we had / Cause when push comes to shove / I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love\u201d) to the three Schuyler sisters singing about New York in the manner of Destiny\u2019s Child; from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/dec/16/the-notorious-big-biggie-smalls-10-of-the-best\">Notorious BIG</a> to Kander and Ebb. Miranda is conducting a magisterial conversation with musical theatre, which is a kind of microcosm of American popular history, marked in important ways by the mainstream\u2019s appropriation of minority cultures (<em>Show Boat</em>, <em>West Side Story</em>). Hamilton reverses that process, exploring mainstream history through the music of subcultures. Lines about racism from Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s <em>South Pacific</em> (\u201cyou\u2019ve got to be carefully taught\u201d) rub shoulders with Busta Rhymes; Sondheim\u2019s experiments in perspective from <em>Pacific Overtures</em> meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg\">Snoop Dogg</a>. There is a running gag about Adams, in which Miranda riffs on <em>1776</em>; its opening number is the resounding \u201cSit Down, John!\u201d in which the Continental Congress tells him to shut up. Miranda is doing the same, telling Adams and the Anglocentric American history he embodies to step aside. He sidelines Adams, waiting until the second act to mention him, and then has Hamilton sing, \u201cSit down, John, you fat motherfucker!\u201d Less explicit (in every sense) is Miranda\u2019s decision to give Hamilton a signature refrain \u2013 \u201cI will never be satisfied\u201d \u2014 that echoes Adams\u2019s line from <em>1776</em>, \u201cI have always been dissatisfied, I know that.\u201d</p> <p>Miranda\u2019s lyrics are dizzying: he rhymes Socrates with mediocrities, before linking manumission, abolition and ammunition. Gilbert and Sullivan are not only sampled, they are schooled; Miranda gleefully told a journalist he felt he\u2019d improved the rhyme in Gilbert\u2019s famous patter, which becomes George Washington\u2019s rap: \u201cNow I\u2019m the model of a modern major general / The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all / Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal.\u201d Puns abound with the exuberant energy of a word-drunk writer: \u201cLocal merchants deny us equipment, assistance / They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfb128f674fa697bd73e7e40995c69e4f624ad27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfb128f674fa697bd73e7e40995c69e4f624ad27/0_74_5009_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daveed Diggs in Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost all of <em>Hamilton</em> is sung through, as opera: there is very little spoken dialogue, and much less rap than some accounts might suggest. When rap comes in, it is with \u201cpractical tactical brilliance\u201d, as when Miranda turns cabinet debates into rap battles, in which Jefferson and Hamilton face off and drop the mic, in reference to Eminem\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/8-mile\"><em>8 Mile</em></a>. Hamilton and Burr\u2019s fatal duel is likened to gang violence by sampling the legendary \u201cTen Crack Commandments\u201d by Notorious BIG, himself notoriously the victim of gang violence. \u201cIt must be nice to have Washington on your side,\u201d sung by Burr, Jefferson and Madison, is ostensibly about President Washington\u2019s patronage of Hamilton, but it also becomes about modern disenfranchisement, alienated citizens who feel that Washington DC is not on their side. A song called \u201cWait for It\u201d is about Burr\u2019s character, but it is also about \u2013 wait for it \u2013 how destructive it has been for communities of colour to be told to wait their turn.</p> <p>As with the lyrics, the music is used to make historical points, rather than simply to score points. Jefferson and Burr each have a standout solo in the second act. (Miranda is markedly generous, giving his co-stars most of the best songs.) Returning from Paris, Jefferson sings \u201c<a href=\"http://genius.com/Lin-manuel-miranda-whatd-i-miss-lyrics\">What\u2019d I Miss?</a>\u201d over boogie-woogie piano with riffs on other Dixieland jazz sounds, including stride and ragtime. Its invocations of the origins of jazz as the kind of grandfather of rap are at once facetious \u2013 as performed by Daveed Diggs, Jefferson even uses \u201cjazz hands\u201d \u2013 and serious. Because Jefferson was considerably older than Hamilton and his contemporaries, Miranda gives the younger characters hip-hop influences, while Jefferson sings old-school jazz, which also lets Miranda tip his hat to classic performers such as Cab Calloway, whose vocals pointed the way to rap. As the act progresses, Jefferson\u2019s influence on Burr deepens. By the time Burr breaks out into his great second act number, \u201cThe Room Where It Happens\u201d, his musical style has subtly shifted, as he picks up Jefferson\u2019s Dixieland jazz. Burr\u2019s song is the kind of gospel-inspired, choir-backed showstopper that composers have used for more than a century in American musical theatre to get audiences on their feet, from Cole Porter\u2019s \u201cBlow, Gabriel, Blow\u201d to Frank Loesser\u2019s \u201cSit Down, You\u2019re Rockin\u2019 the Boat\u201d. But unlike those songs, which are great fun but almost entirely meaningless, \u201cThe Room Where It Happens\u201d is a foot-stomping, barnstorming, surge-to-your feet instant classic about \u2013 the historical record.</p> <p>It\u2019s a turning point in the show in many senses: Burr stops waiting for it, and the gaps in the historical record become a metaphor for political exclusion. \u201cThe Room Where It Happens\u201d is about the way in which historiography constructs mythologies of power, and it\u2019s about realpolitik, how politics gets done. Burr sings, \u201cNo one really knows how the / Parties get to yes / The pieces that are sacrificed in / Ev\u2019ry game of chess / We just assume that it happens / But no one else is in / The room where it happens\u201d, before launching into his power verse: \u201cI wanna be in / The room where it happens / The room where it happens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f5aa95396844c173910604794e714588c028a77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f5aa95396844c173910604794e714588c028a77/0_343_5044_3026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Jackson as George Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miranda is putting immigrants and the descendants of slaves, black people, Latinos and Asians, low-income kids with little hope for the future, in the room where it happens. The ambitious individual left out of the \u201csmoke-filled room\u201d becomes the emblem of entire groups excluded from power. \u201cWe want our leaders to save the day \u2013 / But we don\u2019t get a say in what they trade away / We dream of a brand new start \u2013 / But we dream in the dark for the most part.\u201d The song encapsulates the entire musical, which continually raises questions of historiography and the power to shape a national narrative. Hamilton\u2019s wife, Eliza, initially wants to take her place in history \u2013 \u201cOh, let me be a part of the narrative / In the story they will write someday\u201d \u2013 but when Hamilton betrays her, she burns their letters, to control the narrative. And then in the end, when Hamilton has died far too young, Eliza sings, \u201cI put myself back in the narrative\u201d. Miranda returns in closing to the question of competing historical versions in a song in which Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Eliza all admit that what matters is, \u201cWho lives, who dies, who tells your story? Will they tell your story? \u2026 Who tells your story?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/22/hamilton-teenage-superfans-this-is-like-crazy-cool\">Hamilton's teenage superfans: 'This is, like, crazy cool'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question of what gets left out of the narrative is one that can also be asked of <em>Hamilton</em>\u2019s own mythmaking, however. Although Miranda invokes popular histories to accuse them of colour blindness, the fact is that even <em>1776</em> confronted the question of slavery far more directly back in 1969 than <em>Hamilton</em> does today. To be sure, <em>1776</em> features an all-white cast arguing about whether slavery is bad; Jefferson terribly misses his terribly blond wife and can\u2019t write the Declaration of Independence until she joins him, while his slave Sally Hemings, who probably mothered six of his children, is never mentioned. But <em>1776</em> also ends on \u201cMolasses to Rum\u201d, a startlingly frank and brutal account of the triangle trade, and an indictment of the north\u2019s hypocrisy about slavery. <em>Hamilton</em> does mention Hemings \u2013 once \u2013 and has some other references to slavery, but strongly implies that only Jefferson owned slaves, while suggesting that Hamilton was a far more dedicated abolitionist than the record shows. In fact, Washington and Madison also owned slaves, while Hamilton bought and sold slaves for his wife\u2019s family, and was inconsistent in regards to manumission.</p> <p><em>Hamilton</em> features black and brown actors, but its story never depicts a slave. That said, it\u2019s also true that minstrelsy is crucial to Miranda\u2019s project: he takes the long American minstrelsy tradition of white people in blackface on stage and reverses it. He appropriates its music, rewrites its lyrics, turns its politics on its head, and fashions the whole thing into a show that is simultaneously an excoriation of current American political realities, an encomium to American revolutionary energies, and a celebration of American musical theatre history. If you live in Britain, you will have to wait until next November for it, but when it comes, believe me, you\u2019ve gotta be in the room where it happens.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Hamilton</em> opens at the Victoria Palace theatre, London SW1E, in November 2017.

Instead, what needs to happen is a small act of corporate generosity \u2013 a token of gratitude to the climate, the landscape and the society that enabled both the picture to be painted and the fortunes of its present owners, the drinks business Diageo, to be made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/02/scottish-painting-monarch-of-the-glen-edwin-landseer-abroad-auction\">Scottish painting Monarch of the Glen could end up abroad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Landseer and the modern whisky industry achieved their early success around the same time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/may/21/6\">The painter</a>, the son of an engraver, was a Londoner who made his first visit to Scotland in 1824, aged 22. A year earlier, the British government had <a href=\"http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/history-of-scotch-whisky/\">passed the Excise Act</a>, which by legalising whisky distilling in exchange for a \u00a310 licence gave the business a respectability that illicit stills and smuggling had denied it. Technical developments in the same decade made production more reliable, with a consistent quality of spirit. Sold now in branded casks and bottles, the sales of Scottish whisky took off in England and then the empire. By the end of the 19th century, after the phylloxera epidemic ruined French vineyards (and consequently the trade in cognac as well as wine), it had become a fashionable drink around the world.</p> <p>What helped sell scotch was the vogue for Scotland and wild Scottish things, which no painter did more to promote than Landseer. In London his pictures of animals had established him as an artistic prodigy. Almost as soon as he could walk, his father had set him to work drawing the cows and sheep that then populated the fields beside what\u2019s now the Finchley Road; aged 13, he had two pictures accepted by the Royal Academy. Pets \u2013 dogs, especially \u2013 were a lucrative subject, and Landseer grew popular with their aristocratic owners. He became the lover of one of them, the voluptuary Georgiana, Duchess of Bedford, and the father of the last two of her 10 children. He set foot in Scotland with no firm purpose \u2013 he went as the companion to a young fellow painter who wanted to paint Sir Walter Scott\u2019s portrait \u2013 but fell in love with the landscape. A mutual love of dogs cemented a valuable friendship with Scott, while the Duchess of Bedford\u2019s Highland estate introduced him to a new enthusiasm among the titled rich for deerstalking.</p> <p>According to his biographer, Campbell Lennie, Landseer had until that point faced a likely future \u201cas a parlour painter of lapdogs\u201d. In Scotland, on rugged and treeless stretches of land mysteriously known as \u201cdeer forests\u201d \u2013 sometimes originally cleared of people in favour of sheep, more recently of sheep in favour of deer \u2013 he found what Lennie says was \u201calmost a reaffirmation of his manhood\u201d in a new lease of art. Landseer moved from his dog phase to his deer phase, and would eventually complete his three-act career with his lion phase, most famously the four in bronze that guard Nelson\u2019s column in Trafalgar Square.</p> <p>His fondness for animals endeared him to the greatest advocate for the Highlands and Highland-ism, Queen Victoria, who appreciated his jokes and anecdotes as well as the blighting sentimentalism of his pictures, though the last came hand-in-hand with a relish for cruelty that was shared by the painter, the queen and her consort. In Germany, Prince Albert had joined \u201cdeer-drives\u201d in which beaters scared herds of deer into enclosures where they were slaughtered by riflemen from a platform, with wives looking on and a small orchestra playing close by to compete with, and with luck to drown out, the squeals of dying animals.</p> <p>Stalking in Scotland gave the deer more of a chance, but the intent to kill was the same. \u201cThere is something in the toil and trouble, the wild heather and the savage scenery, that makes butchers of us all,\u201d Landseer wrote to a friend. \u201cIt was a most exciting sight,\u201d Victoria noted in her diary, after watching her husband stand over a wounded stag with a gun and finish him off.</p> <p>Many Landseer pictures came out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/09/edwin-landseer-otter-speared-exhibition\">these bloody scenes</a> and confused, contradictory moods, but the most famous of them was also the least typical. The Monarch of the Glen is a tranquil picture with no suggestion of violence. The stag stands imperious and alone against a background of peaks and cloud, close-up and, to enhance his majesty, seen slightly from below. Landseer painted it in 1850-51 as part of a commission for a triptych of panels intended to decorate the House of Lords refreshment room in Charles Barry\u2019s new Palace of Westminster, but parliament jibbed at the price of 1000 guineas (\u00a31050) for the three, including The Monarch, and the picture went instead to Lord Londesborough for a few hundred guineas.</p> <p>From his collection it started on its long journey towards Diageo. Londesborough sold it to Lord Fitzgerald, who sold it Lord Cheylesmore, who sold it in 1916 to Thomas Dewar, who adopted the stag as a branding device for the Dewar family\u2019s whisky business in Perthshire. The Distillers company bought Dewar\u2019s in 1925 and was in turn bought by Guinness in 1986, which merged with Grand Metropolitan to become Diageo in 1997. Diageo sold the Dewar\u2019s brand to Bacardi the next year, but retained the Landseer in the deal and soon after gave it on loan to the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, which has displayed it in the 17 years since.</p> <p>Why does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/diageo\">Diageo</a> want to sell? The company says its priority is to ensure all its assets \u201care focused on growing our business and delivering value for our employees, shareholders and the communities where we operate\u201d. The painting had \u201cno direct link to our business or brands\u201d.</p> <p>The last statement conflicts with the historical record: the whisky business and stags have gone together ever since men first crawled though the heather with guns and hip flasks, and the painting has been owned by one whisky company or another since 1916 (currently by one that has a 37% share of the global market in scotch, which sells \u2013 to quote from the Diageo website \u2013 25,000 bottles of Johnnie Walker in every hour of every day). But then a lot about Diageo is slightly incredible. We might forgive the name \u2013 it came after all from a marketing consultancy, Wolff Olins \u2013 but the company goes too far when it says it takes this combination of the Latin word for day with the Greek for world \u201cto mean every day, everywhere, people celebrate with our brands\u201d.</p> <p>They do, however, drink a lot of them. In the last financial year, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb1ZOPnY_QAhXGuBoKHU9xC-EQFggbMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.diageo.com%2FLists%2FResources%2FAttachments%2F2814%2FDiageo%2520Interactive%2520AR2015.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTu4dYLetVEOWirQhUVr9yrwZsjg&amp;bvm=bv.137901846,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja\">Diageo made an operating profit</a> of \u00a33bn on net sales of \u00a310.8bn and paid its chief executive, Ivan Menezes, \u00a34.4m. In other words, if The Monarch of the Glen fetches \u00a310m at Christie\u2019s next month, that sum minus the seller\u2019s premium will be eaten up by Menezes\u2019s remuneration within two years. Feeding old masters into the boilers of luxury liners to keep the steam up is an image that comes to mind.</p> <p>No, any business with a sense of history would give the picture to a public gallery in Scotland, the place without which both the business and the picture would be nothing. It would be the decent thing.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was changed to correct the sum asked for The Monarch of the Glen for a triptych of panels intended to decorate the House of Lords refreshment room.</em></p>",

The changing words used by gay people to describe each other can be read as a kind of history in themselves. Their evolution from social to psychological to political categories mirrors changes in the real-life experience of sexual nonconformity. Side by side are&#xa0;the insults thrown by the majority: \u201csodomite\u201d, \u201cqueer\u201d, \u201cinvert\u201d, \u201cdegenerate\u201d, some of which betray the influence of prevailing religious or medical attitudes. As ever, culture leaves its imprint on language. So where are we now? Is \u201cLGBTQQI\u201d the natural end point in a story of emancipation, where everyone is free to express their sexuality and identity as they like?</p> <p><em>Coming Out</em> by Jeffrey Weeks tries to take the long view. A \u201chistory of LGBT identities in Britain from the 19th century to the present\u201d, it was first published in 1977, in a decade when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/apr/29/medicalscience.highereducation\" title=\"\">Dennis Altman</a> prophesied \u201cthe end of the homosexual\u201d \u2013 a world where being gay or straight wouldn\u2019t matter. A second edition in 1990 took in the Aids crisis, and this version, with a new foreword and postscript, brings us up to date.</p> <p>The action begins in the late 19th century, with an unprecedented entwining of law and sexual morality. It\u2019s hard to be certain why this happened: Weeks offers up the \u201cgrappling for control\u201d by central government in an era of mass urbanisation, industrial capitalism and potential disorder. The professionalisation of policing was another factor. Whatever the causes, gay men (the law ignored lesbians) faced unprecedented dangers. The <a href=\"http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/labouchere_amendment_S.pdf\" title=\"\">Labouch\u00e8re amendment</a> to the 1885 Criminal Law Act introduced the offence of gross indecency, punishable by hard labour.

Born in 1844 in comfortable circumstances in Brighton, he had become, by the 1890s, a radical socialist, gay mystic, a \u201cprophet\u201d to some, with poetry, political writings and countless public speeches to his name. Weeks describes how the cottage in Derbyshire where he lived with his working-class boyfriend, George Merrill, became a mecca for \u201cvegetarians, dress-reformers, temperance orators, spiritualists, secularists, anti-vivisectionists\u201d. A&#xa0;former lover, George Hukin, recounts that one day \u201ctwo very pretty young ladies turned up with a donkey and cart and a dog. They had come all the way from Essex with bare feet and sandals \u2026&#xa0;they said they were pilgrims\u201d.</p> <p>While providing a model for gay life, and alluding to it in&#xa0;unmistakable ways in his writing, Carpenter had to be circumspect. He trod a careful line in a&#xa0;response to reviews of his 1908 book <a href=\"http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/pwh/carpenter-is.asp\" title=\"\"><em>The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women</em></a>: \u201cI am certain there is not a single passage \u2026 where I advocate sexual intercourse of any kind between those of the same sex. I&#xa0;advocate sincere attachment and warm&#xa0;friendship.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After New York's Stonewall riots, there was a new spirit of truculence as the 70s rolled in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite these limitations, Carpenter\u2019s vision was influential in an era where most expressions of hope for sexual freedom were idealistic, literary or couched in scientific terms. He was part of a milieu that included the novelists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/emforster\" title=\"\">EM Forster</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/07/trials-radclyffe-hall-review\" title=\"\">Radclyffe Hall</a> and the sexologist Havelock Ellis. As the century wore on, these currents gave way to more technocratic attempts to effect legislative change. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_Law_Reform_Society\" title=\"\">Homosexual Law Reform Society (HLRS)</a> was founded in 1958, after the publication of the Wolfenden report, which recommended the decriminalisation of gay sex, but still a decade away from decriminalisation itself. As a project to convince parliament and society of the need for a new approach, it was respectable to a&#xa0;T. The HLRS argued that its mission was vital, \u201cfor reasons of justice, security, public health\u201d \u2013 a slogan with nods to the risks of both blackmail and venereal disease. For now, the case for change had to be based on something other than \u201cgay pride\u201d.</p> <p>The fact that, post-decriminalisation, prosecutions for gross indecency actually increased, combined with the&#xa0;example set by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/05/monument-stonewall-riots-fight-lgbt-rights-goes-on\" title=\"\">Stonewall riots in New York in 1969</a>, meant that as the 70s rolled in a new spirit of truculence emerged. With the formation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/12/gay-liberation-front-social-revolution\" title=\"\">Gay Liberation Front</a>, some gay men and women decided to stop apologising for&#xa0;themselves, to abandon being as discreet and decorous as possible in order to&#xa0;win allies. Instead there were new forms of protest like rowdy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zap_(action)\" title=\"\">\u201czappings\u201d</a>, which targeted homophobic institutions or people, \u201cgay-ins\u201d and pride marches. Though small in scale (Weeks&#xa0;says that around 2,000 attended the first gay pride march in&#xa0;1971), it was a&#xa0;paradigm shift that probably had&#xa0;more effect on&#xa0;gay people\u2019s sense of themselves than decades of quiet lobbying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2aaa4d7900da8466377c30b9c05b523bac445a8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2aaa4d7900da8466377c30b9c05b523bac445a8e/0_0_5040_3347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wears a Stonewall T-shirt at Pride in London in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman wears a Stonewall T-shirt at Pride in London in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Marshall/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weeks was an activist in the 70s, not&#xa0;merely an observer, and has been criticised as promoting a gay \u201cend of history\u201d argument \u2013 something that might look naive in the light of today\u2019s proliferation of both freedom and reaction. He addresses this in the foreword: \u201cAlthough I&#xa0;certainly believed that the new identities did represent an advance on&#xa0;the closeted and often persecuted identities that came before, I did not believe that there was anything automatic about their emergence \u2013 after all,&#xa0;this book is in large part a history of&#xa0;struggle, which by its nature goes in many, often divergent directions.\u201d As for today\u2019s alphabet soup of Qs and Gs and Is: \u201cNor did I think that lesbian and&#xa0;gay identities, themselves very varied, exhausted all other possibilities, and where we had got to in the 1970s was where we wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>The book has its flaws. The sweep and ambition are&#xa0;impressive but the texture is uneven. The pre-1967 chapters comprise skilled, enjoyable history writing in a fairly conventional mould. By the 70s, however, Weeks\u2019 own history in the gay liberation movement subtly directs&#xa0;his attention. A hurried look at&#xa0;the 80s, and the brevity of the more&#xa0;recent postscript add to a sense&#xa0;of lopsidedness.</p> <p>More problematically, the short passages on attempts by advocates of child abuse to ally with the gay movement come across as too equivocal. Weeks writes, \u201cLibertarians asked: if an encounter between a child and adult was consensual and mutually pleasurable, in what way could or should it be&#xa0;deemed harmful? This led on to questions of what constituted harm, what was consent \u2026 These were real questions which had to be faced if any rational approach was to emerge, but too often they were swept away in a tide of revulsion.\u201d It is discomfiting that Weeks doesn\u2019t make it clearer these arguments fail because no child can \u201cconsent\u201d to sexual activity.</p> <p>Despite the efforts to update it, <em>Coming Out</em> retains the flavour of a period piece, albeit a significant one.

  "<p>Following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/29/new-builds-house-buyers-leasehold-property-trap\" title=\"\">special report</a> in last week\u2019s Guardian Money, there has been a huge response from readers caught out by leases with sky-rocketing ground rents.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We paid \u00a3101,000 for our Taylor Wimpey home in 2010 \u2013 now it\u2019s valued at zero\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Can a newly built apartment from Taylor Wimpey effectively be worth nothing after just six years? Sean Greenwood\u2019s wife paid \u00a3101,000 for a flat in a new development in Gornal, on the edge of Dudley, which she was told would be a great way to get on to the property ladder. But he claims that some banks and building societies are refusing to give mortgages to prospective buyers because a clause in the original leasehold agreement means owners are liable to pay ground rent to the freeholder that will spiral to \u00a38,000 a year.</p> <p>\u201cWe are now trapped with an apartment we cannot sell,\u201d says Greenwood. \u201cOur neighbour, hoping to move as well, told us that their intended buyer\u2019s mortgage company had refused to lend on the property and deemed that it had a zero value. On further investigation we found out that the ground rent review clause in our lease is preventing lenders approving a mortgage.\u201d</p> <p>Ground rents are the crux of the problem. These are the annual payments leaseholders have to make to a freeholder which, in the past, were little more than a \u201cpeppercorn\u201d rate, sometimes so low they were not even collected.</p> <p>But as Guardian Money highlighted last week, developers have begun selling houses as leasehold that would traditionally have been freehold, with clauses that allow the ground rent to rise dramatically in later years. No services are given in return for the ground rent, which is distinct from management charges for looking after a building.</p> <p>In the Greenwoods\u2019 125-year lease the \u00a3250 ground rent on the two-bed flat doubles every 10 years. In three years it will be \u00a3500 a year (on top of the current \u00a3840-a-year service charge), rising to \u00a38,000 from 2059. Greenwood has made estimates that over the life of the lease (125 years) the freeholder will invoice the 32 apartments for a total of \u00a321,672,000.</p> <p>A letter sent to Taylor Wimpey last week by lawyers acting for another flat owner in the block says she \u201chas now had two prospective buyers withdraw from the purchase in the last six months due to the excessive rent review clauses. The latest buyer\u2019s mortgage valuation came in with a nil value due to the rent review clause\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/22/small-print-ground-rent-property-millions-leasehold-flat\">Beware the small print that could hike one-bed flat\u2019s ground rent to \u00a38m-a-year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like other flat owners, they want answers from Taylor Wimpey about what they are supposed to do. It sold the freehold to a private company two years after building the estate. The flat owners believe it was sold for around \u00a3138,000, and say they were not offered the option to buy. \u201cThe current freeholder stands to get their investment back 156 times over,\u201d claims Greenwood.</p> <p>A search of the main property websites reveals that flats are currently for sale in the block, and that sales have been completed in the last year, although at prices below the original purchase price six years ago.</p> <p>In an open letter to MPs and the housing minister Greenwood asks: \u201cHow can a six-year-old apartment be worth nothing? And how can freeholders be allowed to fleece residents who are essentially held to ransom, not able to sell, so forced to live there forever and pay the spiralling ground rent charges?\u201d</p> <p>After last week\u2019s story many readers asked why conveyancing solicitors appear to fail to warn buyers of the potential costs. Greenwood says his wife used a solicitor recommended by Taylor Wimpey to do her conveyancing and that while they \u201cdid make clear that she could not have a pet and had to be aware of the noise levels,\u201d he claims that the topic of ground rent increases was not prominently raised with her. He claims that if any of the 32 buyers in the block had been made aware that they could be liable for a portion of, by his calculations, a \u00a321m ground rent bill in the future they would have walked away immediately.</p> <p>We put Greenwood\u2019s story to Taylor Wimpey. It said: \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on this particular situation as we do not know the details of how the valuation was arrived at. However, it should be noted that Taylor Wimpey does not own the freehold for this development.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f65dda2f861967bd9e58d5d029c4bc056cd01e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f65dda2f861967bd9e58d5d029c4bc056cd01e0/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mellors received a letter saying Bovis had sold the freehold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mellors received a letter saying Bovis had sold the freehold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Bovis said the freehold would cost \u00a34,000. A year later it\u2019s \u00a315,000-\u00a335,000\u2019</h2> <p>A year ago Martin Mellors and his wife bought a newly built detached house in Botley, on the edge of Oxford, on an estate built by Bovis Homes. The Mellors say they were told that although the house was leasehold, it was on a reassuringly long lease which could be bought for a few thousand pounds within two years. But only a year later, buyers are finding, to their horror, that the freeholds have been sold on, and that householders who want to buy them could face bills of up to \u00a335,000.</p> <p>\u201cThe estate is a mix of flats and houses. We weren\u2019t told until we were putting a deposit down that the property was leasehold. We almost pulled out but were offered assurances (to the effect that the lease is 999 years, the development will be managed by Bovis so they have a long -term interest in quality and ensuring \u2018good behaviour\u2019, and that all properties were being sold this way and it couldn\u2019t be changed etc) and looked up the cost of buying the lease.</p> <p>\u201cWe understood there was a law that requires the freeholder to sell the lease after two years if the leaseholder has been in occupation, and there are calculations for this cost. These gave us a figure of around \u00a34,000, plus legal costs.\u201d He says when they put this to Bovis, they agreed that\u2019s what it would cost.</p> <p>A few months later the Mellors received a letter saying Bovis had sold the freehold to Gateway Property Management, \u201cthus negating some of the assurances we were given at sale\u201d.</p> <p>The Mellors also found that some properties on the estate had been sold freehold \u2013 mainly the more expensive ones. \u201cWe wrote to Bovis who said this had been a \u2018commercial decision\u2019, didn\u2019t affect our agreement, and they couldn\u2019t do anything any more as they\u2019d sold the leases. They were basically washing their hands of us.\u201d</p> <p>The agreement allows Gateway to charge a ground rent of \u00a3250 a year, rising with RPI. The Mellors acknowledge that the increases aren\u2019t as high as some in last week\u2019s Money report, where householders face a doubling in ground rent every 10 years.</p> <p>The problem now is how much it will cost to buy the freehold? He says a neighbour pressed Gateway for a figure, and was reportedly told it would be \u00a315,000 to \u00a335,000 \u201cwhich is a ridiculously wide range and very different to our calculations, endorsed by Bovis.\u201d</p> <p>Bovis said: \u201cOut of respect for customer confidentiality we cannot comment on individual purchases, but as a business it is our standard practice to sell our new houses on a freehold basis. In those extremely rare instances where this is not the case, this could be down to a number of local factors, such as building on a consortium site where conditions have been put in place as part of the land purchase. Throughout any house purchase customers will be kept fully informed of the sales process and structure, by our own teams and should also be advised and updated by their own solicitors.\u201d</p> <p>Gateway, based in Southend, Essex, runs GroundRents.co.uk. According to the website, \u201cwe act as strategic partners to property developers\u201d by \u201creleasing the value in their ground rents\u201d with \u201cleases that maximise their worth\u201d. However, it adds that \u201cwe also take care of the leaseholders\u2019 interests after sales\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement Gateway said: \u201cWe confirm Gateway Ground Rents owns a substantial portfolio of freeholds and through its associated company Gateway Properties Limited acquired the freehold interest of Mr and Mrs Mellor\u2019s property in 2015. Obviously we cannot comment on the discussions your reader had with any third parties because we were not party to those discussions. When we receive enquiries from leaseholders about buying their freehold it is not our company policy to quote terms ad hoc over the telephone.

Our buyers had ordered furniture, booked in decorators \u2013 the works. They signed all the contracts and then, a few days before completion, we were contacted because their solicitor read the leasehold document properly and spotted our ground rent clause: \u00a3295 per year, doubling every 10 years until the 50th anniversary.\u201d</p> <p>She claims her buyer\u2019s solicitors advised them not to touch her house as it would be unsaleable given that by 2060 ground rent would be \u00a39,440 per year. \u201cThe sale fell through, and all parties involved are devastated after losing a lot of time and money.\u201d</p> <p>Scott says she was \u201ccompletely shocked\u201d and checked with neighbours about their leases. A few residents on the estate of 50 homes were, she says, given the opportunity to buy the freehold from the outset at a very reasonable sum, while around half were on her 250-year lease, with ground rents doubling every 10 years. The rest, sold after January 2012, were on an RPI-linked lease.</p> <p>Taylor Wimpey sold the leases to UK Ground Rent Estates Ltd for a figure understood to be \u00a3177,000.</p> <p>\u201cWe were never given the option to buy,\u201d says Scott. \u201cEvery time you want to ask a question [to the freeholder] you have to pay \u00a3110. Our neighbours inquired to buy \u2013 \u00a346,000! No one has that sort of money, certainly not for a \u00a3200,000 house.\u201d</p> <p>Scott has written to her MP and sought legal advice, but says she still has \u201cno idea what we can do. We are trapped by this god-awful house and a lease we can\u2019t sell. We contacted the Home Builders Federation, and it contacted Taylor Wimpey, and we got a letter basically saying \u2018you signed what you signed\u2019 and there\u2019s nothing they can do as they no longer own the freehold\u201d.</p> <p>She says that, as a first-time buyer, aged 25 at the time, she had no idea what she was letting herself in for. \u201cThe key messages from solicitors when we bought were: we can\u2019t paint our door for two years, can\u2019t have livestock on the land \u2013 all daft stuff. Not \u2018by the way, this is a hellish lease that will potentially cause you a lot of financial trouble and inability to sell in the future\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOur legal paperwork just states the lease as a matter of fact, no extra commentary around it. As a young first-time buyer I wouldn\u2019t have had a clue whether it was normal or not. I know leaseholds are common in Bolton, so I wouldn\u2019t have thought much of it.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t sell \u2013 despite a few residents putting their heads in the sand and hoping we\u2019ve had a spot of bad luck and most other buyers won\u2019t care. Of course they will care!\u201d</p> <p>But Taylor Wimpey is not the only developer in Bolton leaving buyers shocked.</p> <p>Another reader says she bought a new-build detached house from a separate developer on the other side of Bolton. She wanted to buy the freehold after one year but discovered the freehold would cost \u00a317,600 instead of the \u00a33,000 she expected.</p> <p>She says the freehold has been sold to another company, Adriatic Land 3 Ltd. She adds that she had not been worried about leasehold because she had been in an older property in Bolton where the ground rent was \u00a32.50 a year.</p> <p>Taylor Wimpey said: \u201cAs a homebuilder, Taylor Wimpey\u2019s core business does not include the management of freehold reversionary interests and so they are typically sold to third parties. Taylor Wimpey does not own the freehold [on Clair Scott\u2019s development] and therefore does not benefit from the increases to ground rent or have a say in any associated charges. We can confirm that since around 2011 ground rent increases for Taylor Wimpey leasehold properties have been based on the Retail Price Index and increase every 10 years in line with the index, as per what is considered to be current industry standard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc2a2b13b2582dbb9d17b6c89c2e17f7b85dc0d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc2a2b13b2582dbb9d17b6c89c2e17f7b85dc0d9/0_252_4687_2812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One buyer says: \u2018Persimmon left us with questions, the key one being that of acquiring the freehold.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One buyer says: \u2018Persimmon left us with questions, the key one being that of acquiring the freehold.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018We weren\u2019t told about leasehold until the last minute\u2019</h2> <p>Several readers contacted us to say how they were flummoxed to discover that the house they were buying was leasehold, with some only finding out very late into the purchase.</p> <p>One reader, who preferred to remain anonymous, says she purchased a Persimmon new-build in December 2015. She claims: \u201cThe word \u2018leasehold\u2019 was not used until very, very late in the process, which was fast-tracked due to delays in building and my move-in date.</p> <p>\u201cI studied law at university and am interested in contracts, so I was shocked to finally be told that it was leasehold when I was already emotionally invested in the property and had booked my moving-in van!\u201d</p> <p>Another reader wrote to us about their experience of buying, and their legal position regarding acquiring the freehold.</p> <p>He said: \u201cOur family is outgrowing our existing three-bed semi and, in late August, Persimmon offered us a favourable part exchange for a four-bed detached home on one of its new estates. We were strongly persuaded to sign up to Persimmon\u2019s preferred solicitors and, to date, we have had an amicable working relationship.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, when we asked questions regarding the terms of the lease (which, as yet, we haven\u2019t signed) it has taken four-and-a-half weeks to get a reply... Persimmon was extremely vague and left us with more questions, the key one being that of acquiring the freehold.\u201d</p> <p>Persimmon said: \u201cThe type of property, freehold or leasehold, is discussed clearly with each customer prior to purchase and is described on every reservation form. Customers are under no obligation to use a solicitor known to Persimmon. We recommend solicitors who have knowledge and experience of a particular development. This improves speed of service for the customer, and can sometimes reduce costs.\u201d</p> <h2>Held to ransom</h2> <p>There can also be a price to pay if a homeowner simply wants to add even the smallest of extensions.</p> <p>Unlike traditional homeowners, buyers of new-build leasehold houses have to seek the approval of the freeholder if they want to add a conservatory, or a small extension \u2013 leaving them open to huge fees.</p> <p>One reader, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of jeopardising their plans, says she is contemplating a tiny extension to the rear of her home \u2013 so small it does not require planning permission. But the freeholder is charging her \u00a31,615.</p> <p>The bill breaks down as follows:</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3110 for the initial request to make alterations;</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3225 for a surveyor visit required by freeholder, paid by the resident;</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3600 for the surveyor report required by freeholder, paid by resident</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a3200 \u201cadmin fees\u201d to the freeholder;</p> <p>\u2022 A further \u00a3480 for the freeholder\u2019s solicitor fees.</p> <h2>Location, location, location</h2> <p>Will a plentiful supply of freehold homes become a thing of the past?

  "<p>The capture of eastern Aleppo by Syrian rebels in July 2012 was a severe blow to the regime of Bashar al-Assad early in the country\u2019s civil war. Ever since, the brutal, attritional warfare wrought on Syria\u2019s second city has served as a microcosm of the wider conflict.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s pro-regime intervention in late September 2015 turned the military tide, allowing Assad to prioritise the isolation and eventual recapture of opposition-held districts. These already devastated areas now stand on the brink of a renewed offensive as Moscow tries to force a decisive victory for Assad while the US is preoccupied with its presidential election. </p> <p>This objective is ambitious \u2013 rebel fighters know the territory intimately and have had years to prepare for a street-by-street assault. But Moscow and Damascus know that a rebel defeat would be a psychological blow from which their cause might not recover. Aleppo is their last urban stronghold, and relegating the rebellion to a rural insurgency is a major aim of the regime.</p> <p>Using highly granular data tracking nearly 1,500 locations in Aleppo, it is possible to show how the stranglehold on the east of the city has tightened since Russia\u2019s intervention; and how even ceasefires appear to have been used strategically, with hostilities pausing only when the regime reached important waypoints.</p> <h2>Early October saw the familiar pattern of airstrikes, regime gains and then a pause</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-14067LSlVsXtZxiE/\" data-alt=\"October map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-14067LSlVsXtZxiE/\">October map</a> </figure>  <p>Since the collapse of the September ceasefire, regime forces backed by Russian airstrikes have continued their assault on Aleppo\u2019s eastern districts. The main theatres have been to the north of the rebel-held redoubt, where the regime continues to consolidate its control of roads which might be used to resupply the rebels, and in the south, where the regime has retaken an outlying district and resisted attempts by the rebels to link up with their allies in the western suburbs.<br></p> <p>A three-day ceasefire in mid-October was not long enough to evacuate civilians, but the intervening period has been relatively calm. The rebels sought to use this period to break the siege by shelling government-held areas of western Aleppo. Regime forces have fought back and limited the rebel gains, and all the while the Russians have signalled that they are preparing for a major offensive. A large Russian taskforce led by the country\u2019s sole sole aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/russia-cancels-spanish-fuel-stop-for-syria-bound-warships\">has been sailing towards Syria</a>, and a Russian deadline for people to abandon eastern Aleppo expired on Friday night.</p> <h2>September\u2019s brief truce came only after pro-regime forces encircled the rebels</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-1406dLzSZO8bkIyh/\" data-alt=\"September map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-1406dLzSZO8bkIyh/\">September map</a> </figure>  <p>The nationwide ceasefire that began on 12 September was supposed to help deliver aid to besieged rebel-held areas and pave the way for an ambitious US-Russian air campaign against Islamic State and other extremist groups.

  "<h2>How do I become an agony aunt? I\u2019ve tried using social media but it hasn\u2019t worked</h2> <p><strong>As you are something of an agony uncle, I am seeking your advice on how to become an agony aunt.</strong></p> <p><strong>All my life I have helped others with their problems. I have tried hard to find out how I can do this publicly. I have started my own Facebook and Twitter pages, but have been unsuccessful so far. Any tips or advice you could offer would be gratefully received.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d like to know in what way your Facebook and Twitter pages have been unsuccessful \u2013 there\u2019s nearly always something constructive to be learned from failure. But you have more than failure to guide you. You say that all your life you have helped others with their problems, so you must have some fairly clear ideas about the kind of advice that has been most useful. Adapting this experience to your online presence makes obvious sense, but I imagine you\u2019ve done this already.</p> <p>As for the advice itself, a surprising number of people\u2019s problems stem from their failure to see things through the eyes of others. They are genuinely baffled, and often upset, because a friend, partner, boss or colleague doesn\u2019t see things in the same way. Empathy comes naturally to some, but others have to work at it. However, it can solve or ease a great many differences of opinion. As a solver of other people\u2019s problems yourself, some degree of empathy is probably your most valuable talent.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 As someone who has worked in a counselling-type role my whole life, I would say, don\u2019t. In my experience the people who would actually be the best at this type of thing don\u2019t do it, for a host of rational reasons, or can\u2019t do it, because they\u2019re not journalists or famous. Journalism is probably the more reliable route, because becoming famous is more by happenstance than design. Being a professional counsellor, psychologist, or psychotherapist etc may help you see the issues better, but you simply won\u2019t have enough information to provide anything truly helpful. <strong>momenta</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Consider volunteering with an organisation such as the <a href=\"http://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help-you/contact-us?gclid=CI-ql9SmhdACFcLGGwodIkkJbA\" title=\"\">Samaritans</a>, which provides training and support. It responds to people who are struggling, lonely, ill, poor, in jail or at school \u2013 anyone who wants to talk. Being an agony aunt is a niche role and one that is often as much (if not more) about the adviser than the person asking for help. I\u2019d ask why it\u2019s that route in particular that appeals. <strong>pumpkindoge</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It is about having an appropriate background in publishing, a reputation for having a clear-thinking, balanced approach to issues, and a substantial amount of luck. <strong>starterforten</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Train to be a counsellor or, better, a psychotherapist. It\u2019ll take years and money but, most of all, you will be forced to question whether what you do is of any help. <strong>onalongsabbatical</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Write to yourself for advice. If it\u2019s good advice you will reach your goal. If it\u2019s bad advice, maybe choose another path. <strong>iamtherobotman</strong></p> <h2>How can I help my daughter to choose a career after she finishes sitting her A-levels?</h2> <p><strong>My daughter is bright but doesn\u2019t know what degree to take as she has no clear career plan. We have discussed this time and again, but she still can\u2019t decide. She is studying for A-levels in biology, history and psychology, and completed AS-levels in English and law. She enjoys writing and has considered journalism, but she is particularly interested in endangered species and Greenpeace. </strong></p> <p><strong>Any ideas on how, as her mum, I can gently \u2013 and diplomatically \u2013 try and set her on an interesting path?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Your concern for her future is understandable and laudable. You just have to be heroically patient. It\u2019s not unusual for those of your daughter\u2019s age and stage of education to be indecisive about what to do next. As the sense of pressure mounts, often compounded by would-be helpful teachers and parents, wrong decisions can be made.</p> <p>Perhaps the most useful discussion should start with the sort of career she might consider. There are some for which a degree in mathematics, for example, is essential. But from the sound of it her interests mean the precise choice of degree course is less crucial. Her interests in journalism, the environment and Greenpeace suggest there is no essential degree subject.</p> <p>The A-levels she is taking are usefully broad, and will provide her with valuable qualifications without being restrictive. By all means continue to discuss her emerging interests, but only if she welcomes such discussions. If she shows curiosity about an occupation, consider buying her books on the subject, but take care she knows they are not intended as a covert form of encouragement. Even if she appeals to you to tell her what you think she should do, resist. It\u2019s important she senses what she wants to do with her life \u2013 and she will. The urgency to do so is not quite as great as it seems.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Her college library should have a wide range of resources on choosing a degree course and careers information. She could also take a look at websites such as <a href=\"http://www.prospects.ac.uk\" title=\"\">Prospects.ac.uk</a>, which suggests career paths and gives job profiles. Her mix of A-levels could take her in different directions. <strong>ID5279121</strong></p> <p>\u2022 She sounds like the ideal candidate for a gap year. Not a jaunt to Thailand or Botswana, but time out to try out a few&#xa0;different jobs, possibly to join Greenpeace and see what grabs her in&#xa0;practice. For most people the day-to-day realities of a job affect our enjoyment far more than the title or industry. How much will you need to interact with the public? How do you feel about eight hours a day in front of a computer? How much does money or status matter? These are best learned in practice, and she can use her experiences to guide her choice. <strong>ID0191535</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The pace of technological change is so rapid, and the global environment so unstable, that it\u2019s hard to begin to imagine what work will look like even in 10 years\u2019 time.

  "<h2>Snapshot: My sweet childhood from Nairobi to the UK<br></h2> <p>As a young woman, my mother did not want to marry or be a mother, but she went on to have six children and also an amazing journey, which brought her to England. Kamal had to leave what is now Pakistan because of partition, and was packed off to live with grandparents in Mumbai \u2013 her mother had died and her father travelled to London to do his bar exams. Unable to return to India because of the political turmoil, my grandfather ended up in Nairobi with an uncle. Eventually my mother was sent for. She went reluctantly, leaving behind an extraordinary, fun life in Mumbai, spoiled by grandparents, home help and a chauffeur.</p> <p>In Nairobi, a marriage was arranged for her to a handsome Punjabi who, after serving in the British Indian army, had settled in Nairobi as a civil servant. Her reluctance to marry soon disappeared, as she embraced being a mother.</p> <p>In 1963, my parents made the monumental decision to leave Kenya. My father was keen to create a distance between him and my mother\u2019s very successful but overpowering family but, more importantly, he believed life for Asians would become difficult after independence. My father, with my eldest brother, Anil, were the advance party who headed to Birmingham. Their mission was to call us if they thought England had the opportunities my parents wanted for their children.</p> <p>Three months later, we got the green light from my father and almost overnight locked up our sunny, spacious house in Nairobi, gave the keys to my aunts and flew away into the unknown.</p> <p>Seeing my father at Heathrow with the biggest bars of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/cadbury-oreo-mondelez-buy-hersheys-chocolate\">Cadbury\u2019s chocolate</a> is a sight I can still recall with clarity and warmth. For me, the journey from Heathrow to Birmingham was an adventure despite the grey skies and strange, smoking chimneystacks. What a stark contrast to the sun and familiarity we had left behind. My father had not managed to get a pen-pushing job but was working hard in a dusty foundry. My mother got on with the job of making our shabby, very small terrace feel like home and in making sure we were performing at school.</p> <p>At the time, we were the only non-white family in school and in our neighbourhood. Mother never openly complained \u2013 she was just glad to have all her family together. With six growing children and money tight she, too, got a factory job at Cadbury\u2019s where she was one of the first Asian women to work on the shop floor. Childhood was sweet, in many ways. Our house was always full of children from all backgrounds, either hoping to get a broken up chocolate biscuit or a chapatti and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/04/how-to-make-dhal-recipe\">dhal</a>.

Every Thursday night, I could be found glued to the TV waiting to hear if my favourite song had made it to No 1. Mum and Dad used to moan and groan about the \u201chideous racket\u201d coming from the TV, but they always let me watch it.</p> <p>I was 14 that year and had recently got into athletics. A friend suggested we join the local athletics club but there was one snag \u2013 the main training day was a Thursday evening, the same time as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/12/artsfeatures.popandrock2\">Top of the Pops.</a> This was 1986, before most households had a video recorder. So I didn\u2019t have the option of recording the show.</p> <p>I loved this song. It was so different, so powerful and catchy. I had to know if it was still No 1. And I knew just the thing to do.</p> <p>I had a tape recorder. It wasn\u2019t particularly good, but it served the purpose for which it had been bought \u2013 for my friend and I to sing into (screech would probably be a fairer word).</p> <p>So I told Dad what I planned to do. He\u2019d need to have the TV on so it picked up the sound. He muttered that it was, \u201cAll right, I suppose\u201d. The tape recorder wasn\u2019t very good at picking things up, so I positioned it as close to the TV as possible.</p> <p>Off I went to athletics club, and back I came eager to listen to Tops of the Pops. When I pressed play, you could tell I hadn\u2019t accounted for all the background noises, which were somehow much louder than the TV \u2013 Dad ruffling the paper the whole way through, coughing and belching and other such noises, Mum starting a conversation about the mess Dad made when he ate his biscuits in the lounge and of course, I\u2019d forgotten that we had the loudest clock in the world and so there was its incessant ticking.</p> <p>So, after all that, was Amadeus still No 1? No, it wasn\u2019t. Usurped by Spitting Image and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NemkBVSnUt0\">The Chicken Song</a>. I wasn\u2019t impressed.</p> <p>Did the recording of Top of the Pops last? No. Neither did the athletics.</p> <p><em>Esther Newton</em></p> <h2>We love to eat: Dad\u2019s \u2018Saps\u2019 when Mum was away<br></h2> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p> <p><em>Sliced white bread</em><br><em>Milk</em><br><em>White sugar</em></p> <p>Arrange slices of bread in a shallow plate for each person. Heat the milk, as much as you like, and pour over. Sprinkle with sugar. Eat with a spoon. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>This is a recipe of my wonderful dad\u2019s. We only ate it once, and we actually didn\u2019t love it at all. In the early 70s we were living on Islay in the Hebrides. Unprecedentedly, Mum had gone off to the mainland for a few days, leaving Dad with my sister and me. Teatime approached and, having been running about outside all day, we started hanging around the kitchen looking for clues as to what Dad would make for tea \u2013 neither of us could remember him ever making a meal before so we were curious as to what would appear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"62fea0899e0d23609c6d5f287e71b4f6aa13de38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62fea0899e0d23609c6d5f287e71b4f6aa13de38/0_0_5440_4080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"saps, bread and milk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saps \u2026 good when toasted, too.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the worktop were sliced white bread, a bottle of milk and the wooden sugar bowl. Dad was heating milk in the wee aluminium saucepan with the blue handle, and layering slices of bread in shallow plates. \u201cWhat\u2019s for tea, Dad?\u201d Came the answer: \u201cSaps\u201d. Hot milk was poured over the bread, sugar sprinkled on top, spoons given out and teatime commenced. The bread was slithery, the milk formed a skin and even the gritty sugar couldn\u2019t help. We were hungry, though, and that was what there was.</p> <p>Saps, cheap and filling, was a childhood food for my father, who was one of a large family. He is from a generation of men who never expected to cook for themselves, although he did learn later. The next night it was probably the 1970s classic tinned ravioli.</p> <p>Mum made us mince and tatties, stovies, omelettes. Having been brought up on a farm, Dad shot much of our food and Mum cooked game such as pheasant, pigeon and woodcock. Apparently once when roast beef was served I asked for a leg. We lived on an island but couldn\u2019t buy fish except fish fingers from the supermarket.</p> <p>Dad got the last laugh. Imagine my amazement recently to find the same recipe in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/31/houseandgarden.foodanddrink\">Nigella Lawson\u2019s book Feast</a>, billed as wonderful comfort food.

  "<p><em>\u201cKindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.\u201d \u2013 attributed to Mark Twain.</em></p> <p>Well said, but Twain omits that kindness makes your head spin when it\u2019s from a smart, single, sexy woman and you\u2019re a grieving middle-aged bloke.</p> <p>I\u2019m sitting at my friend Jo\u2019s kitchen table in her house in Scotland. I like her company. She didn\u2019t know Helen or me previously, taking me as I now am \u2013 never looking over my shoulder or tap dancing around my bereavement. She offers advice based on many years of raising her children alone, having a son in Matt\u2019s class. Indeed, she has a single-mindedness about not just coping but making their lives richer. This makes her easy kindness and friendship even more touching.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jo is wildly beautiful, fun and confident. Could we ever be more than friends? My head starts spinning \u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And friendship it is, offered with a naive and delightful lack of awareness that \u2013 as the town\u2019s most eligible divorcee \u2013 her friendship with its most recent widower may lead some people to paint her scarlet if they believed she had amorous intent so soon after Helen\u2019s death. She has no such plans, despite the fact that we\u2019re alone in the middle of nowhere; her invitation and my acceptance of it known to no one.</p> <p>Jo raises her head from the Aga, raven hair sticking to her flushed face, blue eyes sparkling with the enthusiasm that so characterises her, \u201cFancy some homemade apple crumble, Adam?\u201d. She\u2019s wildly beautiful, fun and confident. Could we ever be more than friends? Thinking this, my head starts spinning and not simply because of the Butty Bach beer she favours.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already shared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/17/when-is-the-right-time-for-a-widowers-libido-to-wake-up\" title=\"\">my lack of guilt at my libido kickstarting itself in Yorkshire</a>, but this is something far more treacherous. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to fall for someone, indeed Helen and I discussed it, but surely that timeline is measured in years, not months? What sort of impact would it have on Millie and Matt or would it have to be a secret for ages and therefore be something shabby, small and doomed?</p> <p>Even though I know none of this is vaguely on Jo\u2019s agenda, I really like her and did from the moment we met. The theory that patients fall in love with their doctors is well known and I wonder whether I\u2019m responding that way to her kindness. Only time will tell. I am certain that had Helen not died I wouldn\u2019t have noticed Jo, but then she would not have made contact \u2013 another bleak, virtuous circle.</p> <p>Parking the ramblings of the emotionally stunted 12-year-old that I seem now to be, Jo has a stellar professional career yet is so successful in raising two fantastic boys. That in itself provides hope for successful single parenthood and hope is what I need.</p> <p>There is a ridiculously heavy statue in my garden (a birthday present for Helen) of Pandora whose box, once the evils of the world were released, held only hope. It\u2019s what\u2019s left and what keeps me sane on bad days now I\u2019ve almost banished the bottle. Seeing Jo\u2019s living testimony to how well a single parent can inspire their children to thrive is psychotherapy without the couch. Albeit that her wild passion for life makes me wonder what she\u2019d be like on it.</p> <p>Enough. This is something I need to deal with. My connection to Jo was hard-forged in the extremity of my grief and will probably survive time and distance. I love my sister-in-law Sarah so why not love my sister-in-loss Jo? With her I\u2019ve felt happy in a way I\u2019d thought gone for good and not (entirely) because of her fantastic crumble. I don\u2019t want to alienate her with the sort of unexpected and ill-delivered pass I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of myself.</p> <p>Even knowing all that, sitting on my surrogate sibling\u2019s sofa drinking, chatting and laughing into the late evening, I wonder how I\u2019d react if Jo leaned in to kiss me. Knowing the answer and looking over her shoulder into the deep darkness of the Highland night, I expect to see hooded figures carrying flaming torches and pitchforks as Helen\u2019s friends, family and the more judgmental fellow travellers on grief\u2019s journey get wind of my thoughts.</p> <p>To be honest, though, given that it\u2019s only a few months since Helen died, I may join them: \u201cString him up.\u201d</p> <p><em>Adam Golightly is a pseudonym</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrAdamGolightly\" title=\"\">@MrAdamGolightly</a></p>",
  "<p>What were you thinking, Mr The Mayor of London? Yes, Sadiq Khan makes an appearance in the opening episode of the fifth (!) series of <strong>Citizen Khan</strong> (BBC1). He doesn\u2019t say a lot. \u201cYes, that\u2019s me, Citizen Khan at your service,\u201d he tells a police officer who\u2019s looking for the other Citizen Khan. And then, when the cop starts to escort him out of Edgbaston cricket ground: \u201cBut hang on, I\u2019m the mayor of London!\u201d A little wooden, Sadiq: don\u2019t give up the day job.</p> <p>But the point is he\u2019s in the show. He must approve, and he\u2019s by no means the first British Pakistani \u2013 second generation, first, third \u2013 to give CK the thumbs up. That means something, as do the ratings and the awards, including Asian Media awards, for the show and its creator and star Adil Ray.</p> <p>But then so do all the other voices \u2013 for example Labour MP Rupa Huq\u2019s \u2013<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36048059\"> who say it\u2019s backward and Islamophobic</a>.</p> <p>My view is that it certainly plays to stereotypes, but not necessarily harmfully; more affectionate than hateful. Mr Khan is a caricature but a recognisable one, as are the rest of the family. Younger daughter Alia (Bhavna Limbachia) is most interesting and most believable \u2013 one person with her parents, a very different one away from them. But then you might say my view on this counts for diddly. </p> <p>I am more qualified to talk about the comedy, though. And, God, it\u2019s awful. Painful, even. \u201cTurn around,\u201d Kahn tells his son-in-law as he gets changed, and Amjad turns all the way round \u2013 360 degrees. Even the studio audience struggles to raise a titter at that one. But they like Khan falling through the window, and some of the light innuendo and punnery \u2013 including the inevitable googly misunderstanding. And the line: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to wash into my underbody, it hasn\u2019t been done for a while\u201d (no not that one, the car!). It really is like watching telly in the 70s.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s OK. For it is \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/29/citizen-khan-adil-ray-sitcom\">Ray has said</a> \u2013 influenced by sitcoms from that time. It just seems a shame that the most popular TV programme about and featuring British Asians is so lame. </p>",

The campaign submitted the \u201cClinton Family\u2019s Chocolate Chip Cookies\u201d \u2014 a reprise of Hillary Clinton\u2019s earlier oatmeal chocolate chip submissions.

Back in 1992, Hillary Clinton was something of an oddity, a political spouse with her own high-powered career, who hadn\u2019t set it aside to stand by her husband when Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas. Her career became an issue in the Democratic primary. There were questions about whether then-Gov.

Intricately will break from seven, while Spain Burg and Frankie Dettori go from stall four. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581d0a8ae4b0d073c27d1a24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-04T22:24:43.201Z\">10.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the closing stages of the Breeders\u2019 Cup Dirt Mile: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Dirt Mile\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;REPLAY: Tamarkuz is the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BC16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#BC16&lt;/a&gt; Las &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Vegas&quot;&gt;@Vegas&lt;/a&gt; Dirt Mile World Champion! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MAO8Ku1Mom&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MAO8Ku1Mom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Breeders&amp;#39; Cup (@BreedersCup) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BreedersCup/status/794663607862587392&quot;&gt;November 4, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581d0946e4b029b92ca45ad7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-04T22:21:22.974Z\">10.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Snippet number two is that a run at Royal Ascot is at least being considered for Oscar Performance, and it seems that Nick Smith, Ascot\u2019s globetrotting horse-recruiter-in-chief, may have already had a quiet word with <strong>John Amerman.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Someone came up to me, forgive me but I didn\u2019t catch his name, but a wonderful, nice man, he said, are you going to come to Ascot in the summer?

Songbird is 11-from-11 so far, a record that includes last year\u2019s Juvenile Fillies\u2019, but untested against older fillies and mares.
