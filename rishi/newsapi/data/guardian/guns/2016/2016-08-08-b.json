  "<p>To the Cicada des Arts, a sprawling cultural complex in Barra, to join the sweaty throng for Usain Bolt\u2019s pre-Olympic press conference. Or, more accurately, 20 minutes of mostly softball questions from hundreds of the world\u2019s media, in which the Jamaican sprinter was told, \u201cYour way of dealing with the pressure makes Brazilian people want to marry you a little more,\u201d and rapped to by a Norwegian journalist, who also told Bolt he was in love with him. </p> <p>At the finale Bolt was joined on the stage by scantily clad Samba dancers, who he proceeded to dance along to in perfect time. His sponsor\u2019s, Puma, had chosen the venue \u2013 the largest theatre in South America \u2013 well.<br></p> <p>What did we learn? Two things. First, that Bolt believes the drug problems that have cast a thick cloud over his sport are thinning, and could even evaporate. And that he still believes that he could one day break his 200m world record of 19.19 sec, set in Berlin seven years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/russia-doping-scandal-paralympics-ban-rio-2016\">Paralympics show way on Russian doping to shame of the IOC</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think we are going in the right direction,\u201d said Bolt when asked about doping. \u201cWe are weeding out the bad ones, and I personally think we are on the right track. We have had to go through a rough time before the good times. But in a few years the sport should be clean and I look forward to that.\u201d</p> <p>On the walls one graffiti artist had painted Bolt crouching down in a starting position looking intently Christ the Redeemer. It seemed to be a subliminal message: the Jamaican was a track deity who could lead the sport into better times. But when pressed about how sure he was the 100m final would be free from drugs, he shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIn life nothing is guaranteed,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I never worry about drugs. That\u2019s for Wada and the IAAF and the IOC. They worry about these problems. I go out and compete and wow the crowd. In a few years it will be fine, I personally think.\u201d</p> <p>His main adversary Justin Gatlin, his arch rival, was not given a name-check. But if Bolt has any doubts over his chances of defending his Olympic 100m and 200m titles in Rio he is an even better actor than he is sprinter.</p> <p>Bolt\u2019s press conferences are always more like comedy performances: when he retires, as he promises to do after the 2017 world championships, he would make a brilliant chat show host. For now though his mind is on possibly one day going under 19 seconds in the 200m.</p> <p>\u201cI am more nervous over the 200m than anything else,\u201d he admitted. \u201cFor the 100m it is never really stressful, I know where I am weakest and strongest. But when I get to the 200m I am always nervous, right from the rounds to the final because I love the 200m the most. I really want to run under 19 seconds. It will be a little bit hard because I missed out on a few weeks of training, but you never know. And the 100m rounds always help my 200m.\u201d</p> <p>He did admit, however, that his coach, Glen Mills, had been spectacularly unimpressed by his recent 19.89sec for 200m at the recent Anniversary Games in London. \u201cI called my coach and asked \u2018how was it?\u2019\u201d Bolt revealed. \u201cHe said that is one of the worst races I have ever run. He just went on and on until I got depressed.\u201d</p> <p>Those Jamaican media entourage who are close to Bolt talk of him being in shape to go under 9.70sec in Sunday\u2019s 100m final. The line between cheerleader and journalist can be thin amongst their corps \u2013 most were wearing their country\u2019s colours of black, green and gold \u2013 but when they promise that Bolt is in form they are usually proved right.</p> <p>The evening started when Bolt, wearing a white cap back to front, stepped on to the stage, only to almost immediately stop and walk backwards into the darkness again. \u201cFirst of all, you got to clap louder than that,\u201d he joked. All week reports from Jamaica\u2019s training camp have suggested that the 29-year-old is looking supremely relaxed in the build-up to what will be his last Olympics. Nothing he did or said suggested otherwise.</p> <p>He smiled when he was asked about his form and his rivals. \u201cIt has not been the perfect build-up but I am in much better shape,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been training well, and that\u2019s the key thing. But I never try to pick out one person as a main rival, it is all about the eight people on the day.\u201d</p> <p>Then \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 there was a rap from Nicolay Andre Ramm, a Norwegian radio journalist, after he told Bolt \u201cI don\u2019t really have a question I just want to say I really love you man.\u201d. Afterwards Ramm explained his thinking: \u201cIt\u2019s a show, so you have to spice it up with some comedy.\u201d It was hard to dispute the first part of his answer, whatever you made of the second. It certainly didn\u2019t feel like a press conference.</p> <p>But the overriding impression was that Bolt was as supremely happy as he is confident, which he hasn\u2019t always been the case during major championships. \u201cThe only problem is I\u2019ve had to buy a TV for myself,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cThey said we would get one but after two days it hadn\u2019t turned up, so I went out and bought one.\u201d On Sunday night millions will be watching him \u2013 and, almost certainly, watching him deliver yet again.</p>",
  "<p>As one of the world\u2019s largest consumers of diesel per capita, Australia could soon benefit from the onshore production of a cleaner-burning alternative.</p> <p>Dimethyl ether (DME) is a colourless gas used as an aerosol propellant for things such as hairspray, but engine manufacturers and other companies have been exploring its potential as an alternative transport fuel. </p> <p>This is because DME is compatible with compression ignition engines, requiring only minor modifications. It mirrors the performance of diesel and, under the right conditions, has a much cleaner emissions profile, producing virtually no particulate matter or soot.</p> <p>Michael van Baarle, the managing director of Australian DME Fuels, which was established in 2015, says: \u201cAny replacement of diesel oil by DME, particularly in heavy-duty vehicles, will result in a significant improvement in air quality.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/04/mining-town-coober-pedy-shows-the-rest-of-australiahow-to-turn-to-renewables\">Mining town Coober Pedy shows the rest of Australia how to turn to renewables</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Brisbane-based company has plans to build Australia\u2019s first commercial-scale production plant by 2020, generating a diesel-replacement fuel for use in trucks, heavy machinery, and remote off-grid power stations. The DME can also be blended with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for use in passenger vehicles. </p> <p>\u201cIf you make the methanol feedstock for DME renewably, then you essentially have an almost zero-emission fuel from a greenhouse gas perspective,\u201d says van Baarle.</p> <p>There are other upsides: DME has similar storage and handling properties to LPG. This means it can be stored safely in gas bottles and distributed using existing LPG infrastructure. It also has a longer shelf-life than diesel, and poses no environmental contamination risks from spillage.</p> <p>Van Baarle hopes the onshore production of DME will help Australia end its reliance on diesel, particularly for transportation and off-grid power generation.</p> <p>In 2014/2015, Australia used more than 23.5bn litres of diesel, or just shy of 1,000 litres per person, according to <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=5&amp;pid=alltypes&amp;aid=2&amp;cid=regions&amp;syid=2014&amp;eyid=2013&amp;unit=TBPD\" rel=\"nofollow\">information</a> from the US Energy Information Administration. </p> <p>This places Australia among the world\u2019s largest consumers of diesel per capita, he says.</p> <p>While compression ignition engines are efficient, burnt diesel produces greenhouse gases, noxious emissions, and particulate matter. These hazardous pollutants reduce air quality and can trigger respiratory problems.</p> <p>Even with sophisticated emissions control systems, many diesel engines are still emitting noxious pollutants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/diesel-cars-pollution-limits-nox-emissions \" rel=\"nofollow\">above legal limits</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/18/ban-diesel-cars-in-london-thinktank-urges\">some cities</a> are considering banning diesel vehicles altogether.</p> <p>Australian DME Fuels wants to produce DME from renewably generated methanol, which is considerably more expensive than using fossil fuel feedstocks.</p> <p>This means they need access to waste CO2 from industrial processes, and an ability to make hydrogen from the electrolysis of water \u2013 a power-intensive process that would require them to purchase wind or solar energy. </p> <p>This specific process for generating methanol has been demonstrated on a relatively small scale. A facility in Iceland has generated about 4,000 tonnes a year, says van Baarle. </p> <p>Australian DME Fuels plans to produce 12 times that amount. \u201cWe believe that the next scale-up of this technology to commercial quantities of 50,000 tonnes per annum can be achieved in Australia,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This translates to about 48.5m litres of DME, which is roughly equivalent to 26m litres of diesel from an energy output standpoint.</p> <p>With on-site hydrogen production capabilities, he estimates the plant will cost between $200m and $300m to build. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/22/cheap-and-clean-australian-company-creates-hydrogen-with-near-zero-emissions\">Cheap and clean: Australian company creates hydrogen with near-zero emissions</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The company is exploring funding strategies, including support from bodiessuch as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.</p> <p>Van Baarle says the company is also developing a \u201cnetwork of strategic partners\u201d including engine manufacturers, LPG distributors, methanol producers, and renewable power generators.</p> <p>\u201cWe have some of those people already in place,\u201d he says. </p> <p> But cost is still a red flag. Renewable DME could be upwards of three times more expensive per gigajoule than diesel (currently $15/gigajoule), or DME produced with non-renewable methanol ($17/gigajoule). </p> <p>Van Baarle says his company could offset that cost by selling bulk, renewably produced methanol. He\u2019s also hopeful that downward trends in the cost of solar power will make it more affordable.</p> <p>One of the key challenges to establishing a domestic market for DME is co-ordinating the deployment of modified compression ignition, or diesel engines.<br></p> <p>Jim Patel is a research scientist at the CSIRO who has been leading an Australia-India Strategic Research Fund project investigating the small scale production of DME. \u201cDME is often referred to as a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThere is little incentive to develop applications for DME when it isn\u2019t widely available and while there are no applications, there is little incentive to supply,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Patel says the main challenge for producing renewable DME from CO2 will be the economics of buying renewable power to make hydrogen and sourcing enough CO2 feedstock. </p> <p>He suggests it might be more affordable to initially produce a proportion of DME from renewable sources and gradually increase this. </p> <p>Patel says there are positive signs DME could be gaining traction internationally. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.volvogroup.com/group/global/en-gb/_layouts/CWP.Internet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=143286\" rel=\"nofollow\">Volvo</a> has begun developing DME-powered engines for heavy trucks in North America and its subsidiary, Mack, is running a <a href=\"http://www.vehicleservicepros.com/article/12235287/mack-trucks-dsny-exploring-the-viability-of-dme\" rel=\"nofollow\">demonstration</a> with municipal sanitation trucks in New York City. </p> <p>Last year <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2015/09/11/ford-leads-project-to-develop-near-zero-particulate-emission-die.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Motor Company</a> began working with the German government to develop and test the world\u2019s first production passenger car to run on DME. </p> <p>\u201cDue to its potential for reduced particulate emissions, DME should be amongst the alternative fuels under consideration for use in Australia,\u201d says Patel. </p>",

  "<p>Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union may have been a shock, but a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/17/summer-arrives-just-in-time-for-the-school-holidays\">prolonged period of warm weather in July</a> was even more unexpected.</p> <p>At least that is what the latest retail sales figures show. Like-for-like retail sales, which excludes newly opened or closed stores, rose by 1.1% in July, while total sales rose by 1.9%. This was the best performance since January according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG index.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/uk-consumers-keep-spending-despite-brexit-vote-shock\">UK consumers keep spending despite Brexit vote shock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The increase suggests there has been no post-referendum drop-off in consumer spending, despite surveys forecasting that the confidence of business and households have taken a hit.</p> <p>However, this should not be a surprise. Firstly, more than half of voters wanted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>. It is an obvious statement but one worth remembering when considering the potential damage to the economy from the vote. The 52% who voted for Brexit presumably did not think that they would be worse of as a result, so they will be less inclined to rein in spending then those who wanted to stay in the EU. In fact, some Brexiters may have celebrated the result by spending a few bob on a nice bottle of bubbly.</p> <p>As it stands, of course, nothing has actually changed yet. Britain is still a member of the EU. The impact on household spending may not filter down until businesses actually pull operations out of the country or cut jobs.</p> <p>Secondly, though, the warm weather in July offset any underlying shift in consumer sentiment.</p> <p>Retail sales figures for the UK are notoriously volatile, with the BRC and KPMG report considered the most accurate of a mixed bunch by retailers. However, trends are easily identifiable, and those in the July report show a textbook British reaction to a heatwave \u2013 spending on summer clothing, picnic and barbecue food went up, and spending on furniture went down.<br></p> <p>Food enjoyed its best sales performance since November 2013, excluding distortions for the timing of Easter. In contrast, furniture fell from being the best-performing retail category in the year so far to just the fourth best. After all, who wants to do DIY inside when the sun is shining?</p> <p>There is one intriguing titbit in the figures that will be worth watching in the coming month \u2013 sales of jewellery and watches rose sharply in July, making it the best performing retail category. BRC and KPMG claim this is at least partly because of international consumers taking advantage of the weakness of sterling to buy luxury items. However, Eid also took place in July, which will have boosted the market. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see whether the luxury market can sustain this performance. If it does, then it could offset the effects of a Brexit slump if one hits households when the warm weather inevitably disappears.</p> <h2>National living wage vs executive pay</h2> <p>The trade associations who have written to the government calling for the national living wage to be reconsidered could not have timed their letter worse.</p> <p>Their intervention was revealed on the same day that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/uks-top-bosses-earned-10-pay-rise-2015-average-salary-hit-55m\">High Pay Centre reported that the average pay for FTSE 100 chief executives rose 10% last year to \u00a35.5m</a>. Company bosses now earn 129 times more than their employees.</p> <p>The disparity between the national living wage letter and executive pay is staggering.</p> <p>The trade bodies want Greg Clark, the new business secretary, to slow or scrap the scheduled increase in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/national-living-wage\">national living wage </a>from \u00a37.20 an hour now to more than \u00a39 by 2020. The initiative was introduced by George Osborne and establishes a new level of base pay for workers over 25. If it does reach \u00a39 then it will be one of the highest minimum wages in the developed world.</p> <p>To be fair, some of the organisations behind the letter represent small businesses, convenience stores, pubs and farms. They are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/seven-ways-government-could-lift-the-economys-post-brexit-vote-blues\">concerned about the economic uncertainty caused by the result of the EU referendum</a> and are keen to keep their costs under control.</p> <p>However, the national living wage must not fall victim to Brexit. The policy was a small step towards closing the grotesque gap between the pay of workers and their bosses. Any change would send a terrible message.</p> <p>Theresa May has already said she wants the economy to work \u201cfor all, not just the few\u201d. The new prime minister should be looking at ways to increase the national living wage further and clampdown on executive pay, not vice-versa.</p> <h2>Southern strike</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/07/southern-railway-passengers-week-disruption-rmt-strike-union-five-day-walkout\">The new five-day strike by workers </a>on the Southern rail network does not reflect well on the RMT trade union, Govia Thameslink, the company that holds the franchise, or the government. </p> <p>The long-running saga is a national embarrassment.

Distracted by the pain and still in traffic, he let the car\u2019s controversial autopilot carry him down the road toward a hospital.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the most excruciating pain I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he later told <a href=\"http://www.ky3.com/content/news/Self-driving-Tesla-SUV-saves-the-day-389392262.html\">local KY3 news</a>. \u201cIt was kinda getting scary. I called my wife and just said, \u2018Something\u2019s wrong.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just knew I had to get there, to the ER,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Tesla\u2019s autopilot function requires a driver to touch the wheel every few minutes, and Neally was able to keep it active for 20 miles down the highway. He said that in the moment of crisis, he considered stopping for an ambulance but decided to trust the software, for fear that he would crash if the car were entirely in his control. Tesla\u2019s software has been designed to guide cars to a stop on the side of the road if a driver stops responding.</p> <p>\u201cIf something like that happens where I become unconscious or incapacitated while I\u2019m driving,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cross over the interstate and slam into somebody or slam into one of the big rock walls.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually carried near a hospital, Neally gathered his strength and took over, driving off the highway exit ramp and the rest of the way to the hospital. He has since recovered and continues to receive treatment.</p> <p>Neally declined to be interviewed when contacted by the Guardian, saying: \u201cI\u2019m a tad overwhelmed by the attention.\u201d</p> <p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>In May, a Florida man was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk\">killed while driving a Tesla on autopilot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/01/tesla-driver-killed-autopilot-self-driving-car-harry-potter\">with a DVD of Harry Potter on</a>, according to a witness. According to Tesla, the car\u2019s sensors failed to detect a white 18-wheel truck against a bright sky, and the car attempted to drive underneath the tractor-trailer \u201cwith the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S\u201d.</p> <p>On 1 July, a Model X on autopilot on a Pennsylvania highway <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/06/tesla-autopilot-fatal-crash-public-beta-testing\">crashed into a guardrail</a>, drove across several lanes and flipped on to a roof. The man behind the wheel was later charged with careless driving. A third Tesla also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/12/tesla-car-crash-montana-elon-musk-self-driving-cars\">crashed in Montana </a>that month, in another nonfatal crash, and the company said that data suggested the driver\u2019s hands were off the wheel for more than two minutes, in violation of the autopilot terms of use.</p> <p>Neally acknowledged those questions, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be perfect, there\u2019s no technology that\u2019s perfect, but I think the measure is that it\u2019s better and safer.\u201d</p> <p>The crashes have raised questions over the safety of Tesla\u2019s autopilot function, and the fatal Florida crash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/13/tesla-autopilot-investigation-fatal-crash\">prompted a federal investigation</a>. The Securities and Exchange Commission also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/11/sec-tesla-self-driving-car-crash-death-investigation\">reportedly opened an investigation</a> into whether Tesla, which disclosed the crash in July, should have noted it in an earlier regulatory filing.</p> <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has defended his embattled company\u2019s safety record, and in April he asserted that the autopilot system was \u201c<a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/elon-musk-teslas-autopilot-reduces-crashes-50-451929\">twice as good as a person</a>\u201d. In July, he responded to criticisms of the autopilot, saying: \u201cWhen used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.\u201d</p> <p>Musk has also cited the dire traffic accident statistics, noting that the July crash was \u201cthe first known fatality in just over 130m miles\u201d in contrast to <a href=\"http://asirt.org/initiatives/informing-road-users/road-safety-facts/road-crash-statistics\">1.25m people who die in car accidents each year</a>.</p> <p>The autopilot function is not fully autonomous, like self-driving cars being developed by Google and other companies. The company also calls the technology a \u201cbeta\u201d feature still in testing.</p>",
  "<p>A former Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty to violating the civil rights of a woman and lying to the FBI on Friday, in a rare case of a police officer facing conviction. </p> <p>According to the indictment, in 2012, Homer police department officer Willie Fred Knowles pushed a woman, known as KM, to the floor and struck her face and body, causing injury. A few months later, when questioned by the FBI, Knowles lied about the incident, telling agents the woman jumped on his back and that he never struck her. </p> <p>He was also charged with deploying his Taser against two people in 2012, \u201cwithout justification\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday, in a court in Shreveport, Louisiana, Knowles pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and violating the civil rights of KM. He will be sentenced on 9 November and he faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison for lying to the FBI and one year for the civil rights charge. </p> <p>Knowles was suspended and then terminated by the time charges were brought. </p> <p>Knowles\u2019 case represents a rare example of a police officer facing a conviction in a civil rights case. A study by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review found that, between 1995 and 2005, federal prosecutors denied bringing charges in 96% of cases where law enforcement officers faced civil rights charges. In contrast, prosecutors turned down only 23% of all other type of criminal cases. </p> <p>Elton Richey, a defense attorney in Shreveport who has defended both police officers who were terminated and civilians who claim the police violated their civil rights, said relying on police to monitor themselves is problematic. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of any case that I\u2019ve and where the internal affairs investigation found the officer at fault,\u201d he said, referencing the internal body which investigates civil rights cases. \u201cThe officer will get what civilians don\u2019t get, and that\u2019s the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p> <p>The Homer police department has come under increased scrutiny, after a series of lawsuits prompted the FBI to launch an investigation into the department. Complaints escalated after an elderly black unarmed man was shot and killed by two white police officers. The two settled with the family for $125,000.</p>",
  "<p>The first the Maria Lenk aquatic centre knew of Tom Daley and Daniel Goodfellow\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/tom-daley-dan-goodfellow-rio-platform-diving-bronze\">bronze medal</a> in the 10 metre platform dive was a screeching cry from the Team GB coach Jane Figuero a microsecond before the arena itself erupted.</p> <p>For Daley and Goodfellow, the pursuit of the leaders had come down to the very last knockings, the final dive of 36 in a gruellingly high-end competition. Picked out for a moment against the grey fuzz of the evening sky, they paused, charged and hurled themselves into a final back 3.5 somersault pike, producing under extreme pressure a genuinely beautiful moment of plunging synchronicity. </p> <p>As they surfaced, Daley hugged Goodfellow, eyes fixed now on the scoreboard at the far end. Then came the scream, the cheers, the row of 9s and 8.5s, and a lovely spontaneous arm-in-arm plunge into the shallows.</p> <p>For Daley, this was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2012/aug/11/olympics-2012-tomdaley\">second Olympic bronze</a>, and an unarguable sporting vindication for a British athlete whose extreme achievements can be obscured for some by his glitz, his televisual burnish, his celebrity six-pack. The fact remains, though, that in an era of Chinese dominance, Britain has a self-made bona fide diving heavyweight, a lively, likeable pop-kid of the high board who has now won exactly 50% of Britain\u2019s Olympic diving medals since the 1920s.</p> <p>It is a success all the more remarkable for the fact that Daley\u2019s entire career, from dinky fresh-faced teenager to dinky fresh-faced adult, has been played out in that superstar diving-boy glare. In the buildup here, even his trunks have been a topic of fascination, with reports of Daley seeking an audience with Stella McCartney during design process to reconfigure the precise flow and stretch of his pouch. His attention will now refocus ahead of the individual competition starting a week on Friday. Don\u2019t expect Daley to blink. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/08/tom-daley-dan-goodfellow-bronze-medal-great-britain-diving-synchronised-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q436\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640525\"            data-video-name=\"Tom Daley and Dan Goodfellow secure bronze for Great Britain \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8ea75e4b03b51a99e133e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808MenDiving_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/08/160808MenDiving.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/08/160808MenDiving_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/08/tom-daley-dan-goodfellow-bronze-medal-great-britain-diving-synchronised-video\">Tom Daley and Dan Goodfellow secure bronze for Great Britain</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was a late-breaking success built from a steady start. As the divers marched out on the poolside in their tracksuits, there were cheers and whistles around a half-full arena. The Maria Lenk is an intimate little water park on the far edge of Rio\u2019s Olympic Park with the hills of suburbs poking in above the lip of the stand. Open to the air, built on top of an old military complex, it is a slightly eerie corner of the park with a Ballardian murkiness to its endless corridors and gantries and grey-beige interiors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fd2e55846353977052b1fb335599b4be0c98147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fd2e55846353977052b1fb335599b4be0c98147/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Daley (left) and Daniel Goodfellow (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Daley (left) and Daniel Goodfellow (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daley and Goodfellow were down to dive last through the six rounds of escalating difficulty, the ultimate test of a routine honed over months of training, during which Goodfellow has moved to London to live with Daley, the two men forming an unusually tight bond both on and away from the board.</p> <p>As the divers strode mournfully forward to complete their plunge, oddly stark up there on the highest board, it was striking what a strange activity diving is in isolation. Most sports involve the need to run or fight or leap. In diving it is only contortions during a descent governed by non-negotiable gravity. These are the human race\u2019s masters of falling.</p> <p>The Russians went first, Victor Minibaev and Nikita Shleikher performing a pared back backwards somersault that seemed to hang as they plunged down out of the grey, past the pyramid of blue-blazered judges. Later a mediocre set of scores for the Ukrainians was whistled and booed, as was the row of eights for the Brazilian pair. The rhythm was gripping: a blast of disco music, a fluster of applause, whistles at the appearance of the two small, bronzed figures at the mouth of the top board, then the hush, the craned necks, the thud of entry.</p> <p>Finally Daley and Goodfellow emerged for their opener, kicking off with an inward 1.5 somersault pike. As they paused and stretched, a flock of seabirds flew by cawing at the end of the stadium, a reminder of the background fog of complaints and gripes around these Olympic Games that has become a mini-industry in itself, fed with blaring accounts of each malfunctioning vending machine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1809f2dc08b6182da0ad008288e8ff652161769\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1809f2dc08b6182da0ad008288e8ff652161769/0_139_4560_2735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Daley shows his coach Jane Figuereido the bronze medal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Daley shows his coach Jane Figuereido the bronze medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Maria Lenk arena has had its problems too, mainly focused on mosquito issues, driven by the fertile breeding ground of a nearby stagnant lagoon. There have been misgivings among the divers about competing outdoors, with all its variables of sunlight and wind. Here it was a muggy, slightly unsettling day, with a low fuzz of bruised cloud clinging over the hills behind the board. Undisturbed by the birds, Daley and Goodfellow produced a solid effort that took them to third place. <br></p> <p>And so it went on, the Chinese pair Aisen Chen and Yue Lin pulling away steadily on the board, ahead of the agreeably expressive Mexicans, who went through a kind of psyching-up routine before some of their dives, unusual in this most mannered and stately of water sports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea46e7197b1b2c33a819fc75e90a3b20cc12fc6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea46e7197b1b2c33a819fc75e90a3b20cc12fc6a/0_0_3135_2013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daley and Goodfellow took bronze, with China in the lead and the US team taking silver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daley and Goodfellow took bronze, with China in the lead and the US team taking silver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daley and Goodfellow were a little looser with their reverse 1.5 somersault twist, a telling distance opening up mid-fall between those whirling torsos. The Chinese, immaculate in gleaming red trunks, swatted aside their first really difficult dive as the stakes rose. The British pair dropped to fifth as Mexico and Germany surged. Daley and Goodfellow shook their heads, retreating pensively to the poolside hot tub.</p> <p>The key moment arrived with China\u2019s fifth dive of six, the round during which the stakes are upped, and difficulties go through the roof. Chen and Yue took the judges for 9.5s and 10s, emerging from the water punching the air and whooping after four previous dives during which the favourites had remained sombre and reserved. Gold looked a certainty, the challenge for Daley and Goodfellow was to follow their vapour trail.</p> <p>So to the final round. The Americans, David Boudia and the brilliantly named Steele Johnson, claimed silver with another immaculate dive, hugging with real feeling as they left the water. At which point, enter Daley and Goodfellow and a leap at the last into British Olympic history.</p>",

At the weekend, the 21/11/15 to be specific. I had a freak accident on vault. I went wonky on a yuchenko and landed with one leg on the landing matts (right leg) the other on the concrete (left leg) which left me with a broken leg both tibia &amp; Fibia. I had to have surgery shortly after. The pain as excruciating as it was I could handle, but the disappointment &amp; heart break from going from such a high at the world championships to the lowest low after a little mishap was very hard for me.  all my emotions just erupted and I&#39;ve found myself constantly In tears. This may be a big stepping stone to overcome but most if not all successful athletes have had to overcome adversity to reach their goals. That moment at the world championships I will never forget &amp; it&#39;s something I want to feel again. So after my recovery stage I will be grinding to get myself back better than I have ever been. I would like to thank a lot of people for your support, my family &amp; team mates which are basically the same thing @jaythompson_96 @maxwhitlock @reissbeckford @haydenskinner43 &amp; the biggest thank you to my coach and father figure @scotthann who never left my side once and I know your behind me every step of the way.

The beautiful thing about gymnastics is that it doesn\u2019t matter: marvelling at athletes simply overcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/fabian-hambuchen-gynastics-injuries-samir-ait-said-andreas-toba\">the dangers of flipping and twisting</a> several metres off the ground, pushing the limit of human strength, balance, flexibility and grace is more enough.</p> <p>But if you are from one of China, USA, Russia, Japan, Great Britain, Brazil, Ukraine or Germany, you\u2019ve got a little extra to get excited about. From the Ryder Cup in golf to the Davis Cup in tennis, team competitions seem to light a fire in fans like nothing else. Today\u2019s men\u2019s team final is made up of the eight countries, each with five gymnasts in their ranks, who will take it in turns to each perform one of six different disciplines: vault, floor, pommel horse, rings, parallel bars and horizontal bars.</p> <p>Each individual score will then be added to the team\u2019s total. Every routine counts: less than 2.5 points divided the top six qualifiers for this final, so every athlete is just one disaster from potentially costing their county a medal.</p> <p>The field is tight this year. China, winners in 2012, are widely tipped as the favourites. In Kohei Uchimura, Japan have arguably the best all-round athlete and won team gold the world championships in Glasgow last year.

  "<p>As the first woman to clinch a major party nomination, Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy is already historic \u2013 and increasingly it looks like Donald Trump\u2019s is too. But not in a flattering way.</p> <p>If last week came the point at which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-week-campaign-turning-point-2016-election\">self-immolated the campaign</a> and beloved Trump brand, this week may be remembered as the time he finally drove his party\u2019s national security leadership to support the Democratic candidate for president en masse, either by voting for her expressly or by abstaining.</p> <p>National security is an issue that Republican presidential candidates have historically been able to dominate, but Trump may be the first guy in recent history to blow that for the party. Even more remarkable is that top neoconservatives in the party are all taking the Democrat\u2019s side: Clinton has said Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button\u201d of our nuclear arsenal. It looks like even Republican top brass agrees.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republicans-donald-trump-warning-letter-bush-reagan\">a long list of GOP national security hands wrote a letter</a> saying Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history\u201d and that electing him in November would put the nation\u2019s security at risk. Some of the 50 signatories said they\u2019d vote for Clinton while others deemed it better to abstain from voting entirely. But all were in fundamental agreement on one main point: \u201cTrump is not qualified and would be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>This comes after Evan McMullin, a former CIA official who recently worked for the House Republican conference, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">filed papers to run for president</a> as an independent candidate. He doesn\u2019t support Clinton, and having missed the ballot-access deadlines in most states, the move is expected to have little effect on the race other than to help the former secretary of state by cutting into Trump\u2019s margins. But that\u2019s just fine with McMullin, who says: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to do the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>In fact if there\u2019s a common theme to this most recent wave of GOP dissenters, it\u2019s just how eerily close they sound to Hillary Clinton\u2019s talking points.</p> <p>\u201cHe is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood,\u201d<a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\"> the GOP national security leaders said in the letter</a>. \u201cHe does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be president and commander in chief, with command of the US nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1\">in recent interviews</a> have specifically cited Trump\u2019s recent comment inviting Russia to hack into Clinton\u2019s email servers, a remark Trump has since claimed he was making in jest, as the moment that changed their mind about him. They also touched on his embrace of Putin specifically, calling his admiration for him and other foreign dictators \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>That sounds a whole lot like what Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/politics/hillary-clinton-on-egyptair-shines-a-very-bright-light-on-threat-of-terror/\">been saying all along</a>, if not what Barack Obama said at the Democratic convention last month when he called Trump\u2019s rival the most qualified presidential candidate in history.</p> <p>In our era of political polarization and congressional stagnation, it\u2019s been ages since top Republicans and Democrats in Washington could agree on anything more definitively than the need to keep Trump out of the White House. And without getting ahead of ourselves too much (for Trump\u2019s done nothing this election so well as outperform low expectations), let\u2019s hope the unlikely unity extends beyond the neocons and with any luck, lasts longer than the election. </p>",

Estimates vary regarding how much of that money Iran will actually see: the treasury secretary, Jack Lew, has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, Iranian officials between <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, the $400m in question stems from a dispute over a failed arms deal in the late 1970s, which has been under arbitration at the Hague for decades. The money was delivered in foreign currency because it is illegal under US law to have transactions with Iran in US dollars, and because remaining sanctions are major obstacles to global banks.

This he won with ease before missing just two of his 15 attempts against Kostelecky at the Deodoro complex in the north of Rio.</p> <p>Ling said: \u201cIt was nice to go straight from the shoot\u2011off to the bronze-medal match because you stay in the zone and stay focused on what is in front of you.\u201d</p> <p>Gold was won by Josip Glasnovic of Croatia, the country\u2019s first medal here, who beat Italy\u2019s Giovanni Pellielo 4-3 in a shoot\u2011off after the pair had tied their contest 13-13.</p> <p>It was a third attempt at Olympic glory for Ling, who has won world and European titles in this event. He made his debut at Athens in 2004, finishing tied for 25th in the trap, but did not qualify again until London 2012, where he came 21st.</p> <p>Ling is from a rural background \u2013 his farm near Minehead is a combination of beef, arable and free-range poultry \u2013 and not known for garrulousness. He first learned to shoot as a 12-year-old, hitting clays with his father\u2019s Browning shotgun.</p> <p>Wild celebrations are not usually his thing. Ling sat out the opening ceremony and is not expected to hang around for the closing one either, preferring to get back to work on the farm.</p> <p>All of his family are keen shooters \u2013 his 15-year-old brother, Theo, is an English under-16 title-holder and his wife, Abbey,&#xa0;is a five-times British champion who won this year\u2019s English Ladies\u2019 Open. His father is the former GB international coach Steve Ling.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad and my family are a huge influence on me and I am also delighted for them,\u201d Ling said. \u201cThey will be watching this back home and they will be absolutely thrilled, so this is also for them.\u201d</p> <p>Ling had only moderate hopes for this event having suffered in the heat and humidity when competing at the same Rio venue at a World Cup event in April. But conditions on Monday were to his advantage, being no hotter than a balmy summer\u2019s morning in Somerset.</p>",

  "<p>The Kosovan gold medallist judoka, Majlinda Kelmendi, could face a ban on competition in France after refusing an unscheduled drugs test, the International Judo Federation (IJF) has confirmed.</p> <p>Kelmendi, 25, became the first Kosovan to win Olympic gold when she triumphed in the -52kg category in the Carioca arena on Sunday. But her victory could be tarnished amid claims that she had committed an anti-doping violation in France in June during her preparations for Rio.</p> <p>The IJF said: \u201cA control was done in June in France. The procedure is contested by the athlete and her coach and looks questionable at the level of the IJF. If sanction would be given, it would only apply on the French territory.\u201d</p> <p>It seems Kelmendi refused to take part in an unscheduled, out-of-competition urine test conducted by the French anti doping agency (AFLD), when she was at a training camp in St Cyprien in southern France on 16 June.</p> <p>Agron Kuka, Judo team leader for the Kosovan Olympic team, confirmed to the Guardian that Kelmendi had refused the drugs test but insisted she was clean.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe team was in the training camp in France and some person came and asked to do the doping control. But the person involved, she didn\u2019t have any authorisation from Wada [the World Anti Doping Agency] or anyone. And that\u2019s the end of the story. Then afterwards [the French] made a complaint somewhere and were trying to take the case to court or something... The Kosovan team were in discussion with the IJF the whole time because they are not going to go and give the blood or the urine to somebody who is not responsible. That is the end of the story, it\u2019s nothing else.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI don\u2019t know the reason why they are making a big deal out of it. It\u2019s nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if Kelmendi was facing a potential ban in France, Agron said: \u201cThe French, they can do whatever they want in France. But that\u2019s not correct, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p> <p>Kosovo is making its debut at the Rio 2016 Games, having been officially recognised by the International Olympic Committee in December 2014.</p> <p>Kelmendi, Kosovo\u2019s flag bearer in the opening ceremony, chose to compete for Albania four years ago in London when she was unable to represent Kosovo, losing in the second round of the 52kg division. She returned to Brazil this week three years after being crowned world champion in Rio.</p> <p>After taking gold in the Rio dojo on Sunday, she said: \u201cPeople, especially kids, in Kosovo look to me as a hero. I just proved to them that even after the war, even after we survived a war, if they want something they can have it. If they want to be Olympic champions, they can be. Even if we come from a small country, poor country.\u201d</p>",

In 2013, the US supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-obama\">struck at the heart</a> of the 1965 law in a 5-4 decision that allowed nine states, mostly in the south, to make changes to electoral rules without approval from federal authorities in Washington. </p> <p>The prevailing justices argued that while racial discrimination persisted, it was no longer sufficient to justify what they called \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d against the southern states. The states included Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.</p> <p>Civil rights activists were deeply disappointed by the ruling, and have been at the forefront of fighting a surge of voter identification laws which have passed in some of the nine states, which they say amounts to voter suppression and targets racial minorities.</p> <p>\u201cYou can vote with an ID that allows you to carry a concealed weapon, but a card that allows you to carry a book of Shakespeare or a textbook does not allow you to vote,\u201d Brooks said, expressing frustration that in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2016/aug/03/citing-court-victories-elsewhere-tennessee-de/379235/\">some states</a> a handgun permit, but not a library card, can be presented as identification at polling booths. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/north-carolina-voting-rights-law-republicans-november-elections\">string of legal victories last month</a>, courts in five states ruled against voter ID and proof-of-citizenship laws.

  "<p>Nekoda Davis took up judo aged six because it was the cheapest sport. You did not even need trainers, just a fighting spirit. She had that in abundance, having scrapped with her little brother since he was born. Brought up by their Jamaican mum, Ivy, on a council estate in Cricklewood, north-west London, there was no money for horse-riding or dancing or anything that would have required rackets or pads. But \u00a32 a week Ivy could just about stretch to. And when she could not, her daughter\u2019s first coach, Sheree Brannigan, would quietly waive the fee, believing Davis had the potential to be a world-class judoka one day.</p> <p>Brannigan\u2019s faith was well placed when on Monday her charge, now 23, made her Olympic debut in the -57kg category in Rio, striding out on to the mat and skipping from side to side like Rocky Balboa. Though only 1.57m (5ft 2in) in her bare feet she looked as if she meant business and she certainly did. But after sailing through a first-round match with the Austrian veteran Sabrina Filzmoser she faced a trickier draw to get past the last 16.</p> <p>France\u2019s Automne Pavia, ranked third in the world and a bronze medallist at the 2012 Olympics, was always going to be hard to beat. Fourteen centimetres taller and four years older than Davis, Pavia is renowned for her aggression in both offence and defence. She fought fiercely from the moment the referee declared the match open with a piercing \u201chajime!\u201d and won by scoring a yuko with a harai-goshi throw 1min 51sec into the four-minute match.</p> <p>Davis almost pushed her to four penalties that would have meant immediate disqualification but the Frenchwoman held her off. After four years of full-time training and two lots of four minutes Davis was heading home. But, if you think her Olympic dream is over, think again. She had not even caught her breath after her defeat when she was already vowing to return.</p> <p>\u201cYou get beaten on the day, that\u2019s just the way it is,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come back stronger, fitter. I 100% believe my day will come. I know I will be world champion, European champion and, hopefully, Olympic champion one day.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/jul/23/ten-to-watch-meet-team-gbs-sporting-superheroes\" title=\"\">Davis believes she has the edge over her rivals</a> in one particular department: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely no one here who I think is as mentally strong as I am.\u201d</p> <p>A background like Davis\u2019s is often referred to as disadvantaged \u2013 single mother, immigrant background, social housing. Yet Davis sees her upbringing as an advantage. \u201cI didn\u2019t have everything as a kid growing up. I didn\u2019t have a lot of materialistic things. My mum didn\u2019t have a lot of money. She had quite a tough upbringing in life. She came over here from Jamaica with me to give us a better life. She always taught me not to take things for granted and anything you do get in life you\u2019ve got to work hard for. I think that\u2019s where my mental strength and toughness comes from, my mum being a single mum and how hard she struggled.</p> <p>\u201cI knew that I would have to put the work in in life to make something of myself and not be poor. So it really comes from that \u2026 Really the reason I&#xa0;got into judo is that it was the cheapest thing to do, growing up. I found it really hard to deal with that, to not have all the same things as my friends or not be able to go to dance lessons or learn a different language or play an&#xa0;instrument.\u201d</p> <p>The hard knocks have instilled in her an unusually firm sense of self-belief. \u201cIf you work hard and you stay on the path you will get there eventually. All the knockbacks are just making it even harder for you to get there but, when you do get there, it will be even more rewarding,\u201d she said on Monday.</p> <p>Davis was academic in school, getting good A-Levels in maths, further maths, chemistry, sociology and PE. But she decided not to go on to university after being offered the chance to train with British Judo centre of excellence in Walsall shortly after the 2012 Games, where she had worked as a volunteer. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-3693764/The-story-judoka-Nekoda-Davis-shows-Olympic-Games-matter-puts-arrogant-golfers-place.html\" title=\"\">She told the Mail on Sunday last month</a> how she worked in the administration centre at the ExCeL, where the judo took place, and would think up spurious reasons to watch her heroes in action, most notably the great Japanese judoka Kaori Matsumoto, who won gold in Nekoda\u2019s lightweight category in London.</p> <p>It is a measure of how humble Davis\u2019s needs are that she is delighted simply to be getting enough national lottery funding now to pay the rent and eat. \u201cWithout that I wouldn\u2019t be as comfortable as I am now. I can afford to pay for my rent and my food and just focus on my training, which is perfect really, coming from when I worked three jobs when I left school to being in the position I am now.\u201d</p> <p>Concentrating solely on judo soon paid dividends, when she won bronze at the European junior championships in 2013 and gold at the Commonwealth Games a year later. At the Zagreb Grand Prix in 2015 she won her 57kg category and came to the Olympics ranked 12th in the world. Before turning professional Davis was balancing training with babysitting, teaching judo in school and working in a Japanese sushi shop, who were particularly benevolent employers.</p> <p>\u201cJudo is a Japanese sport and they loved the fact I did judo and gave me time off work and would change the rotas around to suit my competition plan,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She is adamant that Rio is not the end but the beginning. \u201cThis is a stepping stone to Tokyo for me,\u201d she said.</p>",

As we conduct more of our lives online, we\u2019re being asked to become increasingly savvy about computer security. Many are simply uninterested or not up to the task.</p> <p> Add up all these factors, and the question becomes not why many consumers are losing confidence in the internet, but whether they should have any confidence at all.</p> <h2><strong>Consumers: the new ATM for cyber crooks</strong></h2> <p> The online crooks\u2019 weapon of choice: crypto-ransomware, which encrypts all the data files on a user\u2019s machine, making them inaccessible. The malware, which accounts for nearly 60% of all infections, according to research firm Malwarebytes, then displays a screen demanding hundreds of dollars. If victims don\u2019t pay up in time, the files are destroyed.</p> <p> \u201cOver the last few years attackers realized that instead of going through these elaborate hacks \u2013 phishing for passwords, breaking into accounts, stealing information, and then selling the data on the internet\u2019s black market for pennies per record \u2013 they could simply target individuals and businesses and treat them like an ATM,\u201d says Brian Beyer, CEO and founder of enterprise security firm Red Canary.</p> <p> According to Symantec, the average ransom paid doubled from just under $300 in 2015 to $679 this year. Last year, the criminals behind the CryptoWall3 malware cost victims more than $325m, according to estimates from the <a href=\"http://cyberthreatalliance.org/\">Cyber Threat Alliance</a>; 2016\u2019s haul is expected to be significantly higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bde1fc3d0f95b836195f4dfa793378f049324f55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bde1fc3d0f95b836195f4dfa793378f049324f55/0_86_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Kaminsky speaks during his keynote address at the Black Hat cyber security conference in Las Vegas: \u2018We need to go ahead and get the internet fixed or risk losing this engine of beauty.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Kaminsky speaks during his keynote address at the Black Hat cyber security conference in Las Vegas: \u2018We need to go ahead and get the internet fixed or risk losing this engine of beauty.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Becker/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> A ransomware attack is relatively easy to overcome if you have a current and complete copy of your data; you can simply restore the untainted files to your machine, says Beyer. (Before you do, though, be sure to install security software that will remove the ransomware, or you may find yourself being jacked all over again, he warns.)</p> <p> The problem? About <a href=\"http://www.worldbackupday.com/en/\">3 in 10 people never back up</a> their data, while others do it sporadically. And even for those who do backup religiously \u2013 or use software such as iCloud or CrashPlan that automatically copies files to machines in the cloud \u2013 restoring data can be a hassle.</p> <p> Which is why for many victims it just seems easier to pay up, says Beyer. And that\u2019s what the criminals are counting on.</p> <h2><strong> The cyber enemy is us</strong></h2> <p> It\u2019s a truism that the biggest threat to security isn\u2019t increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals, data-hungry corporations or even espionage-happy nation states; it\u2019s the people who get duped into clicking random links or opening rogue files.</p> <p> To <a href=\"http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2011/04/we-have-met-enemy-and-he-is-us.html\">paraphrase Pogo</a>: we have met the cyber enemy, and he is us.</p> <p> In a Black Hat demonstration, Zinaida Benenson, a researcher at University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany, measured how many people would click on a potentially malicious link inside an email, then compared the results to how many did the same with a message they received on Facebook. (Spear phishing, or targeting a specific person via a message containing bogus links, is a common way for attackers to steal information.)</p> <p> The results: one in five test subjects clicked a link from a stranger in an email; more than twice as many did it on the social network. Lured by curiosity, even tech-savvy users in the study could not resist clicking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/05/airbnb-wifi-security-threat-risk-travel\">Using Wi-Fi in Airbnb rentals poses security threat, researchers say</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In another study, Elie Bursztein, head of Google\u2019s anti-abuse research team, tracked whether people would pick up a USB thumb drive they found lying on the ground and stick it into their computers (which, he noted, was used as a major plot point in season one of USA Network\u2019s Mr Robot). His research team left 300 USB drives at various locations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne campus. Unwitting test subjects picked up 98% of them; nearly half plugged the drives in and opened the files contained on them.</p> <p> Ask security companies what consumers should do to stay safe, and you\u2019ll get the same advice they\u2019ve been handing out for years \u2013 use better passwords, keep software up to date, back up your data, etc. Dan Kaminsky\u2019s advice is more stark: keep a close watch on your financials and immediately report anything that looks suspicious.</p> <p> \u201cIf you have a bank account that will not send you a text message when there\u2019s a transaction, move your money,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause now it\u2019s not about preventing the fraud, it\u2019s about seeing it as soon as it happens.\u201d</p> <p> In other words, assume you\u2019re going to be hacked, and try to catch it before it does too much damage.</p> <h2>Could the situation change? </h2> <p> If everyone really followed all the advice out there, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess. But they don\u2019t. Many consumers will never do any of these things, and scant few will do all of them all the time.</p> <p> Jake Braun, CEO of strategic security consultancy Cambridge Global Advisors, says moves by companies such as Apple, Google, and Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/15/apple-fbi-file-encryption-wwdc\">to encrypt data and communications</a> are a huge step in the right direction. When your data is encrypted, the bad guys can\u2019t get to it. (And, sometimes, neither can the good guys. That\u2019s why the US government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/29/fbi-apple-case-dropped-san-bernardino-iphone-far-from-over\">putting huge pressure on these companies</a> to relax their encryption standards to allow access by law enforcement \u2013 known colloquially as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/crypto-wars-governments-working-undermine-encryption\">the crypto wars</a>\u201d.)</p> <p> Braun is optimistic that as younger generations take over, they\u2019ll demand more secure versions of products from vendors. Still, he says, the scope of the problem is so large that more government intervention is needed.</p> <p> \u201cI think consumers should be putting more pressure on their elected officials to fund criminal investigation programs that more aggressively track down cyber criminals domestically and abroad,\u201d Braun says. \u201cFor example, the Homeland Security investigations unit investigates many types of cybercrime (most notably child pornography and online human trafficking that often targets unwitting children) but is embarrassingly underfunded.\u201d</p> <p> In his keynote, Kaminsky called for a federal agency devoted to security issues, similar to the National Institutes of Health, that can \u201ccreate engineering solutions to the real-world security problems that we have\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cIt can\u2019t just be two guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a pile of nerds to be able to work for on this 10 years.

  "<p>Given the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/suicide-squad\">comic book movies</a> are the feet of the geek colossus that now bestrides mainstream popular culture, combining author <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/george-rr-martin\">George RR Martin</a> with a new TV series about superheroes seems like a licence to print money.</p> <p>Though it sounds like the \u201cadd X to Y\u201d brainwave of a TV execs meeting, the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.wildcardsonline.com/\">Wild Cards</a> series has in fact been three decades in the making.</p> <p>Martin <a href=\"http://grrm.livejournal.com/\">announced on his blog at the weekend</a> that Universal Cable Productions has acquired the rights to the Wild Cards series of books, which he describes as \u201ca universe, as large and diverse and exciting as the comic book universes of Marvel and DC (though somewhat grittier, and considerably more realistic and more consistent), with an enormous cast of characters\u201d.</p> <p>The Wild Cards series debuted in 1986 \u2013 10 years before the Game of Thrones novel kicked off Martin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/nov/13/hooked-on-george-rr-martin\">A Song of Ice and Fire </a>series \u2013 and came at a time when superheroes didn\u2019t have the widespread cultural cachet they do now. It was, however, a time of great change in comics, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/16/alan-moore-watchmen-lost-girls\">Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019 Watchmen</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/zack-snyder-batman-v-superman-pays-homage-to-the-dark-knight-returns\">Frank Miller\u2019s The Dark Knight Returns</a> heralding a darker and grimmer chapter for masked vigilantes.</p> <p>Wild Cards both fed into this and veered away from it, joyfully mining the tropes of classic comic books and pulp fiction but attempting to inject them with a dose of logic and realism. But aside from the subject matter, the Wild Cards series was also innovative in its construction. Martin and his co-editor Melinda Snodgrass used a variety of big-name science fiction and fantasy authors to compile a shared universe that wasn\u2019t quite a short story anthology and not quite a collaborative piece but something in between \u2013 what they called a \u201cmosaic novel\u201d, with different stories featuring different characters written by different writers, but interlocking into a wider narrative.</p> <p>The high concept of the Wild Cards series was that at the height of the second world war an alien virus was unleashed on the world \u2013 initially over New York \u2013 which changed the course of history. Ninety percent of those exposed to the virus died instantly, but of those 10 in 100 who survived, nine were horribly disfigured \u2013 they drew the \u201cjoker\u201d, in the parlance of the series \u2013 while just 1% were dealt an \u201cace\u201d and gifted with comic-book-style superpowers.</p> <p>From this divergent point in the alternate history, Martin, Snodgrass and their legion of writers, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cadigan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Pat Cadigan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cheriepriest.com/\">Cherie Priest</a>, X-Men comic writer <a href=\"http://www.chrisclaremont.com/\">Chris Claremont</a> and the late <a href=\"http://www.georgerrmartin.com/about-george/friends/in-memoriam-roger-zelazny/\">Roger Zelazny</a>, crafted a cohesive world that has the magic of the comic books it echoes but none of the continuity issues gathered over several decades.</p> <p>As Martin points out, the Wild Cards universe is at least as populous as Westeros, giving the producers of the forthcoming TV adaptation a huge tapestry of stories to go at. The first volume in 1986 introduced Doctor Tachyon, a benign and extravagantly attired member of the alien race that unleashed the virus in 1941; the Great and Powerful Turtle, who used his telekinetic abilities to encase himself in a flying shell; Cap\u2019n Trips, who employed hallucinogenics to turn on to his super abilities; and Jetboy, a pulp-ish fighter ace who tried to save the world from the virus released over Manhattan.</p> <p>Alongside these Aces are the grotesque and deformed Jokers, forced into ghettos, subjected to bigotry and hatred and even becoming the subject of 1960s civil rights fights in the alternate reality of the Wild Cards timeline.</p> <p>As well as the books, Wild Cards has been adapted into comics (of course) and <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/Roleplayer/Roleplayer16/WildCards.html\">role-playing games</a> \u2013 indeed, the whole concept grew out of superhero RPG sessions played by Martin and Snodgrass \u2013 but will it work as a TV series?</p> <p>It seems difficult to see how it will fail. With Martin\u2019s name attached to it, it\u2019s certainly going to attract curious Game of Thrones fans, even if they have no familiarity with the source material. And despite some lukewarm reviews for the latest comic book movies, especially DC\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2\">Batman v Superman</a> and its newest release, Suicide Squad, the public\u2019s appetite for celluloid superheroes seems to continue unabated.</p> <p>Wild Cards also has the benefit of a fanbase that\u2019s been growing for 30 years \u2013 there are now 22 books \u2013 and a concerted effort from the outset to keep tight control over continuity, meaning the TV producers won\u2019t have to wade through decades of comics history to work out how to fit the disparate elements all together.</p> <p>Add to all that, Wild Cards is actually great. There have been many attempts over the past few years to answer the question: \u201cWhat if superheroes existed in the real world?\u201d But this series gives it a better shot than pretty much anything else. Wild Cards seems such an obvious choice for TV adaptation that the only real surprise in George RR Martin\u2019s announcement is why it\u2019s taken so long.</p>",

The reaction from the remaining grant-maintained schools was to enter candidates in all Lincoln county division elections under the slogan \u201cSay NO to secondary moderns\u201d. The result was that most seats in Greater Lincoln turned Labour or Lib Dem and, for the first and only time since the council was formed in 1974, the Tories were consigned to the opposition benches.</p> <p>If you introduce grammar schools you convert all the rest into secondary moderns, which is, in effect, what you have today in the rest of the county, where selection at 11-plus still occurs.

What it actually signifies is that Theresa May\u2019s talk about reducing inequality is yet more Tory rhetoric; her determination to display compassionate Conservatism is simply political posturing.</p> <p>To return state education to the days of selection, when it means that up to 80% of 11-year-olds, mostly from poor backgrounds, are denied access to an education designed to suit the needs of a privileged few, is doing the exact opposite of creating \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d. May might well believe in the grammar school mythology, but there are thousands of us, who experienced first-hand the divisiveness of the system and its appalling unfairness and inefficiency, willing to testify otherwise. It\u2019s a myth that needs debunking once and for all.<br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 As our current education system is already geared towards those who are going to pass exams, instead of more grammar schools we need more technical education, not just for the non-academic but for all children if we are to catch up with our major competitors in a global economy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/technical-education-has-always-been-a-poor-relation\">Letters</a>, 8 August).</p> <p>Comprehensives were originally intended to provide this but the resources were never really put in, just as we had a dearth of technical schools under the 11-plus system.<br><strong>Margaret Phelps</strong><br><em>Penarth, Glamorgan</em></p> <p>\u2022 Is it too simplistic to suggest that the majority of grammar school places should go to those children who have attended local state primary schools? In my limited experience of the system, all too often children have been \u201chothoused\u201d in the private sector and many of them are not local to the area. To grant significantly more places to able children from the local state system would, in one step, be a pointer in the right direction to social mobility.<br><strong>Elisabeth Smith</strong><br><em>Cheltenham</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the heyday of grammar schools only 2% of pupils from a skilled manual background and 1% from an unskilled background went to university. <a href=\"http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/robbins/robbins1963.html\">The Robbins report</a> of 1964 stated that although 26% of children were from unskilled backgrounds, just 0.3% of those got two or more A-levels at grammar schools.</p> <p>In 2015 only 2.6% of grammar pupils were entitled to free school meals, compared with 14.9% in all schools; 40% of their pupils came from the least deprived quartile against 25% in all schools, and 8% were from the most deprived quartile compared with 20% in all schools. 91% of grammar pupils had achieved above Level 4 at the end of primary school, compared with 33% in comprehensive schools.</p> <p>Selection led to social segregation being so unpopular by the 1960s that both major political parties were happy to abolish it. Middle-class parents who believed grammar schools were theirs were incensed that their children were not selected. Theresa May hides her belief that middle-class parents have a right to grammar schools by claiming that they promote social mobility, and includes a few places for the disadvantaged to give the illusion that she is making education work for the many and not just the few.<br><strong>John Gaskin</strong><br><em>Drifield</em></p> <p>\u2022 The first time I ever remember being under real pressure was in my last year of primary school. I must have been 10. At assembly my headmaster told us we were to face the most important day of our lives: the 11-plus, an exam that would effectively mean the smartest kids in the school would go onto receive an incredibly good and free education. Failure was not an option.</p> <p>I went on to pass that exam and got accepted into Rochester Grammar School for Girls \u2013 now one of the top performing state schools in the country. My older brother, who failed the exam, went on to attend one of the worst schools in the region. I sailed through school by having access to some quite brilliant teachers. It was world-class education which saw me accepted into the University of Birmingham to study economics. My brother left school at 16 with handful of exams and the offer of a job at the local council.</p> <p>The Conservatives would argue this is as it should be. But what about the kids like my brother who failed the exam? Despite his terrible education, my brother worked his way up through the local authority, passed his accountancy exams and went onto study an MBA.</p> <p>But he\u2019s probably about five years behind where other university-educated peers are in their careers because he ended up at a terrible school which didn\u2019t offer the classics or spot his potential.</p> <p>A grammar school system is fundamentally unfair. A great education should be available for British every child, not just one who happens to pass an exam when they are 10 years old.<br><strong>Julia Timms</strong><br><em>Senior media advisor, The George Institute for Global Health, Sydney</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Enough is enough. No more driver led operations.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said that the months of disruption preceding the strike were because a \u201cbasket case\u201d company was unable to run a functioning train service. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat is not related to the dispute.

It\u2019s also important that each employee knows who they should report to if they do experience disruption, she adds.</p> <p>There\u2019s not much employers who are left out of pocket by industrial action can do to recoup the costs, says Limbin-Glassey: instead, their focus should be on making arrangements so that there\u2019s as little disruption to the business as possible. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a89dcce4b0f5d06484180b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T15:01:33.383Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The TUC leader has tweeted her support for the industrial action:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/762637076835799040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Southern?src=hash\">#Southern</a> is an utter mess.

Management seem to forget or wilfully ignore that their passengers are human beings having to deal with their utter incompetence.</p> <p>I fully support the strike action that the RMT are taking, despite the impact to my day to day life.

They are trying to modernise their service, the RMT seem to want to keep things exactly as they are, they are not interested in innovation or the enhancement of services through technology. They are the ones causing a nightmare for commuters. Why don\u2019t we let Southern go ahead with their plans and if the service is still poor, then look at removing them.</p> <p>It is not the RMT\u2019s place to say what they think is safe and what isn\u2019t. We have rail regulators for that. Southern Rail have been given permission to make these staff contract changes, and should be allowed to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T14:08:38.808Z\">at 3.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a88c6ae4b03b51a99e1135\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alice-ross\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T13:51:12.999Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It appears that Labour and the Lib Dems are lining up behind the RMT in their responses to the Southern rail strike, according to comments obtained from the parties by my colleague <strong>Alice Ross</strong>. </p> <p>Andy McDonald, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week Govia Thameslink Railway GTR rejected the RMT\u2019s offer to settle a dispute over conductors\u2019 roles on the same basis that a similar dispute was settled earlier in the week at ScotRail. It has become increasingly clear that the barrier to resolving the Southern-GTR dispute is the Tory Government. </p> <p>The basis for an agreement is there and both sides need to get back round the table \u2013 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s extremely concerning that a senior civil servant from the Department for Transport is on the record as saying that the Department wants to \u2018break\u2019 rail employees and make them \u2018get the hell out of my industry\u2019.</p> <p>The country\u2019s biggest rail franchise is failing. Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25%, and promised investment looks further away than ever, yet Chris Grayling and his officials seem more interested in pursuing an ideological dust-up with rail unions than improving abysmal passenger services.</p> <p>We have a train operating company unable to make their trains run on time and a Government prioritising a battle with trade unions over fixing a failing franchise, and it is the tens of thousands of passengers having to endure miserable services who are paying the price.</p> </blockquote> <p>The comments mentioned by McDonald appear to be from a <a href=\"http://www.private-eye.co.uk/\">Private Eye</a> story quoting a senior Department for Transport official, Peter Wilkinson. That story, like much of Private Eye\u2019s content, doesn\u2019t appear to be online, but <a href=\"https://insidecroydon.com/2016/06/15/southern-failways-civil-servant-wants-to-break-rail-unions/\">the Inside Croydon blog has written about it</a>. Wilkinson, who is the DfT\u2019s managing director of passenger services, is quoted as saying of the strike: \u201cI\u2019m furious about it and it has got to change \u2013 we have got to break them.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jenny Randerson, Liberal Democrat Transport spokesperson, has said accused the government of turning a blind eye to customers\u2019 ordeals. She said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation with Southern is a total mess. People are being left completely stranded. Some even lost jobs before the strikes because of the poor service, whilst home life is being ruined.</p> <p>As a member of the Cabinet, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has constituents being directly affected in Hastings and can only criticise the unions; the Government has to take control of this situation. It has the power to impose terms and conditions on franchises and is turning a blind eye to the suffering of high paying customers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a88c04e4b0f5d06484179a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T13:42:11.208Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As ever, Twitter has proven a popular forum for commuters who want to vent their frustration at the service provided by Southern rail during the first day of this week\u2019s strike action. </p> <p>According to media monitors Visibrain, there were more than 12,670 tweets mentioning Southern Rail by about 2pm this afternoon, while the hashtag #southernstrike had been used 3,815 times. </p> <p>The only surprising statistic is that there had only been 560 tweets in support of the strike. This didn\u2019t seem to tally with the number that I\u2019d seen scrolling by as I scanned the hashtag, so I asked Visibrain why they had registered so few. Georgina Parsons, head of UK communications at Visibrain, told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We obtained this statistic by filtering on all tweets containing the words \u201csolidarity\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d, \u201csupporting\u201d, \u201cstand with\u201d, or \u201cbehind\u201d.

For many it is the culmination of months of poor service from the operator. </p> <h2>\u201cOn my line 100% of trains were cancelled\u201d</h2> <p>Simon Foulkes travels on the Southern service between Appledore to Ashford to access the high speed service to London. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Southern say they have reduced trains in an amended timetable to 80% service, on my line the number of trains in commuting periods was reduced by 50%. When they say the strike will cut 40% of services, on my line 100% of trains are cancelled.</p> <p>My local MP took weeks to respond to me on the issue, ignored several follow up emails, and declines to meet me in Westminster where I work. I\u2019d like to see the Tory MPs whose constituents are affected by this issue acting together to cut through the intransigence, and to address the background fact that the DfT is driving the dispute.</p> </blockquote> <h2>\u201cPeople were stood on the toilets just to have space to stand\u201d</h2> <p>A commuter from Lewes, who asked to remain anonymous, reports months of delays and cancellations. He is worried about the impact this is having on his job: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wanted to get into the office today for some important meetings, and having started my job relatively recently not wanting to have the strike disrupt the progress I\u2019ve made. For all employers can be sympathetic there is a responsibility for employees to ensure they can get to work too. In my 14 weeks in this job this is the third extended strike, which on top of the regular cancellations and delays could easily be giving people the impression I\u2019m unreliable.</p> <p>The only way for me to get to work on time was to catch a bus at my own expense to Brighton, and catch an over-crowded train from there, changing twice. What is normally a journey of an hour taking me twice as long. Already I\u2019ve had to cancel a meeting later this week because changes to the bus service mean I can\u2019t get to Brighton at a time where I can get a train getting me to London before 8.30. Relying on public transport has become impossible.</p> <p>This is all on top of months of delays, cancellations and short formed trains. One day last week we had a 12 coach train reduced to 4 coaches. People were stood on the toilets with others crammed into the cubicle around them just to have space to stand. This is without the air conditioning working properly too. The week before that a woman collapsed on the train and I\u2019ve seen people get off early en-route overcome with the heat and crowding.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T15:36:36.745Z\">at 4.36pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a87ae8e4b03b51a99e10d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T12:46:54.642Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Anger at Southern Rail is still simmering as we await the next bout of commuter chaos, forecast for home-time rush hour today.

David Leam \u2013 infrastructure director at London First, a lobby group for the capital\u2019s businesses \u2013 has used <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/08/the-rmts-southern-rail-strike-is-ludicrous-shameless-and-wrong/\">an article in the Telegraph</a> to describe the conductors\u2019 withdrawal of their labour as \u201cludicrous, shameless and wrong\u201d. He writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The underlying issue here is the prevalence of outdated working practices, which contribute to the high-cost culture of Britain\u2019s railways. While Britain\u2019s railways have been tremendously successful in attracting new passengers they have been much less so at improving their efficiency. Government studies have identified a 40% efficiency gap when comparing our railway against other European countries, requiring passengers and taxpayers to pick up the bill.</p> <p>Reviewing the various assurances and commitments made to the workforce by the train operator and government dispels any notion that the employer is being too hot-headed. Rather it raises the question whether government is, in fact, being too timid. Is it really sustainable to go so far in addressing the concerns of a party that appears dead set against a reasonable negotiated outcome?</p> <p>Workers in all walks of life need to adapt and change as new technologies emerge. Modern trains no more need a guard to close doors than they need a fireman to shovel coal or be preceded by a man with a red flag to alert fearful passersby.

Wake up early and see that it is not running. Go back to bed for a bit wake up to feed baby and then head for the 07:11 from Redhill to Victoria. Wait for 07:11 with friend from Earlswood as there are no trains from this station all week.</p> <p>07:11 is absolutely packed, have one free hand to write. A couple travelling in together are split as one gets on but the other can\u2019t fit on. Thirty-eight minutes is going to feel a very, very long time before I get off. Worse than a normal strike day (been three so far) as people can\u2019t work from home as five days of it. A lot more busy than usual. Rumours that last train home is 18:35 so best check throughout the day.<br></p> <p><strong>Kate Hayes, 55, from Nutfield</strong></p> <p>As the Tonbridge line is shut completely during the strike this week, I rely on my husband to get me to Redhill. </p> <p>0648 from Redhill to Victoria disappeared off the app overnight so husband got an extra 30 mins in bed. Drove me to Redhill where I caught the 0720 (pretty well on time), busy but not overly crowded. No seat though - but am lucky enough to get one at East Croydon.</p> <p>0752: I am being held at Clapham Junction - stuck behind a train in front which has an \u201c\u2019issue\u201d. People getting off if they can use Waterloo or \u201cif they are in a hurry\u201d! The train in front is apparently broken down, so now all of us are told to get off - and now stay on...!

  "<p>Police Scotland has been ordered to pay a journalist \u00a310,000 in damages after it illegally intercepted his communications data in an investigation into a botched murder case.<br></p> <p>The investigatory powers tribunal <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ipt-uk.com/judgments.asp\">ruled</a> the force had breached the human rights of Gerard Gallacher, a former police officer turned freelance journalist, who had spent 18 months investigating a cold murder case in which a prime suspect had been released without charge.</p> <p>Gallacher said he suffered \u201cinvasion of privacy, familial strife, personal stress and strain and loss of long-standing friendships\u201d after detectives accessed 32 days of his communications data, ignoring clear court rulings to protect journalists and their sources.<br></p> <p>Police Scotland had been braced for an adverse ruling after Sir Stanley Burnton, the communications interception commissioner, ruled last November that the force had been reckless in its repeated abuse of its powers.</p> <p>Detectives in an elite anti-corruption unit <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/police-scotland-criticised-for-breaching-law-to-spy-on-journalists-sources\">breached the law five times</a> when they collected phone records for Gallacher and two police officers suspected of leaking information, Burnton said.</p> <p>In its ruling on Monday on the cases of the six people affected \u2013 Gerard Gallacher and his wife Marjorie, the two officers David Moran and Steven Adams and a former officer and his wife named only as Mr and Mrs O \u2013 the tribunal agreed that the collection of their data breached the Human Rights Act and the European convention on human rights.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Only Gallacher sought damages from the tribunal, and he was awarded \u00a310,000 for stress and loss of earnings. </p> <p>The hearing focused on Gallacher\u2019s investigation into the unsolved murder of Emma Caldwell in woods 40 miles from Glasgow in 2005, which sparked a huge police inquiry. </p> <p>Four Turkish men were arrested after an operation involving police from several countries and covert surveillance, but the trial collapsed after prosecutors realised the evidence against them was flawed. </p> <p>In 2013 Gallacher discovered that officers involved in the original case were upset that another suspect, who had admitted having sex with Caldwell in the same woods on numerous occasions, was allowed to go free without being charged seven months before the Turkish men were arrested.</p> <p>The Sunday Mail then ran a series of articles on the case based on Gallacher\u2019s investigations over three successive weekends in May 2015. Prosecutors ordered Police Scotland to reopen the case, and the anti-corruption unit secretly opened its own parallel investigation into whether serving or former police officers had leaked intelligence to Gallacher.</p> <p>The tribunal stated that the detectives involved were told explicitly by a Police Scotland specialist that they needed a judge\u2019s approval to bug a journalist or intercept their data, but the advice was ignored. </p> <p>In its ruling, the tribunal said the force also failed to assess whether seeking the data was proportional. It had \u201cno coherent view as to what, if any, crime might have been committed by any person\u201d and had no intelligence that one claimant had leaked the material to Gallacher or had even had access to it. </p> <p>Deputy chief constable Iain Livingstone said the force had already ordered an external review into the affair by Mike Barton, the head of Durham constabulary.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The active investigation limited what he could say, Livingstone said, but he added that there had already been two reviews, both internally and by the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary Scotland, to ensure such breaches did not reoccur. \u201cPolice Scotland has fully accepted that standards fell below those required in this case,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Moran said he was critical of the limited scope of Barton\u2019s enquiry, because it did not cover criminal misconduct by the officers involved. The tribunal evidence made clear that every element of the case needed to be independently and impartially investigated, he said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cNobody, including myself, knows the full detail of what happened, the level it reached within Police Scotland and who exactly caused officers to break the laws and codes governing the interception of communications,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil that is fully established then, in my opinion, no assumption should be made that criminality was not involved.\u201d <br></p> <p>David Kennedy, the deputy general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said: \u201cThis judgment leaves no doubt that the actions of the Police Service of Scotland towards our members [and others] breached their human rights. The SPF had no hesitation in supporting our members in seeking remedy for this breach, and we sincerely hope the service will reflect on this ruling when considering their future actions.\u201d<br></p> <p>Paul Holleran, the Scottish regional secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said: \u201cThe police have been riding roughshod over people\u2019s rights and we want an end to that. We welcome the recognition that their behaviour was out of order. Hopefully this will be a lesson learned.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Former CIA agent Evan McMullin \u2013 who launched an improbable independent bid for president on Monday in the hope of providing a conservative alternative to Donald Trump \u2013 faces significant hurdles in becoming a credible threat to the Republican nominee.</p> <p>A relative unknown even in Washington, McMullin filed the paperwork on Monday for a third-party run against Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But he now has to navigate intricate rules to secure a place on individual state presidential ballots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">Republican Evan McMullin to launch presidential run against Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And therein lies McMullin\u2019s key problem: he has already missed the deadline to appear on the ballot in half of America\u2019s 50 states, and he is unlikely to meet a deadline of less than 48 hours, on 10 August, to get on the ballot in seven more.</p> <p>In order to secure a place on the ballot where the deadline has passed, McMullin would have to file and win lawsuits in states he chooses to pursue. And even in states where time for ballot access remains, McMullin would have to secure the requisite number of signatures, which varies by state and as a matter of process requires both money and organization on the ground.</p> <p>Those helping McMullin with his long-shot candidacy insist they have donors on their side, citing the trend of high-dollar fundraisers sitting on the sidelines rather than backing Trump. </p> <p>But many influential Republicans also believe the Never Trump movement missed its opportunity to put forward a meaningful challenge to the former reality TV star ahead of the Republican national convention in Cleveland last month, where Trump formally accepted the party\u2019s nomination for president.<br><br>That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a strategy behind the last-ditch effort to introduce McMullin to a dissatisfied electorate. The former House Republican staffer is a Mormon and native of Utah, a state that has remained reliably in the GOP\u2019s column but could prove a toss-up this November.</p> <p>Mormons dominate Utah \u2013 where candidates can still put their names forward until 31 August \u2013 and handed Trump one of his worst losses in the Republican presidential primary in June.

Catching five birds to put satellite tags on them was a heroic endeavour because these notoriously shy animals are crepuscular feeders, running across fields at dusk, huge eyes angled downwards in search of beetles to eat. But Hawkes managed it, and his satellite data is revealing. It shows that birds travel farther from their nest sites than previously realised, and in the Brecks one location is particularly attractive: pig farms.</p> <p>The rise in outdoor pig farming in this area helps the birds find plenty of beetles in pig muck. It\u2019s obvious that most conservation in a heavily farmed country depends on farmers.

Farmers are compensated if they sacrifice a hectare of arable field for a stone curlew nest plot. But the RSPB says it is struggling to persuade more farmers to create such spaces because it is not clear whether they will be funded after Brexit. Farmers need to plan ahead, which is why the government must establish how it will support post-Brexit farming sooner rather than later.</p> <h2><strong>Not so dirty rat</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e138f4cb1c0bff2ef42ae705768be615df13cfa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e138f4cb1c0bff2ef42ae705768be615df13cfa2/0_174_5320_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atlantic puffin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pest control to protect puffins is putting the endangered black rat at risk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plummeting numbers of a grass-devouring pest, the rabbit, are also causing problems for the stone curlew in Breckland because the bird\u2019s traditional heathland habitat is becoming too overgrown.

Ian Pollock, the school\u2019s director of sport, asked Peaty for the memento after he won Commonwealth gold at the Glasgow games two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cHe was in the pool and I shouted down to Mel to ask him for a hat for the wall,\u201d Pollock recalls. \u201cAdam literally took that hat off his head in the middle of a training session.

But it wasn\u2019t always that way. His parents have told how his fear of water led to tears at bath time and a loud refusal to get into the pool as he climbed up his mother Caroline\u2019s arms.<br></p> <p>It was, Pilcher says, a twist of fate that brought Peaty to Marshall\u2019s attention: \u201cMel was looking at this other swimmer, a 14-year-old lad, at Dove Valley swimming club \u2013 but he wouldn\u2019t go [training with Mel] unless he could take a friend to Derby. And that friend was Adam Peaty.\u201d<br></p> <p>And despite his world-beating breaststroke, Peaty\u2019s front crawl wasn\u2019t actually very good for a 14-year-old, Pilcher says: \u201cMel tells me she put him in one of the lower lanes with younger girls when he first arrived.\u201d<br></p> <p>Steve Layton, the City of Derby swimming club secretary, has known Peaty since 2009. He has \u201cself-belief like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Layton says, and a \u201cvery calming demeanour\u201d that inspires not only his teammates but also the younger teenagers with whom he shares a pool.<br></p> <p>The club has several future stars on its books, including teenagers Ellie Baldwin, Sarah Vasey, Harriet Cooper and 14-year-old Greg Butler, who is currently the country\u2019s top breaststroker in his age group and whom Pilcher said \u201ccould be the next Adam Peaty\u201d.<br></p> <p>But there are uncertain times ahead for swimming in Derby. Three pools in the east Midlands city <a href=\"http://www.uttoxeteradvertiser.co.uk/future-swimming-derby-adam-peaty-trained-risk/story-28679344-detail/story.html\">have closed in the last year</a> due to cuts in council funding, meaning the club has had to train outside the city \u2013 some nine and 10-year-olds training 40 minutes away in Loughborough late on Friday evenings.<br></p> <p>\u201cFor an Olympic year we\u2019ve been very strained. It\u2019s been very difficult,\u201d says Pilcher. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to form good grassroots at the club and we don\u2019t want that to be tarnished.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Peaty, his sights are now set on Friday\u2019s 4x100m medley relay and potentially another gold medal for Team GB. There will be a major party in Uttoxeter when their local hero returns from Rio \u2013 and it won\u2019t just be at his nan\u2019s house.<br></p>",

The shooting of bears from a plane or helicopter will also be restricted. However, subsistence hunting by indigenous communities will still be allowed.</p> <p>Alaska reinforced the trapping and shooting of predator animals after the Republican senator Frank Murkowski was elected as governor in 2002. </p> <p>His successors, including Sarah Palin, have all supported a policy of \u201cintensive management\u201d that removes wolves and bears with the goal of boosting moose and caribou numbers for hunters. This stance has led to significant numbers of bears and wolves being killed if they wander away from national park land. </p> <p>But the state has repeatedly clashed with the FWS, which has now decided to clamp down on hunting on federal land.

  "<p>On March 26 this year, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3539363/Scientist-EasyJet-hauled-London-bound-flight-terror-fears.html\">Hasan Aldewachi</a> was on his way back from a science conference in Vienna, and looking forward to seeing his family. As he took his seat on the flight to Gatwick, he sent his wife a text message to let her know the plane was delayed. A woman sitting across the aisle got up and left her seat. Moments later the police arrived.</p> <p>The Iraqi-born Sheffield Hallam student was asked to leave the plane and held for four hours. After his phone was confiscated, he was left at the airport with no onward ticket or refund. The reason? His message was in Arabic.</p> <p>Aldewachi\u2019s story is just one example of the dangers of what has become known as \u201cflying while Muslim\u201d; the tongue-in-cheek term for the discrimination many Muslim passengers feel they have faced at airports since 9/11. It can range from extra questions from airport staff, to formal searches by police, to secondary security screenings and visa problems when visiting America. Sometimes it feels like every Muslim has a tale to tell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bfba30c63f98e2556e9ea8e62c395de27cd20fd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfba30c63f98e2556e9ea8e62c395de27cd20fd7/0_34_1220_732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faizah Shaheen \u2026 reading about Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faizah Shaheen \u2026 reading about Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two weeks ago, a Muslim couple celebrating their wedding anniversary were <a href=\"http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/08/04/muslim-group-announce-profiling-complaint-against-delta/88063364/\">removed from a flight from France to the US</a>. A crew member allegedly complained that Nazia Ali, 34, who wears a headscarf, was using her phone, and her husband Faisal was sweating. The flight attendant allegedly also complained that the couple used the word \u201cAllah\u201d. The airline in question subsequently said it was \u201cdeeply committed to treating all of our customers with respect\u201d.</p> <p>Other examples this summer include NHS mental-health worker Faizah Shaheen who was on her way back from her honeymoon when she was detained and questioned by police under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. Cabin crew on her outbound flight said they had spotted her reading a book about Syria. Shaheen said she was left in tears by the experience. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-muslim-woman-detained-terror-laws-syrian-art-book-plane-cabin-crew-faizah-shaheen-a7168751.html\">Thomson airlines said:</a> \u201cOur crew are trained to report any concerns they may have as a precaution.\u201d</p> <p>The stories that hit the headlines are often those similar to Aldewachi\u2019s or Shaheen\u2019s \u2013 where normal behaviour by Muslim passengers is seen as suspicious. More prevalent, but less reported, are the day-to-day stories of innocent passengers who feel they are under suspicion solely because of their religion.</p> <p>Equality and civil liberties groups warn that the net is now being thrown so wide that it is stigmatising and alienating thousands of Muslims.

In April, the 26-year-old was on his way back to his university in California when he phoned his uncle in Iraq to tell him he had been invited to a formal dinner at which Ban Ki-moon would be present \u2013 he even asked the UN secretary general a question. A woman in front of him reported him and Makhzoomi <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/17/us/southwest-muslim-passenger-removed/\">was asked to leave the plane</a>, confronted by police officers, and had his bag searched in front of other passengers.

However, the airline, Southwest, released a statement saying it was the content of his words that was \u201cperceived to be threatening,\u201d not his use of Arabic.</p> <p>In March, a London DJ, Mehary Yemane-Tesfagiorgis, was removed from a flight from Rome because a passenger said they didn\u2019t feel safe travelling with him.

As Handeyside points out, Dearborne is \u201cthe centre of the highest concentration of people of Arab descent outside the Middle East\u201d. The use of algorithms to determine who required extra screening renders the system even more opaque.</p> <p>The attorney, who spent two years working for the CIA, says the huge numbers involved mean the watchlists are not making us safer. \u201cIt increases the size of the haystack \u2013 if there is a needle in there it is so much harder to find \u2026 it immeasurably increases the white noise.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/23/no-fly-list-operates-in-secret-power-to-exclude\">The 'No Fly List' operates in secret, and its power to exclude is vast | Jeffrey Kahn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For cases of mistaken identity, there is a redress system.

The stigma of being accused of being a terrorist, even if the accusations are unwarranted, can be enough to silence many. Others fear a backlash from the authorities.</p> <p>Handeyside says those who easily dismiss such experiences don\u2019t always realise the toll it can take. \u201cWe can\u2019t underestimate how stigmatising and unpleasant it is to have to go through this every single time \u2013 to have everyone looking at you and thinking you are a terrorist.\u201d</p> <p>Imam Ajmal Masroor, was so incensed by his own treatment at an airport that he set up a website to collate other people\u2019s stories. Having travelling to and from the States several times in 2015, he was stopped by US Embassy officials at the airport in December and abruptly told his business visa had been revoked.</p> <p>Masroor, 44, who says he has received death threats for speaking out against terrorism in the past, explains he was eventually told the problem was someone on his Facebook page, \u201cbut I have 30,000 followers so I don\u2019t know who that is\u201d. And despite a letter from the State Department saying the revocation was an error, he says visits to the US embassy have not rectified the situation.</p> <p>One politician trying to discover the scale of the problem is the MP Stella Creasy. She has been asking questions about US Homeland Security issues after a family of 11 from her Walthamstow constituency were stopped at the airport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/22/us-stops-british-muslim-family-flight-disneyland-david-cameron\">as they made their way to Disneyland</a>. The family lost $13,340 by missing their flights, which they were told would not be refunded. The trauma is, of course, impossible to quantify. \u201cTheir Esta visa was revoked.

A year earlier, the Scottish MSP Humza Yousaf revealed he had been been stopped under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. It wasn\u2019t the first time he was stopped.</p> <p>Under the original legislation of this stop-and-search law act, anyone entering or leaving the UK could be held for up to nine hours with no grounds for suspicion needed. At its peak in 2009/10, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/19/david-miranda-ruling-throws-new-light-on-schedule-7-powers\">85,000 travellers a year</a> were stopped and ethnic minorities were 42 times more likely to be stopped than white passengers.</p> <p>Yousaf said his frequent stops illustrated that they were based on skin colour, not intelligence information.</p> <p>In 2014, after strong criticism, there was a change in the law referring to schedule 7 stops. The presence of a solicitor was required and the maximum detention time was reduced to six hours. It led to a dramatic drop in those stopped. The latest available data shows a considerably lower number \u2013 in 2015, a fall of 21% on the previous year. David Anderson, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, says this, in part, is down to an increased focus on data and behavioural analysis and a \u201creduced reliance on intuitive stops\u201d. Anderson does not believe the statistics show schedule 7 powers are being used in a racially discriminatory manner, although he acknowledges the stops cause \u201cconsiderable irritation for travellers of all ethnicities\u201d while \u201carrest rates remain very low indeed by the standards of stop and search\u201d. Five supreme court judges reviewed his analysis and while four agreed, one believed \u201cschedule 7 not only permits direct discrimination; it is entirely at odds with the notion of an enlightened pluralistic society\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e13cb2528bdd0d22186ec93bd74ccfe395eb0d85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e13cb2528bdd0d22186ec93bd74ccfe395eb0d85/320_328_878_878/500.jpg\" alt=\"Text with care\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Text with care.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Son of Alan/Folio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0012016-schedule-7-to-the-terrorism-act-2000/circular-0012016-schedule-7-to-the-terrorism-act-2000\">government published new guidance</a> pointing out that the decision to stop someone should not be arbitrary, and ethnicity and religion should only be considered significant in association with \u201cfactors which show a connection with the threat from terrorism\u201d. According to <a href=\"http://faith-matters.org/2016/05/18/numbers-counter-terrorism-powers-disproportionately-affect-ethnic-religious-minorities-britain/\">analysis of the 2015 figures by Faith Matters</a>, a community-cohesion organisation, \u201cnon-whites are at least 37 times as likely as a white person to be detained at a port or airport. Asians are almost 80 times as likely as a white person to be detained at an airport or port.\u201d Along with anecdotal evidence, this, they say, shows a \u201csignificant level of profiling that demands urgent action to ensure that British citizens and non-UK nationals visiting Britain are treated equally.\u201d</p> <p>Stefano Bonino, <a href=\"https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/b/stefano-bonino\">a criminologist at Northumbria University</a> recently, interviewed 39 Scottish Muslims. He found while most had positive stories of \u201crelative local harmony\u201d, his interviewees\u2019 experience of airports created real feelings of alienation, social inequality, \u201canger and humiliation\u201d.</p> <p>Philip Baum, author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/violence-in-the-skies.html\">Violence in the Skies</a>, says racial profiling is unhelpful, but says there should be more behavioural analysis at airports than we have currently. \u201cEven if an attack is being carried out under Isis or al-Qaeda that doesn\u2019t mean it will be someone carrying it out who \u2018looks\u2019 Muslim. The <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/maximum-screen-time-443898?rm=eu\">classic case was the Anne Marie Murphy case in 1986</a>, who was stopped from boarding a flight to Tel Aviv \u2013 of 1986. She was white, female and pregnant \u2013 not a stereotypical image of a terrorist.\u201d Murphy was found to be unwittingly carrying explosives in her luggage \u2013 placed there by her Jordanian fianc\u00e9, Nezar Hindawi, who was jailed for 45 years.</p> <p>Baum suggests that the widespread belief that Muslims will be targeted could in turn change their behaviour. \u201cThere is a lot of paranoia and sometimes people can be affected by that \u2013 they act suspiciously because they think they will be picked on.\u201d</p> <p>While the fear of terrorism at airports means that many people are willing to put up with more intrusive security procedures, the discriminatory experiences at airports that many Muslims recount risks creating divisions and resentment.</p> <p>For Bonino the consequences are clear. \u201cGrievance based jihadi propaganda can use things like this. When you want Muslims to work with the authorities to counter violent extremism on the ground, it\u2019s not helpful for people to think they are targeted by the authorities themselves.\u201d</p> <h2>Know your rights<br></h2> <p><em>The </em><a href=\"http://www.cair.com/\"><em>Council of American Islamic Relations</em></a><em> guide to your rights</em></p> <p>\u2022 A customs agent has the right to stop, detain and search every person and item.</p> <p>\u2022 Screeners have the authority to conduct a further search of you or your bags.</p> <p>\u2022 A pilot has the right to refuse to fly a passenger they believe is a threat to the safety of the flight.

  "<p>Give the grown-ups back control of the Labour party. Wasn\u2019t that supposed to be the idea? Yet with each fresh turn of events, the coup against Jeremy Corbyn looks less like an adult intervention, and more like a slapstick farce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">Labour to appeal against high court leadership ballot decision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First the party establishment tried to overturn the result of a leadership election held just eight months earlier by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/29/labour-mps-vs-corbyn-war-party-members-tories-brexit\" title=\"\">resigning en masse</a> to make Corbyn\u2019s position untenable. When this failed, they sought to exclude him from the leadership ballot, in a disingenuous attempt to circumvent rules that were perfectly clear on his right to stand. When this was unsuccessful, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/labour-leadership-courts-millionaire-donor\" title=\"\">millionaire party donor</a> tried to challenge the decision in the high court, which also failed. Today, in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\" title=\"\">second legal defeat</a>, a high court judge has struck down an attempt by the party\u2019s national executive to stop 130,000 of Labour\u2019s newest members, thought to be mostly Corbyn supporters, from voting in the coming leadership election.</p> <p>Meanwhile, apparently having no plan for what to do if Corbyn simply pointed to his mandate and refused to resign, MPs dithered for over a fortnight before producing an alternative party leader. They then found themselves with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-36828082\" title=\"\">two rival \u201cunity candidates\u201d</a> \u2013 Angela Eagle and Owen Smith \u2013 before Eagle dropped out just eight days after a cringe-inducing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbpPaFZmQic\" title=\"\">car crash of a campaign launch</a>. We are now into the seventh week of a spectacle which, altogether, has not exactly been a showcase of managerial competence from the self-styled party \u201cmoderates\u201d.</p> <p>Nor have the last few weeks been a great advert for the Labour establishment\u2019s election-winning skills. A basic principle of electability, whether the battleground is the party selectorate or the national electorate, is that one should avoid antagonising the very people whose votes you need to win. Yet the party executive now plans to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/762616778912571392\" title=\"\">waste members\u2019 money</a> appealing against today\u2019s court decision, in the hope of disenfranchising tens of thousands of those same members. This will hardly endear the membership to MPs and party bosses who owe their lucrative careers to the donations and voluntary labour of the party rank-and-file. And it will clearly rebound to damaging effect on the party establishment\u2019s candidate, Smith.</p> <p>The mantra of Corbyn\u2019s opponents is that the party needs to provide effective opposition to the government, yet here again their incompetence is glaring. The Brexit vote, especially its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29a7964c-3953-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7\" title=\"\">calamitous economic effects</a>, provided a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do lasting damage to the Conservative brand, and raise the chances of a future Labour victory under whichever leadership. The immediate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/brexit-crash-pound-living-standards-george-soros\" title=\"\">crash in the value of the pound</a> and the longer-term damage to the British economy is arguably worse than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\" title=\"\">1992\u2019s Black Wednesday</a>, and should have been hung around the necks of the Tories from the moment the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/24/global-markets-ftse-pound-uk-leave-eu-brexit-live-updates\" title=\"\">markets tumbled after the result came in</a>.</p> <p>Voters should be reminded constantly that the pound in their pocket is now worth considerably less thanks to ministers who either campaigned for a leave vote, failed to plan for it, or both. Conservative responsibility for every ounce of economic pain to be felt in the coming years must be seared into the public consciousness. This one-off opportunity has been squandered so far, simply because the geniuses of New Labour didn\u2019t have the strategic sense to sequence their moves, and wait for the next opportunity to depose Corbyn.</p> <p>Of course, Labour\u2019s civil war is rooted not in questions of competence but in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/labour-battle-blairites-corbynistas-conservatives-progressives\" title=\"\">fundamental political differences</a> between the two opposite wings of the party \u2013 differences which are probably irreconcilable. Corbyn is the clear odds-on favourite to win, not because his leadership operation is a shining example of professionalism, but because \u2013 for now at least \u2013 he is the only available champion for the basic political principles shared by most party members.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s pitch, of Corbynite policies plus effective leadership, was a smart one in this context, but it is likely to fail for two reasons. First, no one seriously believes that Smith came into politics to overturn the neoliberal consensus. Second, it is clear that a Smith victory would return the party to the ownership of its previous managerial class. The shenanigans in the courts this week are a symbol of why, for most Labour members, a return to the status quo ante is now simply unthinkable.</p>",
  "<p>Young people planning to go to festivals or other mass events are being warned to make sure they have been fully vaccinated after a number of measles outbreaks.<br></p> <p>Public Health England says anyone visiting a music festival should ensure they have had two shots of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Some younger people may be at risk because they were not vaccinated as small children, after the scare generated by the suggestion of the now discredited scientist Andrew Wakefield that there was a link between the vaccine and autism.</p> <p>There has already been an increase in measles cases this year, with 234 confirmed between January and June, says PHE, which has to be notified of every case. That is a more than fourfold increase over the 54 cases in the same six months last year.</p> <p>Festivals have added to that. There have been 36 suspected measles cases in young people who attended events in June and July. Glastonbury \u2013 the biggest music festival of the year \u2013 had the most cases, at 16. There were seven cases reported from the NASS festival near Bristol; six at the Triplicity festival in north Devon; three at Tewkesbury medieval festival; two at Nozstock: the Hidden Valley in Herefordshire; two at Noisily in Leicester; one at the Secret Garden Party near Huntingdon; and one at Yeovil Show.</p> <p>At least three of the cases were people who had measles symptoms but decided to go to the festival anyway rather than staying at home.</p> <p>PHE is anxious to avoid further spread at festivals and gatherings where thousands of young people are in close contact and some may be susceptible to infection. Measles can be more complicated in teenagers than in small children.</p> <p>\u201cMeasles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications,\u201d said Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE\u2019s head of immunisation.</p> <p>\u201cSo if you think you might have measles, please don\u2019t go to any of these big events. Measles isn\u2019t common these days because most of us are vaccinated, but young people who missed their MMR jab as children are vulnerable, especially if gathered in large numbers at an event. </p> <p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019ve got it, call your GP or NHS 111. Please don\u2019t turn up at the surgery or at A&amp;E as you could infect other patients.\u201d</p> <p>Measles commonly causes diarrhoea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration, earaches, conjunctivitis, fits caused by fever and pneumonia or bronchitis if the infection reaches the lungs. </p> <p>Very rarely it can lead to serious eye disorders and even a fatal brain complication years later. Before vaccination, it was a regular killer. In 1941, there were 1,145 deaths from more than 400,000 cases. In 1998, the year in which the Wakefield paper was published in the Lancet, there were more than 3,700 cases and three deaths. In 2013, the latest year with published figures, although they are incomplete, there was a surge to 6,102 cases because of the Swansea outbreak \u2013 in an area of Wales where many parents had opted not to vaccinate their children \u2013 but only one death.</p> <p>The MMR vaccination rate fell slightly in 2014-15 to 92.3% of eligible children. The previous year it was 92.7%, the highest rate ever achieved. But the overall figure obscures the problem of low vaccination rates in specific regions. In some places, less than 80% of children were vaccinated.</p> <p>Anxieties about the vaccine have led to outbreaks in the US as well. In 2014, there were a record 667 cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A substantial number of those were among the unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio. </p> <p>Last year there was an outbreak in California among children whose parents had refused to have them vaccinated, which began when somebody with measles visited Disneyland \u2013 another place where there are mass gatherings. </p>",

The advance followed a rare show of unity among the opposition, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/syrian-rebels-advance-on-assad-forces-aleppo-siege\">began a campaign a week ago</a> involving thousands of fighters working to break the siege.</p> <p>The coalition includes Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, which last month said it was severing ties with al-Qaida\u2019s central command and played a key role in the battle.</p> <p>Aleppo has been a battleground since 2012, when it was stormed by the opposition and divided into a regime-controlled western half and an east under rebel dominion.

Humanitarian organisations operating in Syria say the crisis there is likely to be even more devastating, as residents did not expect a siege and therefore did not stockpile any supplies in preparation. </p> <p>Aid workers who are allowed to operate in government areas in Aleppo only have supplies for those of the population deemed in need, mostly refugees displaced from other areas, so they are likely to have only a month\u2019s supply for just a fraction of those still in the city.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no vegetables or fruits, and no meat or chicken because there is only five hours of electricity a day and the generators aren\u2019t working because there is no diesel fuel or oil,\u201d said one resident of west Aleppo. \u201cThe merchants are shit, they are hiding their stock in case [the siege] lasts a long time so they can raise the prices.\u201d </p> <p>Another resident said she had been unable to find bread after the rebel campaign secured Ramouseh. Their accounts mesh with those of aid workers, who say prices of goods have risen between 25 and 50% in the last couple of days, with limited access to fuel and bread scarcity.</p> <p>Nor is the situation better in the eastern part of the city, which has endured heavy aerial bombardment by government warplanes. That bombing has meant that, although the siege is technically broken, few supplies have made it through the corridor that remains a fierce war zone.</p> <p>\u201cThe bombing is horrible,\u201d said one doctor based in east Aleppo. \u201cRussia is taking its revenge and they will not allow any road to be open.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey failed in Aleppo, and they want to make up for that failure,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The greatest beneficiaries of the rebel victory may be Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. The powerful jihadi group played a major part in the rebel campaign, the first since it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">publicly severed ties with al-Qaida\u2019s central command</a>.</p> <p>Though few expect the reconstituted group to alter its ideology, it is now seen more as an efficient fighting force that helped to break the siege of Aleppo when the halting international diplomacy of the US and Russia failed.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis operation was an advertisement for their new name,\u201d said one activist in Idlib, a province entirely under opposition control where the former al-Qaida affiliate has a strong presence. \u201cBut the names won\u2019t change the reality.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cThey also are sending a message to the west and to America in particular that their fight is in Syria, and Syria only.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThe fact that armed groups were those to break the siege and then provide food to eastern Aleppo\u2019s starving communities was an irony not lost on a single opposition Syrian,\u201d said Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and author of The Syrian Jihad, a book chronicling the evolution of the Syrian insurgency, who lamented the failure of diplomatic efforts to end the siege. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite extraordinary that even a de facto al-Qaida movement can be perceived as doing a better job at \u2018serving\u2019 civilian needs in Syria than the most powerful country in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlthough some have reservations over its conservatism, Syria\u2019s armed opposition is explicitly unified in viewing al-Nusra\u2019s rebranding as a \u2018concession\u2019 to the revolution,\u201d said Lister. \u201cTherefore, there\u2019s unfortunately no doubt that [Jabhat Fateh al-Sham\u2019s] role in breaking the siege of Aleppo \u2013 even temporarily \u2013 will further entrench its status as a necessary and accepted partner in the fight against the Assad regime.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Shallows is an important film for a couple of reasons. First, it teaches us that nobody should ever go anywhere near the sea, not even once, even for a second, because everything that lives in it is a full-pelt bastard. But perhaps more significantly, it joins the hallowed group of movie one-handers: films where we only see one actor on screen for the overwhelming majority of the running time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/the-shallows-review-blake-lively-shark-thriller-jaume-collet-serra\">The Shallows review \u2013 deep breath: Blake Lively shark-fighting thriller is superb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The key to a good one-hander is peril. The sole character we meet has to be in an absolute ton of trouble if they are going to sustain our attention for an hour and a half.

However, there is virtually no peril in this film. Will he live or die? The fact that the movie\u2019s real-life subject <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Between-Rock-Hard-Place-Ralston/dp/0743495802\">wrote a book about the experience</a>, then formed a substantial part of the film\u2019s promotional campaign, might tip you off a little. Instead, this is just a film for people who want to watch James Franco hacking his arm off with a penknife.

It\u2019s a terrific film \u2013 and it contains perhaps the most meaningful closeup of a burning basin in all of cinema \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is particularly perilous.</p> <p><strong>Peril rating: 4.5</strong></p> <h2><strong>Secret Honor </strong><br></h2> <p>Made during Robert Altman\u2019s wilderness years in the 1980s, Secret Honor is a fictionalised account of one night in Richard Nixon\u2019s house post-resignation. Starring Philip Baker Hall as Nixon, the film takes the form of a long, angry monologue. And there is peril, too, thanks to the gun that lies on his desk throughout.

Sam Rockwell plays the only substantial character we see on screen, but there are two of him. Can a film still be a one-hander if a man is playing clones? And can it also be a one-hander if Kevin Spacey plays the voice of a chatty computer? Since the emotional heft of the film falls solely to Rockwell, we can probably get away with calling it a one-hander - and a perilous one at that. After all, what possible stakes could be higher than learning that you are an expendable pawn to an unethical corporation \u2013plus, you are on the moon by yourself?</p> <p><strong>Peril rating: 8</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/26/all-is-lost-review\"><strong>All Is Lost </strong></a><br></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1rl9Gvx-s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/no1rl9Gvx-s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Alone in the middle of the ocean, Robert Redford is on a boat that has been punctured by a loose shipping container.

But when Wilson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Rv_7kWfBc\">gets washed out to sea in a storm, and we see Hanks screaming hopelessly after him</a>?

  "<p>Kippa Matthews, who has died aged 54, was an artist who turned from his first love, sculpture in stone, to a distinctive career as a magazine and newspaper photographer. He combined the imagination he had deployed in his initial choice of work with a friendly curiosity and a nose for a story, to make a lasting success of his second.</p> <p>His legacy is a photographic archive, remarkable even in our image-saturated age, which will be of permanent importance to his adopted city of York. Every major institution in the city welcomed his interest and gave him privileged access, while thousands of local people appeared in his studies of happiness and tragedy, work and play.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/aug/08/kippa-matthews-a-life-in-pictures\">Kippa Matthews: a life in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Outwardly laid-back and sociable, with his trademark check shirt, cardigan and ponytail, Kippa worked formidably hard and for long hours to get the images that satisfied him. For his last job, two days before his death from a heart attack, he turned up at 9am and stayed until after 1am. As a news photographer, he was able to work rapidly and without flapping, but also had the patience to wait.</p> <p>He was born Christopher Matthews \u2013 Kippa was a childhood nickname \u2013 at East Layton, on the Yorkshire border with County Durham, where his father worked on a farm. His mother was a nurse. When Kippa was a toddler, the family moved 30 miles north to take over his grandparents\u2019 newsagents in Stanley, near Beamish Industrial Museum. He later credited this with giving him a taste for the daily scramble of news.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55ff87f362a34c729597caddbb81ba2b0ed384c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55ff87f362a34c729597caddbb81ba2b0ed384c8/0_0_2100_1390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kippa Matthews\u2019s image of Phil Beckwith, a wrought iron worker, forging spikes in the workshop at Tholthorpe, near York, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kippa Matthews\u2019s image of Phil Beckwith, a wrought iron worker, forging spikes in the workshop at Tholthorpe, near York, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kippa Matthews</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But art came first and his talent was recognised at East Stanley primary and Tanfield comprehensive schools, which encouraged Kippa to go for a fine art and design degree at Sunderland College of Art. Sculpting was the plan, but three summer holiday stints as an arts counsellor at Camp America in New York state led him to take a series of road trips with a photographer friend. He tried his hand with a camera along Big Sur and realised this was what he wanted to do.</p> <p>Back in the UK, he wound up in York because of a hospitable friend\u2019s sofa and in 1988 got a job at John Pick\u2019s news agency, a well-established outfit that knew precisely which local stories to punt to national outlets as different as the Guardian and the Sun. After four years and many successes with broadsheet papers, Kippa moved to London for three hectic years of shifts with the Guardian, Independent and Times. Then he and his partner, Lesley Baron, started a family and decided to return to York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70ed815fd870fd78df367b6d2e7ebb72f87b5cc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70ed815fd870fd78df367b6d2e7ebb72f87b5cc1/0_70_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Heart of Yorkshire, a 2005 art installation by the French light artist Patrice Warrener on the Great West Front of York Minster, photographed by Kippa Matthews\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Heart of Yorkshire, a 2005 art installation by the French light artist Patrice Warrener on the Great West Front of York Minster, photographed by Kippa Matthews</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kippa Matthews</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The move ended any prospect of a full-time newspaper career but enriched Kippa\u2019s coverage of North Yorkshire, especially York. He continued to contribute to the national media, which helped his standing, but had more time to explore the part of the world he knew best. The archbishop of York, John Sentamu, who shared Kippa\u2019s sense of humour, singled out the value of the way his photographs \u201creflect back and tell the story of our common life here in York and North Yorkshire\u201d.</p> <p>The church\u2019s patronage led to striking images, many taken in York Minster but others out on the streets, as when the archbishop carried out Easter baptisms in a large tub on High Petergate. Kippa\u2019s other regular commissioners included the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, whose work led him to less privileged areas, where he took portraits of people with a rougher deal. These stand beside his studies of the visiting famous \u2013 David Hockney and Tony Blair, for instance, and the Queen amid hats when Royal Ascot moved to York in 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"840e33fd934d45faf924ce6f05bf44d7c67093a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/840e33fd934d45faf924ce6f05bf44d7c67093a3/0_0_2100_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kippa Matthews\u2019s photograph of the archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, conducting a baptism by total immersion outside the church of St Michael-le-Belfrey, York, 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kippa Matthews\u2019s photograph of the archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, conducting a baptism by total immersion outside the church of St Michael-le-Belfrey, York, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kippa Matthews</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His eye for a picture was noted by, among others, the Guardian photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/27/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Don McPhee</a>, who was an earlier graduate from John Pick\u2019s exacting school. When work took him to York, Don\u2019s two interests were in how Kippa was doing and what new equipment was being offered by the city\u2019s camera shops.</p> <p>Alongside his work, Kippa played a keen part in Geodesic, a collaboration of artists, performers and musicians which creates offbeat installations on subjects from mass sea swims to brain scanning. He enjoyed listening to music and trying to do the Guardian crossword, and had recently returned to sculpture: stone for a garden commission was delivered shortly before his death.</p> <p>He is survived by his partner, Haley Capon, his sons, Jack and Dan, with Lesley, his partner for 26 years, and by his brother, Garry.</p> <p>\u2022 Kippa Matthews (Christopher Hall Matthews), photographer, born 18 February 1962; died 28 July 2016</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s police chiefs have their basic pay boosted by an average of 21% by allowances and benefits \u2013 many of them undeclared \u2013 according to Whitehall\u2019s senior pay advisers.</p> <p>The unexpected scale of the continuing allowances and perks enjoyed by senior police officers will add to the pressure on police forces, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/police-forces-urged-to-publish-chief-officers-pay-and-perks\">led by the home secretary, Amber Rudd</a>, to reveal how much their chief officers receive in benefits and perks over and above their basic pay.</p> <p>The drive for transparency in the rewards enjoyed by most senior officers follows the disclosure that one chief constable is living in a rent-free apartment in a castle, another took 64 days holiday in a year while a third claimed \u00a330,000 in \u201callowances\u201d, including money for his food and household bills.</p> <p>The details of a limited number of the locally determined allowances and benefits received by chief constables on top of their nationally set basic salaries emerged after a series of Freedom of Information Act requests <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3728478/A-law-unto-pay-thousands-police-chiefs-household-bills-private-healthcare-64-days-holiday.html\">by the Daily Mail</a>. But many forces declined to release full details of their chief constables\u2019 reward packages.</p> <p>The senior salaries review body, which reviews top public sector pay including for Britain\u2019s 200 chief police officers, has been pressing forces to release full details of their allowances and benefits for more than a year.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been told that the provision of allowances and benefits to our remit group members varies greatly across police forces. We lack full details of what is received where, but \u2026 we provide a list of those details which we have been able to establish,\u201d the SSRB said in its report on top police pay three weeks ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office told us that, before the Winsor review [a government commissioned inquiry into police pay and conditions], chief police officers received additional payments worth on average 21% of basic pay for chief constables and less for other ranks. In the future, it will be very important that we understand the value of these benefits at the time of our review.\u201d</p> <p>The Whitehall senior pay advisers have been calling on the Home Office to provide them with an update on the exact current proportion of senior officer pay accounted for by allowances and benefits since the Winsor review was carried out in 2011. That review established that deputy chief constables received allowances and perks worth 14% on top of their basic pay while assistant chief constables got a further 10%.</p> <p>The senior salaries review body said that under national guidelines drawn up in 2003, chief police officers can receive relocation and removal expenses when a chief police officer moves home when joining a police force. All police officers also have the option of a \u201cmotor vehicle allowance\u201d.</p> <p>Police and crime commissioners have discretion to top up a chief constable\u2019s basic pay by up to 10% and can provide private healthcare schemes or medical insurance. They can also provide access to a car pool or a dedicated car at a value determined locally. They also usually agree to cover part of the costs of legal protection insurance.</p> <p>The SSRB, however, published details from only one force \u2013 the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Its chief constable receives a maximum of \u00a318,000 rent/housing allowance on top of an \u00a3199,413 salary, a car allowance of \u00a38,895, a healthcare allowance of \u00a3600 and a broadband allowance of \u00a3360.</p> <p>Rudd said she expected all forces to publish the details. \u201cDirectly elected PCCs are rightly responsible for decisions about the pay and allowances of their chief officers, and we are clear that these should be transparent and open to scrutiny by the communities they serve,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI am adamant that police forces cannot be opaque about such important matters, and I fully expect all forces to publish details of how they are spending taxpayer money.\u201d</p> <p>Police chief officer pay is set by the Home Office on the recommendation of the senior salaries review body. Any expense payments outside the national regulations, including relocation costs, require approval by a force\u2019s police and crime commissioner, who has the power to set such payments.</p> <p>Mark Polin, the chairman of the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA), said the system had to strike a balance between value for money for the taxpayer and the need to recruit the best people for the top policing jobs.</p> <p>He said the staff association had long sought clarity on a \u201cnational remuneration framework\u201d, including allowances and annual leave. He said: \u201cWe favour consistency and transparency on these issues, with investigations and appropriate action against any misuse. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a concern \u2013 shared by CPOSA, the National Police Chiefs Council, Home Office and Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary \u2013 that the number of applicants for top positions in the country is declining. Any system must strike the right balance between fair reward and value for taxpayers, allowing us to attract and retain talent across the country.\u201d</p>",

Corbyn had already left to greet supporters outside, having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/jeremy-corbyn-wins-right-to-be-defendant-in-leadership-court-case\">clinched the vote to allow him on to the ballot paper</a> without gathering nominations.</p> <p>In yesterday\u2019s written judgment on the six-month cutoff point, Mr Justice Hickinbottom said: \u201cAt the time each of the claimants joined the party, it was the common understanding as reflected in the rule book that, if they joined the party prior to the election process commencing, as new members they would be entitled to vote in any leadership contest. That was the basis upon which each claimant joined the party; and the basis upon which they entered into the contract between members. For those reasons, the claimants\u2019 claim succeeds.\u201d</p> <p>He said that a refusal to allow them to vote was an unlawful breach of contract.</p> <p>The five Labour members who brought the case, whose legal fees were <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.co.uk/case/labour-party-membership/\">crowdfunded</a>, had claimed that Labour\u2019s rulebook made no provision for treating them differently and none had ever been made in any of the party\u2019s previous leadership elections.</p> <p>They also argued that when they joined, the Labour website and other communications said they would be \u201ca key part of the team\u201d, and thus eligible to vote in any leadership election.</p> <p>Four named members challenged the decision: Christine Evangelou, the Rev Edward Leir, Hannah Fordham and Chris Granger. The fifth was named in the court papers only as FM because he is under 18.</p> <p>Both Corbyn\u2019s supporters and his opponents had been actively recruiting party members in recent months, helping Labour\u2019s membership rise to more than 500,000 \u2013 higher than the peak under Tony Blair.

  "<p>\u201cAfter careful consideration\u201d is a bureaucratic phrase that signals elegantly, concisely, that you, reader, are about to be stitched up. In that inimitable British way, it confirms that you are about to be given a \u201cdecision\u201d that was a foregone conclusion, justified with the greatest haste, sloppiness and unfairness.</p> <p>So it was on Friday, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/05/cps-upholds-decision-not-to-charge-over-mi6-role-in-libyans-rendition\" title=\"\">the Crown Prosecution Service let slip</a> that \u201cafter careful consideration\u201d it had concluded its victims\u2019 right of review into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/31/met-libya-abduction-rendition-cps\" title=\"\">Operation Lydd</a>, the police probe of UK involvement in the kidnap and rendition of two Libyan families to Gaddafi\u2019s torture chambers. The CPS decided to uphold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/10/libyan-rendition-couple-boudchar-belhaj-criticise-cps-decision\" title=\"\">its decision</a> that no one in the British government would be brought to justice. It called my office (the victims\u2019 representatives) at end of business on a Thursday, in a patent effort to bury the decision and ensure the public would take no notice.</p> <p>It was a land-speed record for the CPS, after the original team sat on the matter for two years before charging nobody. The \u201creview\u201d team had the case for just over 50 days. With a police file of over 28,000 pages, they would have had to read 550 pages daily, seven days a week, just to process all the evidence. There is no real prospect that they even read the police file. This is the \u201ccareful and fully independent consideration\u201d the Libyan renditions victims are thought to be worth.</p> <p>I will never forget the day I met Arwa al-Saadi. With&#xa0;the apparent connivance of MI6, this little girl was bundled onto a plane with her father, mother and three siblings at the tender age of six. We sat on the sofa and thumbed through her pink sketchbook; it was a disturbing mix of manga figures out of her favourite cartoons, and scenes from her life\u2019s worst moments. One of them showed her and her family in a tiny raft fleeing Gaddafi\u2019s Libya by night. She saw horrors that no adult deserves to see. She and her family have been waiting for justice for half a decade.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not only does the CPS refuse to hear from Arwa al-Saadi: it doesn\u2019t want to hear from other rendition victims either</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet, the position of the CPS is that neither she nor any of the victims have the slightest role to play in the right for review. Not only does the CPS refuse to hear from Arwa, it doesn\u2019t want to hear from other rendition victims either, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-hakim-belhaj\" title=\"\">Abdul-Hakim Belhaj</a>, the Libyan dissident who put grievance aside and fought with Nato to overthrow Gaddafi, and has said he would walk away from the case for a mere apology. It doesn\u2019t want to hear from Fatima Boudchar either, who was five months\u2019 pregnant at the time of her abduction. In effect, victims have no role or rights; while prosecutors carry out a quick box-tick review.</p> <p>It is not the first sign that things were amiss at the CPS. During the police investigation we asked prosecutors to meet the families. They rebuffed them. (They offered, and retracted, a meeting when the original decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/mi6-officers-not-charges-rendition-of-libyan-families-abdel-hakim-belhaj\" title=\"\">not to charge former MI6 counter-terrorism chief Sir Mark Allen</a> was published.) In a typical dose of cultural incompetence, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reprieve/status/740856840729317376\" title=\"\">decision letter</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cori_crider/status/740857325301420032\" title=\"\">did not even get the victims\u2019 names right</a>: it mistakenly referred to Arwa\u2019s dad, Sami, as Khadija \u2013 the name of Arwa\u2019s older sister and only, ever, a woman\u2019s name.</p> <p>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the single guiding principle at the CPS is to act exactly as those at the top of government would wish. During the investigation and afterwards, I spoke to former senior prosecutors and others for advice. All of them were clear: members of the security services are basically never put on trial in this country and, however shocking this case, they probably never will be.

  "<p>The first time I interview <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/mark-singer\">Mark Singer</a> it\u2019s the Tuesday after the Republican national convention, which culminated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\">a Donald Trump speech Singer accurately describes as \u201cscripted insanity\u201d</a>. Things feel pretty bleak. Trump\u2019s candidacy, says Singer, is \u201cthe most cynical and truly sad thing that\u2019s ever happened in my life in this country, and I\u2019ve lived through assassinations and terrible wars, but that it has led to this \u2013 it\u2019s a mixture of every awful emotion. If we elect this man it\u2019s the end of a lot of things, I just don\u2019t know how that happens. With a whimper perhaps \u2013 I hope not a bang.\u201d</p> <p>Born in 1950, Singer has been a writer for the New Yorker since 1974 (\u201cThere was no reason to leave,\u201d he tells me as we sit outside a caf\u00e9 near his home on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side). In 1996, his then editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/apr/07/tina-brown-our-speakers-have-taken-on-bigger-misogynists-than-trump\">Tina Brown</a> commissioned him to write a profile of Trump with the words \u201cHe\u2019s totally full of shit, you\u2019ll love him!\u201d After months getting a full immersion into Trump\u2019s world, one highlight being a ludicrous meeting between Trump and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/29/guardianobituaries.russia\">Aleksandr Lebed</a>, in which Trump proudly showed the Russian general and Kremlin fixer a shoe he\u2019d been given by Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/video-mark-singer-on-the-perils-of-profiling-donald-trump\">Singer wrote a 10,000-word profile</a> that nailed the narcissism, superficiality and cynicism with which the world is now so alarmingly familiar. It concluded that Trump had \u201caspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury, an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/trump-and-me-mark-singer-donald-review-hari-kunzru\">Trump and Me by Mark Singer review \u2013 a lot of laughs but then horror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Naturally, Trump didn\u2019t appreciate Singer\u2019s efforts, attacking him in his book Trump: the Art of the Comeback, in a letter to the New York Times (\u201che was not born with great writing ability\u201d), and finally in an irate missive that read: \u201cMark, you are a total loser! And your book (and writings) sucks!\u201d </p> <p>These last two sentences are proudly printed on the back of Singer\u2019s new book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/trump-and-me-mark-singer-donald-review-hari-kunzru\">Trump and Me</a>, which revisits his profile in the light of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Given Singer\u2019s probing wit and Trump\u2019s essential ridiculousness, it is very funny, though the implications of a Trump presidency seem increasingly less amusing in the light of the hatred he has unleashed. \u201cI am afraid. Everybody I know is afraid,\u201d Singer says. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton wins, listening to the sigh of relief just on this island, we might have a carbon dioxide overload crisis. You\u2019ll see these trees shooting up.\u201d </p> <p>Singer says that Trump is \u201cthe most unapologetic \u2026 there has to be a word stronger than hypocrite, there really does.\u201d He is despairing that some voters \u2013 stoked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">email scandal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/clinton-campaign-blames-russia-wikileaks-sanders-dnc-emails\">the WikiLeaks revelations about her attempts to undermine Bernie Sanders</a> \u2013 think Hillary Clinton is more dishonest than Trump. This, he says, \u201cis what really makes you want to blow your brains out. It makes you want to go back and find patient zero and think, when was the moment where we stopped being willing to fund public education in this country, that it became so egregious that we no longer could have people who understood the constitution, the checks and balances? Trump says: \u2018I love the ill-educated.\u2019 You bet he does.\u201d </p> <p>Singer blames Fox News and the web for what seems to be a growing disregard for the truth, but also acknowledges that widening inequality, leaving a large swathe of Americans essentially abandoned by the two main parties, has helped account for Trump\u2019s rise \u2013 along with \u201cthe haters\u201d, racists and xenophobes excited by this promises to keep Mexicans and Muslims out of America. </p> <p>Nevertheless, he can\u2019t bring himself to picture Trump actually being elected. \u201cImagine November 9, 2016. You wake up and there it is in the newspaper, Donald Trump has been elected president. He\u2019s not going to institute martial law yet, he\u2019s not going to abridge the first amendment just yet, he\u2019s not going to seal the borders \u2013 he can\u2019t do anything until January 20. This will be the beginning of a series of <em>anni horobili</em> that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d </p> <p>Singer cites a recent obituary of a friend\u2019s aunt, which concluded: \u201cDied of complications of congestive heart failure and the 2016 presidential election.\u201d Like her, he says, \u201cI think that you\u2019re going to see a lot of people who\u2019ve been hanging on, letting go. I believe that. And a lot of them are going to be envied.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Trump in his quintessence\u2019</h2> <p>Just a week later, however, things look very different. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-campaign-terrible-week-paul-ryan-khan\">Trump is plunging in the polls</a>, largely thanks to his typically impetuous and politically suicidal decision to attack Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of US army captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in the Iraq war. \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing,\u201d Khan said of Trump in his speech at the DNC, a line devastating because it is so self-evidently true, and one to which Trump was stupid enough to respond, telling ABC: \u201cI think I\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThat almost made me embarrassed for humanity,\u201d says Singer when I call him a few days after Trump\u2019s car-crash performance. \u201cI don\u2019t really lump myself in the same humanity that possibly he belongs to.\u201d</p> <p>Singer says the Khan episode \u201cshowed Donald Trump in his quintessence\u201d. Even the rightwing political commentator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/bill-oreilly-slaves-eat-well\">Bill O\u2019Reilly</a>, he says, \u201cwho\u2019s a bomb thrower\u201d, told Trump on his Fox show that you don\u2019t attack a gold-star mother. \u201cTrump is saying: \u2018Well yeah, but\u2019 \u2013 and then he says, as plain as day, \u2018I didn\u2019t attack her.\u2019 And right after he says that he says: \u2018I was viciously attacked.\u2019 This demonstrates as plainly as anything that he\u2019s a person who lies reflexively.\u201d</p> <p>Now Trump seems to be flailing. \u201cHe\u2019s shocked,\u201d Singer says. \u201cHe\u2019s in a tailspin because his ego is constructed in a way that does not brook any kind of disagreement. He has his own party telling him, \u2018Dude, shut the fuck up. Do not go there.\u2019 These are people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Guiliani </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/newt-gingrich\">Newt Gingrich</a>, this is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, OK? He hears them, he goes out and the next day does it again.\u201d</p> <p>This reckless behaviour has had many commentators wondering whether Trump is suffering from a mental illness. Last week, Singer participated in <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/trump-the-candidate-unfit-to-serve-737086019759\">an extraordinary discussion on MSNBC\u2019s The Last Word With Lawrence O\u2019Donnell</a> with Dr George Simon, a psychologist <a href=\"http://www.manipulative-people.com/\">described on his website</a> as \u201cthe leading expert on manipulators and other disturbed characters\u201d. To be diagnosed with a narcissistic personality disorder, you need to exhibit five of around <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms/\">a dozen symptoms on a checklist</a>, such as \u201cHas a grandiose sense of self-importance\u201d and \u201clacks empathy\u201d. However, the entire list seemed to apply to Trump. </p> <p>\u201cHis mental illness is now the conversation,\u201d Singer says. There are tricky ethical issues around such a long-distance diagnosis \u2013 not least, he says, the fact that comparing them to Trump may further stigmatize sufferers. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely unfair to people who have various mental illnesses.\u201d </p> <p>Singer says that even mental illness can\u2019t entirely account for Trump\u2019s behaviour. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe that this is somebody capable of this degree of obtuseness, obliviousness, total absence of self-awareness and cruelty. This combination. Since you and I spoke the other day, that has blown open and he\u2019s really done. So now the headlines are, what\u2019s the party going to do? They\u2019ve got to do something. They\u2019re almost conceding the election now, two weeks after their convention!\u201d Singer even made a bet last Monday with <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jane-mayer\">Jane Mayer</a>, a New Yorker colleague, that Trump would be gone in two weeks. \u201cThe wheels are starting to come off so dramatically and you can feel it.\u201d </p> <p>Given his plunging popularity, Singer says it\u2019s no surprise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-the-devil-and-suggests-election-will-be-rigged\">Trump is now claiming that the election will be rigged</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s in the book,\u201d<strong> </strong>he points out. \u201cThe thing that he\u2019s dreaded most in his life is being labeled a loser. So he has to have an explanation for that.\u201d </p> <p>In the shorter term, Singer says, Trump\u2019s next big challenge will be the debates \u2013 or more specially, how he can avoid them. As Trump has demonstrated many times, for instance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-fact-check-nfl-debates-iran-hillary-clinton\">recently claiming that Russia would not invade Ukraine</a>, when Russian soldiers occupied Crimea over two years ago, when it comes to events beyond America\u2019s borders he is profoundly ignorant. \u201cExactly right,\u201d Singer says. \u201cBy choice and temperament both. And this is a person who brags: \u2018I know more about Isis than the generals.\u2019 This party has this quote on record when they nominated him. Guess who I don\u2019t have a whole lot of sympathy for? It\u2019s game over.\u201d Given the warp speed at which the news has moved this year however, Singer rows back: \u201cThat is the kind of stuff that is so dangerous to say I should bite my tongue.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, says Singer, is the most transparent politician there has ever been: \u201cHe\u2019s only out for himself, in every way, in every gesture.\u201d One of the reasons for publishing his book, he says, was in disgust at the way journalists indulged Trump\u2019s race for the presidency because it was good for ratings and traffic. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/how-false-equivalence-is-distorting-the-2016-election-coverage/\">This notion of false equivalency</a> is not something that journalists have figured out, but it wasn\u2019t even that with Trump, it was just the celebrity and [him] using up all the oxygen. But I knew that Trump had no intention of winning, it was obvious \u2013 and here we are.\u201d</p> <p>As for many Americans, the Trump candidacy has been a draining experience for Singer. No one can turn away, Singer least of all. \u201cI just sat here and I was watching MSNBC last night until 11 o\u2019clock and I realized, I am now an addict. I\u2019m totally a junkie and I really need to have an intervention of my own, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>That sets him off on another Trumpian train of thought \u2013 those in the Republican party who think they can perform some kind of intervention. \u201cThis idea of doing an intervention with Trump is hilarious to me. These might be the last optimists in America.\u201d You can\u2019t treat people like Trump, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re incurable.\u201d</p>",

The expert claimed that iPlayer data could be modified to make it distinguishable from other traffic without actually looking at its contents.</p> <p>The BBC issued a statement rebutting the Telegraph article (without naming it), saying that there had been \u201cconsiderable inaccurate reporting this weekend about how TV Licensing will detect people breaking the law by watching BBC iPlayer without a licence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we don\u2019t discuss the details of how detection works for obvious reasons, it is wrong to suggest that our technology involves capturing data from private Wi-Fi networks.\u201d</p> <p>But the BBC\u2019s statement is ambiguous about its capabilities, and there\u2019s an obvious reason for that. While it doesn\u2019t want people to think it\u2019s turning into Big Brother, it does want them to think it knows when you are watching BBC programming without a licence \u2013 especially when, from next month, you will be required to pay the \u00a3145.50 annual fee to legally watch catchup content as well as live programming.</p> <p>However, carrying out the sort of mass surveillance suggested by the Telegraph is likely to be prohibitively expensive, technically challenging and quite possibly illegal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/01/bbc-iplayer-tv-licence-iplayer-loophole\">BBC iPlayer users will have to pay TV licence fee from 1 September</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Besides, there are other ways for the BBC to tell who is watching without paying. It has ruled out combing its own records of computers that have logged in to iPlayer and matching those up to licences, but it is authorised to use anti-terror legislation \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/theresa-may-smooth-form-mps-hack-the-ripa-snoopers-charter\">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act</a> \u2013 to target people it already suspects of watching without a licence. It could, in theory, use that authorisation to access internet records of which sites you have visited. Even if surveillance vans were used, a targeted approach, and one that didn\u2019t monitor Wi-Fi traffic, would make more sense.</p> <p>In the long run, a more elegant solution would be to require a code linked to your TV licence to access iPlayer.</p> <p>Whatever it does come up with, the rationale is clear. The BBC says it already loses \u00a3150m a year to people who say they don\u2019t need a TV licence because they only watch catchup, and with the number of households saying they don\u2019t have a TV increasing each year, it needs to find some way of making sure people who consume its programmes any other way are paying. In short, we need people to believe the Beeb is watching \u2013 otherwise one day there might not be a BBC to watch.</p>",

He is 5ft 9in and lacks scintillating pace but is wonderfully composed on the ball and possesses the happy knack of making things happen. Can also operate in a right-sided attacking midfield role. Elegant with the ball at his feet, Cook looks very much a Howe player.</p> <h2>2) Marten de Roon: Atalanta to Middlesbrough</h2> <p>Aitor Karanka has invested around \u00a312m in the Dutch enforcer from Atalanta, who during his debut season in Italy made more tackles than any other Serie A midfielder. With many such interceptions of the wince-inducing variety the 25-year-old is likely to collect his fair share of yellow cards while adding some of the power and physical presence Boro arguably lack in the holding midfield roles. Expect one of last season\u2019s two anchors, Grant Leadbitter and Adam Clayton, to lose their place. It was a lot to pay for someone who is not yet a full international but Italian fans did not dub De Roon \u201cthe bulldog\u201d, \u201cthe wave-breaker\u201d and \u201cthe terrier\u201d for nothing.</p> <h2>3) Ramadan Sobhi: Al Ahly to Stoke City</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8654a3239c7605e1017325c786bff75f55c931aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8654a3239c7605e1017325c786bff75f55c931aa/0_148_2128_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramadan Sobhi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramadan Sobhi is regarded as one of Africa\u2019s most exciting players.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 19-year-old Egypt left winger is a wizard of the dribble blessed with pace, vision, technique and a varied passing range.

Despite Charlton\u2019s travails, he created 11 Championship goals last term \u2013 making him the second tier\u2019s joint-top assist maker \u2013 and is unlikely to be perturbed by the chill Pennine winds blowing in from the moors above Burnley. Born in Reykjavik, Gudmundsson moved to England as a teenager, where he had stints in the youth development systems at Chelsea and Fulham. A brief spell in the Netherlands, with AZ Alkmaar, followed before the switch to Charlton.</p> <h2>7) Ahmed Musa: CSKA Moscow to Leicester</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/07/premier-league-fans-preview-part-two-manchester-united-west-ham\">Premier League fans\u2019 previews part 2: Manchester United to West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The holder of 58 Nigeria caps at the age of 23, the forward has been long coveted by Claudio Ranieri, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/08/leicester-ahmed-musa-confirm-signing\" title=\"\">who has finally got him for \u00a316.6m</a>. Musa\u2019s change of pace is almost certainly speedier than that of Jamie Vardy and in some respects he is similar to his new club-mate. Musa\u2019s rapid acceleration makes him particularly dangerous when operating off the shoulder of the last defender and he is rarely outstripped in a one-against-one sprint. Unlike Vardy, he is as comfortable on the left flank as in a central striking role but remains rather more raw in front of goal than the England forward. Although 18 goals in 44 appearances for CSKA Moscow last season was far from shabby, Ranieri will hope to see a little more composure at times from a player who also contributes his fair share of assists. Only time will tell whether Musa and Vardy will complement each other but that searing pace can only enhance Leicester\u2019s counterattacking style.</p> <h2>8) Matt Phillips: QPR to West Brom</h2> <p>The winger, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/west-brom-matt-phillips-qpr-signs\" title=\"\">captured for \u00a35m</a>, has impressed everyone at The Hawthorns during pre-season, confirming a general impression that he was far too good for the Championship. Sometimes underrated, the 25-year-old possesses both pace \u2013 as a junior athlete he specialised in the 100m \u2013 and close control. Moreover, at 6ft 1in he is capable of overpowering full-backs. Although Phillips has slotted into the right wing position vacated after St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon\u2019s release, Tony Pulis may also use him in a more central attacking role, thereby plugging West Brom\u2019s striker shortage. The Scotland international scored eight times for QPR last season and can finish incisively but Hawthorns regulars would probably prefer to see him concentrating on his dribbling and crossing. Many observers suspect Pulis\u2019s side will become embroiled in this season\u2019s relegation scrap but Phillips\u2019s arrival at least allows West Brom fans to dream of something a little better.</p> <h2>9) Isaac Success: Granada to Watford</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"552c6e38ce7d6ad6b15d15dc1d1991b55a5dd8a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/552c6e38ce7d6ad6b15d15dc1d1991b55a5dd8a3/500_407_1645_987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Success\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Success, in action for his former club Granada, is comfortable on both wings and up front.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Angel Molina/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At \u00a312.5m the boy from Benin City in Nigeria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/01/watford-christian-kabasele-isaac-success\" title=\"\">has become Watford\u2019s record signing</a>.

This very autobiographical show charts the lives, careers and relationship of Rhea Butcher and Cameron Esposito, a married lesbian couple who cohost a comedy show in LA. Just like Maria Bamford\u2019s Lady Dynamite (she guest stars in an episode), Butcher and Esposito have found a way to make a comedy about comedians fresh and original by focusing on the struggles of female comedians and using their comedy to get at some thorny issues surrounding race, gender and sexual orientation.

  "<h2>\u2018How does the 11+ promote social fairness?\u2019<br></h2> <p>As a twin I was faced with the despair of my twin going to grammar and myself, having failed the test, going to one of the roughest schools in the country. I am now an assistant head of a primary school that feeds into grammar schools. </p> <p>I see so many children whose parents do not play the system and who cannot afford tutoring fail to make it. And I see pupils who are tutored for a year and end up passing the 11+. How is this promoting social fairness? Other schools in the area end up having poor relationships with grammar schools or end up as sink schools. </p> <p>I feel grammar schools are more divisive than ever. At least everyone had a level playing field 30 years ago when everyone took the test. <br></p> <p><em>Andy, Hatchard <br></em></p> <h2>\u2018I feel grammar schools have a major social impact in my area\u2019</h2> <p>From my experience of attending both a secondary school and a grammar school, I feel that the grammar school I attended clearly had greater resources available. Students at the grammar school had a wider selection of courses to choose from, for example the choice of taking French plus German, Spanish and/or Latin at GCSE. <br></p> <p>Whereas at the secondary school I attended up to GCSE, we were assigned either French or German to study when we entered the school. Furthermore, at the secondary school we undertook a generic double science GCSE and a humanities GCSE. Conversely, the grammar school offered the three sciences separately (a student could take them all) and the three humanities separately. <br> </p> <p>I feel grammar schools have a major social impact in my area. For some students who \u201cfailed\u201d their 11+ there is an ongoing influence. It is difficult to forget that you failed an important test at the age of 11, which led to your class splitting and the \u201cclever\u201d children going to grammar schools, and the \u201cstupid\u201d children not. I would certainly say that in the area I grew up in, there is stigma attached to \u201cfailing\u201d your 11+. <br></p> <p><em>JMC, Buckinghamshire</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec233734f6462cc8d148164f80be6b2d8cd928ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec233734f6462cc8d148164f80be6b2d8cd928ab/0_166_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl reads aloud during an English lesson on the war poets, at Pates grammar school in Cheltenham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl reads aloud during an English lesson on the war poets, at Pates grammar school in Cheltenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018His tutor said four months would unlikely be enough\u2019<br></h2> <p>We lived in Wallington, where there is unusually, I think, six grammar schools in the area so we had high hopes for our son getting into one. We applied for two but quickly realised that his primary school would offer no help in preparation, and in fact didn\u2019t even talk about the opportunity to the kids; I believe that in five years they\u2019d only sent one child to a grammar school. <br></p> <p>We felt we had no option but to get him some private tutoring, for which there is a thriving industry in the area. The tutor we chose had had previous success but told us the four or so months she had to work with him would unlikely be enough. We worked him hard, as did the tutor, and we gave him as good a run-up as we could, but we were dismayed on the day of the exam to see hundreds and hundreds of other boys turning up, and after speaking to other parents realised they were coming from as far away as Brighton and Birmingham. <br></p> <p>Most kids from out of the area seemed well schooled in the process and the exams, while a lot of the local ones seemed like they were giving it a go but with low expectations, and so it was. My son got close but with only 150 or so places and around 10 times that taking the exams, he fell short by around 30 places in the ranking. <br></p> <p>It was frustrating to say the least that being in the area actually acted as a handbrake rather than an advantage, as a large number of local primary schools couldn\u2019t set the kids up to take the exams, and for most it wasn\u2019t even thought about as a possibility, despite it being on their doorstep. We were left facing dropping from a grammar school with 100% achievement in exams, down to a choice of schools with half that success rate, and so we moved away from the area. <br></p> <p><em>Alistair Anderson, Bedfordshire <br></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/grammar-schools-arent-fit-for-the-world-of-the-future\">Grammar schools aren\u2019t fit for the world of the future | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018I was pushed to reach my full potential, which was ideal for me\u2019</h2> <p>I didn\u2019t enjoy my time at my single-sex grammar school, partly because of the narrow-minded way of teaching. We were taught the only way to progress in life was to go to university, with no advice given on apprenticeships.</p> <p> That being said, I wouldn\u2019t have traded my time for, say, the other local schools. The university route was ideal for me and I was pushed to reach my full potential, and after achieving a first at a Russell Group university, I am now undertaking a PhD funded by two competitive scholarships. I felt bad for others who weren\u2019t that way inclined, as they did not get support. <br></p> <p>I do think grammar schools are open to everyone. I come from a working-class background. Neither of my parents went to university and this was the same for many of my friends while I was there.

The 11+ was seen as some perverse rite of passage for many and I can remember my mother explaining to me the amount of tutoring some of the other children in my school had in order to secure places.<br></p> <p>My own time at grammar school was all in all an excellent experience, the opportunities given to us were huge and we were encouraged to aim for only Russell Group universities if possible. Looking back now it\u2019s sad but there certainly was an antipathy towards those who didn\u2019t study in grammars and I can vividly remember some of the more sickening chants when we played rugby against local comprehensives: \u201cYou\u2019ve got more STDs than GCSEs.\u201d</p> <p>I was a very high achiever at primary school but, regardless, I was still coached for the 11+, in my mother\u2019s words, to \u201cmake sure\u201d. The pressure on us was huge to do well in the exam and our entire year five geared up towards this. The amount of children with me who underwent tutoring was incredible and many of my colleagues at grammar school even noted they did not belong there, instead finding the pace too much.</p> <p><em>Robert, London<br></em></p>",
  "<p>Warner Bros\u2019 marketing department is probably having a hell of a time finding positive quotes for their latest DC Comics-inspired critical disaster, Suicide Squad.

In honor of those poor souls who just want to get some experience in Hollywood during their summer away from Northwestern, here\u2019s a quote for you, free of charge: I didn\u2019t hate it!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/aug/08/suicide-squad-joker-harley-quinn-cara-delevingne-spoilers-david-ayer\">Suicide Squad: A new Joker, Harley Quinn and Cara Delevingne \u2013 discuss with spoilers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c\u2018I didn\u2019t hate it,\u2019 says Dave Schilling of the Guardian\u201d has a real ring to it, doesn\u2019t it? But why, you might ask, did I not hate Suicide Squad? </p> <p>It\u2019s atrocious. A blatant pastiche of Escape from New York, Ghostbusters, Guardians of the Galaxy and Con Air. Yes, I said Con Air is better than Suicide Squad. Con Air sucks, but Con Air sucks in the most fun way possible. It\u2019s happy being bad. It knows nothing other than being bad and does not stray from its mission statement of being bad. It\u2019s a natural expression of its creative vision.</p> <p><strong> </strong>It includes a prominent role for John Cusack as a US marshall who does karate in Birkenstocks. There are moments in Suicide Squad that harken back to the era of movies such as Con Air \u2013 the height of the Jerry Bruckheimer brand of unapologetic Hollywood action trash, a dearly departed style of eccentric stupidity wiped away by the pristine war machine of Marvel Studios.</p> <p>The success of films such as X2, Iron Man and The Dark Knight gave credence to the so-called respectable genre film. Peek at the Rotten Tomatoes page for 2014\u2019s Captain America: The Winter Soldier and you\u2019ll see critic after critic applauding the film for its \u201cenergy\u201d, \u201chumor\u201d and various allusions to real-world problems. Winter Soldier, like almost every Marvel production, is a testament to the infernal dream factory they have created. </p> <p>Each film adheres to a stylistic and thematic structure that guarantees success. Even lesser works such as Ant-Man and Iron Man 2 possess enough Marvel magic to skate by without anyone really stopping to consider how generic they are. They\u2019re fun, brimming with charm and eager to please. Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios should be commended for doing something truly superhuman: getting people to leave their homes to see films in a theater on a regular basis. Of the 13 Marvel Studios releases, only one has grossed under $150m in domestic box office. Only four of them <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=avengers.htm\">have grossed under $200m</a>. Ask the producers of recent box office disappointments such as Ghostbusters or Star Trek Beyond \u2013 good movies that received mostly positive critical notices but underperformed financially \u2013 if making a blockbuster is easy. </p> <p>That success breeds audience loyalty and brand recognition. If a new Pixar movie is released, people will see it out of cultural obligation. If Apple releases a Wi-Fi enabled nose-hair trimmer, millions of consumers would snap one up just to be the first one at the office to try it out in the private executive bathroom. But Apple doesn\u2019t take big swings any more. They release another iPhone once a year with a slightly better camera. Pixar\u2019s film slate is littered with sequels. What was once refreshing and vital is now the fourth trip to the soup-and-salad bar at Sizzler. That\u2019s OK, though. I have an iPhone 6 and will gladly pay money for Incredibles 2. I also love Sizzler. That cheese toast they have is stupendous. (Still, it\u2019s human nature to want to sample new things, even in the face of what\u2019s warm and familiar, which brings me back to Suicide Squad.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d962bcbdbc33cddd285810e2f67de254f9b34c93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d962bcbdbc33cddd285810e2f67de254f9b34c93/0_50_2250_1349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s criminal: John Malkovich in Con Air.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s criminal: John Malkovich in Con Air.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 5</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Warner and DC Entertainment promised a film-maker-centric creative culture, a subtle dig at Marvel\u2019s Pixaresque top-down structure.

Finally, something different. What we often forget is that \u201csomething different\u201d occasionally means \u201csomething terrible\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/10/con-air-guilty-pleasure\">My guilty pleasure: Con Air</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The movie business is not designed to produce starkly original works. It\u2019s supposed to create profitable widgets with merchandising potential. When a piece of art with an unconventional worldview does escape, it\u2019s rare and it tends to take audiences awhile to catch up to what they witnessed. Sometimes, a film will get hammered to death by the executives whose job it is to protect the profit margin of their studio. It\u2019s a facile argument to say that they\u2019re all \u201ccorporate stooges\u201d who hate art. No, what they hate is losing their jobs. Think about all the industry professionals that will soon be out of work at studios that struggled this summer, such as Paramount and Columbia. I\u2019m not saying you should pity them; most of them get paid quite well and will find work elsewhere. But understand the motivation behind the instinct to meddle with something weird. Remember the studio executives that watched Blade Runner and suggested Ridley Scott add a voiceover and a happy ending?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Studios are going to have to learn to accept failure, which is outside the realm of their corporate identities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Suicide Squad wasn\u2019t going to be Blade Runner, but it could have been more coherent with less studio involvement. WB execs clashed with writer/director David Ayer and mandated reshoots to lighten the tone of the film, rendering the finished product an unholy mess of conflicting ideas and <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/suicide-squads-secret-drama-rushed-916693\">unclear character motivations</a>. A movie that co-stars a crocodile-man in a Juicy Couture track suit was probably never capable of the serious treatment. Marvel, on the other hand, has weaponized the ironic distance necessary to make these movies palatable for mass consumption. DC can try to copy that or they can carve a new path, but they have to pick one or the other. As it stands now, they are cranking out glorious B-movies and no one, save for Michael Bay, makes movies this strange and terrible any more.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s why audiences have sleepwalked through the summer season. While there is plenty of arthouse fare worth your time, the studio product is competent, clean and safe. The results are predictable. There\u2019s nothing in the big-budget, studio category compelling us out of our moviegoing apathy, nothing as particular and auteurist as Tim Burton\u2019s Batman, Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Total Recall or James Cameron\u2019s Titanic. There\u2019s also nothing as moronic as Twister, except Suicide Squad. The summer of 1995 \u2013 the year the neon demon known as Batman Forever squirted out of the Warner Bros apparatus and dominated the box office \u2013 saw the release of the abominable Sylvester Stallone Judge Dredd adaptation. Bombs like that made Batman Forever, a McDonald\u2019s commercial posing as a feature film complete with rubber nipples and Tommy Lee Jones having an artistic seizure on camera, seem interesting. If everything is good, is anything <em>really</em> good?</p> <p>Hollywood needs to take risks and give creative control to singular visionaries in order to keep people energized by the idea of seeing men and women in spandex fight CGI monsters. The auteurist sensibilities of Christopher Nolan pushed the form to new heights with the Dark Knight trilogy, even if the template he laid down is not being followed by the brain-trusts at Marvel and Warner Bros. The sign of a unique piece of work is when it can\u2019t be so easily replicated and commodified. Let Yorgos Lanthimos, director of The Lobster, have a crack at a comic book film. Sure, it might turn out to be artsy and unconventional, but it could also redefine the parameters of the superhero genre and breathe new life into the movie business.</p> <p>Studios are going to have to learn to accept failure, which is outside the realm of their corporate identities. There\u2019s a certain nobility to the earnest, creatively pure disaster. When watching Suicide Squad, it\u2019s readily apparent that whatever was noble about that film was surgically removed long before opening weekend.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president could affect the strength of the Anzus treaty and Australia\u2019s relationships in the Asia-Pacific region, former federal foreign minister and NSW premier Bob Carr has warned.</p> <p>ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night was entirely dedicated to US politics, and parallels were also drawn between the US and Australia, with rising public dissatisfaction having led to the emergence of more fringe candidates.</p> <p>Besides Carr, the panel included US anti-poverty campaigner Linda Tirado, US author and satirist PJ O\u2019Rourke, international security analyst Lydia Khalil, and US defence and politics analyst Crispin Rovere. </p> <p>Guests initially discussed the prospect of Trump having access to nuclear weapons. O\u2019Rourke described him as a \u201ctoddler\u201d but Rovere, who is writing a book on Trump, said his approach to nuclear weapons was \u201centirely mainstream and entirely consistent\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/pj-orourke-says-blame-the-elites-for-trump-and-brexit-and-vote-for-clinton\">PJ O'Rourke says blame the elites for Trump and Brexit \u2013 and vote for Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe says he hates nuclear weapons.

Maybe because I spent so much of my time looking at other regions of the world where this is very easy to open up, and democracy is a fragile thing, open society is a fragile thing \u2026 no international security person in the United States has come out in favour of him. They\u2019re saying he is a threat.\u201d</p> <p>It followed her earlier comments that Trump lacked an articulated position on anything, which she said made him a dangerous presidential candidate.</p> <p>\u201cWin or lose he\u2019s already set us back on the international and security front,\u201d said Khalil.</p> <p>O\u2019Rourke warned that perhaps Trump was not the real threat, but that his candidacy seemed to spark \u201can impulse to like a demagogue.\u201d</p> <p>Carr agreed Trump could be \u201cthe harbinger of something to come. It may not be this Trump, but it could be the Trump in four years time, as America becomes a society shaped by global forces that Washington can\u2019t control.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to a question about rising popular discontent with the Australian, US and UK establishments and support for Brexit, Trump, and newly reelected senator Pauline Hanson, Carr said there was a \u201cself-correcting process\u201d and Trump as president would result in \u201can enormous rethinking\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe sense of betrayal will be very rapid. How does somebody implement the promises that he has made? I think we\u2019ve seen a self-correcting process in the rise of the Green party in Australia. Its support hasn\u2019t continued to rise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd look at Clive Palmer, who was seen as a bit of a demagogue, I guess. The public looked at him, the public was entertained for a period and then the public dropped him. There is no alternative here but to trust in the good sense of the voters.\u201d</p> <p>Tirado said Australians were looking at their version of the rise of the Tea party, and it would be problematic when Turnbull has to negotiate with the One Nation senators over important issues like the economy and royal commissions.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we don\u2019t have the choices of pushing it one way or the other, that leads to a lot more people feeling disenfranchised\u201d.</p> <p>Khalil said the political elite had \u201cignored the losers of globalisation\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe see it here in Australia with Pauline Hanson. But you have a prime minister here who talks about innovation and how wonderful it is to be an Australian. But for many Australians, innovation is scary and no one is addressing these concerns of voters. There is a crisis with the middle class in the States \u2013 there\u2019s opiate addictions, high mortality rates and no-one outside of it are addressing those concerns. They have a voice in Trump \u2013 a narcissistic, crazy one, but they have a voice in Trump.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Security flaws that could give hackers complete access to a smartphone have been found in the processors of hundreds of millions of Android devices, researchers claim.</p> <p>Computer security firm Check Point says that the bugs could affect up to 900m Android phones, including some made by BlackBerry, Google and LG among others. </p> <p>The bugs are caused by vulnerabilities in the processor chips used by US firm Qualcomm in those phones , and allows an attacker to craft a malicious app which can do almost anything on the phone \u2013 a flaw called \u201cprivilege escalation\u201d. However, there is no evidence that the issue has yet been used in the wild to attack real phones.</p> <p>The firm has dubbed the flaws \u201cQuadRooter\u201d, because there are four interconnected flaws which can be used to gain access to the \u201croot\u201d of the phone, the most secure section of the operating system. An attacker with root access has full control over a device and can do anything from completely replacing the operating system to logging every single action on the phone and uploading everything to a third party.</p> <p>According to Check Point, speaking at the Def Con hacking convention in Las Vegas, an app taking advantage of QuadRooter could \u201cgive attackers complete control of devices and unrestricted access to sensitive personal and enterprise data on them\u201d. The company named Google\u2019s Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, and Nexus 6P, HTC\u2019s One M9 and HTC 10, and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge as some of the phones affected by the flaw.</p> <p>Qualcomm said: \u201cWe were notified by the researcher about these vulnerabilities between February and April of this year, and made patches available for all four vulnerabilities to customers, partners, and the open source community between April and July.\u201d</p> <p>Just because manufacturers know of the bug and how to fix it, doesn\u2019t mean consumers are safe: each individual manufacturer still has to create a specific fix for their model of phone, and in many cases individual mobile carriers then have to themselves agree to roll that fix out to their customers. As a result, Check Point suggested that the Android platform as a whole \u2013 which is open to dozens of different manufacturers and software developers \u2013 was part of the issue, with updates taking too long to pass through the system.</p> <p>\u201cThis situation highlights the inherent risks in the Android security model,\u201d <a href=\"http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/08/07/quadrooter/\">the firm said</a>. \u201cCritical security updates must pass through the entire supply chain before they can be made available to end users. Once available, the end users must then be sure to install these updates to protect their devices and data.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Google <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/06/google-stagefright-megabug-patch-nexus-phones-samsung-android\">announced an initiative to solve these problems</a>, confirming that their phones would be kept secure for at least three years after launch. The company\u2019s own-brand Nexus smartphones <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/\">have indeed received a fix</a> for three of the four flaws identified by Check Point. The fourth fix missed out on the fix because the final patch wasn\u2019t issued in time.</p> <p>Check Point has encouraged users to keep their phone\u2019s software up to date in order to keep it secure, and said it has also created <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.checkpoint.quadrooter\">a free app called QuadRooter Scanner</a>, which can be used to check whether a user\u2019s phone is at risk.</p> <p>Unpatched users do still have some defence, however. A malicious app must be installed on their phone before it can take advantage of the vulnerability, and Google now explicitly vets apps uploaded to its own app store before publication to ensure they are safe to use. Some still slip through the cracks, however, and third-party app stores, particularly popular in China where the official Google Play Store isn\u2019t available, may not have such protections.</p> <p>The vulnerability is the most widespread seen in the Android platform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/06/google-stagefright-megabug-patch-nexus-phones-samsung-android\">since 2015\u2019s Stagefright bug</a>, which affected the operating system\u2019s media handling technology. That bug affected the vast majority of Android phones, even after the security researcher who discovered it gave manufacturers 90 days advance warning to fix the problems before going public. </p> <p>The embarrassing lag between learning of the problem and issuing a fix led some manufacturers, including Google and Samsung, to promise a radical overhaul in how they handle security fixes for top-tier phones. But the vast majority of Android phones aren\u2019t the luxury models covered by such promises, and it remains unclear whether such mid-market devices will ever see fixes for flaws like QuadRooter.<br></p>",
  "<p>I knew grammar school was going to be different to my life experience to date when, as we lined up in our caps and shorts, the teachers swept dramatically into view. Half were priests in long, black robes, one of whom appeared to be wearing makeup and perfume. Thus began seven years of&#xa0;educational privilege.</p> <p>To get there, I\u2019d had to pass the 11-plus and a&#xa0;written test at the school itself. The 11-plus asked me to differentiate between vegetables and fruit, while the entrance exam asked me to write an account of the battle of Waterloo. That was how they weeded out the merely bright from those who were both bright and aspirational for the distinct social role we were to play.</p> <p>As the Tories prepare to reinstate selection at 11, it is worth remembering that grammar schools were only the second tier of a three-tier caste system, carefully moulded on to the workforce stratifications of the postwar era.</p> <p>At Thornleigh Salesian College, Bolton, in the 1970s, we were encouraged to think about university, but only a tiny minority were groomed for Oxbridge. As a result, when I meet my classmates, I find mainly technocrats: two chief fire officers, a senior police officer, a senior civil servant, a few top engineers. Our annual visit to the local private school, so they could destroy us at rugby union and then clap us politely into afternoon tea, revealed that theirs was a different world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/working-class-grammar-school-theresa-may-inequality\">I was a working-class grammar school pupil \u2013 our success is built off those left behind | Frances Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This three-tier system was functional in that the economy needed clever, skilled people to do the top layer of manual jobs; managers to organise and innovate; and an elite to do the higher&#xa0;brainwork.</p> <p>As demand increased after 1945 for white-collar workers and middle managers, the country needed significant numbers of working-class kids to \u201cescape\u201d the world of semi-literacy into the ranks of the salariat.

So, in every class of 30 kids, there were maybe five who went to grammar, and two or three who should have, but did not. It was cruel, but for a couple of decades, supply matched demand.

Or almost always. She took two looks before she was sure. She first saw him swim when he was 14, just after he\u2019d joined the City of Derby club. Peaty was swimming freestyle, badly, plowing his way up and down the slow lane. Marshall didn\u2019t reckon much of him until he switched to breaststroke, and then she knew, straight away. She could see it in the strength of his lunge and the steady line he held through the water. </p> <p>Marshall, who won 15 medals in her own international career, persuaded Peaty to commit to the breaststroke. But talent wasn\u2019t enough on its own. It never is. And in 2012, Peaty wasn\u2019t even close to the best breaststrokers in Britain. He finished 10h in the 100m at the national championships in April 2012, and wasn\u2019t anywhere near making the Olympic team.</p> <p>Peaty has said himself that he lacked the dedication he needed to succeed. In swimming, success costs a lot. All those hours in the pool, the starts at sunrise each morning and the twilight finishes every night, they leave little time for schoolwork or socialising. And while Peaty may have been happy enough to slack off one of the two, the other felt a harder sacrifice to make. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"636d1c416e07d63dd21d90f876f48da3eb724d2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/636d1c416e07d63dd21d90f876f48da3eb724d2a/0_0_5040_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Peaty celebrates with his gold medal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Peaty celebrates with his gold medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later in 2012, during the Olympics, Peaty was just getting ready to go out \u2013 to \u201cget drunk in a field or something stupid like that\u201d \u2013 when he flicked on his phone to check what was happening in the swimming. He saw that his mate Craig Benson had made the semi-finals in Peaty\u2019s favourite event, the 100m breaststroke. And that was the moment everything changed.</p> <p>They knew each other well from the junior circuit. Benson is only eight months older than Peaty, but back then he was so much better. \u201cIt was like a \u2018what am I doing with my life?\u2019 kind of moment,\u201d Peaty said later. \u201cFrom then, I watched all the Olympics and said to myself that I would make the next one. That was my defining moment, to stop messing about and get my head down.\u201d </p> <p>He dropped out of college and started training full time. He married his incredible natural talent and impressively cool temper to an intense commitment to training. Back at the British National Championships the next year, Peaty finished third in the 100m breaststroke. A month later, he broke the minute barrier for the very first time at the National Youth Championships. In the circles of British swimming, people were starting to talk about his prospects.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/08/adam-peatys-gran-on-swimming-gold-i-went-ballistic-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qxmn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2638868\"            data-video-name=\"Adam Peaty's gran on swimming gold: I went ballistic \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITV Good Morning Britain\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a83908e4b033cb0795dfa1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808PEATYGRANNY3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/08/160808PEATYGRANNY3.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/08/160808PEATYGRANNY3_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/08/160808PEATYGRANNY3_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/08/160808PEATYGRANNY3_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/08/adam-peatys-gran-on-swimming-gold-i-went-ballistic-video\">Adam Peaty\u2019s gran on swimming gold: I went ballistic</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Everyone else caught on one night at the Tollcross pool in Glasgow, during the Commonwealth Games in 2014. That was when Peaty had to race for the first time against his idol Van der Burgh, the Olympic champion. Peaty was only 19, but he beat Van der Burgh, and broke the Games\u2019 record. After that he didn\u2019t look back. At the European Championships the next month he won four gold medals, then in 2015 he broke Van der Burgh\u2019s world record at the British Championship. Later that year he won three gold medals at the World Championships in Kazan, and then four more at the European Championships this spring. </p> <p>Now he has the one that matters most of all. In the space of four years Peaty has gone from being just another British swimmer to the Olympic champion. Right now, the 21-year-old Peaty is one of the most impressive competitors in the country, in any sport.</p>",
  "<p>Hinkley Point C, the multibillion pound nuclear deal, years in the making, is on the cusp of unravelling. At the last minute, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval\">the government has hit the pause button</a> in order to take a hard look at what Hinkley is offering in return for \u00a337bn of energy consumers\u2019 money.</p> <p>The voices of opposition are growing. Even newspapers which have supported the nuclear industry are raising doubts. <br></p> <p>Its supporters chant the same mantra: there is no alternative, Britain needs Hinkley to keep the lights on. That was the warning from the then business secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/edf.britishenergygroup\">John Hutton, in 2008</a> yet the lights are still on and Lord Hutton is now the chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association.</p> <p>But the world - and the electricity landscape - has changed radically since 2008.</p> <p>Then, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228866/7686.pdf\">just 5.5%</a> of the UK\u2019s electricity came from renewables. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/24/renewable-energy-outstrips-coal-for-first-time-in-uk-electricity-mix\">It\u2019s now 25%</a>.

The cost for wind and solar is coming down too. <br></p> <p>The way we increasingly get our energy is changing. The former chief executive of the National Grid, Steve Holliday, said that the idea that we need nuclear power stations to provide baseload electricity <a href=\"http://www.energypost.eu/interview-steve-holliday-ceo-national-grid-idea-large-power-stations-baseload-power-outdated/\">is \u201coutdated\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>Baseload is the trump card of Hinkley\u2019s supporters: how do we keep the lights on when the sun isn\u2019t shining and the wind isn\u2019t blowing? But the National Grid predicts<a href=\"http://www.powerresponsive.com/viewpoints/internet-of-things-meeting-the-uk-s-grid-balancing-needs/\"> that in some scenarios by 2020, small-scale </a>and distributed generation will represent a third of total capacity in the UK. The future is more local and in our control. It will also provide more jobs and greater energy security at increasingly lower cost.</p> <p>Intermittent supply is already being tackled with interconnectors - basically, huge cables connecting the UK with European countries like Norway to manage variations in supply coming from renewables. They could be hugely expanded. But renewables and interconnectors are only part of the answer.</p> <p>Electricity demand is not constant. At peak times, there can be up to <a href=\"http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/09/21/4-ways-the-uk-can-get-almost-all-its-power-from-renewables/\">50% more demand</a> compared to the average \u2013 typically when people get home from work in the early evening and prepare their evening meal, especially in winter.</p> <p>This demand needs to be met with power generation which can be switched on, sometimes at very short notice. Hydropower does this \u2013 with reservoirs in places like Scotland, Wales and Sweden being filled up at a time of low demand, so water can be released through turbines when demand is high.</p> <p>Existing gas-fired plants can also be fired up at short notice, but this comes with a carbon cost. The point is to use it only when back up is required and only until alternatives become mainstream.</p> <p>The real leap forward will come with improved storage. </p> <p>You can also look at energy demand another way.<br></p> <p>Rather than building lots of extra capacity to meet intermittent peaks, could those peaks be lower by shutting down demand where and when it\u2019s not needed?</p> <p>Google and Tesla are already experimenting with smart energy \u2013 managing how gadgets are switched on and off. </p> <p>Energy systems and the thinking behind them are changing fast. What happened in just a few years with telephones - where we moved from centralised exchanges and fixed landlines to mobile phones - is about to happen with energy systems. Hinkley is a roadblock in this transition.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the Cinderella of them all - energy efficiency. The less we use, the easier the problem is to solve. If all street lights were switched to LED bulbs we could take half a GW of demand off the grid with ease.</p> <p>If all homes did the same, we\u2019d save 2.7GW of power at peak use - that\u2019s nearly the equivalent of Hinkley by just changing the lightbulbs. </p> <p>The UK has come a long way since 2008 \u2013 the year parliament passed the Climate Change Act, which committed the UK to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. We are already halfway there with emissions down 40%.</p> <p>A low-carbon future is essential. So is energy security and affordable energy. If we are to deliver on all three, there is a huge investment opportunity across renewable energy, interconnectors, energy storage, smart grids and energy efficiency. We mustn\u2019t squander that money and opportunity on Hinkley Point C.</p> <p>\u2022 We would like to publish your ideas about how to power Britain.

  "<p>Women often have complicated feelings about hen parties. Modern feminism fights on many fronts, some more serious than others: consent, online abuse, equal pay, Kim Kardashian v Taylor Swift. But the hen party straddles the line between the serious and the (seemingly) frivolous. On the one hand, it suggests questions about a woman\u2019s place in the outdated rituals of courtship \u2013 has she really done everything \u201cright\u201d if she doesn\u2019t have a weekend of contrived abandon before settling down? On the other, someone is waving a penis straw and grinding up against a bouncer. It is hard to know what to think.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/25/strip-club-pole-dancing-children-stigma-olympic-sport\">From strip clubs to sports halls: the reinvention of pole dancing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Part of the problem is that hen dos seem to turn modern, liberal women into monsters. Women in their 20s and 30s, most of whom have been having sex, capably, for more than a decade, become squeamish and giggly, talking crudely about appendages. Women who would normally rail against sexual objectification start squeezing the buttocks of spry young strippers. Those who might usually be happiest wearing stylish, muted tones suddenly insist on contrived, kaleidoscopic themes. \u201cStars and stripes and polka dots,\u201d read the email to one friend from a maid of honour this week.</p> <p>\u201cWe hired two naked butlers,\u201d admits Haxie Meyers-Belkin, 26, who went to the hen do of a close university friend earlier this year. \u201cThis was a bunch of highly educated, capable women squealing at the tired, predictable, rehearsed innuendo spouted by these two young men.\u201d</p> <p>So far, so tacky. But it\u2019s all fun and games, and objecting too much can feel po-faced. Indeed, Meyers-Belkin rejects the idea that there is much to intellectualise. \u201cReally, it was such fun. It was obviously ridiculous: the bride\u2019s mum got a lap dance. It\u2019s about girls being silly, and not much else.\u201d</p> <p>And it is. All the performative sexuality and exuberance is intended as a celebration of female friendship, an opportunity for female bonding and nights that end in deep, meaningful chats over large amounts of wine. It is almost a rite of passage: it is easy to parody because the expected roles and behaviour are so established.</p> <p>On the other hand, gendered celebrations feel regressive. Granted, that applies to stag dos, too, but historic gender imbalances add an extra dimension. \u201cIt used to be a send-off into married life, which meant a sex life,\u201d says Kate Leaver, 28. \u201cBut now that couples generally have sex before marriage, it doesn\u2019t have to be an initiation ceremony for virgins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes, I find the whole celebration about becoming a wife a bit hard to swallow,\u201d agrees Ella Lewis, 28. \u201cIt just seems to me like they\u2019re celebrating losing a bit of their identity and individuality. Which seems really outdated.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3384122d0308bb1eafcfc7a9af819399fe36a780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3384122d0308bb1eafcfc7a9af819399fe36a780/0_0_3464_5187/668.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It becomes a bunch of highly educated, capable women squealing at tired, predictable, rehearsed innuendo\u2019\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It becomes a bunch of highly educated, capable women squealing at tired, predictable, rehearsed innuendo.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cultura/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hen do demands that women sequester themselves away for a night, or even a whole weekend. Being separated, by mandate, from \u201cthe men\u201d is also strange: some of these women are probably total strangers, whereas close male friends are excluded simply on the grounds of gender.</p> <p>One of the reasons why hen dos can feel so uncomfortable is that you are not slurping out of willy straws with your best friends: you are often doing it with a group of girls whom you don\u2019t really know (sometimes the girlfriends of your friends, or distant family members) \u2013 and one of them is uploading pictures of it all to Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of hen parties, I\u2019ve had to do a shot of tequila off a topless man\u2019s torso in front of my sister, my sister-in-law and my stepmother,\u201d says Leaver. And the parties are expensive: one friend is spending almost \u00a3500 on a hen do in Amsterdam. She doesn\u2019t even have her own room.</p> <p>Marriage is also shifting, which makes hens seem all the more outdated. How do gay couples approach heterosexual rituals such as hens and stags? \u201cWeddings and hen dos have been among the most rigidly heteronormative experiences of my life,\u201d agrees Alice Shepherd, 30. \u201cI find it really funny how in the cold light of day, I would be kind of appalled at the idea of buying any kind of penis-related novelty item, yet when you are organising or attending a hen do, it is an incredibly difficult thing to avoid. One of the main photos I have from my friend\u2019s hen do is of me and another bridesmaid brandishing penis straws and lollies at each other. We are both lesbians.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/06/bad-moms-behave-badly\">Mums behaving badly: films take aim at the myth of the perfect parent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are many complicated reasons for the resurgence in modern feminism. Traditions such as hen parties, that play so heavily to gendered type, seem like exactly the sort of thing this new movement hopes to overwrite. But can, and should, modern feminists seek to reshape the ritual?</p> <p>\u201cIn the past five years, hen parties have had a bit of a facelift,\u201d says Beth Nicholas, a founder of <a href=\"http://www.bettysbirds.com/\">Betty\u2019s Birds</a>, which organises hen dos. \u201cWe\u2019ve started having girly weekends away with our friends, instead of one night of hectic drinking, with feather boas, willy straws and L-plates. Mostly, [women] are celebrating marriage and friendships with weekends in the countryside or visiting popular hen-party cities, such as Bath or Bristol.\u201d</p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t feel as if what Nicholas is describing qualifies as much of a shift. It still insists on a divide between men and women. Weekends in the countryside with the girls are simply a PG<strong> </strong>version of the raunchy, naughty hen do. Many modern women would usually still roll their eyes at the idea of afternoon tea at a country hotel. Again, it suggests that the hen party encourages a strange identity crisis: women default either to ladette traditions, or to typically \u201cgirly\u201d activities because they are not really sure what the alternative is.</p> <p>So what could it be? The only genuinely revolutionary shift that Nicholas describes is in the increase in the number of \u201csten\u201d parties she caters for: stag and hen parties combined. One friend called her version a \u201cshag\u201d do: she took a mixed group of friends to an Airbnb, and they spent the weekend getting drunk on their own terms and playing hide and seek in the huge grounds. Another did away with her hen night altogether, and waited, instead, until after her wedding in Italy, when a mixed group of friends stayed on in a big house for a holiday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"351579378affa76a1285669e5a739f037865691a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/351579378affa76a1285669e5a739f037865691a/0_0_4992_3328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Women default either to ladette traditions, or to typically \u201cgirly\u201d activities because they are not really sure what the alternative is.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Women default either to ladette traditions, or to typically \u201cgirly\u201d activities because they are not really sure what the alternative is.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A real change would be welcome. Every stage seems to bring out the worst stereotypes about women: the passive-aggressive email chains before the event, the competitiveness to show you are closest to the bride; outdoing nominal friends to give the better present. Remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/23/bridesmaids-review\">the Kristen Wiig film Bridesmaids</a>? It\u2019s funny because it is a (barely) exaggerated version of all these impulses.</p> <p>Penis straws and strippers make it feel as if you are trying to match lad culture play for play. L-plates are brash and silly, but the metaphor riffs ultimately on the idea of inexperience (which is a little sinister). On the other hand, afternoon tea is a reversion to a genteel, sanitised and antiquated version of femininity. Why not just go to the pub or throw a boozy dinner? Think about how you would usually celebrate: birthday parties don\u2019t inspire a dizzy, frenzied identity crisis. They rarely cause arguments between friends and strangers. You can keep it all-female if you want, but refusing some of the traditions in favour of forging your own might also put an end to some of those unpleasant behaviours, like snarky emails and WhatsApp chains.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/term-crazy-shouldnt-be-thrown-around-lightly-ask-any-woman\">The term 'crazy' shouldn't be thrown around lightly \u2013 ask any woman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, though, of the two schools of hen do tradition, penis paraphernalia may well be more progressive. Feminism is ultimately about equality, and playing at a version of lad culture means well (even if the Facebook photos are pretty embarrassing). In their 2008 paper, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687630801920872?journalCode=idep20\">Hen Parties: Bonding or Brawling?</a>, academics Adam Eldridge and Marion Roberts explore the hen party as a \u201csite of transgression, empowerment and female bonding, and \u2026 a unique opportunity to explore women\u2019s shifting attitudes to late-night culture.\u201d Perhaps mimicking the boys is, in fact, perfectly in line with modern feminism.</p> <p>And maybe we <em>would</em> be losing something if it all changed. A hen do is a rare occasion when women hang out with other women, which is not by definition regressive. Enjoying female company doesn\u2019t mean you are defaulting to an outdated, gendered version of friendship. Spending time with a large group of women \u2013 friends or otherwise \u2013 obviously doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t a feminist.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, hen dos are a neat metaphor for the identity crisis of the modern woman: we are more sure of ourselves, but old-school ceremonies and expectations can still throw us off our game. Are we Madonnas having petits fours, or whores waving straws?

  "<p>\u2018Everyone talks about the soundtrack to their lives,\u201d says Lauren Conrad in the opening of The Hills: That Was Then, This Is Now \u2013 the 10-year anniversary special of the reality TV hit that screened over the weekend. And during its six-season run, The Hills itself was the backing track to the latter part of the noughties: it told the story of a zeitgeist and the nature of modern-day celebrity, and its legacy lives on in the structured reality genre that dominates TV schedules today.</p> <p>Created by Adam DiVello and Liz Gateley, the series blended a kind of aspirational drama with the \u201creal lives\u201d of its protagonists. Episodes were cut seamlessly together, with no acknowledgement of the cameras and no breaking of the fourth wall. There were full-season story arcs, mixed with single-episode ones \u2013 a fashion show or video shoot \u2013 which lent a strong narrative drive. While many of the shorter plots clearly betrayed the hand of the production team, the longer storylines \u2013 of faltering friendships and burgeoning romances \u2013 were the tales of real lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"101b6571b04386259499965aaf44987fed79906c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/101b6571b04386259499965aaf44987fed79906c/0_0_2312_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whitney Port, Lauren Conrad and Stephanie Pratt at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whitney Port, Lauren Conrad and Stephanie Pratt at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Baron/BEI / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Hills was born from Gateley\u2019s previous show, Laguna Beach. Subtitled The Real Orange County, it was created to tell the \u201creal\u201d story behind Josh Schwartz\u2019s hit teen drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2007/apr/19/sothisisitthen\">The OC</a>. Like The Hills, Laguna merged storytelling with reality to create a new kind of fiction, neither documentary nor drama, but something in between. The first series was narrated by Lauren Conrad, one of a group of kids who went to Laguna Beach High, and followed her as she hung out on the beaches of the OC during her senior year, drinking beers around bonfires, hiring out hotel rooms for fairly tame parties, and putting on fashion shows for charity. When Lauren announced she would be heading to Hollywood to intern at Teen Vogue, the producers were keen to follow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/19/reality-tv-is-dead-ruined-by-reality-itself-eva-wiseman\">Reality TV is dead, ruined by reality itself</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Heidi Montag, a friend Lauren had made while studying fashion in San Francisco, was a shoo-in for her co-star. The small-town girl from Crested Butte, Colorado, seemed worlds away from Lauren\u2019s haut monde, but she quickly adapted, and was ready to try her luck in Hollywood. The pair would share an apartment in the modest Hillside Villas, where, seemingly organically (though actually set up by the production team), they would meet Audrina Patridge, an aspiring model/actress/whatever. Whitney Port, meanwhile, had independently secured herself an internship at Teen Vogue, and would share an office with Lauren. With her long legs and sometimes dubious fashion choices, Whitney quickly became a fan favourite and would go on to star in her own spin-off reality show, The City.</p> <p>And so the scene was set for a series featuring sun-kissed girls in halterneck tops and oversized sunglasses, hanging out by the pool of the Roosevelt Hotel, sipping weak cocktails and gossiping about their inner circle. Their jobs acted as a cover for their actual TV-star roles, and had the added bonus of allowing them backstage at music gigs and fashion shows, where they would dress Lady Gaga or alphabetise showcards for Marc Jacobs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"385ee3b380b55cee28b9825f4a1cac4001ede12c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/385ee3b380b55cee28b9825f4a1cac4001ede12c/0_9_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Hills, circa season six\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hills, circa season six.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MTV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet as The Hills went on, the dissonance between what was shown on screen and what was happening off it became greater. The raging success of the show meant the girls were red-carpet regulars who appeared on <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/are-they-for-real-20080515\">the cover of Rolling Stone</a>, while still maintaining the fiction that they were interns or receptionists. The reality became less and less real.</p> <p>Spencer Pratt, one of a long line of cynical reality TV manipulators, had wormed his way into the series by romantically targeting the cast, accompanied by Brody Jenner (stepbrother to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\">Kardashian sisters</a> and half-brother of Kendall and Kylie Jenner \u2013 a family whose own inescapable reality show owes a debt of gratitude to The Hills). Spencer\u2019s attempts to control the action of the show, ruining Lauren and Heidi\u2019s friendship in the process, saw the series morph from an aspirational tale of Hollywood high life to an artificial, low-rent relationship drama.</p> <p>Spencer would go on to marry Heidi, and, in the special, Lauren admits that her awkward flirtations with Brody were encouraged by a production team who wanted her to have a \u201clove interest\u201d.

While she used the special as an opportunity to publicise her successful career in design, Speidi, as Spencer and Heidi rebranded themselves, were sidelined, underlining their Z-list status. They have become a reality TV cautionary tale, as their blurring of on-screen and off-screen personas resulted in disastrous and psychologically damaging real-life decisions. Heidi would go on to have 10 cosmetic surgery procedures in one day, become estranged from her family, and embark on an ill-advised pop career, backed by her self-styled Svengali husband.</p> <p>The show ended in 2010 with a controversially meta reveal. As the camera lingers on Brody, behind him a set is pulled away, revealing a studio lot where the backdrop of the Hollywood sign is fake.

There were glimpses of the Uruguayan\u2019s capabilities against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/losangelesgalaxy\">LA Galaxy</a> the week before, yet in central Florida he produced a showcase of his full range. This performance underlined how one exceptional player can elevate an entire team, and there is no doubt that Lodeiro is exceptional.</p> <p>Clint Dempsey claimed the match ball, and the headlines, with a hat-trick in the 3-1 victory, but that was largely down to Lodeiro. Well, technically two of his three goals were down to Jordan Morris, but the performance of the sometimes maligned rookie was certainly down to Lodeiro. The Uruguayan\u2019s position on the right side of Seattle\u2019s front four freed up space for Morris, which he used to record four \u201cbig chances\u201d, as Opta calls them, a record high for any MLS player this season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/mls-weekend-preview-alejandro-bedoya-philadelphia-union\">MLS weekend preview: Alejandro Bedoya could be signing of the season</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/mls-weekend-preview-alejandro-bedoya-philadelphia-union\">Just a few days ago I wrote</a> about how the signing of Lodeiro could see Dempsey strike up the kind of attacking partnership he enjoyed over the past couple of seasons with Obafemi Martins, but in truth the arrival of the former Ajax playmaker could have the biggest impact on Morris. Lodeiro\u2019s creativity around the edge of the box has given the Sounders a new dimension, but his greatest quality is that he makes others around him better, none more so than Morris.</p> <p>Statistically, it\u2019s difficult to quantify just how important Lodeiro has already become to this Seattle team. While he notched not one assist or goal on Sunday, he made two secondary assists. Those contributions often go uncharted in soccer, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are any less significant. In some cases they are the most important transition in an attacking move, and Lodeiro is excellent at producing them. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillParchman/status/762459571294130176\">As Will Parchman said on Twitter</a>, he is the footballing equivalent of Jon Favreau\u2019s character in Swingers \u2013 the guy behind the guy.</p> <p>Seattle needed a result like the one they got against Orlando City. Their season has faltered before it ever really got going, winning just two of their last 12 league outings before Sunday\u2019s game at the Citrus Bowl. Sigi Schmid paid for such dismal form with his job and now Lodeiro is doing his best to ensure the Sounders don\u2019t concede their entire season. His signing could prove to be a watershed moment for the club, not just in the context of the 2016 seasons but in seasons to come too. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>Marsch sees red as Red Bulls drop points on the road</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps Jesse Marsch has a point after all.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/newyorkredbulls\">Red Bulls</a> boss has had his problems with MLS officials this season. In his most recent stump against PRO, Marsch paid the price for suggesting officials make calls to protect ageing designated players. That pre-NYC FC rant worked in his favor en route to an impressive victory. </p> <p>But the animated Marsch felt the wrath of the officials for his on-field critiques on Sunday night.<br></p> <p>Marsch was ejected late in the Red Bulls-Galaxy 2-2 draw after referees failed to reward his team on not one, but two clearcut penalty chances. The uncalled penalty shouts, along with a string of physical tackles and outright injuries, drove the Red Bulls boss to his limit, resulting in his ejection just shy of extra time. </p> <p>As he received his marching papers, an animated Marsch hugged fourth official Kevin Stott on his way to the locker room, clearly fuming from another frustrating road encounter.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear to see how the Red Bulls head coach reached that boiling point. He was forced to make three substitutions within the first 47 minutes \u2013 all due to injuries. First, it was Damien Perrinelle collapsing on a foul from Jeff Lawrentowicz. It was arguably a yellow card-worthy tackle but the Galaxy midfielder managed to leave that scrap with a simple foul \u2013 his only call of the game. Connor Lade was next, suffering a knee injury that required an ice wrap \u2013 and a towel to bite on for the pain. Rounding out the wounded, Bradley Wright-Phillips requested a sub just two minutes into the second.</p> <p>That string of bad news did lead to some positivity. The oft-overlooked Gonzalo Ver\u00f3n got extended minutes at the pinnacle of the attack and made the best of his opportunity. A rainbow chip over Brian Rowe put his side up 1-0. Six minutes later, Sean Davis, in for the injured Dax McCarty, showed his class with his first-ever MLS goal, doubling New York\u2019s lead.</p> <p>But as has been the case for the Red Bulls this season, they were unable to close out the road result \u2013 only this time, it wasn\u2019t entirely their fault. </p> <p>Mike Magee cut New York\u2019s lead in half with 10 minutes to go. Then, opportunity arose for New York. Brian Rowe fouled Alex Muyl in the box, challenging on a late ball. Despite the foul, no PK was given. Then, it was Ver\u00f3n getting tripped up by Rowe mere feet from head official Hilario Grejada. Again, no call. No PK.<br></p> <p>But the ensuing goal from Ashley Cole is what set Marsch off. Had either of the previous calls gone New York\u2019s way, the Red Bulls would have had a better chance to leave LA with a rare three points. Instead, Marsch and his men head back to Harrison feeling like they left two behind. <strong>DM</strong><br></p> <h2>Fire in a hole as Open Cup beckons</h2> <p>While Saturday night marked another milestone for Nick Rimando\u2019s career, let\u2019s not forget: every away match without a win only further carves the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chicago-fire\">Chicago Fire</a>\u2019s name into Major League Soccer\u2019s history books.</p> <p>The Fire\u2019s 3-1 loss against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/realsaltlake\">Real Salt Lake</a> at Rio Tinto not only furthered their unenviable position as the worst team in Major League Soccer, but it also extended their winless run on the road to 36 matches \u2013 a record that dates all the way back to 12 July 2014 (a 1-0 win over the Revolution).</p> <p>That is an unbelievable number when you think about it. The streak spans three MLS seasons, three calendar years, three Chicago Fire coaches and a total of 747 days. In fact, the last time the Fire tasted victory on the road, Ellen Degeneres introduced Oscar-watching baby boomers to the magic of a selfie and Justin Bieber earned his troubled child-star badge with an arrest for DUI \u2013 with a tabloid tickling mugshot to boot!</p> <p>Never mind that the Fire are coming off of an impressive 2-2 draw at home against the highly touted New York Red Bulls or the fact that they have actually been competitive in most matches this year. Saturday\u2019s match was a chance to end that streak for good. </p> <p>Instead, the Fire seemed content to go through the motions, happy to wrap up another pointless road trip in order to prepare for their vital US Open Cup semi-final match against the Revolution on Tuesday. </p> <p>And can you blame them? It isn\u2019t like the MLS regular season will produce any kind of glory for this beaten-down bunch. As odd as it seems, this Fire team was looking past RSL \u2013 and all the proof you need came in the first goal. A flatfooted Fire backline watched on as a slow-rolling 25-yard shot from Olmes Garc\u00eda skipped past the defense, beating a slow-to-react Matt Lampson to open the scoring. </p> <p>A boneheaded PK made it 2-0 within the first 30 minutes. By the start of the second half, David Accam and Michael de Leeuw were pulled out of the match, with Tuesday on the mind. Arturo \u00c1lvarez\u2019s 58th-minute goal breathed life into the bunch, but it was a fleeting moment. Nick Rimando made sure of that. </p> <p>Paunovic\u2019s initial insertion of Accam and De Leeuw to the starting XI signaled a competitive tone to this encounter, but the team\u2019s response told another story. By the end of the 90, Chicago added another blemish to their already unsightly record.</p> <p>But this time, there was no question about their motivation. As if their 4-11-6 record wasn\u2019t indicator enough, this Saturday\u2019s performance proves where Chicago\u2019s priorities lie: it\u2019s US Open Cup or bust. <strong>DM</strong></p> <h2><strong>Nick Rimando is the unheralded great of his goalkeeping generation</strong></h2> <p>There are theories that attempt to explain why the USA is so prolific at producing exceptional goalkeepers, but regardless of how they are made there is no doubting the quality of the country\u2019s shot-stoppers over the past decade or so. There was Kasey Keller, then Tim Howard, then Brad Guzan, all with a background in Major League Soccer. Nick Rimando, however, is the unheralded great of the contingent.</p> <p>Of course, North American soccer fans are familiar with the brilliance of the Real Salt Lake keeper, but having played his entire career in the States the 37-year-old seems doomed to never receive the credit he truly deserves. Maybe that will change now he\u2019s a record-breaker, with Rimando picking up his 181st MLS win against the Chicago Fire on Saturday. No player in league history has won that many games.</p> <p>The RSL number one was already number one in terms of MLS shutouts (126) and has now made more starting appearances and played more minutes than anyone else in the North American top flight, with Rimando surely now running out of space on his walls for another framed record. He is a bona fide legend of the league.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t achieve that record by doing one thing,\u201d gushed Jeff Cassar after the win over Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s many things. It\u2019s being a leader. It\u2019s being unbelievable at your craft. He\u2019s come up big so many times for this club in moments when it\u2019s shootouts and big saves. He\u2019s a leader in the way he approaches the game and he\u2019s just gotten better and better.\u201d</p> <p>Rather bizarrely, Rimando has never picked up the league\u2019s Goalkeeper of the Year honour, but he is MLS\u2019s goalkeeper of the decade following stints with the Miami Fusion, DC United and of course Real Salt Lake. At just 5ft 10in he is somewhat short for a goalkeeper, particularly in the modern age, but he more than makes up for that in terms of reflexes, presence and experience. He is an anomaly in many ways, but a gloriously consistent one.</p> <p>With just three more outings Rimando will tie the record for the most MLS appearances in total, with the 37-year-old needing 45 more saves to claim the record in that column as well. Some claim MLS lacks enough strong figureheads and icons to build narrative from, but they don\u2019t come much more iconic than Rimando. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>Kei Kamara and New England Revolution a less than perfect match</strong></h2> <p>It should have been the perfect signing for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/newenglandrevolution\">New England Revolution</a>. With Jay Heaps in need of a frontman to lead his attacking line, he couldn\u2019t have found a better candidate than Kei Kamara to perform that role. What\u2019s more, they signed him for nothing more than targeted and allocation money of just over $300,000, opportunistically capitalising on a turbulent situation at the Columbus Crew. The theory behind the move hasn\u2019t quite matched up with the reality, though.</p> <p>Indeed, Kamara hasn\u2019t had the impact that was predicted of him for the Revolution. Saturday\u2019s 4-1 defeat to Toronto FC was something of a nadir in New England\u2019s season, and while the loss certainly couldn\u2019t be attributed to the striker there was little to suggest Kamara is any closer to being the player his team so badly needs him to be.</p> <p>Kamara\u2019s scoring record since joining from Columbus isn\u2019t the worst, although four goals from 12 games isn\u2019t the mark of the league\u2019s most dangerous frontman. The issue with the Sierra Leone international at the Revs is more of a stylistic one. He has become something of a misfit at his new club, with New England reluctant to play quickly through the lines of transition as the Crew did so effectively last season.</p> <p>While Columbus would cross it into the box early, allowing Kamara to attack the ball without breaking his stride on the run, the Revolution are more likely to delay their delivery, with the Sierra Leone striker not as effective from a standing start. Heaps\u2019s side simply aren\u2019t playing to Kamara\u2019s strengths and that is detrimental to everyone involved. The 31-year-old is among the league\u2019s best at attacking crosses, getting in between the opposition defense, causing general mayhem in the attacking third. The Revs, however, aren\u2019t allowing him to do that.</p> <p>New England, in fact, become a more predictable, one-dimensional outfit since the signing of the forward from Columbus three months ago. Against TFC at BMO Field that was exposed, with Sebastian Giovinco netting his second hat-trick in his last four outings as the Revs fell way short of the required standard. The Italian edged out Kamara for last season\u2019s MVP award, but the two players have enjoyed differing fortunes since. That contrast was clear for all to see on Saturday. <strong>GR</strong></p>",

For me, as a man, the sense of culpability was overpowering. Qandeel\u2019s murder was engendered by a deeply unequal patriarchal order participated in by Pakistani men across class, religion and ethnicity, in wilful ignorance of the unending physical, emotional and ideological violence it inflicts on women every day. </p> <p>From birth, we men find ourselves afforded advantages in all spheres of life, from the prioritisation of our education, to unregulated access to public space, to lopsided inheritance rights, to a culturally sanctioned lifelong freedom from the responsibility of household work. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Honour' is the currency of a patriarchal order, structured to sustain men\u2019s preeminence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Few men acknowledge or renounce these privileges, and the consequence is huge gender disparities in all walks of life.

In our national discourse, \u201chonour\u201d killings are labelled as a cultural aberration committed in backward rural communities. </p> <p>But honour crimes are not simply a consequence of religious dogma. Honour is the currency of a patriarchal order, structured by society and state to sustain men\u2019s preeminence while ensuring that hierarchical clan, caste and class identities are maintained at the expense of women\u2019s autonomy and selfhood. It was the intersection of Qandeel\u2019s gender with her working class and ethnic minority background (the identity she was accused by her brother of betraying) that made her transgressions particularly dangerous.</p> <p>A patriarchal system legitimises itself by hiding the reality of its systemic injustices.

  "<p>Darren Clarke may have another Ryder Cup rookie in his team at Hazeltine next month after Russell Knox of Scotland became a two-time winner on the US PGA Tour this season and pushed his name further forward for consideration to represent Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/jim-furyk-golf-pga-tour-record-58\">Golfer Jim Furyk sets record low score for PGA Tour with first 58 in history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarke\u2019s side already looks likely to be heavy laden with Ryder Cup virgins and Knox has to make the top nine to qualify as of right \u2013 the leading four names <a href=\"http://www.europeantour.com/rydercup/points/\" title=\"\">from the European points</a> list on 28 August not otherwise qualified, with five from the world points list \u2013 but Knox sank a 12ft putt at the final hole to win the Travelers Championship by a shot on Sunday and enhance his chances of making it on the plane to Minnesota.</p> <p>Knox carries British and US passports but the 31-year-old considers himself to be Scottish. \u201cMy dad was born in California so I have dual nationality,\u201d the Inverness-born golfer said after shooting a two-under 68 to finish on a 14-under 266 at TPC River Highlands. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s ever been someone in my position before but I\u2019m Scottish down to the core so I\u2019ll be on team Europe hopefully.\u201d</p> <p>Knox won the Travelers after getting up-and-down from a greenside bunker at the final hole to edge out the 49-year-old American Jerry Kelly, who signed for a 64 then after seeing the Scot drop a shot at par-three 16th went to the range and hit a few putts. After the Scot had produced a wild drive into the crowd deep in the right rough at the 18th when he needed par to win, Kelly, who won the last of his three PGA Tour titles in 2009, settled down in front of a TV to see his fate.</p> <p>Knox\u2019s second shot found the bunker and after he chipped from the sand and holed the difficult putt, the Scot launched his cap across the green. \u201cThat putt, I\u2019ll remember that one for ever,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like the Incredible Hulk when it went in. I could have ripped my shirt off.\u201d</p> <p>Only five Europeans are ahead of Knox in the world rankings now \u2013 Rory McIlroy, Henrik Stenson, Danny Willett, Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose, and he sits 18th overall, but even if he is not among the nine who make the team automatically, he would hope to be one of the captain\u2019s three picks.</p> <p>\u201cI thought about it [Ryder Cup] on the last tee, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew by winning this tournament it puts Darren Clarke in a very difficult position not to pick me, but it\u2019s his decision. If I make the top nine I deserve to be on the team. If I\u2019m number 10 he can quite happily pass on me and that\u2019s just the way it is. I\u2019d love to be there. It would be a huge honour. Holing nice putts like that obviously helps.\u201d</p> <p>Knox\u2019s breakthrough came by winning the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai in November and this victory came a few hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/jim-furyk-golf-pga-tour-record-58\" title=\"\">Jim Furyk shot the lowest round in PGA Tour history</a>, 58.

Justin Thomas managed a 62 and put together five successive birdies to close out the front nine, finished with nine for the day and at 12-under was tied with Patrick Rodgers for third place.</p> <p>Padraig Harrington shot a 75, finished at one-under and slipped to 131st in the FedEx Cup standings, putting him in danger of missing the play-offs as he heads off to Rio to represent Ireland in the first Olympic golf tournament since 1904.</p> <p>Patrick Reed had the best warm-up of the three US Olympians with a 66 to finish at nine-under par, Matt Kuchar finished with a 65 and was eight under, and the defending champion, Bubba Watson, was on seven under after a 68. \u201cIt was one of those weeks where you could easily see [yourself] playing great next week or the week after,\u201d Watson said after being serenaded from the 18th green with chants of \u201cU-S-A\u201d and boarding a plane for Rio de Janeiro.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Debt</strong>: $4,500</p> <p><strong>Source</strong>: Credit card<br></p> <p><strong>Estimated years until debt free: </strong>Uncertain</p> <p>I work at REI, a store selling outdoor gear, in Seattle. I have worked hard at the co-op since 2014. I am 25 years old. I am in debt and I am barely making it.<br></p> <p>Shortly after I was hired, my rent doubled, like happens to so many other people in Seattle. At a loss, I started saving almost my entire paycheck for rent and used my REI credit card to pay for other bills and food. This went on for a few months while I looked for other solutions, but I could not keep going like this. I got a little bit of help from my mother but ultimately had to end my lease early and move all of my belongings into storage. <br></p> <p>I found a truck I could live in. I could manage a $200/month truck payment and $150/month for storage but there was no way I could afford a bare-minimum $1,100 Seattle apartment with my REI wages.</p> <p>By January 2015, I had about $2,200 in credit debt, built up before leaving my apartment. I was in school full-time while working at REI as many hours as I could, outside of my 40+ hour school schedule. I received student loans and grants which helped supplement my wages. I knew that I had to focus on school to have a shot at a better paying job in the future. Sometimes the most challenging question was: \u201cWhere do I do my homework?\u201d I would stay at cafes until closing, do my homework at the park and wake up by 5am so I could get to the earliest opening cafe to complete my assignments. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/06/tell-us-about-your-life-in-the-red-how-do-you-survive-with-debt\">Tell us about your life in the red: how do you survive with debt?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By July I decided to take time off of school in order to catch up on debt. I got a second job and worked 50-60 hour weeks regularly, often putting in 14-hour days. It seemed as though no matter how hard or how much I worked I was just not able to eliminate my credit card debt. Food spoils quickly without refrigeration so I had to buy costly ready-made meals or fresh foods daily. </p> <p>I applied for food stamps but was denied because I was not on a lease and my income was not going towards an apartment rental payment. I was in this relentless cycle of not being able to afford to live yet the only way out was to continue my education at the risk of more debt. I decided to take the risk of going back to school. I quit my second job and registered for classes again.<br></p> <p>In January 2016 I applied for loans and scholarships through my school. I also supplemented my income by buying food and paying bills with my credit card. I tried to work more hours at REI but I could only get seven hours a week for months. I became desperate for answers on why I was not receiving adequate hours. I was forced to lean again on my credit card to eat and pay for basic essentials. </p> <p>I applied for food stamps again and this time was turned down because I was not working 20 hours per week. Then in June I learned I was inexplicably not awarded with any scholarships even after maintaining a high GPA and being on the dean\u2019s list for multiple quarters in a row.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/will-boyfriend-reject-me-debt\">Will my boyfriend reject me if he finds out about my debt? | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, I am about $4,500 in credit card debt and am finally getting 20-30 hours of work per week.

Not many people know just how many workers like me are struggling on unreliable hours and poverty wages. Not many people know that my employer opposed Seattle\u2019s groundbreaking $15 minimum wage law.<br></p> <p>But that is beginning to change. When my fellow workers and I founded REI Employees for Real Change, and worked with council member Kshama Sawant and United Food and Commercial Workers International Union to organize our public meeting at City Hall this month, we got our bosses\u2019 attention. But also the attention of whole lot of the Seattle media. We recently learned that a number of the demands we organized around will be met \u2013 not just for us but also for workers at REI stores outside of Seattle. <br></p> <p>It\u2019s not over yet. We need to make sure get what we\u2019re promised, like a $15 minimum wage starting in August, better scheduling with more notice on hours and immediate cost of living adjustments. And we need to make sure no one is punished for organizing at our workplace, while we keep fighting for a union at REI.</p> <p>As for me, it will take time to pull myself out of debt. <br></p> <p>And it will take time to finish school.

  "<p>At the dawn of my national newspaper career I recall the night editor at the Daily Mail\u2019s Manchester office saying that readers love to read about money, meaning other people\u2019s money.</p> <p>He was admonishing me, a novice subeditor, because I had deleted what I thought was an irrelevant reference to the supposed value of a house in a story about a sacked headmaster. <br></p> <p>I soon came to realise that house prices, no matter how incongruous to the substantive story, should always be published. As should salaries, the prices of cars and the estimated costs of clothing. </p> <p>We journalists must never forget the enduring interest among our readers of that deadly sin known as envy. Money was a seller. And, needless to say, the bigger the money, the greater the appeal. </p> <p>Nor was this merely tabloid lore. All social classes are fascinated by what people earn and own, as the success of the Sunday Times\u2019s Rich List supplement was to prove after its 1989 launch.</p> <p>It is surely significant that it was a newspaper writer (Frank Kent of the Baltimore Sun) who is credited with inventing the term \u201cfat cat\u201d in the 1920s to describe rich political donors who yearned for public honours as a recognition of their value.</p> <p>Fat cattery has since widened in its usage, now referring to any man (yes, always a <em>man</em>) who is thought to be too wealthy for his own good. He may be guilty of doing no more than flaunting it; most often, he is linked to a news event.</p> <p>So it has been for Sir Philip Green, the billionaire who sold BHS for \u00a31 to a former bankrupt, leaving behind a multi-million pound pensions deficit.</p> <p>For newspapers, he is the ultimate fat cat. If they were critical of him before he appeared at a Commons select committee in June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/mps-sir-philip-greens-reputation-and-knighthood-depend-on-pension-offer\">during which he told MPs he would \u201csort it\u201d</a> [the deficit], they were even more so afterwards. </p> <p>They have delighted in running pictures of <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sir-philip-green-pictured-having-8500635\">a bare-chested Green cruising on his new yacht in the Mediterranean</a> while BHS staff continue to worry about their pensions. </p> <p>On Monday, the Daily Mirror reported that <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pressure-growing-over-sir-philip-8584269\">Green was coming under \u201cmounting pressure\u201d</a> because, it alleged, Serious Fraud Office officers were considering whether there was enough evidence to investigate if he broke the law through \u201cfraud by misrepresentation\u201d. </p> <p>And Iain Wright, the MP who chairs the business, innovations and skills committee, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/sir-philip-green-told-do-right-thing-bhs-pension-deficit\">he was frustrated by the lack of progress in resolving the pension deficit</a>.

Although I\u2019ve chosen an example of her lighter verse, it\u2019s worth reading her more serious and sustained pieces of writing; for example, her condemnation of child labour, <a href=\"http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/norton/avftf/avftf.html\">A Voice from the Factories</a>, combines fluent versification and eloquent \u201cprotest\u201d.<br></p> <p> \u201cIfs\u201d is an almost purely playful short poem from her 1830 collection, <a href=\"http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/vwwp/view?docId=VAB7186;chunk.id=d1e540;toc.depth=100;brand=vwwp;doc.view=0;query=\">The Undying One and Other Poems</a>. Its readability owes a lot to its chosen grammatical structure \u2013 a cadenza of conditional clauses, introduced by the subordinate conjunction, \u201cIf\u201d. The structure effortlessly sets up readers\u2019 expectations. It leads us inexorably towards the moment when all will be revealed, we hope, by the main clause \u2013 in this case, a main clause phrased as a mischievous but resonant question (lines 23 and 24). Earlier, we may have wondered if the poem could possibly say anything very significant at the end. In the event, it doesn\u2019t disappoint.</p> <p> Underneath the grammatical logic, the poem is a charming exercise in romantic impressionism. It catches moods, imagining sentimental-pastoral scenes possibly threaded through with the trace of a love story. If Nature and her associated elements could somehow disclose the lovers\u2019 words and activities, the poem asks, what then?</p> <p> Speech is the focus of the first four lines of the first stanza. These lines imagine a situation in which the lovers\u2019 words could be whispered by the evening winds and (possibly <a href=\"http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/keats.htm\">reminding us of Keats\u2019s epitaph</a>) \u201cwritten on the streamlet clear\u201d. Then the focus changes to an interestingly complex fantasy of thoughts becoming visible. Shooting stars might \u201cimage forth\u201d the thoughts which, being lovers\u2019 thoughts, would not be about starlight. Each of the first two stanzas ends with an almost saucy little last-line joke of this kind, which Norton has made sure to emphasise with an italicisation. </p> <p> In the second stanza \u201call that has passed upon (the ocean\u2019s) golden sand\u201d seems to invite an interpretation as daring as a modern reader might wish. These four lines are remarkably effective: the \u201clulled heaving\u201d ocean with its rising \u201cmoon-lighted waves\u201d, the flying spray and echoing strand are brilliant in their discreet eroticism. But now, it seems, the lovers must part \u2026 Poetic decorum is restored with the softer focus on tears and eyes. </p> <p> If a narrative is indeed hinted in the poem, the last stanza subtly indicates that the lovers have been reunited. It imagines \u201ctimid\u201d sighs, then words, again (\u201ceach whispered word and tone, / Which made the hearer\u2019s listening heart rejoice\u201d) and at last prepares for the crescendo to the poem\u2019s main clause. At first, Nature is imagined repeating, \u201cAll she hath heard and seen \u2013 must hear and see \u2013\u201d. That \u201cmust\u201d is a powerful reminder of the inevitability of natural renewal in which human lovers participate, and the fancy of Nature being able, \u201cunchecked\u201d, to utter all the discourse of love out loud. This has a symphonic richness and spaciousness beyond the whimsical. And so prepared, we reach the main clause, a rhetorical question splendidly laden with present participles: \u201cWhere would the whispering, vowing, sighing crowd / Of lovers, and their blushing partners, be?\u201d</p> <p>Ifs is a poem surely designed to please, with an imagined readership of young people, male and female, who themselves are lovers. Which likelihood brings me to a very different poetic cadenza on the conditional, the one that everyone will already have recalled, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_if.htm\">Rudyard Kipling\u2019s If</a>.</p> <p> Writing in 1909, Kipling had his son in mind as the poem\u2019s primary reader. The \u201cmodel\u201d character he draws on is that of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1146109/The-remarkable-story-Rudyard-Kiplings-If--swashbuckling-renegade-inspired-it.html\">his friend, Dr LS Jameson</a>. The two poems are poles apart in intention \u2013 and in many other ways, of course. Even the titles are distinct. Norton\u2019s plural, which turns the conjunction into a noun (as in \u201cifs and buts\u201d) is already mischievous, while Kipling\u2019s conjunction already seems to show its \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d. Kipling\u2019s poem is didactic, and it looks at hypothetical situations that could readily happen: Norton fantasises. One \u201cif\u201d is what an old-fashioned grammarian would call the First Conditional, the other (Norton\u2019s) the Second, because her imagined events are unlikely to happen. But the grammatical structures have a significant amount in common. </p> <p> Kipling\u2019s is a fine poem, in its way, although I\u2019ve often thought it a surprising victor in the search for \u201cthe nation\u2019s favourite\u201d. But the total eclipse of the poem that could have engendered it (and the marginalisation of Norton\u2019s work in general) is regrettable. Let\u2019s not forget that the more famous If has a feminine predecessor. As far as charm and originality are concerned, dare I suggest that Norton\u2019s poem has the edge on Kipling\u2019s? </p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago, I was expecting to enjoy the summer in the communal garden of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/27/haggle-maisonette-won-hollow-victory-vendor-offer-estate-agent\">my new home</a>, but after weeks of the legal process grinding on, my dreams were shattered by something lurking out there: Japanese knotweed.</p> <p>This is an invasive and destructive plant well known for damaging buildings, tarmac and drains. Looks-wise, think bamboo. In the summertime it grows like billy-o \u2013 7ft up and clumps of it at least as wide. While it dies down in winter, it returns each year thanks to creeping underground stems. Digging it up is usually a thankless task; chemicals are favoured but can take years to kill it and cost thousands of pounds.</p> <p>I had asked my solicitor to find out if there were any issues around knotweed after seeing online that it was an important question in the conveyancing process. On reflection, I should have asked this question before making an offer as the presence of knotweed is hugely significant.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t check the garden or surrounding properties for it when viewing. But even if I had known what it looked like, I doubt I would have seen it anyway, as apparently it is lurking underground in the communal back garden. While the survey I commissioned found no evidence of the plant, it also said that the easily accessible garden and grounds were not inspected. That surprised my solicitor and me, especially as I had opted for a homebuyer\u2019s report for \u00a3150, bolted on to the lender\u2019s free valuation. The survey did recommend that my solicitor ask the seller about any previous growth and treatment.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So the knotweed only emerged in mid-June when the management company finally responded to the question my solicitor raised. I was told that for around 10 years there had been a treatment programme in place with apparently no signs of regrowth in the past year. But I wasn\u2019t prepared to take the management company\u2019s word for it. As far as I had come and as much as I wanted the place, I needed to investigate matters more. Cue phone calls to specialists who enlightened and concerned me in equal measure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps I took the coward\u2019s route, especially as there had been no recent regrowth, but the risks were too high</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My main concerns centred on possible resale issues. After all, if the knotweed scared me, I am sure it could scare someone else in my position. A search online confirmed what it looked like and why it mattered. Pictures and stories of it sprouting through bricks and causing structural damage made me even more worried, as did word from those I knew. I really didn\u2019t fancy living in a place that could be badly affected structurally. The thought of paying out for ongoing treatment was similarly unappealing.</p> <p>What ensued was a fairly bitter battle of who would pay for the specialist surveyor I wanted to call in. The vendor refused to pay, claiming no knowledge of it; the estate agent\u2019s attitude was the same. I certainly wasn\u2019t going to on principle. I thought it was shocking that it was revealed at such a late stage, especially as I had invested a lot of money in financial adviser, surveyor and solicitor fees. And that\u2019s disregarding the emotional investment and the hope dangled in front of my face of finally being a homeowner. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Eventually, after the management company also refused to pay, I withdrew my offer. Perhaps I took the coward\u2019s route by withdrawing, especially as there had apparently been no recent regrowth, but for me the risks were just too high.</p> <p>Investing \u00a320,000 of hard-earned cash and borrowing nigh on \u00a3120,000 to live in a place I might struggle to sell was too much of a gamble. And that is assuming the lender would have continued to offer me the mortgage anyway. Better to lose a little than a lot. I read a telling piece of advice online \u2013 a question really: \u201cIf I had known then, pre-offer, what I know now, post-offer, would I have offered? If the answer is no, pull out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79766957f550e9c27482e345995506325f581e04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79766957f550e9c27482e345995506325f581e04/0_316_2667_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese knotweed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I really didn\u2019t fancy living in a place that could be badly affected structurally.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The whole experience made me feel bitter \u2013 towards the management company for apparently not telling their lessees about knotweed, to the vendor for asserting the property had categorically not been affected by it, and to the surveyor for not bothering to look for any signs. I felt I had been deceived and had no recourse. Some system.</p> <p>But a week or two on, I\u2019m optimistic about my new search. I will take stock and drill down the questions to ask and at what point. I will now be asking all the questions on the property information form that the seller completes pre-offer. After all, neighbour disputes, knotweed and boundary line issues can be deal breakers. </p> <p>While I\u2019ve spent a lot, I\u2019ve learned a lot too. I\u2019ll aim to keep my cool and professionalism, recognising as I do that buying a house is just another business deal. I\u2019m keen to find a place that represents better value and am now prepared to roll up my sleeves and consider a doer-upper. Also, I\u2019m going to spread my search wider, as long as getting to work in Southampton is doable. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A system that sees homebuyers lose \u00a3270m\u200b a year on doomed purchases urgently needs a kick into the 21st century</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I now face a summer of Rightmove some \u00a3800 poorer. Meanwhile, my surveyor is \u00a3150 richer and my solicitor around \u00a3650. Luckily, my IFA, who I coughed up \u00a3300 to, is happy to rearrange another mortgage at no extra cost. There really needs to be some system of financial redress for when things go wrong \u2013 both I and the vendor have lost out.</p> <p>In the budget the government talked about improving the homebuying process \u2013 and about time too. A system that sees homebuyers lose \u00a3270m a year on doomed purchases urgently needs a kick into the 21st century. </p> <p>Obviously I would like to see a system where solicitors are only paid upon completion, but that said, why should they work for free? Crucially, we need full disclosure of all property details on the advert or certainly pre-offer. This will enable informed decision-making and help reduce house sales falling through, saving money for those whose lives are massively affected. Why I had to wait until such a late date to find out this vital information is beyond me. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>I would also like to see some service-level agreements put in place to expedite matters. Perhaps enabling a discussion between vendors and buyers could help. Often, I found not only myself in the dark, but the estate agent and solicitor were also unaware of exactly what was happening. Being drip-fed information about any progress made was annoying and counter-productive. When the knotweed rose its ugly head, I took it upon myself to call the management company and the specialist contractor, which shone a little light on proceedings. </p>",
  "<p>Fifty years since it exposed the scale and impact of substandard housing and homelessness, Cathy Come Home was screened again on the BBC on 31 July.

This is n0t the case under current legislation, which works on a priority basis and obliges local authorities to rehouse only those with a certain level of need.

We already know that supported housing plays a significant role in preventing homelessness, with 19,500 people helped through this route in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/533099/Statutory_Homelessness_and_Prevention_and_Relief_Statistical_Release_January_to_March_2016.pdf\">2015/16 alone</a> (pdf).

Did you believe the way the Joker and Viola Davis\u2019 Amanda Waller both turned up alive when we thought them dead?</p> <p>And why does everyone in the DC universe seem to make decisions like a three-year-old, based on gut instinct or rage and often without any thought for the consequences? For me, Waller was another thinly sketched character who was created purely for plot development, like Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s Lex Luthor in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

This was a traditional caped crusader, taking down Gotham\u2019s bad guys with his bare hands rather than blasting everything to smithereens with giant Batguns. But did you wonder whether he really needed to punch out, then give the kiss of life to a waterlogged Robbie? Is it ever acceptable to use sexualised violence against a woman by a man for comic effect, even in a silly superhero movie?</p> <p>The Flash was gone in a flicker, but helped to take down Jai Courtney\u2019s Captain Boomerang.

Compare Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje\u2019s Killer Croc to supporting heroes in Marvel\u2019s similarly pitched Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 the obvious comparison is Dave Bautista\u2019s Drax the Destroyer. Or the romance between Joel Kinnaman\u2019s Rick Flag and Cara Delevingne\u2019s Dr June Moone to the wonderfully eccentric, offbeat love story between Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero\">Deadpool</a>. In each case, Suicide Squad\u2019s human connections seem cartoonish when measured against those of the comic-book movie elite. But perhaps you disagree?</p> <h2>Yet another CGI meltdown finale</h2> <p>Speaking of Delevingne, was pitching the young British model and actor as effectively the movie\u2019s main antagonist the best idea? I thought she was rather good as the Enchantress in her madcap, grubby witch phase, but went a little Nicolas Cage in Wicker Man around the time the villain transformed into her gyrating-fantasy-princess-from-hell alter ego. </p> <p>Her brother, Incubus, was a complete non-entity, a Snyderian CGI mega-villain as meaningless as Batman v Superman\u2019s Doomsday. And that laughable, slo-mo infested, almost unfeasibly clunky ending \u2026 is anyone prepared to defend it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc1e774c87ab0d0bc2519b7b47559bd93ec1ebac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc1e774c87ab0d0bc2519b7b47559bd93ec1ebac/358_0_1430_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suicide Squad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suicide Squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The mid-credits scene<br></h2> <p>So Batman forms the Justice League because he doesn\u2019t want the bad guys having all the fun. This bit probably made more sense than anything else in the movie, though that\u2019s not saying a lot. At least DC has wisely given up trying to come up with its own take on universe-building segues (see Batman v Superman\u2019s confusing \u201cknightmare\u201d or the preposterous scene where the Batfleck sits down to watch trailers for upcoming DCEU movies) and decided to copy Marvel instead. But if Waller has a dossier on decent-hearted meta-humans such as the Flash, why didn\u2019t she get them to take down Enchantress and her bro rather than a bunch of crazies?</p> <h2>Will the DC extended universe live to fight another day?</h2> <p>Would you agree that the answer is a resounding \u201cyes\u201d \u2013 somehow \u2013 despite everything that\u2019s terrible about Ayer\u2019s movie?</p> <p>The early box-office figures for Suicide Squad look spectacular, and the movie\u2019s key cast \u2013 Leto, Robbie, Smith (as the previously unheralded Deadshot) \u2013 gave good supervillain in short bursts of brilliance, even as the film as a whole got lost in a knotty labyrinth of competing visions. There\u2019s a real sense that these characters might be well worth watching in a different movie, with a more carefully considered film-making process in place.</p> <p>Most of the Suicide Squad, with the exception of Harley, ended up back in their prison cells by the time the credits rolled. Are you begging them to stay locked up, or hoping they\u2019ll be let out again for round two?</p>",

The blocks around them have seen shooting after shooting, including people injured or killed as they mourned previous victims. Truehill and fellow organizer Lauren Richardson sent round a flier, advertising their march as \u201ca cry for an end to the senseless violence\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, Rudy Giuliani <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/07/10/giuliani-says-black-fathers-need-teach-kids-real-danger-them-not-police/I1uSCruAGwQaf4QYyYVNRK/story.html\">criticized black Americans</a> for protesting shootings by police officers rather than shootings of young black men by other young black men. The former New York City mayor suggested, inaccurately, that the Black Lives Matter movement never held protests about community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/08/obama-library-university-chicago-trauma-center-protests\">gun violence in Chicago</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to hear from the black community,\u201d Giuliani said, \u201cis how and what they are doing among themselves about the crime problem in the black community.\u201d</p> <p>But black Americans in neighborhoods that see constant gun violence do try to make their voices heard, in protests like the one Truehill helped organize: community led, often small and largely ignored by news organizations. </p> <p>Thirty people showed up on Friday, most of them black men and women in their mid-20s. Gun violence was deeply personal to them. One 24-year-old, Chris Head, said he had lost 30 friends. He was \u201cblessed\u201d, he said, that it was only that many. </p> <p>\u201cAt least I can count,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people can\u2019t count.\u201d </p> <p>The march and vigil lasted two hours, buoyed by waves and cheers from people along the route and honks of support from cars. No television crews or reporters from local news organizations showed up. The single reporter present had only learned about the protest by chance, from one of Truehill\u2019s mentors, a local pastor. </p> <p>Truehill has lost two brothers to violence in Oakland. But for him, he said, a turning point had come just a few weeks before, when 17-year-old <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2016/06/15/oakland-shooting-girl-dies-shot-to-death-gunfire-california/\">Regina Jeffries</a> was shot dead at a vigil for two teenagers who drowned in a reservoir earlier this summer. She was one of more than 39 people killed and 175 shot in Oakland this year, through the end of July.</p> <p>\u201cAfter that, I figured that something needed to change,\u201d Truehill said. \u201cIf you get the young black people in the community together, you can do a lot.\u201d </p> <p>He was inspired by a 7 July march in Oakland against police brutality that temporarily shut down Interstate 880. Thousands joined the protest; for the first time, Truehill was among them.<br></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really do stuff like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, pretty much everybody know that. This is me trying to set an example for people who know me.\u201d</p> <p>Nate Millheim, a pastor who runs the Oakland Leadership Center, a storefront mentoring organization for Oakland youth, told the group: \u201cI\u2019ve been at a lot of peace marches in Oakland, in the eight years I\u2019ve been here, but they\u2019re pretty much usually only older or mostly older people. I think when younger people come out and lead and, like, bring their friends, there\u2019s something special about that.</p> <p>\u201cI know we ain\u2019t that deep as we want to be, but it don\u2019t matter how deep we are; we come together, we bigger,\u201d Truehill said.</p> <p>Richardson, the co-organizer, said: \u201cEverybody is representing different things, \u2013 some people have lost family members to violence, some people are representing being against police brutality.\u201d</p> <p>Another marcher said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to have the little kids.

As <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2016/08/03/after-brexit-climate-science-denialists-form-new-group-call-clexit\">Graham Readfearn reported</a>, a new group called \u201cClexit\u201d (Climate Exit) has formed in an effort to similarly withdraw countries from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">the successful international climate treaty</a> forged last year in Paris. As the group describes itself:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Brexit was Britain\u2019s answer </em><em>to the growing over-reach of EU bureaucracies.

Its secretary is <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/viv-forbes\">Viv Forbes</a>, who has been involved with coal industry for over 40 years and is associated with many fossil fuel-funded groups.</p> <p>With feedback from the rest of the group\u2019s members, Forbes prepared <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/clexit.pdf\">Clexit\u2019s summary statement</a>, which is full of myths and misinformation about economics, energy, laws, and climate science. It includes this expression of compassionate concern over the plight of low-lying island nations that are being engulfed by rising seas:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Some of the biggest supporters of the Paris accord are small oceanic nations seeking </em><em>welfare through handouts to save them from baseless predictions of rising sea levels, </em><em>even though actual changes in sea levels are tiny and not unusual.</em></p> <p><em>The fact is that sea level rise in Tuvalu has been effectively zero since accurate </em><em>measurements commenced in 1993, on tide gauges set up by the Australian </em><em>government</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This purported fact <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Tuvalu-sea-level-rise.htm\">is actually a fiction</a>: <a href=\"http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.data/1839.rlrdata\">the tide gauge data</a> show the rate of sea level rise in Tuvalu since 1993 is 4.3 mm per year, which is faster than <a href=\"http://sealevel.colorado.edu/\">the global average of 3.4 mm per year</a>. And Tuvalu is only one among <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/islands-threatened-by-climate-change-2012-10\">the many small island nations facing the loss of their homelands</a> at the hands of global warming-caused sea level rise.</p> <p>However, when it comes to energy use, Clexit\u2019s compassion for developing countries becomes even clearer yet:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>For developing countries, the Paris Treaty would deny them the benefits of reliable low-cost hydrocarbon energy, compelling them to rely on biomass heating and costly weather-dependent and unreliable power supplies, thus prolonging and increasing their dependency on international handouts. They will soon resent being told to remain forever in an energy-deprived wind/solar/wood/bicycle economy. </em></p> </blockquote> <p>The problem with energy from burning fossil fuels is that it\u2019s only \u201clow-cost\u201d if we ignore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/04/climate-change-will-blow-a-25tn-hole-in-global-financial-assets-study-warns\">the tremendous costs of the damages its carbon pollution causes</a> via climate change. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/27/global-warming-could-be-more-devastating-for-the-economy-than-we-thought\">Poorer countries are particularly vulnerable to those costs</a>, both because they lack the wealth and resources to adapt to them, and because they tend to be located in already-hot geographic regions near the equator. <br></p> <p>There\u2019s a reason why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution\">95% of expert economists agree that we should cut carbon pollution</a>. Of course, the Clexiters deny that carbon dioxide is a pollutant:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Carbon dioxide is NOT a dangerous pollutant \u2013 it is a natural, non-toxic and beneficial </em><em>gas which feeds all life on earth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>However, this was long ago decided in the courts. In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that the State of Massachusetts had legal standing to sue the EPA for its refusal to regulate greenhouse gases, specifically because Massachusetts showed that it was being harmed by global warming via sea level rise encroaching on its shores. In that case, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-pollutant-advanced.htm\">the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant</a>.</p> <p>In response to the Supreme Court decision, the EPA issued an endangerment finding concluding that, based on the available scientific evidence, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-pollutant-advanced.htm\">carbon dioxide endangers public health and welfare, and must therefore be regulated as a pollutant</a>.</p> <p>The Clexiters deny that vast body of scientific evidence. In addition to sea level rise, their summary statement denies <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/lindzen-illusion-6-importance-of-ghgs.html\">the major role of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect</a>, that <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/medieval-warm-period-intermediate.htm\">current global temperatures are hotter than they\u2019ve been in over 2,000 years</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-intermediate.htm\">dangers of ongoing climate change</a>, that <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/ice-age-predictions-in-1970s-intermediate.htm\">most climate scientists were predicting global warming in the 1970s</a>, and so on.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that the Clexit group denies basic climate science, since the only climate scientist on their committee is <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/richardson-2013-man-made-carbon.html\">Ole Humlum, who has done some very shoddy research on fossil fuels and carbon pollution</a>. The group effectively asks that we all reject the conclusions of <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/meta;jsessionid=6AB66F8B1F75942D14A194F55F99C5D8.c4.iopscience.cld.iop.org\">97% of climate science experts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution\">95% of economics experts</a>, in favor of the myths and misinformation propagated by their fake experts. Perhaps, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/21/in-defence-of-experts-whether-they-support-leave-or-remain/\">as top Leave campaigner Michael Gove said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em> people in this country have had enough of experts</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Gove also pushed to remove climate change from school curriculums, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/05/michael-gove-climate-change-geography-curriculum\">before backing down</a>. <br></p> <p>Fortunately, given <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/18/what-the-world-thinks-about-climate-change-in-7-charts/\">the high level of global concern about climate change</a>, Clexit faces a much tougher road to success than Brexit, because a Clexit victory would be a disaster for the rest of us.<br></p>",
  "<p>In her acceptance speech after becoming prime minister Theresa May set out a vision for a country \u201cthat works for everyone \u2013 not just the privileged few\u201d. Four weeks into her premiership, central to that vision it seems will be an extension to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/senior-tories-likely-to-resist-theresa-mays-grammar-schools-agenda\">selective education</a>.</p> <p>For their supporters, grammar schools are a vehicle for social mobility and a means for the gifted but disadvantaged to go beyond their social and economic boundaries, giving access to the top universities and most prestigious careers. Critics, however, say research shows the social mobility argument is a myth.<br></p> <p>The number of grammar schools peaked at 1,300 in the mid-1960s when they educated a quarter of all state school pupils. From the 1960s onwards, however, they started to fall out of favour, and both central government and local authorities began to open all-ability comprehensive schools. The chief aim was to provide a fairer system and a better education for the remaining 75% of children in frequently inadequate secondary moderns. </p> <p>There are now 163 grammar schools in England that survived the cull and are still legally allowed to select pupils on entry to year seven by way of the 11-plus exam. In recent years selective education has been gaining favour with many of the surviving grammars gradually increasing their intake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/senior-tories-likely-to-resist-theresa-mays-grammar-schools-agenda\">Theresa May's grammar schools plan faces cross-party backlash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then last October, selective education was given a controversial shot in the arm when the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, approved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/15/grammar-school-decision-likely-to-spur-more-bids-for-satellite-developments\">the first new grammar school for 50 years</a>, to be built in Kent.</p> <p>It was approved, despite legislation introduced by Labour in 1998 banning any new school from adopting selective admissions, by presenting it as an extension to an existing grammar school, the Weald of Kent in Tonbridge.</p> <p>Its critics said it is to all intents and purposes a new school, since the extension \u2013 or annexe \u2013 is in fact nine miles away in Sevenoaks. Supporters of grammar school education argued that the government should simply lift the ban, rather than try to get around existing legislation. Given No 10\u2019s guidance to journalists this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/senior-tories-likely-to-resist-theresa-mays-grammar-schools-agenda\">it seems that may be about to happen</a>.<br></p> <p>That grammar schools get excellent results is not the issue; in 2015 virtually all grammar school pupils achieved five or more good grades at GCSE and equivalent qualifications compared with around two-thirds at comprehensives, with the gap even greater when just GCSEs are taken into account, including passes in English and maths.<br></p> <p>The real problem is that the children who attend grammar schools overwhelmingly come from wealthy middle-class families, which flies in the face of the social mobility argument. Department for Education statistics show that existing grammar schools have far fewer children from disadvantaged backgrounds than neighbouring non-selective schools, and some have almost none.</p> <p>Research by the <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/\">Sutton Trust </a>educational charity has found that less than 3% of entrants to grammar schools are entitled to free school meals \u2013 a key indicator of social deprivation \u2013 whereas on average 18% of pupils in those selective areas are entitled to free school meals. The Sutton Trust also found that almost 13% of those who enter the grammar school system come from outside the state sector, often from fee-paying preparatory schools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/17/grammar-schools-could-be-fantastic-for-social-mobility-if-any-poor-kids-went-to-them\">Grammar schools 'could be fantastic for social mobility \u2013 if any poor kids went to them'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Then there is the problem of the pupils who don\u2019t get in to grammar schools, who tend to fare worse in the secondary modern schools at the other end of the selective system than their peers at comprehensives.</p> <p>In recent years there have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/01/grammar-schools-priority-disadvantaged-pupils-entrance-exams\">efforts to try to address the poor representation of children from disadvantaged backgrounds in grammar schools</a> and increase diversity in their intakes. Some grammar school headteachers have been experimenting with prioritising children on free school meals or in receipt of the pupil premium \u2013 another indicator of disadvantage.</p> <p>Among them is Charlotte Marten, the headteacher of Rugby High School for Girls in Warwickshire, which has a tiny proportion of students on free school meals. In an attempt to address that, her school now reserves 10 places out of its annual intake of 120 for children eligible for free school meals, who can secure a place even if they score 10 marks below the 11-plus qualifying standard that year.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019m really keen on is the message should be going out, these schools exist for the whole community. Not for a section of the community,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The King Edward VI Foundation in Birmingham, which runs five grammar schools in the city, has similarly set a slightly lower qualifying score for pupil premium children to increase its intake from more disadvantaged communities.</p> <p>Despite such efforts, opposition to grammar schools is staunch. The chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, spoke for many when he said: \u201cGrammar schools are stuffed full of middle-class kids. A tiny percentage are on free school meals: 3% \u2026 Anyone who thinks grammar schools are going to increase social mobility needs to look at those figures.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, as the world of education absorbed the news that May\u2019s new Tory government is about to open the way for greater selection, Sir Peter Lampl, the founder and chair of the Sutton Trust, called for a wholesale rethink. \u201cThe government is right to recognise that there is a serious issue about the education of highly able young people from low and middle-income backgrounds.<br></p> <p>\u201cGiven that there have been 35,000 extra grammar school places since 1997 \u2013 and our evidence suggests the existing 163 grammars are largely very socially selective \u2013 we need a proper strategy rather than a piecemeal approach.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat means a national drive to improve education for the highly able in comprehensives, backed by fairer admissions policies in urban schools. It means boosting access to the existing grammars for less advantaged young people. And it means opening up the 100 leading independent day schools on the basis of ability rather than ability to pay.\u201d</p>",

I thought the web was so great because of such vast opportunities for meeting people from beyond my immediate circle, of learning from each other, and doing stuff together. </p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t really happened. My friendships have fallen apart and I am gaining weight by being in all the time. The internet affects my ability to sleep too.

I started my BA just last year and a lot of my friends have already graduated, have exciting jobs and are generally having more fun (or so Instagram tells me).</p> <p>Although I feel I\u2019m right where I\u2019m supposed to be, seeing their carefully curated lives as they appear on social media exacerbates my anxiety. The web is also very addictive. I\u2019ve now deleted social media apps and use the sites on my browser for a fraction of the time I used to, but I often feel rubbish after using them.</p> <p>I\u2019ve battled with mental health issues for a long time.

  "<p>Ofcom is set to scrap its two-year investigation of the Premier League\u2019s multibillion-pound TV rights auction, a move which complainant Virgin Media says will lead to price hikes for football fans.</p> <p>The media watchdog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/18/ofcom-premier-league-tv-rights-virgin-media\">launched the probe in 2014</a> after Virgin Media lodged a complaint arguing that the Premier League should make all 380 matches live on TV.<br></p> <p>Virgin Media maintains that by making just 41% of matches available \u2013 in contrast to other countries such as Germany and leagues such as the NBA which make all games available \u2013 the Premier League is keeping prices artificially high and restricting choice to consumers.<br></p> <p>Ofcom announced on Monday that it is dropping the investigation concluding that its \u201cresources could be used more effectively on other priorities to benefit consumers and competition\u201d.</p> <p>The Premier League has said that it will increase the number of matches available live in the next auction, starting with the 2019-20 season, from 168 to 190, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/07/premier-league-skips-attempt-to-tackle-51bn-tv-bill-as-ofcom-dro/\">according to the Daily Telegraph, which broke the story</a>.</p> <p>It had been speculated that any substantial increase in the matches on offer could require the football authorities to abandon the 2.45pm to 5.15pm broadcasting blackout on Saturday afternoons that has been in place since the 1950s to protect lower-league attendances.</p> <p>Ofcom said that the Premier League\u2019s intention to increase the number of matches available at the next auction and its own research into the views of match-going and TV watching fans supported its decision to drop the investigation.</p> <p>The research found that while 20% of fans wanted more matches on TV a similar proportion were happy with the overall number of live games broadcast, but wanted to see different games shown.<br></p> <p>Among match-going fans over two-thirds said that the Saturday 3pm kick-off was their preferred time to go to a game.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that a balance would need to be struck between the potential benefits of releasing more matches for live broadcast, and the potential disruption on match-going fans due to these games being rescheduled to be broadcast outside of the \u2018closed period\u2019 [of 2.45pm top 5.15pm on Saturday],\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cDue to the range of views expressed in the consumer research, significant further work \u2013 including additional research among football fans \u2013 would be required to conclude this investigation. Given the considerations outlined above, we have decided to close the investigation. Ofcom\u2019s resources could be used more effectively on other priorities to benefit consumers and competition.\u201d</p> <p>Under the three-year contract that begins next season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/feb/10/premier-league-tv-rights-grow-sky-sports\">Sky and BT will pay \u00a35.1bn</a> \u2013 an almost 80% increase on the current deal. </p> <p>Virgin has argued that by effectively limiting the supply of matches the Premier League has inflated the price that broadcasters have to pay and that cost is then passed on to consumers.<br></p> <p>Virgin Media chief Tom Mockridge, the former head of Sky Italia and ex-member of Sky\u2019s board, has said that making all matches live may not bring down costs for consumers but it could act as a brake on inflation and allow fans more choice.<br></p> <p>Mockridge hailed the Premier League\u2019s decision to increase the number of live matches for the next auction by 22 \u2013 on top of 14 more matches made available in the 2016-17 season over the previous deal \u2013 as a victory of sorts.<br></p> <p>\u201cFootball fans will now be able to watch more live action on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are pleased that after a two year campaign the Premier League has agreed to offer more TV games.\u201d</p> <p>The Premier League said that it is upping the minimum number of games a season that must be aired by a second rights holder (Sky is the primary rights holder) to at least 42 matches in the next auction.</p> <p>The governing body is also introducing a new rule that will mean that a minimum of 30 matches a season will have to be made available to the second rights holder for broadcast on the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cWe welcome the certainty that this Ofcom decision brings,\u201d said a spokesman for the Premier League. \u201cFrom 2006 to 2013 our UK broadcasting rights were sold in line with commitments given to the European Commission, with subsequent sales processes having been conducted on an even more pro-competitive basis. The Premier League will continue to structure and auction its UK broadcasting rights in ways that are compatible with applicable competition law.\u201d<br></p>",

You might think it\u2019s about time for the most radical reforms to higher education since 1992. Sadly, the new <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/highereducationandresearch.html\" title=\"\">higher education bill</a> is going to make it worse.</p> <p>Our government says it is committed to widening attendance, pitching university fees as a trade-off for higher salaries. There is <a href=\"http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/articles/why-the-higher-education-bill-must-be-defeated\" title=\"\">plenty to dislike</a> about a bill that will turn our universities into a competitive marketplace of winners and losers, but one of its worst aspects is that it measures teaching quality according to the earnings of graduates. This is not fair or sensible. This is the dogma of market-imposed education: if you do well, you deserve it. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s your fault.</p> <p>Our government is setting up a system where failure to get a high-paying job is blamed on university teaching. It\u2019s nothing to do with being working-class. Nothing to do with the colour of your skin. Nothing to do with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/07/gender-pay-gap-uk-women-earn-300000-less-men-lifetime\" title=\"\">gender pay gap</a>. It is simply because you didn\u2019t invest enough in your education. It is because you didn\u2019t make your market choice wisely enough.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would also be true in reverse: a high-quality education is your ticket to a high salary. Tell that to black women.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If this were true, then it would also be true in reverse: a high-quality education is your ticket to a high salary.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/01/pay-gap-black-white-uk-workers-widens-more-qualifications\" title=\"\"> Tell that to black women.</a> It\u2019s not just wrong \u2013 it\u2019s insulting to everyone who has to deal with structural inequalities across society.</p> <p>Obviously, the amount you earn is affected by far more than what degree you took and how well you were taught. Your gender, sexuality and ethnicity play massive roles. Your social background plays a massive role. The state of the economy plays a massive role. Using salaries as a measurement of teaching quality makes no sense at all; still less as a justification for setting higher fees. Granted, there are benchmarks to widen participation, but this is a small and inadequate concession in the context of full marketisation.</p> <p>Everyone wants our higher education system to be amazing. Nobody argues with that. But trying to judge higher education teaching according to graduate earnings is pointless. There is a simple way to test this. The next time you\u2019re negotiating a pay rise, try telling your boss how satisfied you were with your undergraduate seminars. See how that goes.</p> <p>The universities that will succeed if the higher education bill passes will be those that best prepare their students to earn higher and higher salaries. Forget the social value of your education: your salary is the measurement of your worth. Keep this in mind the next time you have to go to a hospital. That nurse who is caring for you \u2013 who may have \u00a3100,000 of debt, by the way \u2013 earns way less than a hedge-fund manager. According the bill\u2019s logic, that nurse must have had a rubbish education. They probably have absolutely no idea what they\u2019re doing.</p> <p>The government is forcing market dogma onto our universities. Students will become consumers. Life after education will become a return on investment, with winners and losers. And, as is usually the case, the losers will be people who were already losing.</p>",
  "<p>Occupational therapists are now treated as appropriate trained professionals, thanks to lobbying by the College of Occupational Therapists (COT). This means they can undertake complex assessments alongside social workers and other professionals and consequently, they must have a good working knowledge of the Care Act.</p> <p>Here are four essential things that occupational therapists need to know about the act.</p> <h2>Wellbeing</h2> <p>The act states that any care and support should help people achieve outcomes which matter in their own lives, and that local authorities must promote people\u2019s wellbeing when carrying out their care and support duties. The cornerstone of occupational therapy is the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wfot.org/AboutUs/AboutOccupationalTherapy/DefinitionofOccupationalTherapy.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">promotion of health and wellbeing through everyday activities</a>. Supporting people to improve their wellbeing might include changes to physical environments, helping participation in work, education, training, or adapting daily routines.</p> <h2>Prevention</h2> <p>The ambition within the prevention part of the act is to move to proactive, rather than a reactive, care and support service. The act also points toward the vital part carers play in care and support, and states that the local authority have a duty to prevent, delay or reduce carers\u2019 needs alongside those they care for.</p> <p>Occupational therapists can, for example, support carers in self-management techniques for healthy eating, anxiety, fatigue and back care management.</p> <p>For those in need of care, occupational therapists also have a leading role to play in reablement services based in local authorities, supporting people to learn or re-learn the skills for daily living following illness or disability. They also complete environmental adaptation, equipment provision and moving and handling interventions, which can be a contributing factors in limiting and/or delaying people\u2019s needs for care and support. </p> <p>Within the act, there are a number of factors that highlight the importance housing plays in meeting the needs of people and their carers. One definition of wellbeing focuses on the suitability of an individual\u2019s living accommodation; this could include adaptation to property and information and advice on more suitable housing options, including the care homes. </p> <p>There is also a duty on local authorities to carry out their responsibilities for care and support in a more integrated way with the NHS and other health-related services, which also includes housing organisations. </p> <p>A particular initiative championed by the act is the Better Care Fund, which pools clinical commissioning groups and local authority funds to meet shared objectives around preventative care and support services in the community. </p> <p>An important element is the disabled facilities grants. Recommendation for adaptive work, which aims to maximise a person\u2019s independence and/or ability to remain in their own home, funded by these grants, is often carried out by occupational therapists. This work addresses people\u2019s wellbeing needs and contributes to preventing further escalation of needs. </p> <h2>Safeguarding</h2> <p>Occupational therapists within social care participate in all areas of safeguarding, and their particular skills are often used in complex moving and handling cases to ensure risks are managed in a client-centred way. </p> <p>For the first time, the act sets out clear legal guidelines on safeguarding duties related to adults. It details the responsibilities for local authorities which include: </p> <ul> <li>Making enquires if abuse or neglect is suspected.</li> <li>The establishment of local safeguarding adults boards and carrying out safeguarding adults reviews.</li> <li>Arranging independent advocacy where appropriate.</li> <li>And requirements that all relevant partners cooperate with the local authority. </li> </ul> <p>Alerting the local authority when there is a safeguarding concern is the responsibility of everyone regardless of position or service. </p> <p>The addition of self-neglect as a category of abuse presents a real challenge, however in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Document-library/NMDS-SC,-workforce-intelligence-and-innovation/Research/Self-Neglect-Final-Report-301013-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent guidance on self-neglect</a> (pdf), occupational therapists are accredited as being effective professionals to work in this area due to their client-centred and holistic approach. </p> <h2>Prisons (custodial settings)</h2> <p>Finally, the act places a duty on local authorities to assess and meet eligible care and support needs for prisoners who are in their local area. The legislation provides welcome clarity, as previously provision of services was unclear, leaving prisoners with unrecognised or ineffectively met needs. </p> <p>With an increasing number of older people in prisons, the responsibilities within the act have come at an opportune time. Although people in prisons benefit from most of the rights and responsibilities under the act, there are notable exceptions. Prisoners are not eligible for direct payments, and their choices about care and support are limited. </p> <p>In addition: investigation of safeguarding incidents is not the responsibility of adult social care teams; preference of accommodation can only be expressed when leaving prison; and local authorities are not responsible for protecting the property of adults in prisons. </p> <p>Occupational therapists\u2019 skills are increasingly recognised within prisons and a number of local authorities have set up teams to meet prisoners\u2019 needs which include occupational therapists as key members.</p> <p><em>COT has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cot.co.uk/library-publications/cot-publications/guidance\" rel=\"nofollow\">published a series of guides</a> to the Care Act which have been endorsed by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to support practitioners to understand and deliver its key concepts and their duties. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Los Angeles.<br></p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Drew Love (vocals) and Dante Jones (production). </p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> LA duo THEY. capitalise the letters of their name and insist on following it with a full stop. It would be tempting to declare them a big, bold culmination of the noirish rap and R&amp;B that began with the release of Kanye West\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s and Heartbreak</a>, was further developed by Drake and the Weeknd, and has more recently been advanced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/29/bryson-tiller-review\">Bryson Tiller</a>, partynextdoor, Tory Lanez and Post Malone. But they\u2019re not exactly that; they\u2019re not quite that stylised or extreme. Their music is more atmospheric and meditative than abrasively emotional, although there are moments of quiet tension and calm fury that signal two young artists using the surface accoutrements of black music as well as the sounds and sensibility of rock to say something heartfelt and personal.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what the critics are saying: \u201c<a href=\"https://likes.asos.com/29226/soundcheck-they/\">Listen to THEY. if you like Kurt Cobain and the Weeknd.</a>\u201d What a tantalising proposition that is: In Utero remixed by Illangelo. Again, it\u2019s a little wide of the mark and a little bit the result of wishful thinking. THEY. \u2013 singer Drew Love and producer Dante Jones \u2013 do, however, feature guitars on their songs, and have a track entitled Motley Crew. OK, the latter obviously alludes to a quite different type of rock; nevertheless, they were delighted when we suggested to them that a possible term for their music might be grunge\u2019n\u2019b. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my favourite writer of all time,\u201d says Jones of the Nirvana frontman. \u201cAs much as I grew up listening to Jodeci, I was always a rock fan and an emo kid. I\u2019m a big indie guy, so I listen to Vampire Weekend and Tame Impala.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI was drawn to the vulnerability of his voice and the way he delivered his message \u2013 it was haunting,\u201d adds Love, whose rasp-lite does indeed feature faint traces of Cobain. \u201cIt drew you in. Anyone else singing those songs wouldn\u2019t have had the same effect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNirvana\u2019s career was short, condensed \u2013 they didn\u2019t have a chance to do any wrong,\u201d continues Dante, considering Nirvana\u2019s famous quiet-loud dynamic. \u201cA track like Motley Crew starts softly, then a wall of sound hits you. I can see parallels in their work with how we create.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/unofficialthey/sets/they-nu-religion-ep\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F154692352&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s probably worth noting that THEY. have already had some success. They have provided beats for Chris Brown, Jeremih, Kelly Clarkson and will.i.am \u2013 and accrued a decent sized following. Their Soundcloud and Spotify streams for their N\u00fc Religion EP total in the tens of millions, although there is a vertiginous drop from the number of listens for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1awIcBrhw\">Working for It</a> \u2013 their collaboration with Skrillex and Zhu \u2013 to their other tracks. When we saw them supporting Tiller in London earlier this year there was none of the tentative applause normally afforded second-billed acts; rather their every song was greeted like a greatest hit. Evidently, your average punter cares less about pioneers and progenitors and all that music journalist palaver. They just like the latest and best.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m blessed,\u201d says Love of having in Jones his very own <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl23qnQQ3J0\">Noah \u201c40\u201d Shebib.</a> \u201cProduction is crucial, people don\u2019t realise: it can take a song from C or D level to A. Dante is the best producer in the entire game right now. Together we\u2019re unstoppable.\u201d More than the Cobain/Abel Tesfaye comparison, Jones prefers the idea of THEY. as the missing link between the Weeknd and Vampire Weekend. \u201cThat\u2019s a good analogy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe last Vampire Weekend album [2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/09/vampire-weekend-modern-vampires-review\">Modern Vampires of the City</a>] determined how I heard music: lo-fi and gritty, but still sonically hard. That was a huge album for me. It sounded so right.\u201d</p> <p>Deep End \u2013 recorded in Tupac Shakur\u2019s old studio \u2013 features dramatic piano chords and moves at a faltering pace, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/janet-jackson-superproducers-jimmy-jam-and-terry-lewis\">Jam and Lewis\u2019 shiny 80s R&amp;B, </a>only downtempo and with a dark, depressed pall. As though to confirm that, in rap, forlorn is the new triumphalist, Say When is a song about \u201cthat new phenomenon\u201d \u2013 the cutting down of black lives by US law enforcement \u2013 and was written as a response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">the shooting of Michael Brown</a>. Motley Crew is equal parts grit and gloss, with an acrid Come As You Are guitar tone offsetting a sweet warble on a song that flirts with gangsta posturing (\u201cSome might say we\u2019re armed and dangerous \u2026 Pain is the name of the game when they play with us\u201d) and a sense of urgency, even desperation: \u201cRunning down Sunset Boulevard with my niggas / Screaming, \u2018Oh my Lord.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Back It Up opens with interference, warped voices, and another reference to pain. And yet you can imagine this intoxicatingly slow, meandering electronic R&amp;B on a daytime radio playlist beside Drake and the Weeknd, Kanye and Rihanna, in that mainstream world where it\u2019s almost a given that your music will include elements of what would once have been considered experimental and avant garde. Bad Habits, with its \u201cmoney, pussy, bitches\u201d refrain, inhabits that bleak nocturnal demimonde where the Weeknd indulge in all manner of unsanctionable activities. But the rolling melody, chords played on an acoustic guitar and tumbling rhythm are so mellifluous and attractive they draw you in even as you flinch at the terrible mise en sc\u00e8ne. Besides, you get the impression these are case studies rather than first-hand reports.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day we\u2019re doing urban music, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t touch on darker personal issues,\u201d says Jones. \u201cDrew and I are human beings with emotions. We\u2019re just blessed we\u2019re able to channel our own personalities into the music and keep it authentic. Really, I\u2019m just a studio guy. People say, \u2018You\u2019re killing it, everything\u2019s blowing up!\u2019 I\u2019m like, is it? We\u2019re just making the best music we can.

This generation is hungry for new visionaries.\u201d As for his partner, he already has his eye on posterity: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me, but I always feel like I have a greater calling, whether it\u2019s with music or whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cDrew and I have high aspirations in regards to the impact we could make culturally, and socially.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> <a href=\"https://likes.asos.com/29226/soundcheck-they/\">\u201cListen to THEY. if you like Kurt Cobain and the Weeknd.\u201d</a> </p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Or if you like Vampire Weekend and the Weeknd\u2026</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqO8LpE0GU4\">Shout at the devil</a>. </p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Star in a sex tape with Pam Anderson. </p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Deep End is available on Spotify.

At some point in these Rio Games the US will win their 1,000th gold medal in a summer Olympics. Presumably this will not be celebrated with cannons of confetti and a banner with a number 1,000 the size of a small SUV. But gold medals are important to the US so you never know.</p> <p>So far that pursuit has not been as fast as everyone might have hoped. Two days into the Olympics, American athletes have only one gold medal to go with five silvers and a bronze. It is not the haul of a powerhouse. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full\">The Guardian\u2019s handy interactive medal traker</a> has the US in sixth place behind Australia, Italy, China, Korea and Hungary. Obviously it is just two days into the Olympics and things can change quickly. We are only starting to get into the big swimming and gymnastics events where the US dominates and still have track and field lingering next week. America\u2019s medal count will explode.</p> <p>Still, it is weird to see the US languishing in fifth place on an Olympics medal chart. And there have been some disappointments already. Their narrow loss to Australia in the women\u2019s 4x100m freestyle relay wasn\u2019t a surprise \u2013 Australia won gold in the event in 2012 \u2013 but the closeness of the race made the defeat sting. Venus Williams\u2019s illness this weekend that led to to her losing her singles match to 67<sup>th</sup>-ranked Kirsten Flipkens and the Williams sisters\u2019 doubles defeat on Sunday was a signifiant blow.</p> <p>In a few days this will probably all be forgotten. By then America\u2019s swimmers and gymnasts will have delivered their predicted wins and all those gold medallions will gleam in the lights for NBC. Everyone will talk excitedly about American dominance at the Olympics. No one will remember those first few days when Australia ruled Rio. By then, attention will have turned to a bigger question.</p> <p>Who will get that 1,000th summer gold for the US?

There has been a big enhancement of criminal gangs and trafficking networks engaging in the sexual exploitation of younger and younger Nigerian girls.\u201d</p> <p>Although a thriving sex trafficking industry has been operating between Nigeria and Italy for over three decades, there has been a marked increase in the numbers of unaccompanied Nigerian women arriving in Italy on migrant boats from Libya. In 2014, about 1,500 Nigerian women arrived by sea. In 2015 this figure had increased to 5,633.</p> <p>\u201cAlready we have seen nearly 4,000 women come in the first six months of this year,\u201d said Moscarelli. \u201cWe are expecting the numbers to have increased again by the end of this year.\u201d<br></p> <p>She warned that the current policy of placing Nigerian women in reception centres along with thousands of other migrants was playing to the traffickers\u2019 advantage, with women regularly going missing. </p> <p>\u201cThere is little understanding of the dynamics and nature of this form of trafficking,\u201d said Moscarelli. </p> <p>\u201cThe reception centres are not good places for trafficked women.

Many are forced into prostitution in Libya,\u201d said Moscarelli.</p> <p>\u201cThe women we are seeing are increasingly young, many are unaccompanied minors when they arrive and the violence and exploitation they face when they are under the control of these gangs is getting worse.

He said the men had now been released, but faced charges of prostitution and loitering. </p> <p>Though sodomy is a criminal offence punishable by life imprisonment, there is no law prohibiting homosexuality in Tanzania. As a result, Ouma said that many LGBT people in Tanzania had been able to lead relatively normal lives free from harassment and violence until now.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cMakonda has made people believe that it is now OK to hate LGBT people, especially gay men.

  "<p>Working full-time after the age of 40 is&#xa0;not good for the brain. Doing more than three days a week once you reach this age can damage your ability to think. <a href=\"https://www.melbourneinstitute.com/downloads/working_paper_series/wp2016n07.pdf\" title=\"\">A&#xa0;paper from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research</a> says that, while working up to 30 hours a week is good for the brains of the over-40s, do any more than that and it goes downhill. If you were to work 60 hours a week, your cognitive ability would be worse than that of someone who didn\u2019t work at all. Still, on the plus side, you would have more money than them.</p> <p>The researchers used data from more than 3,000 men and 3,500 women who completed the national <a href=\"https://www.melbourneinstitute.com/hilda/\" title=\"\">Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda)</a> survey. The survey tested the ability to read words aloud, recite lists of numbers and match letters and numbers in a&#xa0;speed trial. Testing reading is a measure of the \u201cknowing\u201d part of ability, says lead author Prof Colin McKenzie, while the other two tests capture fluid intelligence \u2013 the \u201cthinking\u201d part of ability that includes memory, abstract reasoning and executive reasoning.</p> <p>This lowering of scores in those aged&#xa0;over 40 who work full-time doesn\u2019t fit with the idea that working for longer helps people stay mentally sharp, or with the notion of \u201cuse it or&#xa0;lose it\u201d. So, should those who can afford to work less from the age of 40 reduce their hours?</p> <h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2> <p>Most of us have to keep working full-time. But does it matter what sort of job you do? Is your ability to think preserved, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12735080\" title=\"\">as some research suggests</a>, if you have an intellectually demanding job? The Hilda survey doesn\u2019t ask questions about the quality of work, and McKenzie says it\u2019s hard to tell: \u201cIt\u2019s&#xa0;very difficult to identify the causal effects of the type of work on cognitive functions. People may be selected into certain occupations according to their cognitive abilities.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also not clear why working more than 30 hours is not good for your brain, while fewer hours is beneficial. McKenzie says that work can be a double-edged sword. \u201cWhile work can stimulate brain activity, long working hours can cause fatigue and stress, which potentially damage cognitive functions. Full-time work (40 hours a week) is still better than no work in terms of maintaining cognitive functioning, but it is not maximising the positive effects of work,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Results may also vary between countries, depending on how much holiday people can take each year. It\u2019s&#xa0;hard to control for all the factors that might bias a study such as this&#xa0;(including choices around the&#xa0;hours worked and the type of work), but it makes the idea of working full-time until the age of 67 \u2013 which the government aims to bring in between 2026 and 2028 \u2013 even less appealing.</p>",
  "<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-job-vacancies-fall-700000-in-the-week-after-brexit-data-shows-a7124686.html\">data by CEB</a>, job adverts fell by 700,000 in the week after the British people voted to leave the European Union. So if you were thinking of changing jobs, you may be thinking you should put your CV on ice. No one likes uncertainty and until there is more clarity about our future relationship with the EU and the impact of a Brexit on the jobs market, the outlook is uncertain. </p> <p>However, we need to focus on the positives. It may not be as bad as we fear \u2013 the UK is still the sixth <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/24/france-overtakes-uk-as-fifth-largest-economy-as-pound-plummets-5964746/\">largest economy</a> in the world; plus, findings from a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/agentssummary/2016/jul.aspx\">Bank of England survey</a> of its nationwide agents revealed that two thirds of firms are pressing on with hiring plans as normal.</p> <p>Now is actually the time to start thinking how you can turn the current situation to your advantage and get ahead of the game.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t think everyone has stopped recruiting</strong></h2> <p>The news would certainly have us believe that employers are not hiring, but actually it is likely that firms who put recruitment on hold pre-Brexit now need to fill the vacancies they froze until the EU referendum result was announced. </p> <p>Do your research and check whether the industry you are interested in is advertising. And be proactive by sending out tailored applications to the companies you want to work for \u2013 they might just arrive in a recruiting manager\u2019s inbox at the right time. Remember that August is always a bit quieter on the job front but the autumn will see an increase in recruitment, so be ready.</p> <h2><strong>Odds of getting a job may improve as others give up</strong></h2> <p>Competition for jobs may be reduced post-referendum, as many job hunters assume it\u2019s not a good time to apply for jobs, and there may be fewer EU nationals applying for roles in the UK. </p> <h2><strong>Prepare and get ready to be proactive</strong></h2> <p>If you feel more cautious or your industry is more affected by the referendum result, as is financial services for example, then you may decide to put your job search on hold. If you do, then use the time you have to prepare.</p> <h2></h2> <p>Investing time in crafting a really strong CV and updating your LinkedIn profile will reap benefits. Again, do your research and think about what you can bring to a company \u2013 what changes might a potential Brexit cause in your industry, and how can you contribute? You can drill down even further and consider what leaving the EU will mean to your profession and what new skills or knowledge you could focus on developing to be able to deal with future challenges.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/may/23/work-after-brexit-the-biggest-winners-and-losers-for-uk-jobs\">Work after Brexit: the biggest winners and losers for UK jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Make sure you highlight these areas in your applications \u2013 it demonstrates you are thinking strategically and are commercially aware.</p> <h2><strong>Attend networking events and schedule lunches</strong></h2> <p> Employers will continue to recruit using non-traditional routes, so building a sound network and letting your contacts know that you\u2019re looking for a job can be an effective way to hear about potential vacancies. It is also a good way to find out what employers will be looking for post-Brexit. Be clear about your message and how you can add value.</p> <h2><strong>Re-evaluate and reach out to recruiters</strong></h2> <p>Similarly, taking time to develop strong relationships with recruiters is a good investment of your time. Find out which agencies your industry respects and uses, and work hard to get to meet them so you can talk about what you have to offer and what you want to get from your next role.

  "<p>On a sultry night in Brazil the expectant supporters of Team GB finally had every excuse to go nuts. The first British gold medal of the Games is safely in the bag but Adam Peaty\u2019s storming success in the 100m breaststroke carries far more significance. Not for 28 years has a British male collected Olympic swimming gold, a long watery drought if ever there was one.</p> <p>And how spectacularly did the dam finally burst, courtesy of another of those buccaneering displays the bullish Peaty now specialises in. He did not so much see off the assembled field in the aquatics centre as swamp them with his sheer class and irresistible power. As he swept into the final 25 metres, his own world record about to obliterated, even the illustrious, sepia-tinted ghosts of Adrian Moorhouse, Duncan Goodhew and David Wilkie were left trailing in his wake. His final time of 57.13 is more than a second quicker than anything he achieved prior to Rio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/adam-peaty-breaks-his-own-world-record-again-in-golden-olympic-swim\">Adam Peaty makes light work of pressure as hard work pays off in Rio pool | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Talk about rising to the occasion. Peaty and his coach Mel Marshall had felt 57.3 secs was the fastest he could possibly swim; to go lower was an almost impossible possibility. \u201cTwenty eight years is a very long time...it was always in the back of my mind,\u201d he confirmed, referring to Moorhouse\u2019s 1988 feat. \u201cGoing into the actual race I wasn\u2019t even thinking about that; I was so calm and composed. But now I\u2019ve achieved it, it\u2019s an absolute honour. It\u2019s definitely the best feeling I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p> <p>There is certainly something fresh and wonderfully uncomplicated about the turbo-charged 21-year-old from Uttoxeter, particularly at a turbulent time in his sport\u2019s history. For Team GB it hardly be a healthier pick-me-up, a tantalising invitation to others to do likewise. Within minutes, the Welsh swimmer Jazz Carlin had secured silver in the women\u2019s 400m freestyle to make it a truly memorable evening for British swimming. Already there is the promise of a weightier haul than in London four years ago when British won just three medals in the pool \u2013 a silver and two bronze. There is a very different feel now.</p> <p>In Peaty\u2019s case, however, there are strong echoes of Rebecca Adlington\u2019s emotional triumph in Beijing in 2008: a down-to-earth Midlands background, a fearless attitude in the pool, refreshingly honest on dry land. Like Adlington, now a mentor of his, Peaty had a slight phobia about water as a youngster: he apparently used to scream the house down when his parents tried to put him in the bath so they took him the swimming-pool instead. \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to shower when I was younger,\u201d he revealed after the medal ceremony. \u201cThat\u2019s how scared I was.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/08/adam-peaty-wins-great-britains-first-gold-of-rio-2016-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qxbh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2638565\"            data-video-name=\"Adam Peaty wins Great Britain\u2019s first gold of Rio 2016 \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8188ae4b0f5d06484157e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808peaty_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/08/160808peaty.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/3gp/small/2016/08/08/160808peaty_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/3gp/large/2016/08/08/160808peaty_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/08/160808peaty_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/08/adam-peaty-wins-great-britains-first-gold-of-rio-2016-video-highlights\">Adam Peaty wins Great Britain\u2019s first gold of Rio 2016</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Famously, he decided to get serious about his sport four years ago when he watched his pal, Craig Benson, racing at the Olympics. Peaty realised it was time to buck up his ideas. With World, European, Commonwealth and now Olympic titles behind him at the age of 21 all that dedication has paid off handsomely. \u201cMy family knew how much it meant to me so words weren\u2019t really necessary after the race. You could tell everything from the hug we gave each other. For all these years they\u2019ve believed in me from the start.\u201d</p> <p>No-one will be more delighted than his 74-year-old grandmother, Mavis Williams, who has been entertaining the Twittersphere in her new role as #OlympicNan. From asking her window-cleaner to put up union flag bunting on her bungalow to suggesting she was \u201cso proud I could burst\u201d Mavis could soon threaten Dame Edna Everage\u2019s status as the world\u2019s most endearing senior citizen.</p> <p>His nursery manager mum, Caroline, has also been a pivotal figure, having endlessly risen at 4am to drive Peaty to the pool to train \u2013 and taken him back in the evening \u2013 despite her aversion to driving. Her poolside presence in Brazil was a major achievement in itself, given she had never previously flown or been further than France. As her son put clear water between himself and his nearest pursuer, South Africa\u2019s Cameron van der Burgh, the British-accented cheers around the 15,000 capacity venue were impossible to miss.</p> <p>There was almost as much delight for Carlin, 25, who swam another fine race to finish second behind the inevitable winner, Katie Ledecky of the United States. It was the gutsiest of swims in the most illustrious of company, Ledecky carving another large chunk off her own world record to clock a time of three minutes 56.46 secs. Later in the evening there was also another gold for the uniquely prolific Michael Phelps as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/michael-phelps-usa-swimming-katie-ledecky-rio-2016\">the US won the men\u2019s 100m relay</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"928a67440f5c4cffde4e69f2eeb889cd1c6f6bcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/928a67440f5c4cffde4e69f2eeb889cd1c6f6bcd/0_96_2290_1375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jazz Carlin with her silver medal after finishing second in the final of the women\u2019s 400m freestyle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jazz Carlin with her silver medal after finishing second in the final of the women\u2019s 400m freestyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, James Guy had just enough energy left in a depleted tank to qualify for the final of the 200m freestyle, having earlier revealed he and his room-mate Peaty had struggled to sleep the previous night. The adrenalin and excitement generated by their first Olympic swims kept both men awake and Guy only just squeezed into the final in eighth place, with China\u2019s Sun Yang the fastest swimmer in the semi-finals. There was also a world record time of 55.48 secs in the women\u2019s 100 metre butterfly for Sweden\u2019s dominant Sarah Sjostrom, as well as boos for the controversial Russian Yulia Efimova before and after her 100m breaststroke semi-final.</p>",
  "<p>Less than a year ago, George Osborne boasted of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/19/george-osborne-embrace-china-dont-fear-its-rise\">\u201cgolden decade\u201d</a> in ties with China. It was grand rhetoric for a cobbled together package of red carpet visits, a problematic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/13/hinkley-point-c-cost-30bn-top-up-payments-nao-report\">nuclear energy project</a> and deals like the \u00a345m agreement to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/pig-semen-export-deal-china\">export the UK\u2019s finest pig semen</a>. But even the cynics didn\u2019t expect the shine to come off quite so quickly. Britain has just blindsided Beijing twice: through its shock announcement that the centrepiece nuclear project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/government-seeks-to-reassure-investors-as-hinkley-point-delayed\">is on hold</a>, pending a fresh review, and by voting to leave the European Union.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">swift reversal on Hinkley Point C</a> epitomises the dilemma posed by China\u2019s ascendance. Other countries dutifully talk about partnership and win-win pacts, and there has been real progress on areas such as climate change. But for the most part, they have found themselves torn between the lure of the world\u2019s second largest economy and their alarm at its might \u2013 its increasing influence and assertiveness, its authoritarian leadership, nationalism and hefty military investments, and its desire to reset the rules, as rising powers usually do. Tony Abbott <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/fear-and-greed-drive-australias-china-policy-tony-abbott-tells-angela-merkel-20150416-1mmdty.html\">said privately</a> while he was Australia\u2019s prime minister that his country\u2019s China policy was driven by \u201cfear and greed\u201d. He could have spoken for many of his counterparts.</p> <p>When Osborne took charge of China policy, ushering through the deal for investment in the French-built nuclear plant, greed took the lead. Some of the steps were sensible and even admirable \u2013 seeking cooperation on a space programme; leading support for Beijing\u2019s new development bank in the face of churlish US opposition. But Britain\u2019s hushed response in a string of cases showed that despite the lip service to human rights they were \u201cnot one of our top priorities \u2026 the prosperity agenda is further up the list\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/05/guardian-view-on-human-rights-and-foreign-policy-philip-hammond-foreign-office\">a top official conceded</a> of foreign policy in general.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/friends-may-hinkley-point-delays\">Just as we need friends, May is busy ruffling feathers over Hinkley Point | Deborah Orr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though Theresa May\u2019s spokesman says the UK will still seek a strong relationship \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/chinese-firm-with-military-ties-invited-to-bid-for-role-in-uks-nuclear-future\">China National Nuclear Corporation</a> was yesterday revealed to be on a government list of those deemed eligible to develop small modular reactors \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s instincts appear fearful.

There is a more obvious reason to ditch the plant: its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-c-wrong-project-wrong-price\">questionable technology and excessive price tag</a>. Analysts suggest that should relations deteriorate to a point where China might contemplate turning the lights out, we would probably have bigger problems to deal with anyway.</p> <p>Still, the US, for example, has been much more cautious, mindful perhaps that China has a variable safety record and a culture of cover-up. On Hinkley Point, says <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/en/persons/nigel-s-inkster\">Nigel Inkster</a> of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and formerly of MI6, the risks \u201care ultimately manageable if you are prepared to acknowledge they exist\u201d.</p> <p>Though Beijing\u2019s response so far has been muted, it will not have appreciated the embarrassingly last-minute nature of the Hinkley rethink, and the airing of suspicions about Chinese intentions. If the nuclear project is ditched for good, it is likely to be much more vocal.</p> <p>Four years ago, it punished us in retaliation for David Cameron\u2019s meeting with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/china-cancels-uk-visit-dalai-lama\">Dalai Lama</a>. High-level visits halted and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/29/slapdowns-2013-insults-jibes\">state media trolled the UK</a> as \u201cmerely a country of old Europe suitable only for tourism and overseas students, with a few decent football teams\u201d. But trade still went up and Beijing still approached London to initiate projects. It knew we had our uses. Osborne understood the importance of China\u2019s power better than most. But he wasted our own, albeit waning, influence.</p> <p>Britain is still boosted by the legacy of our empire, such as our permanent seat on the security council. Until recently, we offered China a gateway to Europe and a voice inside it, lobbying against anti-dumping rules, for example.</p> <p>China\u2019s own economic woes mean that entrepreneurs are looking outwards, and Beijing wants to diversify its foreign holdings away from dollars. Britain still looks like a fairly safe bet if you want a decent return on investment; that\u2019s why Chinese companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/03/china-buys-weetabix-majority-stake\">own Weetabix</a>, a slice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/16/china-current-future-investments-18bn-trade-rail-nuclear\">Thames Water</a> and, as of Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/west-brom-takeover-chinese-investment-group\">West Bromwich Albion FC</a>. More may come in search of post-Brexit bargains. Our soft power is born not just of Jane Austen, James Watt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but also our political, legal and economic culture, for all its flaws.</p> <p>China has tried and failed to buy its way to soft power. The Hinkley Point project was in large part about borrowing our reputation \u2013 showing that we trusted the China General Nuclear Power Corporation not only to cooperate on the EDF plant, but more importantly to design and build its own reactors at Bradwell in Essex, with a view to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed\">further overseas deals</a>.</p> <p>For the leadership, the Hinkley delay and the manner of its announcement will reinforce the conviction that democracy is not only a threat to their power, but also a bad, unpredictable, even irresponsible way of running a country. It is perhaps even more dismayed by Brexit. We have lost a large part of our value to it; and at the same time lost the strength in numbers we enjoyed in dealing with it.</p> <p>The prospect of a bilateral <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36877573\">trade agreement</a> compensating for Brexit-induced economic woes seems slim, even putting aside the years it would take to thrash out a deal, with experienced negotiators in short supply. We need China more than ever, and have less to offer them; especially since other advantages \u2013 the City of London, world-class universities \u2013 have to deal with the impact of Brexit too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/22/i-want-you-to-understand-the-sense-of-fear-that-chinese-people-feel-every-day\">I want you to understand the sense of fear that Chinese people feel every day | Nanfu Wang</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The price for Osborne\u2019s unabashed embrace of China has been our credibility, at a time when we need it most. The relegation of human rights told Beijing that we would cave if pressed hard enough on an issue. It undermined Chinese activists and lawyers, made it tougher for other countries to tackle the issueand bolstered the argument that western concerns for rights are selective (which is often true) and another way of attacking it (which is not).</p> <p>That is a practical issue for the UK as well as a moral one. While Hinkley Point was dominating front pages, news from China garnered less attention: the trials of human rights lawyers, part of a sweeping crackdown on civil society and dissenting voices. Zhou Shifeng, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/04/chinese-lawyer-who-exposed-baby-milk-scandal-jailed-for-subversion\">jailed for seven years</a> for subversion, had represented families hit by the scandal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/02/china\">melamine-tainted milk powder</a> which killed six infants and sickened 300,000, partly because of a cover-up by the firm and local officials, and self-censorship by journalists who feared retaliation.</p> <p>It is Zhou, and people like him, who have sought to promote the rule of law and accountability: things we should also wish to see prioritised there. Osborne and co pleased China\u2019s leadership when they rowed back on human rights, but they sold its citizens short \u2013 and Britain too.</p> <p>They pursued their strategy without sufficient thought, adequate consideration of the repercussions or a deep enough understanding of our potential partners \u2013 at a time when Beijing has displayed increasing hostility to western ideas and a tougher approach to western businesses. The prime minister should learn from Osborne\u2019s focus on China, without adopting his unalloyed enthusiasm, but her job has been made much harder by his compromises.</p>",

Like most countries, the UK has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/14/zero-carbon-emissions-target-enshrined-uk-law\">tough emissions target for 2050</a> and, even though aviation has been given an easy ride compared with other industries, the sector is on course to exceed its generous limit. That\u2019s the case even without adding a new runway. Increasing the number of flights from the UK would put the target further out of reach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/15/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-gatwick-bosses-new-runway-heathrow\">London mayor Sadiq Khan joins Gatwick bosses in call for new runway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Undeterred, the commission responded with reassurance that we can build a new runway without breaking our climate limits. Its confidence seems to have put most people off looking into the details: that and the way the commission scattered, across hundreds of pages in several different publications, its explanation of how it had achieved what seemed impossible.</p> <p>Analysis that I co-authored might help explain why the commission appeared so reluctant to spell out its workings. In fact, it\u2019s hard to imagine a less popular way of winning public support for a new runway than its suggestion for how expansion could avoid breaking our climate limits.</p> <p>The essence of the commission\u2019s suggestion is simple, even if the details are difficult to pin down. It proposed that the government could allow a new runway to be built without busting the emissions cap, by hiking the cost of tickets so fewer people can afford to fly. Its idea is to build a new runway in London then increase prices so that demand for flights falls, particularly at airports in poorer parts of the country. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-05T15:55:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Impact of a Heathrow third runway on passenger demand at regional airports\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-05T15:55:56/embed.html\">Impact of a Heathrow third runway on passenger demand at regional airports</a> </figure>  <p>No one can say precisely how big the price increase would need to be to keep the country within its limits, because it depends on how quickly flight technology improves, but today\u2019s report estimates how much more tickets might have to cost.</p> <p>If technology to make planes more fuel-efficient progresses as quickly as the commission optimistically suggests, a return ticket to New York \u2013 from any UK airport, not just the one with the new runway \u2013 would become about \u00a3270 more expensive after a new runway is built. But if technology moves more slowly, as many analysts think it will, the flight could cost \u00a3850 more. Price increases like these would spell the end of budget flying; long-haul trips would be affordable only to the rich.</p> <p>People worried about climate change shouldn\u2019t kid themselves that this is a realistic solution to the emissions problems a new runway brings. It\u2019s near-impossible to imagine the government putting such a high price on flying purely to protect the environment: after all, it couldn\u2019t bring itself to increase fuel duty for drivers this year despite two years of <a href=\"http://www.racfoundation.org/data/uk-pump-prices-over-time\">falling prices</a>. It\u2019s far more likely that a new runway \u2013 and the rest of the UK\u2019s airport capacity \u2013 will be used, busting our climate limits.</p> <p>If the runway really is built, the best hope of keeping flights affordable without breaking our climate targets may be for the government to tax frequent fliers at a higher rate than those going on holiday just once or twice a year, so more people can still travel. This approach was outlined last year by <a href=\"http://afreeride.org/\">A Free Ride</a> and could be the cleanest and fairest answer, but would depend on a level of serious political engagement with this challenge that has so far been absent. </p> <p>Sometime soon the government will finally make a decision about a new runway. To many, it seems the question of how the runway can avoid breaking our climate change law has been resolved, but in fact, all we\u2019ve had is a series of possibilities. We should understand where the path leads before taking a step into the dark.</p>",
  "<p>Scotland\u2019s environment agency has warned the country\u2019s industries and farmers that their waste and inefficiency is now the biggest threat to the environment, overtaking pollution.</p> <p>In a marked shift in strategy, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, Terry A\u2019Hearn, will urge businesses, farmers and manufacturers to adopt a \u201cone planet prosperity\u201d policy designed to cut their energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, waste and resource use. </p> <p>\u201cThe major threat to the environment now is that humanity is overusing the planet as a resource base,\u201d he told the Guardian. </p> <p>A\u2019Hearn argues that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has largely won the battle against so-called gross pollution from onshore sources. Air, water and soil pollution is now far below the levels seen decades ago. <br></p> <p>Those were 20<sup>th-</sup>century problems, he said. But developed economies such as the UK\u2019s are now consuming resources at a rate close to three times the planet\u2019s actual capacity. \u201cI\u2019ve been extremely clear that if we have only one planet, we have to be really, really smart about how we use it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sepa, which is sister agency to the Environment Agency in England, has been given greater regulatory power and independence under legislation passed by the Scottish parliament in 2014, including greater freedom to fine polluters. </p> <p>It is now able to levy fines as high as \u00a340,000 without going through state prosecutors, imposing fixed penalties similar to those issued by police for driving offences, and has discretionary powers to penalize repeat offenders far more heavily for repeated breaches. </p> <p>But Sepa\u2019s data shows that 87% of Scottish businesses now have a good or excellent regulatory record, with only 7% rated as poor or very poor. </p> <p>A\u2019Hearn, an Australian who took over as Sepa chief executive last year after running Northern Ireland\u2019s environment agency, said there were still sectors with \u201csignificant challenges\u201d, particularly the fish farming industry.<br> </p> <p>Scottish salmon farms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/10/scottish-fish-farmers-parasite-pesticide\">are repeatedly </a>criticised by environment campaigners and other marine industries for heavy use of toxic chemicals to combat sea lice and disease, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/10/marine-harvest-salmon-farm-scottish-loch\">seabed pollution caused by fish excrement</a>. \u201cThere are still compliance issues here; we need to get on top of those,\u201d A\u2019Hearn said.</p> <p>With an overall budget of \u00a378m, Sepa has seen its government funding cut by about 25% in real terms over the last decade and is absorbing a 6% budget cut this year, down to \u00a337m. Half its funds come from regulatory fees and other sources, helping cushion the impact of those cuts.<br></p> <p>A\u2019Hearn said its inspection regime would remain robust but in an article being posted on <a href=\"http://www.sepaview.com/\">Sepa\u2019s website</a> later on Monday, he asserts that sustainable growth is now the core objective of its regulatory strategy.</p> <p>\u201cOur statutory purpose, to deliver environmental protection and improvement in ways which also create health and wellbeing benefits and sustainable economic growth, means that Sepa must undertake a very different role if we are to help create prosperity within our planet\u2019s capacity to support it,\u201d he states. </p> <p>The aquaculture sector would be among the first to be approached by A\u2019Hearn to establish new \u201csustainable growth agreements\u201d which he said will be central to his new one planet strategy. </p> <p>Based partly on a similar scheme he rolled out in Northern Ireland, voluntary but formal agreements would be struck with the most successful or progressive companies, or possibly on an industry-wide basis. </p> <p>Companies which became sector champions would set targets or goals to increase efficiency and cut down waste; it would allow them to publicise that role in their marketing. Some highly integrated sectors such as the whisky industry, which has lately adopted more ambitious environmental policies, could sign industry-wide sustainability deals.</p> <p>A\u2019Hearn cited a deal signed by the aggregates and cement giant Lafarge on his second-last day as boss of the Northern Ireland agency. Lafarge agreed to pilot a scheme to take chicken manure from a major poultry farm and waste tyres as lower carbon fuel sources to generate the vast amounts of power needed for its cement factory at Cookstown. </p> <p>Environmentalists fear that crowning some firms and industries as sustainability champions could lead to conflicts of interest and tensions for Sepa, if it had to crack down on pollution offences by that company or had to help adjudicate if a sector champion, say a fishfarm, wanted to open a new site or expand in a sensitive area.</p> <p>A\u2019Hearn said Sepa \u201cwon\u2019t hesitate\u201d in telling a firm that wants to expand that it can\u2019t do so if it fails to protect the environment. \u201cI don\u2019t see any tension at all if we do it properly,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The opening passage of any sustainable growth agreement would ensure the business agrees to meet all compliance standards at all times. \u201cIf it becomes clear that they\u2019re not willing to sign up to those, it\u2019s clear then that they\u2019re not best performers. I will be eyeballing CEO\u2019s to test that,\u201d he insisted.</p> <ul> <li>A reference to the Welsh environment agency was removed from this story on 9 August 2016.</li> </ul>",

  "<p>The United Nations is now 70 years old. And the world of 70 years ago was a vastly different place to the world of today. Global geo-politics is in the middle of its third great transformation since the last global war: from 40 years of cold war, to what now seems to have been the 20 year temporary peace that followed the fall of the Soviet Union, to the current period of growing geo-political instability between the US and Russia, the US and China and the now the deepening strategic engagement between China and Russia.</p> <p>Geo-economics has also radically changed from a post-war global economy dominated by the US, to one where global economic power is split between the US, China and Europe, and where China\u2019s economic century has barely begun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/kevin-rudd-outlines-10-point-plan-to-reform-un-in-response-to-globalisation\">Kevin Rudd outlines 10-point plan to reform UN in response to globalisation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And against all this fundamental change in the deep underpinnings of the order itself, the need for global collaboration is at an all-time high as we strive to respond to the \u201cglobalisation\u201d of everything, from global financial instability, to the rise of global terrorism, the explosion in global people movements and the planetary imperatives from climate change. The common refrain from foreign ministries around the world is that at a time when the demand for effective global governance is on the rise, the supply of such governance appears to be in decline. Instead, we are beginning to see a fragmentation of the order itself.</p> <p>The question arises, therefore, whether this post-war institution called the UN remains \u201cfit for purpose\u201d to meet the needs of the international community for the century unfolding before us. And if not, what can be done in practical terms to bring its mission, structure and resourcing up to date to meet the formidable challenges ahead.</p> <p>The bottom line is that despite its many detractors, the UN matters. In fact, because it is such an embedded part of the post-war order, it matters a lot. So much so that if it was to fail, falter or just fade away, it would further erode the stability of an already fragile global order.</p> <p>But because the UN has become such a \u201cfactored in\u201d component of the international order after 70 years, we are barely conscious of the continuing stabilising role it plays in setting the broad parameters for the conduct of international relations. We tend to take the UN for granted. We see it as a comfortable part of the international furniture. A given.</p> <p>But as history reminds us, nothing is forever, least of all the durability of global institutions whose history is recent and where the precedents are fraught. If the UN one day disappears, or more likely just slides into neglect, it is only then that we would become fully aware of the gaping hole this would leave in what remained of the post-war order. Without the UN, we would be left with increasingly brittle \u201cstate-on-state\u201d relationships, with little remaining to mediate, negotiate or resolve inter-state crises when they arise. By which time it would simply be too late to lament the UN\u2019s demise.</p> <p>The UN has many core strengths. It has unmatched international legal legitimacy under the terms of the UN Charter and the sovereign equality of states. It is capable therefore of speaking with a universal voice, unmatched by any other institution. It sets global norms through a vast array of international treaty law. It possesses a unique global convening power to deal with the challenges of the day. It can take global initiatives in its own name and demonstrate global leadership. It has a unique power to initiate lawful collective security action to preserve international peace and security. It is also empowered to deliver economic and social programs to enhance social justice and environmental sustainability. These powers are impossible to replicate, and they stand separate to the many successes and failures the UN has been associated with over the decades.</p> <p>Those of us who are proud to be life-long friends of the UN today will defend the institution to the hilt. But The uncomfortable truth is that while the UN today is not broken, it is in trouble. The danger is that it is starting to drift into irrelevance as states increasingly \u201cwalk around\u201d the UN on the most important questions facing the international community, seeking substantive solutions elsewhere, increasingly seeing the UN as a pleasant diplomatic afterthought. </p> <p>We see this, for example on the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, terrorism, cyber security, global pandemics, and refugees. There is a reason for this. The UN, like many old institutions both national and international, is being overwhelmed by the major systemic changes and challenges now buffeting the international community at large. But this is compounded by the fact that UN has a 20th century institutional structure and culture, struggling to adapt to new 21st century realities. And the common concern for those who care about the institution\u2019s future is that if it fails to adapt, the UN is likely to slowly slide into the shadowlands.</p> <p>This need not be the case. The UN is capable of re-inventing itself. All 21st century institutions must do this in order to survive the pace and complexity of change around them. There is no point dreaming utopian dreams that the UN could be rebuilt from the ground up. But we can make what we already have work much better.</p> <ol> <li>We need a UN which structurally integrates its peace and security, sustainable development, humanitarian and human rights agendas as a strategic continuum, rather than leaving them as the self-contained, institutional silos of the past. This reflects the \u201cjoined-up\u201d realities which the UN now has to deal with on the ground. This integrated approach to UN missions must occur both at the centre of UN operations, and in the field.<br></li> <li>We need a UN with a robust policy planning capability looking into the future several years out, not just at the crises of the day;</li> <li>We need a UN which embraces a comprehensive doctrine of prevention, rather than just reaction, which is directly reflected in the organisation\u2019s leadership structure, culture and resources. The guiding principles of the future must be anticipation, planning and prevention, rather than a culture of simple reaction, \u201cband aid\u201d solutions, and fingers crossed.</li> <li>We need equally a UN with a comprehensive ready-reaction capability, both as an effective provider of security stabilisation and emergency humanitarian support, to deal with crises which erupt without warning.</li> <li>We need a UN which attaches first priority of field operations over head office. The UN of the future will be judged on its performance in the field in saving lives and transforming life opportunities for the world. The UN\u2019s performance will not be judged by the number of reports that are written. In fact, the UN writes too many.</li> <li>We need a \u201cTeam UN\u201d which finally resolves the problem of its rigid institutional silos by moving increasingly to integrated, multi-disciplinary teams to deal with specific challenges on the ground, and driven by fully-empowered directors of local UN operations in each country;</li> <li>We need a UN driven by the measurement of real results on the ground, rather the elegance of our processes in the conference hall;</li> <li>We need a UN which attaches a new priority to the principle of \u201cWe the People\u201d by developing, at scale, global partnerships and compacts with civil society and the private sector. The UN has embarked on an approach of gradually developing these. It must now proceed at pace. Otherwise we will fail in the delivery of the sustainable development goals under Agenda 2030, which cannot be delivered in the absence of unleashing large-scale private finance. Global public finance is but a drop in the ocean of what is needed. This new partnership philosophy must also be integrated at the highest levels of UN management and, once again, across the traditional silos. And this can be done while maintaining the centrality of the UN member-states, and their policy priorities, in the process.</li> <li>We need a UN where women are at the centre of the totality of its agenda, not just parts of it, so that their full human potential can be realised as a matter of social justice, and because to fail to do so will further undermine peace, security, development and human rights. We also need a UN where the youth of the world have their voices heard at the centre of the UN\u2019s councils, not simply as some sort of paternalistic afterthought, so that youth can help shape a future of genuine hope for the billions of people today aged under 25.</li> <li>And we need a UN that can operate efficiently, effectively, and flexibly, within the inevitable fiscal limitations of the future, rather than one that assumes that constrained national budgets are likely to loosen up any time soon.</li> </ol> <p>These 10 basic principles are not exactly rocket science. Nor do they address every institutional and policy challenge faced by the UN system today. They do, however, provide some guide for the continuing reform of the <em>management</em> of the UN system in the future. Many fine reform programs have been launched in the past, including by the current secretary general. But it is the responsibility of each generation to think afresh on the mega-changes and challenges of our own time. And this responsibility will fall principally on the shoulders of the next UN secretary general, whoever she or he may be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/05/kevin-rudd-says-malcolm-turnbulls-rejection-of-un-bid-a-monstrous-intrusion\">Kevin Rudd says Malcolm Turnbull's rejection of UN bid a 'monstrous intrusion'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is also the task I have sought to address over the last two years as the chair of the Independent Commission on Multilateralism, established by the International Peace Institute in September 2014. Given the recent decision of the current Australian prime minister to decline my nomination, it seems I will not be a candidate myself for the position of UNSG. But I offer these reflections, and more substantively the report I will soon release, to the next SG, her or his staff, the UN secretariat, and most importantly the UN member states, for their consideration. </p> <p>The slow, but steady decline of the UN, and the wider multilateral system which has the UN as its foundation, would be catastrophic for an increasingly unstable world. The peoples of the world, in one way or another, are increasingly asking the question: \u201cIs anybody in control anymore?\u201d when they see growing disagreement among the great powers, the re-emergence of old inter-state conflicts, terrorists on their streets, chaos in their markets, and jobs disappearing with nothing to replace them. People are questioning whether we are beginning to see the beginning of a deeper crisis in the foundations of the overall post-war order itself.</p> <p>I remain a life-long UN supporter, advocate and optimist. But the time for deep UN reform is now. Otherwise, the UN will, in the decades ahead, not die, but quietly fade away, the facade of a once grand building but where, on closer inspection, little of substance actually happens anymore. And that would an avoidable tragedy for us all, large states and in particular small, signalling the end of what remains a core pillar of our post-world order. </p>"
