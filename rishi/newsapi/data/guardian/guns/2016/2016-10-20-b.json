  "<p>On Friday, the state police ministers will meet to finalise the review of the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) including the fate of the Adler A110 lever-action shotgun. </p> <p>The importance of this meeting should not be underestimated. In summary, the ministers are deciding the future direction of Australia\u2019s gun laws. A future that could see the demise of Australia\u2019s strong gun laws and the continual rise of the pro-gun lobby.</p> <p>One issue which the states and commonwealth cannot agree on is the classification of the Adler lever-action shotgun. To understand the argument surrounding this firearm, it\u2019s important to understand the way firearms have been classified in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2016/oct/20/heres-why-gun-control-advocates-want-to-restrict-the-adler-shotgun-interactive\">Here's why gun control advocates want to restrict the Adler shotgun</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1996, in response to the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, where 35 people were shot dead and 19 others were physically injured, Australia implemented a new firearms licensing system that categorised firearms based on firing action, calibre and other criteria.</p> <p>The aim of this new firearm licensing system was to restrict civilian access to rapid-fire and self-loading firearms. These types of firearms can hold a large cache of ammunition and fire that ammunition within a quick time succession. For this reason, these firearms were, and still are, the firearms of choice when it comes to gun massacres.</p> <p>Each jurisdiction recognises five primary categories A, B, C, D and H. This licensing system is outlined in a document known as the National Firearms Agreement (NFA).</p> <p>In summary, category A firearms are the least powerful firearms and have limited firing capacity. They include air rifles, and single and double barrel shotguns. Lever-action shotguns fall within this category. Category B firearms also include some low level repeating firearm. Category A and B firearms are the most commonly registered firearms in Australia and may be owned for a range of sporting, recreational (hunting) and occupational purposes.</p> <p>Categories C and D include the more powerful firearms and are restricted. Category C includes semi-automatic and pump action shotguns with a magazine capacity of no more than five rounds. These guns are available to primary producers and some sporting shooters. Category D are prohibited firearms (except for official purposes) and include self-loading rifle and shotguns and military-style firearms with a magazine greater than five rounds.</p> <p>So let\u2019s get back to the Adler. In 1996, when the NFA was created, lever-action shotguns were single barrel and most could only hold one to two rounds of ammunition at any given time. The design of the lever-action shotgun has been based on an 1887 Winchester cowboy gun. The lever itself was often found to be quite clunky and difficult to use. For these reasons, these firearms were placed within category A.</p> <p>However, 20 years on and the new lever-action shotguns have come a long way. They are slicker, synthetic, hold more ammunition in the magazine, the magazine can be easily extended to carry more ammunition and they can propel the ammunition at a much faster rate. The only real resemblance to the old lever-action is the fact it has a lever, but other than that, it could just as well be a pump-action shotgun, which are category C firearms.</p> <p>There is no doubt recreational hunters were frustrated and angry with the restrictions imposed upon them by the NFA and there has been a thirst among some to gain access to higher powered firearms.</p> <p>Firearm suppliers and manufacturers have also been frustrated by the restriction imposed by the Australian market and have been trying to find ways to create new demands for firearm ownership so they can sell more of their products.</p> <p>One firearm supplier, the company NIOA \u2013 which purports to be Australia\u2019s largest privately owned small arms supplier \u2013 saw the potential for a new lever-action shotgun market. A potential to make money from more than 800,000 category A recreational gun owners across Australia.</p> <p>A strategy successfully utilised by NIOA was to find a way to redesign a category A firearm so that it could have greater firing capacity.</p> <p>To garnish this market, NIOA worked with the Turkish-owned company Adler to design a new lever-action that could hold eight cartridges. The gun was promoted by NIOA as a \u201cgame changer for the Australian market\u201d and more than 7,000 Adlers were pre-ordered. </p> <p>Although a ban has been placed on the eight-shot Adler, a six-shot Adler (five in the magazine and one in the chamber) has not been banned and NIOA currently sells nine different models of Adler A110 to firearms dealers. One new model is called the \u201cPunisher\u201d which has a side saddle that holds six extra cartridges. The six-shot is now available to all category A firearm licence holders across Australia.</p> <p>Beside it being a new modern lever-action, what sets this particular Adler lever shotgun apart from other lever-actions is the easy ability to remove the magazine and replace it with one that holders even more ammunition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/gunslinger-tony-abbott-tries-another-ambush-but-shoots-himself-in-the-foot\">Gunslinger Tony Abbott tries another ambush but shoots himself in the foot | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 21 July 2015, Chris Dawson, chief executive officer of the Australian Crime Commission prepared a memo warning the minister for justice about this danger concerning the Adler. Dawson warned that with the import of the Adler a new magazine extension market will emerge. He noted that because of the firearm\u2019s tubular magazine feature, the extension of the magazine \u201cis not difficult and requires no specialist gun-smithing skills\u201d.</p> <p>Dawson was not wrong. Since the government allowed the importation of the six-shot Adler in October 2015, a new do-it-yourself magazine extension market has emerged, which allows owners of the Adler A110 to extend the magazine to up to 11 shots.</p> <p>There is no doubt the horse has already bolted as the Adler six-shot flows into this country. There is the possibility that, as I write, one is being converted at home into an 11 shot. </p> <p>It is with great sadness that I watch Australia\u2019s gun laws wilted away under the watchful eyes of both sides of politics. There is a lot that could have been done before now to prevent this situation. But there is still a lot that could be done to prevent the situation from worsening \u2013 ban the eight-shot, recategorise the six-shot to a category C and prohibit the modification of firearm magazines. Prime minister, premiers, police ministers, the ball is in your court.</p> <p><em>Samantha Lee is chair of Gun Control Australia and a lawyer.</em><br></p>",

There needs to be someone outside of that circle who can protect the student throughout the complaints procedure. It would help to erase that fear.\u201d</p> <p>While welcoming many of the recommendation, campaigners expressed frustration that there were no mechanisms to enforce the proposals, leaving institutions free to adopt \u2013 or ignore \u2013 them as they wish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/26/sexual-harassment-of-students-by-university-staff-hidden-by-non-disclosure-agreements\">Sexual harassment of students by university staff hidden by non-disclosure agreements</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>Dr Rachel Fenton, associate professor of law at the University of the West of England, said it was obvious that no one with knowledge of sexual offences law had been involved in drawing up the legal guidance because it failed to grasp the complexities involved, for example, in determining consent. \u201cYou imagine being a university administrator in a disciplinary procedure where the girl says, \u2018I was drunk and he raped me\u2019 and he says, \u2018It was purely consensual, she was giving me the come on\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThey have no training, no understanding of what that means, no way of understanding credibility, no guidance on how they are supposed to gather evidence, what evidence is appropriate [or] how they are supposed to make that decision.

She also expressed concern about the lack of attention to staff-student harassment.</p> <p>Referring to the Guardian\u2019s coverage, she said: \u201cReports last week detailed the shocking experiences of some postgraduate students at the hands of senior staff, and we know staff-on-student abuse is part of the problem women face. We would like to see regulations put in place [to] prevent sexual relationships between staff and students.\u201d</p> <p>The report acknowledged that, in the absence of statistics from universities, it had relied on the National Union of Students (NUS) for data about sexual harassment and violence against women.</p> <p>Hareem Ghani, the NUS\u2019s women\u2019s officer, said: \u201cWe know sexual harassment and violence is prevalent on our campuses and women are disproportionately affected by this. In our post-Brexit society we have become only too aware of the steep rise in hate crime.</p> <p>\u201cNo student should have to face this on their campus and we welcome the opportunity this guidance presents in offering clear recommendations to the leadership in education on the actions they need to take to challenge these issues.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Offering cash payments and rewards to the worst performing pupils produces a substantial boost to their GCSE exam results, according to the findings of the first large-scale experiment of its type in English schools.</p> <p>Researchers from three British and American universities found that offering incentives worth about \u00a380 per half-term to pupils for improved school work, attendance and behaviour produced an outsized impact by cutting the gap in results between pupils receiving free school meals (FSM) and their better-off peers.</p> <p>The study headed by <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/efm/people/simon-m-burgess/overview.html\">Professor Simon Burgess</a> at the University of Bristol followed the performance of 10,600 students taking GCSEs at more than 60 secondary schools, and found that while the incentives had little impact on stronger students, underachieving pupils improved their exam grades and pass rates by up to 10%.</p> <p>\u201cOur paper is the first to test the use of behaviour incentives for high-stakes tests, and the first to compare financial and non-financial rewards over the timescale of an academic year,\u201d <a href=\"http://simonburgesseconomics.co.uk/using-behaviour-incentives-raise-gcse-attainment-poor-neighbourhoods-evidence-large-scale-field-experiment/\">Burgess said</a>.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/economics/working_papers/pdffiles/dp16678.pdf\">the research</a> [pdf] published on Friday, the intervention had \u201cvery substantial\u201d effects on maths and science GCSE results for about half of the pupils involved \u2013 enough to wipe out half of the attainment gap between students eligible for FSM and the rest.</p> <p>\u201cOur hope was that improved effort and engagement would raise GCSE scores, even though the scores themselves carried no rewards,\u201d said Burgess, a professor of economics.</p> <p>\u201cAmong pupils with low predicted GCSE scores, pupils in the intervention group scored substantially more than in the control group.</p> <p>\u201cFor those pupils expected to do well, and already making a huge effort at school, the incentives made little difference.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jun/11/text-messages-us-high-school-students\">Daily inspiring text messages fail to inspire US students to perform better</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burgess said the research \u201cseems to offer some very promising leads for schools and for policymakers\u201d to design incentives for pupils from low-income households, at a lower cost than other interventions tied to FSM eligibility or past attainment.</p> <p>\u201cIn the metric researchers use to compare results across studies, the maths GCSE score increased by 16% of a standard deviation (SD), and the science score by 20% of an SD,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cEducation researchers will know that these are very large effects.\u201d</p> <p>The research was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation, which provided the incentives at a cost of more than \u00a3700,000, and included work by academics from the University of Chicago and the University of California, San Diego.</p> <p>The 10,000 pupils from 63 schools were divided into three groups: a control group that received no rewards, a group that received offers of non-financial rewards, and a third group that received financial incentives.</p> <p>Those in the financial incentive group could each earn up to \u00a380 per half-term, including \u00a330 for completing classwork, \u00a330 for homework, \u00a310 for attendance and \u00a310 for good behaviour. Those in the non-financial group earned tokens for the same criteria, which they could then exchange for rewards such as concert tickets.</p> <p>The researchers found that the cash incentives had the strongest effect on pupils, especially in improving science results. But the non-financial incentives were not far behind, leading the authors to suggest that \u201cnon-financial rewards provide a feasible and cost-effective alternative to financial incentives\u201d.</p> <p>The results are unusual in their effectiveness, with previous studies \u2013 such as those carried out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jun/11/text-messages-us-high-school-students\">by the Harvard academic Roland Fryer in US high schools</a> \u2013 finding little or no effect on test scores from rewards for good behaviour or attendance. Previous research by Burgess had found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/03/student-rewards-cash-free-trips-fail-improve-gcse-results\">little overall impact</a> of such payments. But this latest research differs in concentrating on students preparing for high-stakes tests, in the form of GCSEs.</p> <p>\u201cThis is worth emphasising: a one-year intervention costing around \u00a3200-\u00a3320 per student eliminates half of the free school meal gap in maths and science GCSE scores in the poorest neighbourhoods,\u201d Burgess said.</p> <p>Because of the size of the sample involved, the researchers were able to identify effects that might not have been noted as significant in a smaller study.</p> <p>\u201cIn educational interventions in particular, it is important to recognise that while there may be little effect in the overall population, there may be a significant sub-population of students who experience meaningful benefits,\u201d the research paper concludes.</p> <p>\u201cA better understanding of how to target educational interventions will improve the efficiency of spending on social programmes and help craft policies that meet the needs of individual students.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>During last week\u2019s presidential debate, Hillary Clinton leaned on an old and appealing line. \u201cWe are great because we are good.\u201d Reagan has used it before, as did Eisenhower. What it means, of course, is that our country\u2019s performance advantage on the world stage comes from our willingness to do the right thing.</p> <p>Businesses who market social responsibility as a selling point have been trying to make the same claim for decades.

Skins invested a good deal of its cache on British marathoner Robert Young. An abused child who had grown into a man committed to the impossible, Young claimed to have run 370 marathons in a single year. His 2016 feat, sponsored by Skins, was to run across America in 46 days. What better way to inspire the brand\u2019s performance minded customers?</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/22/robert-young-marathon-record-attempt-cheating-rumors\">rumors began that Young was cheating</a> \u2013 rather than running \u2013 his way across the country. And this is where things got interesting. Rather than sit back and wait for the truth to come out, Skins launched its own investigation, hiring two independent researchers \u2013 Roger Pielke Jr, of the University of Colorado Boulder, and Ross Tucker, of the University of the Free State \u2013 to look into the claims. When they found that Young had likely been hopping into vehicles rather than running, Skins <a href=\"https://www.skins.net/usa/rob-young-investigation/\">published the 101-page report on its website</a> and ended its deal with Young.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a difficult situation when the shit hit the fan,\u201d Skins CEO Jamie Fuller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/02/robert-young-marathon-sponsor-stands-tall\">told the Guardian</a>. \u201cBut the most important thing for us isn\u2019t the initial problem \u2013 because problems will always happen \u2013 it\u2019s what you do when they arise. In our view, there are no half measures when you apply and live by your principles.\u201d</p> <p>The move may seem counterintuitive at first. When the Nike Oregon Project running team faced a doping scandal in 2015, Nike waited for the results of its own investigation and then quietly withdrew sponsorship, a strategy we\u2019ve all come to expect. Why would Skins invite the negative attention? Why spend money on an investigation that is likely to embarrass the company?</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/02/robert-young-marathon-sponsor-stands-tall\">Sean Ingle\u2019s Guardian piece</a> brilliantly scratched the surface as to why this is such a rare example, it\u2019s worth digging deeper into how the company\u2019s actions measure up against other corporate social responsibility efforts.</p> <p>The underlying message of how Skins approached this speaks of a company on a quest for perfection and, in that quest, doing the right thing is just a natural extension of excellence. Skins flipped the logic of traditional corporate social responsibility marketing by saying: \u201cWe are good, because we are great.\u201d</p> <p>See the difference? Skins isn\u2019t saying, \u201cWe\u2019re making great products because we do the right thing.\u201d It\u2019s saying, \u201cWe do the right thing because it\u2019s just part of making great things.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s actions send a strong message about its high-performance gear: to create an extremely high-quality product, a brand must pursue operational perfection. Abusing workers, trashing the planet, tripping through doping scandals \u2013 this is all evidence of a sloppy company that cuts corners.</p> <p>A brand that wants to charge a premium for what it claims are excellent products wins when it shows that it ruthlessly roots out imperfection wherever it\u2019s found.</p> <p>Fuller has built his entire brand around this concept. The company\u2019s mission statement declares that: \u201cSport should be played with creativity, flair and sportsmanship, free of corruption and drugs.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/01/north-carolina-hb2-law-transgender-issues-corporate-businesses-protest\">Inside corporate America's stand against transgender discrimination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How do you live by that mission? By making excellent products that allow athletes to win cleanly and by standing up against cheating. For consumers, the message reinforces the value of Skins products. In the logic of, \u201cWe are good because we are great\u201d, publicly investigating and cutting Young was a no-brainer. In doing so, Skins took what promised to be yet one more brand-bashing scandal and turned it into something positive.</p> <p>Evidence suggests that transparency in handling a corporate scandal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jul/29/what-are-the-business-benefits-of-being-more-transparent\">can actually help a company\u2019s bottom line</a>, both from a consumer perspective as well as <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/03/121703.asp\">overall market value</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s why brands should take notice of this unusual case. Using recycled content, donating a dollar for each purchase, reducing packaging \u2013 these are common efforts by companies who want to tell a story about doing the right thing. We\u2019ve seen that story before.</p> <p>The story that gets people talking \u2013 and buying \u2013 involves pursuing greatness with passion and zeal and doing the right thing in that pursuit. Any brand can do this simply by asking this: what is the greatness we are pursuing, and what good for the world can we do as part of that pursuit?</p>",

Last year at least one voting machine system was found to be substantially insecure. Princeton researcher Jeremy Epstein, now of technology firm SRI, discovered that WinVote machines used in Virginia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/15/virginia-hacking-voting-machines-security\">could be accessed comparatively easily</a> over a Wi-Fi connection through simple passwords. Epstein successfully pushed to have the machines decertified. </p> <p>Epstein told the Guardian that exit polls in particular were a dangerously inaccurate way to gauge the legitimacy of an election. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence that exit polls are not very accurate,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t tell the pollsters what they actually did. In this election, depending on the neighborhood, people might not want to admit that they voted for Clinton or that they voted for Trump.\u201d</p> <p>There are already methods in place to determine the accuracy of the results in a contested district. \u201cRoughly 75, 80% of all voters in this election will use paper ballots,\u201d Epstein said, \u201cso even if the machines were hacked, we\u2019d have the paper ballots to go back to in most cases, especially in states where they do audits.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security is already taking precautions to make sure election results are not interfered with electronically. \u201cTo date, 33 state and 11 county or local election agencies have approached the Department of Homeland Security about our cybersecurity services,\u201d the department said in a press release issued 10 October. DHS continues to offer \u201ccyber-hygiene\u201d services to other state or local boards looking for protection against hacking.</p> <p>Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, shared Epstein\u2019s concerns over using exit polls as way of measuring the legitimacy of an election and warned: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like a scientific way to do things, nor do I think it\u2019s a sound way to ferret out machine problems, it sounds much more like a Roger Stone dirty trick.\u201d </p> <p>Stone, who did not identify the particular precincts volunteers would be targeting, argued that the polling methodology, was \u201cdesigned by professionals\u201d, but was unable to identify who these professionals were.

In 2004, he received a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/04/france.jonhenley\">14-month suspended sentence</a> and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a corrupt 1980s scheme that illegally put workers for Jacques Chirac\u2019s party on the payroll of the Paris town hall.</p> <p>However, the conviction has not so far come back to haunt him. It is accepted that he did not profit personally and instead he is seen as having taken the flak for Chirac.</p> <p>At his campaign headquarters on Paris\u2019s left bank, he stuck by his promise to lead a diverse France that could live together harmoniously.

Economically our unemployment is still very high, particularly among young people, and politically the current leadership has lost all credibility,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the role of a politician is not to bring a message of pessimism and decline, but to share confidence and optimism.\u201d</p> <p>Jupp\u00e9\u2019s take on positive French community relations is an attack on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/how-nicolas-sarkozys-presidential-days-came-back-to-haunt-him\">Sarkozy\u2019s hardline brand</a> of national identity politics, focused on immigration and Islam, which has dominated the headlines.

The world\u2019s largest miner will have no difficulty in recruiting another heavyweight figure, but the role won\u2019t have quite the same allure as it did back in 2010.</p> <p>Back then, the living was easy for the entire mining industry. The commodity supercycle was in full swing, thanks to China\u2019s infrastructure splurge, and the debate in the boardrooms was about the pace of expansion \u2013 fast, or very fast. BHP, to its credit, had a keener sense than most of its rivals that the good times would not last for ever. Thus, when the inevitable bust in commodity prices arrived, it avoided the humiliation of a rights issue. Others didn\u2019t, thus Nasser can depart BHP while pointing to a superior record on total shareholder returns.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not pretend BHP was a model of self-discipline. The failure to buy PotashCorp of Saskatchewan in 2010 was a lucky escape. The entry into the US shale market the following year \u2013 just before oil prices collapsed \u2013 was timed horribly and big write-offs followed. The company was also too slow to cut its dividend after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/brazilians-hit-fatal-dam-disaster-protest-bhp-billiton-agm-mining-collapse-fundao-dam\">Samarco dam disaster</a> in Brazil in which 19 people died.</p> <p>Samarco will consume much of BHP\u2019s attention in coming years in the form of legal battles and compensation claims. As will the on-off spats with Australian politicians who, in more straitened times, want to protect their tax revenues. The next chair of BHP can afford to know little about mergers and acquisitions \u2013 deft political skills are at a premium.</p> <h2>Ryanair: return flight check-in charge is not so nice </h2> <p>So much for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/michael-oleary\">Michael O\u2019Leary</a>\u2019s vow not to \u201cunnecessarily piss people off.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s chief executive has provoked the wrath of some of his customers by announcing plans to charge \u00a36 for customers wishing to check in more than four days before a flight. Current policy is to allow free check-in beginning seven days before a flight for unallocated seats, which is vaguely convenient if you\u2019re off for a week\u2019s holiday and fear being fleeced on roaming charges while abroad.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> says the shift is designed to benefit those passengers who pay between \u00a38 and \u00a315 to reserve a particular seat in advance; they will have more time to pick their spot. This sounds like self-serving nonsense. easyJet allows free online check-in up to 30 days before a flights and still manages to operate a reservation system. Ryanair could do the same if it wished. Being nicer, it seems, is a flexible policy.</p>",

  "<p>Phil Chess, a Polish immigrant who helped deliver Chicago blues to the world, died on Wednesday. He was 95. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/19/phil-chess-dies-chess-records\">Phil Chess, Chess Records co-founder, dies aged 95</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chess and his brother Leonard built <a href=\"http://www.history-of-rock.com/chess_records.htm\">Chess Records</a>, the record label on Chicago\u2019s South Side that first recorded the pantheon of post-war blues and R&amp;B greats who would, a decade later, directly influence the British Invasion and the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll aftermath. Their artists \u2013 Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson, Etta James, Little Walter, Buddy Guy, among many others \u2013 were either first recorded at Chess or the label shepherded the most influential recordings of their careers. In 1951, Chess released Rocket 88 by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, which is considered the first rock record. Besides electric blues, between 1950 and 1969, the label also released jazz, gospel, soul, doo-wop, rockabilly, some country and psychedelic rock. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcFIj8OuIEI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WcFIj8OuIEI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe body of work created by Chess is unmatched in blues history with literally hundreds of songs that are considered classics,\u201d said Bruce Iglauer, president of <a href=\"http://www.alligator.com/\">Alligator Records</a>, the Chicago blues label. </p> <p>Phil and his older brother Leonard emigrated from Poland to the US in 1928 to join their father in Chicago where he worked as a shoemaker and carpenter. By then Yasef Czy\u017c had changed the family name to Chess and his sons, Lejzor and Fiszel, became Leonard and Philip. As teenagers they later joined him in running a family junkyard that happened to be across from a black Baptist church. Years later both brothers would say they were influenced by the music they heard coming through the building\u2019s windows throughout the week. </p> <p>\u201cOn a Sunday, man, they\u2019d get going with that groove and you couldn\u2019t help but stand there and dance. Really, that\u2019s, that\u2019s how good it was,\u201d <a href=\"http://openvault.wgbh.org/transcripts/V_0FDCCD5CA2EB47BAA80E9DDD21954D05\">Phil said in a 1995 interview</a>. \u201cWe gradually got a feel for this black blues. And thank God it took off.\u201d</p> <p>After a stint in the army, Phil joined his brother in the club business in Bronzeville, the city\u2019s center of black nightlife. Eventually they took over Aristocrat Records, a pop label they renamed Chess. The first record under their direction was I Can\u2019t Be Satisfied by Muddy Waters. The 3,000 copies the company pressed sold out in a single day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL53_etpc7Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bL53_etpc7Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Through his earliest days running liquor stores and clubs in Bronzeville, Leonard Chess got to know many of the label\u2019s earliest artists such as Muddy Waters, and throughout the label\u2019s heyday he played a prominent role in securing the artists and producing sessions while his younger brother played a quieter role in the back office, which included handling <a href=\"http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/bmg-buys-control-of-chess-records-publishing-company-arc/\">Arc Music</a>, the company\u2019s important publishing arm, and traveling to radio stations across the US and persuading disc jockeys to give their artists a chance.</p> <p>\u201cPhil was the rock of the company. He held down the office and took care of financial matters,\u201d said Iglauer. \u201cLeonard was known to be emotional, mercurial, and sometimes difficult to deal with while Phil was always the solid one. He was the go-to guy when business had to be dealt with.\u201d</p> <p>Together the brothers recorded artists targeting the black market with no intention of targeting white record buyers, primarily because radio remained largely segregated with little opportunity for exposure. However as the 1950s moved forward, artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Howlin\u2019 Wolf and Muddy Waters found their way outside the black market, particularly to England. \u201cTheir early releases of the Muddy and the Wolf and Sonny Boy records helped whites get into it although I don\u2019t think they were too aware this was happening,\u201d said Bob Koester, founder of Chicago-based <a href=\"http://delmark.com/\">Delmark Records</a>, the oldest jazz and blues independent record label in the US.</p> <p>Both men were not musicians nor had musical training, but they often admitted they had no method to their process but instead prided themselves with having an ear for artists they knew were unique. \u201cAnything different that would draw your attention,\u201d was their baseline for signing artists, Phil said. After getting his demos rejected elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/chuck-berry\">Chuck Berry</a> showed up at the Chess doorstep with just a notebook of lyrics and a tape. \u201cIt was different \u2026 It had a lot of country to it,\u201d he said. The label would test records by throwing open its doors on South Cottage Grove Avenue and watch the reaction of people waiting at the bus stop. \u201cThat was our gauge. It wasn\u2019t always right, but 99% of the times it was right,\u201d he said. </p> <p>As Chess grew it expanded beyond blues and served as an important label for jazz, recording saxophonists Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt and Rahsaan Roland Kirk, pianists Ramsey Lewis and Ahmad Jamal.</p> <p>The British Invasion helped usher in a new wave of interest on Chess artists during its second decade. The Rolling Stones, who named their band after a Waters song, made the pilgrimage to Chicago to record there, as did the Yardbirds. But the label never lost its connection with its black audience. In 1963 the brothers purchased a South Side radio station and changed its call letters to WVON (Voice of the Negro) and it became a towering outlet for black music during that decade. </p> <p>The brothers got out of the business in 1969; a few months after selling the company Leonard died of a heart attack. Phil Chess relocated to Arizona where he lived until his death. Sheva Jonesi, his wife of 70 years who he met in high school, died in April.</p> <p>The Universal Music Group now controls the Chess catalogue and the label\u2019s final headquarters at 2120 S Michigan Avenue is now operated by a foundation owned by the family of Willie Dixon, the label\u2019s house songwriter, arranger and bassist. </p> <p>Until his death Phil insisted that Chuck Berry invented rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, not Elvis Presley. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/18/chuck-berry-new-album-first-in-38-years\">Berry turned 90 on Tuesday</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe story of the blues is you tell your feelings,\u201d Phil said in 1995. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, you have to catch the blues when it comes from the heart. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re black, white, green or yellow.\u201d</p>",

Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cTheresa May and the government have made statements about wanting to be the party of the worker.

Shamim, Navid, Hossein, Misbah and Batol bravely spoke for them all; spoke of their fears for their safety, their lost years, and uncertain futures. Many other people on Nauru, not involved in the program, have sent me effusive messages of thanks for sharing \u201ctheir\u201d story. </p> <p>But the Australian government has responded ferociously to \u201ctheir\u201d story, attacking the ABC for what it claimed was biased reporting. The government is used to controlling the narrative, writing the story and dictating the Nauru script. </p> <p>Refugees speaking for themselves is not in that script because that would give the impression that they are real people, with real hopes, suffering real pain. The Nauruan government\u2019s response was similarly dehumanising. Refugees couldn\u2019t possible think for themselves, they were coached, it claimed.</p> <p>Both governments have been able to control the public discussion over the people held on Nauru by keeping them isolated from the media through the $8,000 non-refundable application fee for Nauru media visas. This decision means the Australian government and the two media outlets with approved Nauruan visas, the Australian newspaper and A Current Affair, are the only ones free to tell stories about those on Nauru.</p> <p>The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has portrayed detainees as illiterate and innumerate, but many of my students held degrees. He said on Tuesday that many refugees on Nauru would choose to remain there permanently to get an education for their children. Dutton has not spoken to any refugees on Nauru and I know hundreds of them, all of them desperate to leave. And as Four Corners noted, the majority of refugee and asylum seeker children on Nauru are not getting an education. </p> <p>Dutton has also accused us of doing the children a disservice by not encouraging them to accept \u201cthe package\u201d and go home. All the children featured on Four Corners are refugees which, by definition, means they cannot go home.</p> <p>The prime minister, Malcom Turnbull, stated that many of the children on Nauru are there because their parents are security risks, i.e. terrorists. Considering the majority of those children have been found to be refugees, along with their parents, that\u2019s another intentional red herring. Most of those on Nauru are there because they have fled extremist regimes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/doctors-freed-to-speak-about-australias-detention-regime-after-u-turn\">Doctors freed to speak about Australia's detention regime after U-turn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there is the economic migrant misnomer. The government itself releases the statistics on refugee status determinations so knows irrefutably that this is not the case. Quite the opposite actually, as many formerly affluent Iranian refugees were forced to flee due to political persecution because they are Christian, Arabic, gay, or opposed to Sharia law. Now they have nothing.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the claim that the RPCs are now \u201copen centres\u201d. Asylum seekers are not permitted to work, are not permitted access to money (even though they may have money stored in property, confiscated when they were detained), are not permitted smart phones, and are not permitted to take any food out of the camp. Yes they are free to come and go, but they are not free. </p> <p>Media allowed on the island have criticised the asylum seekers and refugees for protesting behind the fences when they are not confined by those fences. Protesting in public has been illegal in Nauru since a new law was passed in March 2015. Subsequently, more than 100 refugees were arrested. So yes, they can theoretically peacefully protest outside the wire, but they will be arrested.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, A Current Affair \u2013 one of two media organisations to have received a golden ticket to report on Nauru \u2013 were back busily exposing \u201cthe truth\u201d as they claimed that the Four Corners program was based on the Amnesty International report released this week. No, the program was based on the children on Nauru, supported by the accounts of people, including one member of Amnesty, who had spent much longer on Nauru than any favoured media organisation and certainly more than Dutton or Turnbull. The latter never having been to Nauru.</p> <p>So when I was approached by Four Corners to participate in a program aimed at giving a voice to the voiceless, I agreed. I agreed because I am sick of the lies that direct the prevailing narrative about those on Nauru. I agreed because I know if they are not resettled somewhere safe soon, more people will die from hopelessness. </p> <p>I also agreed because I thought that if the Australian people could just see these kids, hear their voices, they would care about them too, care enough to save their lives.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tracey Donehue is an ESL teacher who worked at the Nauru Regional Processing Centre from 2014 to 2015.</em></p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"mailto:donehuetracey@gmail.com\"><br></a></p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Murder behind bars \u2013 it\u2019s a story that was already written. In fact I could\u2019ve written most of this article months before Tuesday afternoon, when a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/one-arrested-after-man-killed-in-pentonville-prison\" title=\"\"> 21-year-old father lost his life</a>.

The location: G wing in HMP&#xa0;Pentonville, known as the Gaza Strip among inmates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/pentonville-prison-knife-attack-second-inmate-arrested\">Pentonville stabbing: death prompts call for inquiry into state of jails in England and Wales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be honest I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if this had happened while I was locked up in Pentonville in 2011. I saw some nasty stuff, including an east v south London gang fight between 30 people. Occasionally there was blood, or \u201cclaret\u201d, splattered on the wall. A guy had boiling water poured over him. But I\u2019m even less surprised that there is bloodshed now because prison standards have slipped since then. They will slip still further unless drastic efforts are made by politicians to challenge the two-dimensional fallacies spread by those who\u2019ve never experienced life behind the wall. We can\u2019t begin to address the problems in our prisons until we have a realistic sense of what they are like.</p> <p>There is violence, but it is important to understand that life behind bars is nothing like Hollywood\u2019s bloodbath portrayal. On my release, my mind was&#xa0;damaged, but my body was unscarred, principally because I was not involved in the areas that cause the majority of violent incidents \u2013 drugs, gangs and severe mental health issues. From the little we know, at least some of these may have played a part in this week\u2019s killing.</p> <p>The continuing tragedy is that our prisons need not be like this. Gangs are manageable when you retain experienced staff, but we\u2019ve seen valuable personnel demoralised and replaced by lower-paid equivalents in a short-sighted attempt to save money. The older officers I saw knew who was in which gang, and had a chance of keeping things in check.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Failure to tackle drugs leads to exacerbated gang problems. The drugs and gangs are interlinked and both cause violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But when you have a 21-year-old inexperienced prison officer from the provinces trying to cope with inner-city gang feuds, who can be surprised that things go wrong. The drug problem is also preventable with front-end investment. Think rigorous checks on staff and visitors, sniffer dogs, nets that stop drones and packages full of heroin being thrown over the fence. But in the absence of that, one failure begets others. Failure to tackle drugs leads to exacerbated gang problems. The drugs and gangs are interlinked and both cause violence.</p> <p>The prevalence of drugs also results in countless people being released with addiction problems that they didn\u2019t have when they entered the system. Each day, on leaving my cell, I saw people sprinkling heroin into roll-up cigarettes.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s mental health. If we lock up people with a clear need for psychiatric care for 23 hours a day, the result is surely predictable. I would hear people wailing and kicking their doors until 5am. One guy would spend each night screaming \u201cET take me home\u201d.</p> <p>So much could change if we were more clear sighted. With a relatively small amount of money well spent, the prison system could exponentially reduce all of the causes of violence.</p> <p>What\u2019s happening in our prisons is less the biblical battle of good and evil that is commonly portrayed, more a matrix of complexities both good and bad. Liberals argue that prisoners are victims of the system; reflexive rightwingers say criminals are completely capable of making decisions and should therefore suffer harsh consequences. Both are right and wrong.</p> <p>Both fall victim to the lure of easy answers, when the real solutions \u2013 with potential for rehabilitation and the prospect of alternative constructive punishments \u2013 require time and concentration.</p> <p>We need a clear-headed conversation that involves inmates and moves away from the old muddled narratives. We have seen this week what happens in prisons when they are starved of resources and run on the basis of politics and prejudice. No one is reformed, no one is protected, no one wins.</p>",
  "<p>We keep being told that the Donald Trump phenomenon means we have entered the era of post-fact politics. Yet, I would argue, post-fact politics has been tarnishing democracy for some time. Twenty-two years ago a successful businessman sent a VHS tape to Italy\u2019s news channels. It showed him sitting in a (fake) office. He read a pre-prepared statement via an autocue.</p> <p>The man\u2019s name was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\" title=\"\">Silvio Berlusconi</a>, and he was announcing that he was, in his words, \u201ctaking the field\u201d. The first reaction was derision. Opposition politicians saw his political project (the formation of a \u201cmovement\u201d called Forza Italia \u2013 Go for it, Italy \u2013 just months ahead of a crucial general election) as a joke. Some claimed a stocking had been put over the camera to soften the impact of Berlusconi\u2019s face.</p> <p>But Forza Italia soon became the biggest \u201cparty\u201d. In the working-class Communist citadel of Mirafiori Sud in Turin, an unknown psychiatrist standing for Berlusconi\u2019s movement beat a long-standing trade unionist. Berlusconi had not just won, he had also stolen the left\u2019s clothes and some of its supporters. That first government was short lived, but Berlusconi would dominate Italian politics for the next 20 years \u2013 winning elections in 2001 and 2008 and losing by a handful of seats in 2006. In terms of days in office, Berlusconi ranks as Italy\u2019s third longest-serving prime minister, behind Mussolini and the great liberal of 19th-century Italy, Giovanni Giolitti.</p> <p>The parallels between Berlusconi and Trump are striking. Both are successful businessman who struggle with \u201cmurky\u201d aspects linked to their companies \u2013 tax, accounting, offshore companies. Berlusconi was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/27/silvio-berlusconi-ousted-italian-parliament-tax-fraud-conviction\" title=\"\">convicted of tax fraud in 2013</a>, which effectively put an end to his political career. But business success and huge wealth was part of his political appeal, as they are for Trump. Beyond wealth, Berlusconi, like Trump, always painted himself as an outsider, as anti-establishment, even when he was prime minister. And, like Trump, Berlusconi\u2019s appeal was populist and linked to his individual \u201cpersonality\u201d.</p> <p>Berlusconi\u2019s personal-business political model has since been followed by others in Italy. It could be argued that both Beppe Grillo\u2019s populist anti-political <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\" title=\"\">Five Star Movement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi\" title=\"\">Matteo Renzi</a>\u2019s insider-outsider appeal (until recently) have been created very much in Berlusconi\u2019s image. One could go so far as to say Berlusconi transformed politics. The mass parties of the postwar period had become increasingly irrelevant, but he didn\u2019t need a party just as Trump doesn\u2019t really need the Republican party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6801e1d51ae072ef0c8f122a09b028c9feeac005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6801e1d51ae072ef0c8f122a09b028c9feeac005/0_226_3584_2150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Like Donald Trump, Berlusconi\u2019s appeal was populist and linked to his individual \u201cpersonality\u201d.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Like Donald Trump, Berlusconi\u2019s appeal was populist and linked to his individual \u201cpersonality\u201d.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So-called gaffes were a frequent part of Berlusconi\u2019s political strategy \u2013 a dog-whistle strategy that included frequent recourse to sexist, homophobic and racist stereotypes, and reference to his belief that he was irresistible to women. He flaunted his Don Giovanni image, but also attempted to keep a parallel reputation as a family man, whose main concern was the welfare of his five children.</p> <p>His electoral campaigns were all about him. Nothing else mattered. He dominated the agenda from start to finish. When the former mayor of Rome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/08/italy1\" title=\"\">Walter Veltroni</a> tried to run a campaign against Berlusconi by not mentioning Berlusconi, he was heavily defeated. Silvio\u2019s \u201cgaffes\u201d would usually be followed by claims that he had been \u201cmisunderstood\u201d or was the victim of a \u201chostile media\u201d. He was also reluctant to accept the verdict of the electorate as final when he lost. He would make frequent (and unsubstantiated) claims of electoral fraud and ballot-stuffing. Remind you of anyone?</p> <p>He also created a set of enemies against which he could mobilise his followers: the judiciary, the media (despite owning much of it), politics itself, Communism, women (he often commented on the appearance of female opponents) and the EU and the euro. He presented himself as a victim of political correctness gone mad, an ordinary/extraordinary man speaking his mind. He promised the world, and it mattered little if he was quickly proved wrong, or had no intention of fulfilling any of his promises. Berlusconi knew that many of the electorate had short memories indeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f241ab3bac29d0d08b01ddb76419c35de1fcd7e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f241ab3bac29d0d08b01ddb76419c35de1fcd7e3/0_0_2254_3000/751.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Berlusconi\u2019s scandals had little effect on his support\u2019: the former prime minister was convicted but on appeal found not guilty of paying prostitute Karima El Mahroug for sex when she was under 18.\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Berlusconi\u2019s scandals had little effect on his support\u2019: the former prime minister was convicted but on appeal found not guilty of paying prostitute Karima El Mahroug for sex when she was under 18.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giuseppe Aresu/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And as with Trump (at least until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/locker-room-talk-not-harmless-rape-culture-trump\" title=\"\">\u201clocker-room\u201d video</a>), Berlusconi\u2019s scandals had little effect on his support. The numerous trials and journalistic scoops regarding Berlusconi\u2019s private and business lives often seemed merely to reinforce his appeal. The message sent out was, for many, an attractive one. Be like me. Don\u2019t pay taxes. Enjoy life and make money. Say what you want. We won\u2019t bother you.</p> <p>He became so powerful at one stage that he even tried to make himself immune to prosecution, through a law passed by his own government. Luckily, Italy\u2019s constitution forbade such a monstrosity. But the fact that it was even contemplated was worrying. Mass opposition to Berlusconi rose and fell at various times, and many took to the streets to protest. Yet his appeal also had roots deep in Italian society \u2013 and in a hatred of politics and politicians that has since moved onto other forms of populism.</p> <p>The Berlusconi phenomenon shows that a post-truth politician can rise to power in one of the world\u2019s strongest and richest countries. The lesson for America is that for far too long Berlusconi was treated as a joke and a clown. By the end, nobody was laughing. Twenty years of Berlusconi at the centre of the system had a deeply damaging impact on Italy\u2019s body politic and democratic culture and the wounds are by no means healed. Win or lose, Trump has shifted the terms of political discourse, campaigning and organisation. As with the Berlusconi era, things will never be the same again.</p>",

  "<p>UK immigration laws permitting refugees to be deported if they exhibit \u201cextremist behaviour\u201d may breach a United Nations convention, the organisation\u2019s general assembly is to be told.</p> <p>In a speech condemning states for exploiting security fears to frustrate their international legal obligation to provide safe havens, the UN official responsible for reporting on counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson QC, will criticise the UK\u2019s record.</p> <p>Emmerson, who recently left his post as counsel to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, has been the<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx)\"> UN\u2019s special rapporteur on \u201cprotecting human rights while countering terrorism</a>\u201d since 2011.</p> <p>\u201cThe link between displacement of people from their homes and risks to national security in the countries in which they seek refuge has been irresponsibly and misleadingly overblown in many states, with the refugee crisis being used to stoke public fears of terrorism,\u201d he is due to tell the UN session on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cThere is almost no evidence that terrorist groups take advantage of refugee flows to carry out acts of terrorism, or that refugees are somehow more prone to radicalisation than others. These claims are analytically and statistically unfounded.\u201d</p> <p>Following the Islamic State-inspired attacks on Paris last autumn there were widespread reports that some of the gunmen had infiltrated refugee groups travelling through Greek islands. Those reports have since been thrown into doubt amid uncertainty over the black market trade in fake passports.</p> <p>Referring to legislative measures designed to single out suspected radicals from the refugee population, Emmerson says: \u201cThe United Kingdom, as just one example here, has enacted legislation allowing for the review and revocation of refugee status if a person is thought to have exhibited extremist behaviour, or if their dependents have acted in a manner inconsistent with British values. </p> <p>\u201cLegislation of this kind, with the vagaries that are necessarily entailed in such generalised definitions, runs a risk of falling short of the requirements of the 1951 refugee convention.\u201d</p> <p>His reference is to a Home Office report, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/493918/revocation_of_refugee_status_v4_0_EXT.pdf\">Asylum Policy Instruction: Revocation of Refugee Status</a>, published earlier this year. It states: \u201cExtremist behaviour: where there is any evidence that a refugee or their dependents have engaged in unacceptable behaviours (whether in the UK or abroad) considered not conducive to the public good or has acted in a way which undermines British values, their status must be reviewed [and referred to the special cases unit ].\u201d</p> <p>It also notes that: \u201cAlthough there is no requirement to formally respond to representations from [the UN high commissioner for refugees] caseworkers must take their comments into account as part of the decision on whether to proceed with revocation and provide UNHCR with a copy of the final decision.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in his speech, Emmerson says: \u201cAlmost without exception, refugees and migrants do not pose a risk \u2013 they are in fact at risk, fleeing regions where terrorist groups are most active. It is beyond question that terrorist activity, in the form of asymmetrical armed conflict, is a significant driver for internal displacement and the flight of refugees.</p> <p>\u201cMany states have introduced stricter border controls, built fences and walls to keep migrants and refugees out, engaged in push-back operations, criminalised irregular migration and abandoned pledges to accept refugees.</p> <p>\u201cAmong the measures that pose serious human rights concerns are ethnic or religious profiling, the disproportionate collection of often inaccurate biometric and other data, forced fingerprinting and, perhaps most seriously, the criminalisation of irregular migration.\u201d</p> <p>Emmerson also raises concerns about the EU/Turkey agreement, which \u201cprovides for the blanket return of all migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece\u201d. He said he was concerned about the \u201cabsence of individualised consideration and the risk of detention or ill treatment in Turkey\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Emmerson\u2019s <a href=\"www.un.org/ga/search/viewm_doc.asp?symbol=A/71/384\">report on the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the human rights of migrants and refugees</a>, which details his criticisms, is on the UN\u2019s website.</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Monday night\u2019s Four Corners program about the treatment of asylum seeker children on Nauru has seen the program and the ABC attacked by both the Australian and Nauruan governments. These broad swipes \u2013 attacking the ABC as an institution rather than addressing the merits of the journalism \u2013 is an approach that only works if you\u2019ve been undermining the national broadcaster through years of culture wars.</p> <p>The entire conservative attitude towards the ABC was summed up in a single exchange last month.</p> <p>The former prime minister John Howard was doing the media rounds in mid-September to promote the ABC-produced documentary he had made about his own favourite prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies.</p> <p>On 15 September Howard spoke to Tom Switzer on Radio National\u2019s Between the Lines. Switzer, a journalist and former Liberal National party adviser, frequently explores international politics with guests from traditionally conservative outlets such as the Daily Telegraph, Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. It\u2019s an often-interesting program, a million miles away from the cartoonish Sean Hannity clips that have come to represent rightwing commentary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/abc-and-nauru-government-clash-over-four-corners-expose-of-offshore-detention\">ABC and Nauru government clash over Four Corners expos\u00e9 of offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The interview with Howard was light and conversational, which seemed appropriate for the interview topic. (A former prime minister discussing a TV series he made about another former prime minister is not really the place to re-prosecute the Iraq invasion. Your mileage may vary.)</p> <p>Then the moment came.</p> <p>SWITZER: Menzies once said of the ABC, \u201cI have never been persona grata with the ABC, nor the ABC with me.\u201d So let\u2019s hope your experience today means you\u2019ve had a different view about the ABC.</p> <p>HOWARD: Hahaha, next question.</p> <p>A seemingly innocuous exchange, and hardly a surprise to hear someone on the right chuckle at the idea of receiving a fair go on the ABC. But the fact that we are so used to this type of offhand commentary highlights the absurdity of this particular situation.</p> <p>Let\u2019s set the scene: this was at least the third promotional interview Howard had done on the ABC that week, which included time on ABC TV\u2019s Lateline and Radio National\u2019s Drive, not including the live broadcast of Howard\u2019s National Press Club address on the legacy of Robert Menzies, all of it designed to promote Howard\u2019s three-part documentary that the ABC had itself funded. The airwaves were so dominated by commercials for the series, I could probably recreate them verbatim should the need ever arise.</p> <p>So as Howard and Switzer sat in the ABC studios promoting a Menzies puff piece that had been made on the ABC dime, they chuckled at the unspoken but clearly understood premise that the ABC is a hive of leftwing Trotskyites, working overtime to keep the conservative message down. Caricaturists need not apply.</p> <p>This view is one that is profoundly unshakable, no matter what the evidence actually shows. In a 2009 research paper, How Partisan Is the Press?, the economists Joshua Gans and Andrew Leigh (now a federal Labor MP) discovered that the ABC\u2019s coverage slanted more significantly towards the Coalition. This study was released seven years ago but it is a revelation that has never managed to take hold in the public mind, failing to challenge accepted wisdom. The message certainly didn\u2019t make its way to Howard.</p> <p>Meanwhile the ABC itself exists in a state of everlasting course correction. Determined to avoid the appearance of bias, it uses its flagship program Q&amp;A as a cosmetic ballast. </p> <p>The newly elected One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts was provided with airtime so he could peddle conspiracy theories about global warming. When an actual scientist, Brian Cox, asked if Roberts believed the moon landing was real, Roberts took offence, viewing Cox\u2019s question as an underhanded rhetorical swipe. But Cox meant the question: if global warming is a gigantic global conspiracy then how much of reality do you question? If that\u2019s how far we need to go to establish a baseline of sanity then something is seriously wrong.</p> <p>In 2014, when he was communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull announced a $254m funding cut to the ABC over five years. This year $20m was cut from reporting and digital services. Journalists have been made redundant and the Fact Check unit was shut down. The ABC is being chipped away, bit by bit, and every joke about its inherent, ingrained bias makes it easier to justify.</p> <p>Much of the disdain for the ABC stems from a deeper ideology, one that is rooted in the free market and sees the concept of a public broadcaster as barely indistinguishable from state propaganda, even if the state itself keeps objecting to it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9e6ee6f94505f8828b20c7a771c165bc9cc04ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6ee6f94505f8828b20c7a771c165bc9cc04ccd/0_0_1456_2231/653.png\" alt=\"Book cover - Double Dissolution: Heartbreak and Chaos on the Campaign Trail by Lee Zachariah\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Zachariah\u2019s book Double Dissolution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Echo Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an environment saturated by privately owned news outlets, justifying a taxpayer-funded news organisation seems like an impossible needle to thread. And yet one glance across the environment of broadcast journalism and the value of a broadcaster focused on the public interest becomes immediately apparent.</p> <p>Attacking the journalism conducted by Four Corners is hardly new territory. The program regularly produces stories that affect the national conversation and even policy: a shocking report on live baiting in greyhound racing led to major reforms to the industry; a story on child abuse in youth detention had the prime minister immediately calling for a royal commission; footage of live cattle exports led to an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on the practice. </p> <p>At a time when the ABC is fighting for its survival it has refused to shy away from difficult and provocative journalism that often upsets the very hands that control its purse strings.</p> <p>The problem is that no accord can be reached. There is no incentive for the ABC\u2019s critics to concede any ground on its ideological makeup: there will never be a time where they confess that, yes, the ABC\u2019s reporting typically bends in every direction to find the impossible moment of balance. They will never admit that its analysis can be seen as right-leaning just as often as it is seen as left-leaning. There is absolutely nothing to be won in such a confession.</p> <p>So long as this belief continues, the ABC will inevitably and self-consciously shift itself to the right. It\u2019s a win-win for conservatives. Like a boa constrictor tightening around its prey, it\u2019s a game of inches that will only ever move in one direction.</p> <p><em>Lee Zachariah is the author of a new book, <a href=\"http://www.echopublishing.com.au/titles/double-dissolution/\">Double Dissolution: Heartbreak and Chaos on the Campaign Trail, which is available now.</a> </em></p>",

I think the coaches are knowledgeable and astute at correcting a player and are willing to use tactics that are more modern.\u201d</p> <p>In comparison, a team like Perth Glory in 2005-06 prepared by McMahon around marquee Brian Deane looks antediluvian in comparison with Merrick\u2019s Wellington of 2016-17. And that\u2019s not even touching the low-hanging fruit that was the New Zealand Knights.</p> <p>His Melbourne Victory side of 2005-06 followed the blueprint that would later form the hallmark of Merrick\u2019s success, and whilst competitive, ultimately there was one vital piece missing.</p> <p>\u201cI like to have a key decision maker up front supported by two very quick strikers \u2013 I like to give them a lot of freedom, and not turn them into defenders.\u201d</p> <p>In Archie Thompson and Danny Allsopp, Melbourne Victory had perhaps the league\u2019s most potent strike duo, but in players like Richard Kitzbichler, Michael Ferrante or Carl Recchia, Merrick never quite managed to find his key decision maker.</p> <p>\u201cAt the Victory after the first year Geoff Lord says to me, \u2018what do you need?\u2019 I said \u2018an injection of funds\u2019.\u201d Enter Fred, one of the first great imports of the A-League. With captain Kevin Muscat shifting from full-back to the base of the midfield, Fred was free to pull the strings \u2013 the attacking playmaker behind Thompson and Allsopp.</p> <p>It was the A-League\u2019s first really dominant team \u2013 second only perhaps to Ange Postecoglou\u2019s almost all-conquerers (the \u201cNear-Invincibles\u201d) of 2010-11 \u2013 and a season that ended with Melbourne winning the first ever premiers-champions double with that most emphatic of grand final thumpings against arch rivals Adelaide.</p> <p>As we discuss the growing influence of different tactical styles upon the league \u2013 Dutch, Spanish, even German \u2013 and the emergence of Asia as a major player within world football (at least, economically), Merrick offers an unprompted comparison.</p> <p>\u201cI was with the Victory team in season two when we won the grand final 6-0 \u2013 today I think that team would struggle, would be a middle-placed team. They were a great bunch of lads, it was a tremendous achievement what we did but I think the standard has just gone up and up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ad1afa44444ba66904aba0953c6fe8626670fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ad1afa44444ba66904aba0953c6fe8626670fa0/0_243_3148_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Merrick Muscat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Merrick celebrates Victory\u2019s grand final win over Adelaide in 2009 with Kevin Muscat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the non-Australian club, for the Phoenix it\u2019s often a case of \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d. Their successes are marked as aberrations, their struggles almost expected. It\u2019s a context of low-expectation that irks the veteran coach.<br></p> <p>When Merrick secured Wellington\u2019s equal best finish, fourth in 2014-15 in his second season at the club, the media plaudits focused on the standout season of Nathan Burns, rather than the team structure surrounding him, or in fact that under Merrick Burns was a player reborn.</p> <p>More than a fluke, this run to the finals was informed by the same basic philosophy that guided Merrick\u2019s all-conquering Victory side; trade Allsopp and Thompson for Burns and Roy Krishna, Fred for Roly Bonevacia or Michael McGlinchey, and Muscat for Albert Riera. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/17/a-league-tactics-wellington-phoenix-danger-zones\">The cattle were different, but the attacking philosophy remained the same.</a></p> <p>And yet, for all Merrick\u2019s experience, there\u2019s no refuting that last season was a horror-show for the Phoenix, an almost perfect-storm of calamity that flustered the usually unflappable Scot.</p> <p>\u201cLast season, everything seemed to go wrong from the start, really,\u201d Merrick says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have training facilities for a lot of the pre-season, so we were training on a cricket pitch. We had the licence [speculation] over our heads. I signed Jeffrey Sarpong, who\u2019d lost the motivation to play the game \u2013 that was a big mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Merrick, pauses, and shakes his head: \u201cI\u2019m giving you excuses, I never give excuses. It was just one of those years. If there was an injury to be had, we had it, suspension to be had, we had them. For me one of the biggest killers though was our schedule \u2013 from round four to round 17 we had three games at Westpac \u2026 we hardly trained, we were just getting on planes all the time.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a reality that will always trouble the Phoenix \u2013 not too many clubs travel 5,250km (and back) for a domestic league game as Wellington did last weekend. But with their heightened focus on conditioning and sport science, off the field you get the inkling Merrick\u2019s staff is learning its lessons.</p> <p>Having seen the club\u2019s ups and downs over a decade, foundation player Vince Lia is well placed to judge the impact of the Phoenix\u2019s new coach; his old coach at Melbourne Victory. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty fickle business if you look at coaching careers and who\u2019s stayed and who\u2019s gone \u2013 it\u2019s not a great industry to be involved in but Ernie\u2019s stood the test of time,\u201d Lia says.</p> <p>It\u2019s a relationship of respect that cuts two ways, and is instructive of Merrick\u2019s man management, and the culture he tries to instil at his clubs. \u201cHe is one of those coaches that signs men,\u201d Lia explains. \u201cHe likes to sign characters, and see how they can fit into the team.\u201d</p> <p>At the Victory in season two, a wealth of midfield options saw Merrick make the call to release Lia. With just a handful of games to his name and his professional future on the line the defensive midfielder could have drifted from the A-League like so many fringe players before him.</p> <p>Instead, Merrick placed a call to friend and then Wellington coach, Ricky Herbert. He\u2019s a good lad, a good character, he\u2019ll do a job for you, was the message.</p> <p>177 A-League games later Lia never forgets the loyalty shown to him, by a coach in whose plans he no longer featured. Reunited, in turn this season Merrick has every confidence the player who\u2019s career he helped rescue will play a key role in his side.</p> <p>The successful knitting of youth with experience is a hallmark of Merrick sides \u2013 no coach has blooded more youth internationals or given chances to National Premier League players than the Scot. But if last season\u2019s injuries led to an over-reliance on green youngsters, veteran Lia is confident of the squad\u2019s depth for this campaign.</p> <p>\u201cLooking back at last year\u2019s squad you always thought if we had a few injuries, we\u2019d struggle, and it\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lost Siggy [Ben Sigmund], we lost Roy [Krishna], we lost Dura [Andrew Durante] for parts of the season and we couldn\u2019t cope.</p> <p>\u201cLast season when we lost Roy, they started to double up on Roly and he struggled to have an impact \u2013 but this season, how do you double up on five players?\u201d</p> <p>The recruitment of key duo Kosta Barbarouses and Gui Finkler may have made the Australian football media take notice, but more ominously than big name signings, Merrick\u2019s trusted attacking system appears to once again have all the component parts it needs to fire.</p> <p>\u201c[Last season] was horrendous in many respects,\u201d says Merrick. \u201cBut it will make our team stronger. If we learn the lesson than we are pushing for the top four, end of story. It will be a disaster if we don\u2019t make the finals this year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfa90a66048023db727c6b55cc6f3b22e885c4d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfa90a66048023db727c6b55cc6f3b22e885c4d8/0_83_3512_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wellington\u2019s Andrew Durante\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wellington\u2019s season has not got off a smooth start with two defeats, including one in Perth last weekend, from two games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Mcdonough/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only once during our interview does Merrick interrupt. Shifting uncomfortably in his chair, in his thick Scottish drawl he interjects: \u201cAch, don\u2019t talk about me, let\u2019s talk about football.\u201d</p> <p>We don\u2019t delve into his past. His background growing up in a large carnival family, this spirit of wandering that took him from Scottish town to town and in his early 20s to the outskirts of Melbourne. But as the interview continues fleeting moments in this journey are revealed.</p> <p>\u201cI arrived in Australia in 1975 and after one week I knew I wasn\u2019t going back to Europe, to Scotland \u2013 and that weather. I remember my mate picking me up and driving me from the airport, and I thought \u2018what are these big posts, do they play rugby here?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThey were different posts and I had no idea what Australian rules football was. I said \u2018there\u2019s two big ones and two wee ones\u2019 and my mate says \u2018the wee ones are for encouragement.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>As a trained PE teacher Merrick had a love for many sports \u2013 a fact that later became a strength in his coaching of football.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up, I liked all sports, I really enjoy playing basketball, volleyball \u2013 every sport. But everybody played football in Scotland, we played it in the streets, we played it in the schoolyard every minute we got, I just loved it.\u201d</p> <p>Watching \u201cwee\u201d Willie Henderson, and later Billy Bremner or Joe Jordan, the passion for the game so intrinsic to Scottish culture infected the younger Merrick, and the other sports fell by the wayside.</p> <p>\u201cFootball was <em>the</em> game, and we used to qualify for the World Cup \u2013 it was just great to see us beat England every year, until we got banned for hooliganism. Scotland was pretty good at that too.\u201d</p> <p>After an undistinguished playing career \u2013 \u201cI was pretty rubbish\u201d Merrick reports \u2013 the Scot began his badges during the 1970s while playing in Melbourne\u2019s suburban south east.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to get on the field as the assistant coach at Doveton soccer club, and show all my fellow coaches how much I knew. I was just showing off, just trying to tell \u2018em everything I knew, and the best thing about Doveton soccer club is there was no plastic people, so they just put me in my place.\u201d</p> <p>Chastened, Merrick got his break in the National Soccer League, first with Preston Makedonia and then with Sunshine George Cross. And \u201chaving made every mistake you can make in coaching\u201d by the early 90s Merrick figured his time in the game was up.</p> <p>\u201cAfter I was sacked from my second NSL club I imagined I\u2019d never be involved in football again. I thought \u2018I\u2019ve had enough, I\u2019ll go and do something else\u2019 \u2013 until the Victorian Institute of Sport came along; and that changed my view of everything.\u201d</p> <p>Juggling full-time employment as a PE teacher with a part-time role at the VIS, for the first time Merrick saw a pathway towards being a professional football coach.</p> <p>With his interests in other sports \u2013 at one stage Merrick even undertook an AFL coaching course to learn how the game could inform the code he loved \u2013 the Scotsman was able to rub shoulders with some of the world\u2019s best coaches, from rugby, from AFL, from netball \u2013 anything that might expand his horizons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b2acee9310190a29facd6a29bcec07d3a3d2f9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b2acee9310190a29facd6a29bcec07d3a3d2f9d/0_0_3000_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Merrick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Merrick talks to his players during a Melbourne Victory training session in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over 13 years Merrick continued to re-imagine himself as a student of the game; willing to sit at the feet of anyone who could teach him new insights, new philosophies.</p> <p>When Merrick signed Grant Brebner for Victory in 2006 it was as much for his talents as a player, as the insights and winning mentality he\u2019d developed over five years as an apprentice at Manchester United under Alex Ferguson.</p> <p>\u201cI spoke to Grant Brebner about Alex Ferguson \u2026 and he said everybody knows him as a hard man and all the rest of it but he\u2019s a person who was very very good with the players. We as coaches, we don\u2019t really coach skills \u2013 we coach people.\u201d</p> <p>During the A-League\u2019s lengthy off-seasons Merrick continues to undergo football sabbaticals. With former Wellington goalkeeping coach Jonathan Gould now with West Bromwich Albion the \u2018Nix boss recently enjoyed a fruitful stint learning about the Premier League club\u2019s backroom operations.</p> <p>As we digress onto his recent dissertation into J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d back-four tactical formation (\u201cvery attacking, yet very solid at the back\u201d) it\u2019s clear the veteran Merrick has lost no hunger for new knowledge, new insights.</p> <p>Despite his longevity in the game, there\u2019s no hint of tiredness in Merrick. In fact, after last season\u2019s disappointment you get the lingering feeling the 63-year-old still has a point to prove.</p> <p>\u201cThe scary thought is, I haven\u2019t peaked yet,\u201d Merrick laughs softly. \u201cAfter 30 years, I still feel I\u2019m getting better.\u201d</p>",

Quite right, too. This time six years ago Southampton were picking themselves up from a 2-0 League One defeat to Huddersfield Town while Inter were still high on winning Serie A and the Champions League. Now the clubs meet as equals. In fact, Southampton could even claim to be superior, as they are top of Europa League Group K with four points from two matches while Inter are bottom with nothing to their name but, well, a name. But what a name.</p> <p>Internazionale, one of the most prestigious clubs on the planet, 18 times champions of Italy, three times champions of Europe and hallowed canvass of men who have enriched sporting history, from managers such as Helenio Herrera, Giovanni Trappatoni and - drum roll please - Roy Hodgson to players such as Giacinto Fachetti, Lothar Matthaus and Luis Suarez (the Spanish genius rather than the Uruguayan one). Southampton\u2019s trophy cabinet, by contrast, contains one FA Cup, one Johnston\u2019s Paint Trophy and a well thumbed programme from the 1992 Zenith Data Systems jamboree. OK, so they\u2019ve duelled with a couple of European heavyweights before \u2013 notably when they lost narrowly to a Hamburg side that was in the fading stages of Ernst Happel\u2019s reign \u2013 but this match, against this club in this venue, feels bigger than anything the club has ever experienced on the international stage. Word is that around 7,000 Saints fans have headed to San Siro where at this very moment they are quivering with the giddy glee of stoners at Woodstock. This will go down in history.</p> <p>And who\u2019s to say it won\u2019t go down as a famous Saints win? Inter are struggling under Frank de Boer while Southampton have found a nice groove under Claude Puel, who can point to an encouraging precedent: ten years ago <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF3DAt4yPHg\">his Lille team beat AC Milan 2-0 to become the first French side to win at the San Siro</a>. Puel\u2019s got Southampton playing attractively and effectively, with muscle, sharpness and unpredictable passing patterns. He has chopped and changed his team successfully but must surely start his strongest available lineup here, which, alas, will not include his first-choice full-backs because of injuries. We\u2019ll bring you news of the team selections as soon as we get it. If Inter start with Mauro Icardi, that\u2019ll add extra spice to the atmosphere, though let\u2019s hope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/mauro-icardi-v-inters-ultras-an-unhappy-chapter-in-his-ongoing-san-siro-saga\">all stupidity is kept in check</a>.

Several firms are already facing action from workers taking their cases to employment tribunals.</p> <p>According to one employment expert, the timing of the HMRC intervention against Hermes is important because it follows the government announcement this month of a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">review of workers\u2019 rights and practices</a> by Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair. An employment tribunal is also considering whether <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/uber-drivers-court-tribunal-self-employed-uk-employment-law\">drivers for taxi-hailing tech firm Uber</a> should be recognised as company staff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/delivery-giant-hermes-faces-hmrc-inquiry-into-low-pay-allegations\">Delivery giant Hermes faces HMRC inquiry into low pay allegations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Matt Gingell, an employment specialist at the Gannons, said: \u201cThis comes at a time when the government has asked Matthew Taylor to do a review of the law and we are waiting for the Uber judgment, so companies must be a bit concerned about the grey area of status, and whether people they say are self-employed really are.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Uber</strong></h2> <p>The firm uses about 30,000 drivers in London, all of whom are designated as self-employed. In July, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/uber-drivers-court-tribunal-self-employed-uk-employment-law\">two drivers took a case to an employment tribunal</a> arguing that they should be classed as workers, meaning they were entitled to holiday pay and the national living wage. They said that their work was controlled by the firm as they are only told the destination of a job when they pick someone up, and they were not allowed to send another driver in their place \u2013 two features of employment. If the ruling goes in their favour, 17 other drivers will also be deemed to be workers and entitled to compensation, and HMRC may decide to take a closer look at the firm. The tribunal\u2019s ruling is due imminently.<br></p> <p>Uber said the case only involves a very small number of its 30,000 drivers and that it is a technology company rather than a transport provider, working with \u201cdriver partners\u201d and offering them flexibility to control how much and often they work.</p> <h2><strong>CitySprint, Excel, Addison Lee and eCourier</strong></h2> <p>The four firms are facing tribunal cases brought by cycle couriers working in London who argue they are not really self-employed. Currently, they are classed as \u201cindependent contractors\u201d, but say they should be recognised as workers because: they tend to work for one company at a time only; are subject to the control of their managers; and have no say over their rates of pay. One courier, Andrew Boxer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/30/job-pay-workers-gig-economy\">said that he carried a company ID for Excel at all times</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t have any independence as such,\u201d he said. The first case, against City Sprint, will start on 22 November and the other three will follow in the new year. </p> <p>The courier companies say the tribunal claims are unfounded. Excel has previously said its London couriers \u201coperate as independent subcontractors\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Deliveroo</strong></h2> <p>The takeaway food delivery service has more than 3,000 riders around the UK on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/25/deliveroo-workers-contracts-ban-access-to-employment-tribunals\">contracts that say they are self-employed and cannot contest their status</a>. Employment lawyers have dismissed this clause as unenforceable. A strike in the summer over changes to the way riders were paid to deliver food prompted the government to state that workers\u2019 status was determined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/14/deliveroo-told-it-must-pay-workers-minimum-wage\">\u201cby the reality of the working relationship and not the type of contract they have signed\u201d</a>. It also led drivers to join forces to call for better rights. Next week, the Independent Workers of Great Britain union is holding a meeting for Deliveroo riders to discuss how to win better rights and be paid the London living wage of \u00a39.40 per hour if they are based in the capital.</p> <p>Deliveroo has defended its employment terms, saying: \u201cWe provide a platform for people to work with us on a freelance basis. This allows riders to work flexibly around another commitment, like studying or other work. We\u2019ve worked with legal experts to design our contracts to reflect that.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Gig economy</strong></h2> <p>Michael Newman, an employment lawyer at Leigh Day, said there were other \u201cgig economy\u201d businesses that depend heavily on self-employed workers. \u201cThere are other smaller businesses in different sectors, such as cleaning, that tend to go under the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are working for these are likely to face the same issues of no holiday or sick pay, or not earning the living wage.\u201d</p> <p>Newman said that these companies were unlikely to be too concerned about the latest development at HMRC. \u201cUntil they see some kind of enforcement in place it will be business as usual,\u201d he said. </p>",
  "<p>At the edge of the Nineveh plains, where hundreds of thousands of Iraqis from ethnic and religious minorities were forced to flee more than two years ago, the Kurdish peshmerga were massing. Ahead was an area they had long controlled \u2013 until they were forced out by Islamic State\u2019s lightning assault in August 2014. <br></p> <p>That rout marked the end of several millennia of coexistence in northern Iraq, and the ignominy has burned ever since.

Now the berm was being used to attack them.</p> <p>The only sign that Isis was on the alert was the now-ubiquitous oil fires, which insurgents light every time the group comes under attack. Their purpose is to make it difficult for warplanes to spot them below \u2013 but that was not working on Thursday. As the black smoke unfurled a canopy over the battlefield, jets roared above and bombs thudded on the grey buildings ahead.</p> <p>The Kurds moved forward to a point just outside the village \u2013 and then came the Isis counter-attack. First, a hail of heavy machine-gun fire, then the giant flame of a powerful car bomb, and then, a full four seconds later, the blast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4beb77d27dce9c7e2761370691c571ee58684317\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4beb77d27dce9c7e2761370691c571ee58684317/0_302_4474_2685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bulldozer clears a roadblock during the peshmerga\u2019s advance near Bashiqa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bulldozer clears a roadblock during the peshmerga\u2019s advance near Bashiqa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cengiz Yar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soon, the peshmerga were withdrawing. Cars bearing the dead and dying bounced across the fields, their horns honking frantically. As the wounded were evacuated to ambulances on a nearby main road, a British man in military uniform stood behind a machine gun on a pickup truck, which moved towards the fire.</p> <p>He would not say where he was from, and insisted that his face should not be photographed. But alongside him were an array of weapons typically carried by Special Forces. The British and Australian SAS are active in northern Iraq, along with US forces, where they have been calling in airstrikes to support both Kurdish and Iraqi advances. Their role at the frontline has not been well documented, however. Peshmerga officers said the New Zealand SAS are also present. The NZ defence minister said it was incorrect to say NZ SAS were calling in airstrikes or involved in other combat operations in Iraq, NZ media reported. </p> <p>As the Kurdish evacuated their wounded, an elder standing on the earth berm implored others to advance. \u201cYou are noble, you have honour \u2013 and you are fighting for a cause,\u201d he shouted, as rifle fire crackled in the near distance. The peshmerga huddled tighter into the berm as the old man shouted: \u201cThis is a merciless enemy and you have a long history as fighters, as men.

Iraqi officers said they had surrounded the largest Christian city in Iraq, Hamdaniya, about 30 miles from Mosul.</p> <p>Hamdaniya is seen as a prize by both Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Its fate is central to whether minorities can safely return to Nineveh and whether a region that was a haven of coexistence can reclaim that status. Iraqi officers said they had seized the town of Bartella on Thursday night, as the battle ground slowly into the fourth day of a campaign that could last for up to two months.</p> <p>The principal element of that campaign is Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city. The International Rescue Committee said it had spoken to residents inside the besieged city, who had been stockpiling white cloths to wave in surrender when anti-Isis forces eventually enter the city. The IRC also said the old and infirm were struggling to breathe properly in Mosul because of the toxic smoke of oil fires.</p> <p>Peshmerga leaders have said they will not enter Mosul, leaving that role to the Iraqi army, which is anxious to use the campaign as a nation-building moment, two years after it too fled the area.</p> <p>\u201cThey can have Mosul,\u201d said one peshmerga officer, three miles behind the front. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it.

  "<p>Violence inside prisons in England and Wales is at its most serious level ever and is getting worse, the new chair of the parole board has warned.</p> <p>Prof Nick Hardwick said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/pentonville-prison-knife-attack-second-inmate-arrested\">the stabbing inside Pentonville prison on Monday</a> was \u201cthe most extreme example of the decline in safety\u201d that he and others have warned about for years.</p> <p>In his Howard League Parmoor lecture, he says that without \u201ca very substantial increase in staffing levels\u201d ambitious government plans to improve rehabilitation and education or tackle extremism \u201care simply not achievable\u201d.</p> <p>He welcomed a \u00a314m scheme to recruit 400 extra staff at the 10 worst prisons, which was announced two weeks ago by the justice secretary Liz Truss. But he added: \u201cIt does not compensate for the thousands of extra staff who have been taken out of prisons over the last few years and I am afraid a lot more than 10 prisons are in trouble.</p> <p>\u201cThe meaning of the increase in suicides, assaults and murders we are seeing now is not just the awful consequences for the prisoners, staff and families involved but the evidence they provide of a loss of control of our prisons.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/19/time-has-come-to-end-brutality-and-squalor-of-pentonville\">Time has come to close 'grimmest of the grim' Pentonville prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hardwick, who is the former chief inspector of prisons, said Truss and her justice ministers fully understand the gravity of the situation and the need for a very substantial increase in staffing.</p> <p>\u201cThe 400 extra staff must be just the first immediate step,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is now of such a scale, and the resources required to address it so significant, that it will take a government-wide commitment to address it in the next spending round.

He gave the example of an elderly and frail sex offender at one recent parole hearing who could be released to a care home provided he had no contact with children but the difficulty lay in finding a care home prepared to take him.</p> <p>\u201cIf the parole board can resolve some of these issues and continue to make the progress it has been making, and if nothing else changes, we estimate we can get the number of IPP prisoners down to about 2,000 by 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers could go further, and more quickly, by considering the options of compassionate release for a small number of IPP prisoners by making it easier to release short-term IPPs with tariffs of less than two years and reduce recalls after their release by limiting licence periods.</p> <p>Justice ministers confirmed in the House of Lords on Thursday that a prison safety and reform white paper will be published shortly to be followed by legislation in the new year.

  "<p>Donald Trump raised new questions about whether he would accept the election result on Thursday, less than 12 hours after he used the final presidential debate to declare that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">keep the country \u201cin suspense\u201d</a> over whether he would accept the outcome.</p> <p>At a rally in Delaware, Ohio, the Republican candidate said first: \u201cI will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election,\u201d before pausing for effect and then adding to cheers and applause: \u201cIf I win.\u201d </p> <p>Later he told the crowd: \u201cOf course I would accept a clear election result, but I would reserve my right to contend or file a legal challenge, in the case of a questionable result.\u201d He did not define what he meant by a clear result. </p> <p>Trump later went on to warn that his opponent Hillary Clinton would \u201cdo anything, including voter fraud\u201d to win.

Surrounding this folly, first made in 1963, hang stretched hammocks of thin, coloured fabric, appended with reels of cotton. The audience can use these to stitch drawings and designs on to the lengths of material.<br></p> <p>More lengths of fabric \u2013 with stories printed, sewn and painted on to them \u2013 line the walls. Here is Emily Bront\u00eb, there is an invented myth of a virgin-eating crocodile. Delicate, touching and wan, Medalla\u2019s art is as hard to grasp as the soapsuds climbing and falling next door, where a long poem called The Bubble Machine is also pinned to the wall. The poem itself is a delightful, painful spume of reminiscence.</p> <p>What has reading a poem, or soapsuds, or an invitation to sew, or a series of images and stories, got to do with sculpture? In the poem, James Dean licks popcorn from a young Medalla\u2019s face. Further on, the young artist visits a brewery in Edinburgh, watching the froth bubbling in copper vats. And he remembers (or is it all an invention \u2013 Medalla was three when the second world war ended) a young man who was in the same Filipino resistance cell as the artist\u2019s father, fighting the Japanese, lying shot and dying, \u201ctiny bubbles coming out of his mouth/ tiny rainbows / mixed with blood\u201d. The poem makes you look at Medalla\u2019s work differently. His art is a casual affair, but it is impossible for me not to be touched by it, even though it often looks like nothing much. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"369e863320ea90cf63e6295a4383d29ec8493f7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/369e863320ea90cf63e6295a4383d29ec8493f7a/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scree Stage by Phyllida Barlow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scree Stage by Phyllida Barlow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond, a large gallery is almost entirely filled by <a href=\"http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/50/phyllida-barlow/images-clips/\">Phyllida Barlow</a>\u2019s untitled: <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/exhibitions/pbarlow-scree\">Scree Stage, a work first shown in Des Moines, Iowa, in 2013</a>. It is like entering a cave, a crypt, or a petrified forest. Rough concrete pillars, festooned with dangling lumps and excrescences, support a kind of slanting stage of roughly painted boards, that look like a version of the shattered ice-floes in Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s 1824 German Romantic painting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/feb/26/art\">The Sea of Ice</a>. The pillars pierce the avalanching boards, rising up like standing stones and set about with boulders and rough wedges. I thought of the neolithic formations of Carnac in Brittany and the stones of Avebury. It was hard not to laugh out loud at Barlow\u2019s mad ambition. </p> <p>Of course it is all a thing of chickenwire, scrim and concrete; hardboard, paint and tar. If it collapsed, it would kill you in a great whumphing thud. Like a cartoonish stage set, Barlow\u2019s work is a magnificent, slapstick catastrophe. High above our heads, in a far corner of the gallery, hangs a tangle of black tubing, a sort of hysterical thought bubble. While diagonally opposite, in another corner, painted boards (like estate agent signs) climb the walls. Next year, Barlow is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/04/phyllida-barlowrepresent-britain-2017-venice-biennale-sculptor-british-pavilion\">official artist in the British Pavilion</a> at the Venice Biennale.

Her installation is my favourite to win that prize. Her <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/helen-marten-drunk-brown-house\">Drunk Brown House</a> also currently fills the Sackler Gallery at the Serpentine. It is difficult not to see those two exhibits, as well as her work here, as one continuous, interchangeable body of work. There are so many smaller and larger elements \u2013 things made, found, adapted, conjoined, fabricated, aligned, superimposed, ordered and arranged \u2013 that piercing the logic becomes an overwhelming task. \u201cI love the process of dragging legibility into crisis,\u201d Marten has said, \u201cand getting to the kernel of something where you know it but cannot name it.\u201d She defamiliarises the things around us \u2013 surely one of the jobs of all art \u2013 and the associations proliferate.</p> <p>In her Turner prize work, there is a small body, as if lain on a bier. Here, a similarly sorry-looking, doll-like figure is lain across something that looks like a bath for a child. The body is pierced, as if by an arrow. It is a stalk of corn. Another more diagrammatic body lies across a work mounted on the wall. The room she has at the Hepworth is divided by a sort of screen that is also a drawing made from bent, bolted-together strips of grey-painted steel. It describes a sort of flailing shirt. One sleeve looks like an erect penis. </p> <p>Marten\u2019s art is excessive, with too many details to count or describe, too many crafted bits of leather, wood and hand-embroidered fabric, inlaid Formica and woven straw, wicker, feathers, beads, shells and gum-wrappers; the real and the fabricated; drooping fag-ends and drawings of cats. In the Serpentine catalogue, Marten provides a partial lexicon of her art \u2013 from Archeology to Dust, Curves to Falling Stones. None of it helps. Instead, it compounds what is already a vertiginous complexity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7f8844b74f679a7124c55581f92b8969b9f6b99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7f8844b74f679a7124c55581f92b8969b9f6b99/848_410_3140_1884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stochastic Conveyor (Transference), Like Shooting Sparrows in the Dark 3 (deterrent lure) and Pernicious Membrane by Steven Claydon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fake wood and arcane ideas\u2019 \u2026 sculptures by Steven Claydon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The logic of <a href=\"http://www.sadiecoles.com/artists/claydon#sc-exhibition-2016-the-gilded-bough-img\">Steven Claydon</a>\u2019s work is equally arcane. You enter through doorways hung with thick yellow plastic, like entrances to an abattoir or some kind of protected environment. The yellow attracts insects, while the citronella-impregnated plastic is meant to kill them. It is a trap. Six blue industrial lights glow on one wall, the kind that might be installed in some inner-city fast-food restaurant toilets to prevents junkies from finding a vein. The light reflects off a blue wall spangled with stars, except the stars are constellations of copper pennies. A huge carved tree-trunk sits on a trestle of boxes. The wood is fake, made from polystyrene foam, and so are the spoon-like sculptures from Papua New Guinea that sit on the wooden beam. </p> <p>Elsewhere, two cast busts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/03/how-william-morris-beauty-and-anarchy-uk\">William Morris</a> rest on a rusted metal and glass table. Shredded \u00a310 notes are embedded in the glass, lit from below. A microphone, connected to a sheet of suspended steel, is angled over the mouth of one of the busts. So far, it has failed to pick up any sound, but if you bash the metal sheet, a thunderous roar bursts from under the table. Claydon\u2019s art \u2013 like Marten\u2019s \u2013 sucks you down a rabbit hole. You go from mobile phone masts disguised as trees to hollow talking heads, pennies from heaven to rafts of homeless tribal artefacts. If things could speak, all you would hear is thunder.</p> <p>Art needs more interpretations than it does explanations. None of these artists make puzzles to be solved. Understanding is frequently overrated. What a rich, varied and contrary exhibition this is. After a bit, I forgot it was a prize. Here, the best art and the best sculpture might not be synonymous. It is impossible. Give the prize to Medalla, who probably needs it most. </p> <p>\u2022 The winner of the Hepworth sculpture prize will be announced on 17 November.

  "<p>Lunar House is a brutal 20-storey office block in Croydon, named after the lunar landing of Apollo 11. This architectural monster is the frontline of Britain\u2019s immigration administration \u2013 and the reason the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/refugee-children-britain-calais-resettlement-uk\" title=\"\">children from the Calais refugee camp</a> are being bussed to Croydon, south London, to have their applications processed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://about.me/bekelewoyecha\" title=\"\">Bekele</a> remembers his first encounter with Lunar House. The first day he waited 12 hours. It was so horrible he remembers the date: 3 March 2006. The next day he waited from 8am to midnight. Mostly, he waited outside. \u201cI was brought up with stories of Britain and its respect for human rights. But I am sorry to say that during those early days I was robbed of my dignity.\u201d There were no waiting facilities, no baby changing and nowhere to get a cup of coffee. Lunar House security guards nicknamed the entrance the \u201ccattle shed\u201d.</p> <p>That was before a couple of nuns in a Winnebago turned up outside and started collecting people\u2019s stories and distributing coffee. The security guards felt a bit uncomfortable strong-arming the nuns to leave. So they got a meeting with the head of Lunar House to discuss how immigrants were being treated there. This was the founding campaign of <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/south_london\" title=\"\">South London Citizens UK</a>. One woman, a parishioner from the local Roman Catholic church, Sri Lanka-born Mary Aprigas, drove the campaign for a half-decent waiting area. In 2009 a <a href=\"http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/4816303.New_waiting_area_at_Croydon_s_Lunar_House_finally_completed/\" title=\"\">small plaque was erected</a> to her in the foyer of the new facilities she campaigned for. It&#xa0;reads: \u201cVoice of Courage\u201d.</p> <p>Bekele has been back to Lunar House every day this week, welcoming the children coming off the coaches from Calais. And others from local churches and further afield have been working behind the scenes. We came together early on Monday morning, encouraged by the presence of the former archbishop of Canterbury, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/rowan-williams-stop-foot-dragging-over-calais-child-refugees\" title=\"\">Rowan Williams</a>, and the bishop of Croydon, Jonathan Clark. As we met for morning prayer, one of the students from the theological college read the story of the child Jesus&#xa0;being forced to flee his home and of how political forces conspired to murder innocent children. It all seemed horribly contemporary.</p> <p>The Home Office had asked local churches to provide a pool of criminal-records-cleared adults who could sit with the Calais children as they went through their interviews at Lunar House. The Salvation Army provided goodie bags. Church buildings nearby had been set up as welcome centres where the children could meet their families and escape the press.</p> <p>We tried. But in the end, what will be remembered most from this week is that this country greeted vulnerable children not with welcome, but with fear and derision. Apparently, some didn\u2019t look enough like children. They didn\u2019t reward our \u201cgenerosity\u201d with cherubic faces and a gratifying tear. Instead, we got gangly male teenagers with a bit of fluff on their upper lip. And we wanted them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/child-refugees-dental-tests-verify-age-david-davies\" title=\"\">examined by a dentist</a>, as if they were cattle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/child-refugees-dental-tests-verify-age-david-davies\">Give child refugees   dental tests to verify age, says David Davies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A thousand or so children are still stuck in Calais, in the freezing mud and surrounded by every kind of threat.

And despite the fact that parliament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/21/house-of-lords-votes-to-let-lone-child-refugees-come-to-britain\" title=\"\">passed the amendment tabled by Lord Dubs</a> earlier this year, honouring the memory of the Kindertransports, so far not a single child has been brought over under that legislation. Not&#xa0;one. A more cynical mind might suspect that a thousand freezing children are seen by the British government as an acceptable price to pay to deter others from making the journey to Calais. Surely this cannot be the calculation being made by our vicar\u2019s daughter prime minister?</p> <p>Croydon\u2019s most famous son is John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury to Elizabeth I. The town\u2019s shopping centre and many of its businesses still bear his name. He is remembered for the schools he founded in Croydon and his concern for the young \u2013 a legacy that is being honoured by ordinary people from local Croydon churches in welcoming the children from Calais.</p>",

Eventually Breitbart\u2019s leader, Steve Bannon, managed to elbow out political operative Paul Manafort and acquire the top spot \u2013 \u201cCEO\u201d \u2013 of the Trump campaign.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lewandowski\u2019s adversarial relationship with the media, whom he had <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/remember-that-time-lewandowski-cussed-out-and-threatened-to-blacklist-a-cnn-reporter/\">penned</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trump-revokes-post-press-credentials-calling-the-paper-dishonest-and-phony/2016/06/13/f9a61a72-31aa-11e6-95c0-2a6873031302_story.html\">blacklisted</a>, to say nothing of Fields\u2019s charges, got him a job at CNN, where he will continue to be paid <a href=\"http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/corey_lewandowski_trump_campaign_cnn.html\">$20,000 a month by Trump</a> beyond even the end of the campaign.</p> <p>Fox, largely because of Ailes\u2019s departure, has become the site of soul searching among a conservative establishment that has lost its way in a violent upsurge of the same populism that had helped animate it in its formative years. If the allegations of the more than 20 women uncovered by its internal investigation were true, the network had hosted multiple incidents of sexual misconduct against its own talent; that kind of conduct, James and Lachlan Murdoch made clear, could not be publicly tolerated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">Tenth woman accuses Donald Trump of sexual misconduct</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, CNN and other outlets were discovering that the inchoate rage of the populist right could be very good for business. Trump himself became the target of 10 accusations, so far, of sexual assault \u2013 and responded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/look-at-her-i-dont-think-so-trumps-defence-is-to-demean-his-accusers\">insulting his accusers as unattractive</a> and calling them liars. </p> <p>Trump coverage has given CNN its highest ratings since the first Obama campaign and, crucially, even a smattering of ratings victories over Fox, which has dominated its competition for more than a decade. There are even persistent rumors of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/18/trump-tv-network-what-it-would-look-like\">Trump TV</a>\u201d network \u2013 a near impossibility in the current TV economy, but one Trump himself teased on Wednesday by livestreaming the debate on Facebook with the hashtag #trumptv.</p> <p>Likewise, Breitbart, the Federalist and conspiracist Alex Jones\u2019s Infowars have suddenly entered the mainstream. At Fox, similar voices to those were all represented at one time or another \u2013 Ailes famously <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/ailes-to-the-dc-staff-no-more-shooting-inside-the-tent/26167\">reprimanded staff</a> for \u201cshooting in the tent\u201d when concerns were raised internally over controversial commentator Glenn Beck, who eventually left the network amid acrimony. </p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that Fox is on its last legs \u2013 it\u2019s still a fabulously profitable enterprise. But it is grappling with the consequences of a political environment it did so much to create.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to remove a reference to the \u201cschizophrenia\u201d of Fox News. The term should not have been used outside of a medical context.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>Think for one second about all the TV you don\u2019t watch \u2013 home renovation reality shows, dramatic re-enactments of obscure civil war battles, bass fishing highlights, and whatever the hell Freeform is. There\u2019s just not enough time in the day to consume every TV show. Then there\u2019s the shows that you not only won\u2019t watch, but you literally can\u2019t watch. These are the failed pilots, the little lost three-legged puppies of Hollywood. They get buried in an abandoned missile silo or melted down and turned into episodes of The Big Bang Theory. But what if, for one shining moment, we could imagine a world where these shows not only exist, but they thrive? This is what I have done for five genuine unsold pilots that sound the least appealing. For your pleasure, I have charted out a path forward for these shows.</p> <h2>Spark</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11b0c93819059b8e1624ac4f8d463e204bd4b571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b0c93819059b8e1624ac4f8d463e204bd4b571/0_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edison light bulbs, popular hipster staple but completely useless in Spark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edison light bulbs, popular hipster staple but completely useless in Spark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DeRailleur/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Try, if you might, to imagine a world in which no one invented electricity. All of your gadgets are powered by fossil fuels. So, I guess your smartphone needs a portable furnace attached to it, which seems very practical. That\u2019ll fit in your pocket. Two families fight for control of the energy infrastructure of the planet \u2026 until a young girl invents electricity. Considering I have not seen this pilot and know nothing about it, I must assume that this girl (who I will call Tabitha, unless told otherwise) is not only spunky, but also a bit of a misfit. You see, Tabitha is an orphan, preferably from the wrong side of the tracks. Her father should, ideally, be a coalminer himself. He should also be suffering from the black lung, which pushes her to inventing a cleaner source of energy. There are betrayals, lots of tame, broadcast TV sex scenes where people grind on each other while wearing overalls, and a special guest appearance by 3rd Rock from the Sun star French Stewart as Nikola Tesla. In the final episode, climate change occurs at an accelerated rate and the entire planet drowns under the rising tide of the oceans, revealing that this had been a prequel to the movie Waterworld the entire time.</p> <h2>The Kicker</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f134f11371152c95a7966d10c5988c851a21760\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f134f11371152c95a7966d10c5988c851a21760/0_169_4652_2791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traumatic brain injury need not be an impediment to solving crimes, albeit tedious ones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traumatic brain injury need not be an impediment to solving crimes, albeit tedious ones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Brevard/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s about a football kicker who gets cut from his team and tries to fit into the real world. The gag here is that he\u2019s a bit crazy, so he has a hard time relating to other people. In my version of this pilot, the poor bastard learns that he can\u2019t function in the real world because he has a traumatic brain injury and sues the National Football League for millions of dollars. His intrepid lawyer is portrayed by Casey Affleck (because Ben Foster said no) and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is played by a box of instant mashed potatoes (also because Ben Foster said no). The twist here is that each week, Affleck and his football player friend solve crimes. Mostly petty offenses like a stolen purse or a guy who waters his lawn on Tuesdays instead of legally mandated Thursdays. The show goes on for longer than even Law &amp; Order did, as the procedural element allows for multiple cast changes \u2013 so many, in fact, that future generations will not even know why the show is called The Kicker, as the football aspect gets dropped after five seasons once football is outlawed by President Chelsea Clinton.</p> <h2>Furst Born</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caec278d93c2876b07b72244981cddd669936f6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caec278d93c2876b07b72244981cddd669936f6d/0_24_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"drag racing car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You were born to drag racers and consequently have won 57th place in the lottery of life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Based on an Australian TV series, Furst Born tells the story of a woman who learns she was adopted and that her birth parents are drag racers. I\u2019m struggling to see the dramatic (or comedic) potential here. Was there a fishbowl full of professions the parents could have and some poor sap happened to draw \u201cdrag racers\u201d? What other options were there? Podiatrist? Soapmaker? Cheesemonger? Suicide assistant? Journalist? Also, drag races are not particularly engaging to watch, as they\u2019re over in a few seconds. We\u2019re going to really have to spice things up on this one. I\u2019d suggest they fight crime with their drag racing cars, but I already used that one for The Kicker. I don\u2019t believe anyone\u2019s ever thought about this, though. What if the drag racing cars \u2026 turned into robots? They\u2019re actually aliens from another planet that came to Earth in the guise of automobiles \u2013 the perfect disguise.</p> <h2>Zoobiquity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48eee08c356bca360663219eee3845e58d122ef6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48eee08c356bca360663219eee3845e58d122ef6/0_333_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaliningrad Zoo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Help!

This is based on a nonfiction book by Barbara Natterson-Horowitz and Kathryn Bowers, so even if it sounds stupid, it\u2019s based in some semblance of real science. Still, I can\u2019t help but picture someone being fed the pills meant for a baboon or a gorilla popping Viagra. I\u2019d rather die than take the same drugs you\u2019d give my dog for giardia. This would be a better show if instead of real science informing fake TV stories, they go full Island of Dr Moreau and spice animals with people. Again, I gotta go for the crime-fighting angle. I\u2019m thinking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles meets Moonlighting or Castle. More specifically, I see a young cardiologist teaming up with a zebra. At first, there\u2019s some tension. The cardiologist plays it by the book, but the zebra is a damned hothead, consistently bending the letter of the law to get the job done. It\u2019s a classic odd couple, in that one is a strait-laced doctor and the other is literally a horse with stripes.</p> <h2>The Fluffy Shop</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abc99b4e883cd3fcc7f5bbcffe0061d0c5742277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abc99b4e883cd3fcc7f5bbcffe0061d0c5742277/141_0_3292_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gabriel Iglesias (far right) and the rest of the Magic Mike cast share a laugh over the thought of The Fluffy Shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gabriel Iglesias, far right, and the rest of the Magic Mike cast share a laugh over the thought of The Fluffy Shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Comedian Gabriel Iglesias stars as himself in a semi-autobiographical sitcom about a comedian named Gabriel Iglesias. Contrary to popular belief, the Fluffy Shop is not a fetish outlet for furries, like it is in my version. Mr Iglesias works the counter at a store that sells only furry outfits and furry accessories. It\u2019s not the ideal job, but he has to pay the bills while he struggles to make his dreams of comedy stardom come true. Eventually, he has the brilliant idea to host a weekly standup show in the store. Boy is there a wacky cast of characters who show up each week. Think of Cheers, but substitute alcoholics for people who like to have sex through layers of synthetic hair. It\u2019s a real shame that no one will ever see this show, as I\u2019m sure they jam-packed the pilot with more dunderheaded fat jokes than anyone else in the history of television, until the upcoming season finale of Kevin Can Wait.</p>",

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/20/philip-green-knighthood-commons-set-to-debate-stripping-philip-green-of-his-knighthood-politics-live?page=with:block-5808ac7fe4b005f21833b6ca#block-5808ac7fe4b005f21833b6ca\">12.40pm.) </a>Here are key extracts.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Wright described the BHS saga as \u201cone of the biggest corporate scandals of modern time\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BHS is one of the biggest corporate scandals of modern times. I\u2019m sure the whole House has sympathy for the thousands of workers and pensioners who have lost their jobs and seen their pension benefits reduced as a result of greed, incompetence and hubris. The reputation of business has been tarnished as a result of this greed. The vast majority of businesses are not run and managed like this. It would be wrong to tar all of business with the same brush. However, it is vital that this mess is sorted. Even at this late stage, Sir Philip should make amends for this whole story, and put right the wrongs that he himself engineered.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright accused Green of raiding BHS for his own benefit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> [Green] can\u2019t be described as a short-term corporate raider. But he did raid the company, and his ability to do so meant that he was then in a financial position to be able to obtain the debt to acquire Arcadia and, through the same modus operandi, pay his family the biggest dividend in corporate history. He took the rings from BHS\u2019s fingers, beat it black and blue, starved it of food and water, put it on life support, and then wanted credit for keeping it alive.</p> <p>BHS\u2019s balance sheet was made considerably weaker during Sir Philip\u2019s tenure of the company. His extraction of value early on in his ownership made the company less able to innovate, to retain a market share or competitive place in the retail market which would allow the firm to generate the profits and be in more of a position to survive and to address the growing pension scheme deficit. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright said the BHS Group\u2019s dividend policy \u201cset the scene for the eventual demise of the company\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BHS folded in 2016, a year after Sir Philip Green sold it to Dominic Chappell, but its demise was on the cards a lot earlier than that. In the three year period between 2002 and 2004, BHS Group paid dividends of \u00a3423 million, even though operating profit for the period was less than that amount, at \u00a3325 million. In 2004, BHS Group had dividends of \u00a3199,500,000. This dividend exceeded the Group\u2019s operating profit for that year of \u00a3137 million ...</p> <p>Sir Philip could say, quite reasonably, that he received dividends for only a short period of time early on in his period of ownership. It was a long time ago. That is true. But I do think the dividend policy is crucial to understanding the whole story of BHS and wider lessons for business. </p> <p>Green was to enrich himself, his family and his friends at the expense of long-term and sustainable growth for the company. Certainly, profits were made, but they were more akin to a short-term sugar boost rather than a nutritious diet that aided the long term health and strength of the busines<strong>s. </strong></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright said Green was not even very good at retail.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sir Philip received his knighthood for services to retail. However, throughout the course of our inquiry, it became increasingly evident that he wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail at all. True, he was able, in the early days, of sniffing out a corporate bargain and cutting costs to boost profit. There is nothing wrong with that, but he did not boost BHS\u2019s turnover during his period of ownership, he lost market share to more nimble, or even not-so-nimble competitors, and he failed to anticipate the on-line retail revolution. By failing to innovate and invest in the brand, BHS looked like a remnant of the 1970s and 1980s, in a cut throat competitive sector where grabbing the customer\u2019s attention and retaining their loyalty are paramount.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808b936e4b055209adaf893\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T12:32:22.059Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>James says it is important that the investigating bodies are given time to complete their inquiries.</p> <p>If the evidence supports it, enforcement will be taken, she says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808b837e4b005f21833b70f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T12:31:22.742Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>James says Green says he is in a dialogue with the pensions regulator.</p> <p>She says she would urge him to sort it out quickly.</p> <p>The pensions regulator continues to investigate the handling of BHS pensions.

Here it is.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rolf Harris</strong>, March 2015. The former children\u2019s entertainer was stripped of his CBE after being jailed for almost six years for a string of sex attacks on girls as young as seven. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong> Stuart Hall</strong>, October 2013. The former It\u2019s A Knockout presenter was made an OBE in 2012 for services to broadcasting and charity. But the Queen directed it be cancelled after Hall, then 83, was handed a 30-month jail term for sexually abusing 13 victims, one as young as nine, over a period of nearly 20 years. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vicky Pryce,</strong> July 2013. The economist was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 2009 in recognition of her contribution as head of the Government economic service. But in March 2013 she and ex-husband Chris Huhne were both jailed for eight months for swapping speeding penalty points a decade earlier so he could avoid a driving ban, which only emerged when Pryce approached newspapers after Huhne left her for another woman. She was released from prison after two months but, following her conviction, her name was removed from the Order of the Bath register. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>James Crosby,</strong> June 2013. The former HBOS chief executive, who was knighted in 2006 after leaving the bank, was stripped of the title at his own request following a scathing parliamentary report into its collapse. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jimmy Savile,</strong> January 2013. The television star was knighted for his services to charity in 1990 but the honours forfeiture committee considered stripping him of the title posthumously when the scale of the paedophile\u2019s crimes emerged. The Cabinet Office later said that he had ceased to be a member of the order upon his death in 2011. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Fred Goodwin</strong>, January 2012. Goodwin received his knighthood for services to banking under the Labour government before guiding the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse in 2008. While honours are usually only removed from those convicted or jailed, the Cabinet Office said the scale of the RBS disaster - necessitating a \u00a345bn bailout from the taxpayer - made the case \u201cexceptional\u201d. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jean Else</strong>, February 2011. \u201cSuperhead\u201d Jean Else was made a Dame in 2001 in recognition of her transforming performance at Whalley Range High School in Manchester. But in January 2009 she was banned from running a school after the General Teaching Council found her guilty of failing to observe minimum standards in recruiting and promoting staff. Her honour was revoked in 2011 after she was found guilty of misconduct. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Robert Mugabe</strong>, 2008. Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe was stripped of his honorary knighthood in 2008 over his \u201cabuse of human rights\u201d and \u201cabject disregard\u201d for democracy. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>\u201cPrince\u201d Naseem Hamed,</strong> 2007. The former WBA world featherweight champion was jailed in 2006 for 15 months and disqualified from driving for four years after a crash in May 2005 that left another man with fractures to \u201cevery major bone in his body\u201d. The boxer was stripped of his MBE in January 2007. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Lester Piggott</strong>, 1988.The former champion jockey was stripped of his OBE after he was given a three-year jail term for evading tax in 1987. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Anthony Blunt,</strong> 1979. Art historian Anthony Blunt was a Professor of the History of Art at the University of London and Surveyor of the Queen\u2019s Pictures. What was not known was that in 1964 he had confessed to having been a member of the infamous Cambridge Five Soviet spy ring, passing information to Moscow while they worked for MI5 during the Second World War. His secret was closely guarded for many years, but Margaret Thatcher publicly revealed his status in November 1979 and he was immediately stripped of his knighthood.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808aec6e4b055209adaf856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T11:47:58.677Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eleanor Laing,</strong> the deputy speaker, says she expects the debate to end around 2.30pm.

Witnesses appeared to harbour the misconception that they could be absolved from responsibility by blaming others. The worst example was Sir Philip Green, despite his protestations to the contrary. Sir Philip adopted a scattergun approach, liberally firing blame to all angles except his own, though he began his evidence by saying he would do the opposite. The truth is that a large proportion of those who have got rich or richer off the back of BHS are to blame. Sir Philip Green, Dominic Chappell and their respective directors, advisers and hangers-on are all culpable. The tragedy is that those who have lost out are the ordinary employees and pensioners. This is the unacceptable face of capitalism.</p> <p>The sale of BHS did not have to proceed as it did. The potential checks, however, proved to be inadequate. Regulatory concerns were circumvented. Advisers were heavily incentivised to progress the deal ...</p> <p>Sir Philip Green drove the deal forward. He sought to sell a chain that had become a financial millstone and threatened his reputation. He knew that Dominic Chappell was a wholly unsuitable purchaser but overlooked or made good each of Chappell\u2019s shortcomings and proceeded with a rushed sale regardless.</p> <p>Dominic Chappell was out of his depth. He was over-optimistic to the point of arrogance. He failed to recruit a retail expertdespite his own lack of experience; failed to secure funding on commercial terms; failed to address BHS\u2019s property leases in a timely way; and failed to address the company\u2019s long-term underperformance ...</p> <p>The Green family benefited significantly from BHS. In his early years of ownership, Sir Philip cut costs, sold assets and paid substantial dividends offshore to the ultimate benefit of his wife. He failed, however, to invest sufficiently in stores or reinvent the business to beat the prevailing high street competition. We found little evidence to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which he received his knighthood.</p> <p>It is true these are private companies holding Green family money. BHS, however, was a major employer and the sponsor of a large and ailing pension fund. Arcadia, another Green company, is in a similar position. Sir Philip gave insufficient priority to the BHS pension scheme over an extended period. His failure to resolve its problems by now has contributed substantially to the demise of BHS. Sir Philip owes it to the BHS pensioners to find a resolution urgently. This will undoubtedly require him to make a large financial contribution. He has a moral duty to act, a duty which he acknowledges. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808aa25e4b005f21833b6bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T11:32:25.146Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fuller says Green was running a business with 11,000 employees. He criticised the decision to sell BHS to Dominic Chappell.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What goes through the mind of a knight of the realm to say that those livelihoods should be consigned to a three-time bankrupt? </p> <p>What goes through the mind of the owner of such a substantial business that this, the problems that he has faced and been to him quite challenging, can more easily be solved by someone with zero experience of the industry that they are about to take on? </p> <p>We are debating today those tangible issues. We are talking about what happened to the pensions, we are talking about what happened to the fact that many people lost their jobs, that there is a symbolic but still quite tangible step that we can take in this House, which is to say that those behaviours do not merit the continuations of an honour.</p> </blockquote> <p>He says MPs can take the step of saying these behaviours do not merit an honour.</p> <p>He says some MPs have said they agree Green might not deserve an honour, but they are not sure this is a matter for the Commons.

Davis implied the government was looking at such an option. He told her:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are seeking to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union and it would not be in the interests of either side, either Britain or the EU, to see disruption. And to that end we are examining all possible options, as you would expect.</p> <p>We are approaching these negotiations in good faith and with goodwill towards our negotiating partners, and we hope the same in reverse, focused on a mutual interest to the UK and the EU including financial stability. I would say that having London as a number one financial centre sitting at the heart of the global capital markets is not just in the UK\u2019s interests, it\u2019s also in the EU\u2019s interests, and I\u2019m confident that everyone will see the value in not undermining it. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Hilary Benn</strong>, the Labour MP and new chair of the shadow Brexit secretary, said that businesses needed to know now that transitional arrangements would be put in place if there was no deal within two year. Davis told him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have to treat as absolutely central to what we do maintaining the stability of both the City but also the European financial markets, and the European financial markets are a little fragile over the last few years. Now we will therefore do anything necessary. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis said that the government would publish \u201cmuch information\u201d about its Brexit plans between now and the triggering of article 50, starting the two-year EU withdrawal process.</strong> He told MPs:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the course of the coming - whether it is six months or less - period before the triggering of article 50, much information will be put out about this and the House will be in no doubt what our aims and strategic objectives are.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But he also claimed that Labour was undermining the national interest by demanding detailed information about the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating position. </strong>He told MPs:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m afraid what [Labour] do is rather seriously not to the country\u2019s interests from time to time ...</p> <p>What the opposition are trying to do is to put us in a disadvantaged position against the European Union.

It seems highly likely that the Commons will vote for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood.</p> <p>MPs are due to debate a motion on <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmworpen/54/5402.htm\">the joint report from the Commons business committee and the Commons work and pensions committee into the collapse of BHS.</a> It says Green should fulfil his promise to make good the deficit in the BHS pension fund. But more than 100 MPs have signed an amendment tabled by the Conservative MP Richard Fuller saying Green should lose his knighthood. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[This House] noting that Philip Green received his knighthood for his services for the retail industry, believes his actions raise the question of whether he should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour and calls on the honours forfeiture committee to recommend his knighthood be cancelled and annulled.</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be surprising if John Bercow, the Speaker, does not call the amendment and, assuming it does get called, it is hard to imagine it not being passed. It is not binding, because the final decision on Green\u2019s knighthood would be taken by the honours forfeiture committee, but the committee may find it hard to ignore parliament.</p> <p>I will be covering the debate in detail.</p> <p>Otherwise it is a relatively quiet day.

  "<h2>\u2018A spot of dry skin convinced me of the need to moisturise\u2019<br></h2> <p>Any man who tells you they don\u2019t have a beauty routine is, frankly, lying through the prongs of their <a href=\"http://www.kentbrushes.com/ranges/combs/20t\">Kent pocket comb</a>. When I was a child, I remember my father ascending from the first-floor bathroom looking like a shiny balloon, the contours of his face glistening like a sweet wrapper. Something was off, even though his standard line was: \u201cJust soap and water!\u201d My mother was also a serial, although not so secretive, moisturiser-user, religiously slathering her face in Pond\u2019s cold cream. So, early on, I knew what was important, and, as a teenager, a spot of dry skin convinced me of the need to moisturise.</p> <p>For years, my gloop of choice was Vaseline Intensive Care, which has the consistency of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and suggested that it might work if you ran out of glue. Thanks to a sample, I now use Clinique\u2019s For Men moisturiser. It feels significant because a) it costs \u00a325, which officially means I\u2019m in the realm of \u201cmale beauty product users\u201d and b) it\u2019s feels slightly magical, because it photoshops out the cavernous brow marks that make me look like the thoughtful emoji. My hair, after fighting aeons-old wars with gel, mousse and \u201cfudge\u201d (no idea), now occasionally gets treated with Bumble and bumble (thanks, sample box) for curly hair. By the time this part of my morning routine is done, I realise that I\u2019ve ignored the plaintive cries of my two-year-old out of pure vanity. And then, of course, the brow frown reappears. <strong>Priya Elan</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I own a spray-on facial serum brought back from Kyoto\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49ac129a831765627409b4d7d8a7dfc86d7257fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49ac129a831765627409b4d7d8a7dfc86d7257fa/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Jonze\u2019s beauty products\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skincare obsessive?

On this front, no self-respecting metro can be without Tom Ford, but it\u2019s not just sexy marketing \u2013 his scents have more layers than a Bake Off showstopper, and make even the likes of Armani smell like Toilet Duck. <strong>Ben Beaumont-Thomas</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Water is a very underrated beauty treatment\u2019</h2> <p>Beauty regime? Me?! I\u2019m a 53-year-old father of two, for God\u2019s sake: the closest I get to grooming these days is splashing water on a sticky-out clump of bed hair in the morning and patting it vaguely back into place. It\u2019s all a far cry from the days when my morning routine involved a mirror, a tub of <a href=\"http://blackandwhitewax.com/\">Black &amp; White</a> and, eventually, an immaculately sculpted flat-top.</p> <p>As it happens, I use no products these days \u2013 literally<em> </em>none. I\u2019m a longstanding eczema sufferer, especially on my scalp; the last time I put shampoo in my hair, Kajagoogoo were at No 1. I rarely use soap, even, for the same reason, and when I do it\u2019s Simple for the, erm, simple fact that it\u2019s the only brand I\u2019ve come across that doesn\u2019t bring me out in a rash. Water is a very underrated beauty treatment.</p> <p>There\u2019s another upside, too: if the marketeers are to be believed, while every other bloke is giving Cheryl Fernandez-Versini a run for her money and spending their hard-earned on moisturisers, hair products, beard oil and all the rest, I\u2019ve always got enough in my pocket to get another pint in. <strong>Bob Granleese</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Free yourself from the tyranny of shaving cream\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d558bb17215d90189757c7634eb932b89109066e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d558bb17215d90189757c7634eb932b89109066e/0_1035_3024_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Vine\u2019s beauty products\" width=\"1000\" height=\"890\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Vine\u2019s minimalist approach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Vine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other than wading through piles of hair gel, mousse and hairspray in the very distant teenage past, and a brief dalliance with Kiehl\u2019s moisturiser (did it do anything? It didn\u2019t seem to make a difference when I forgot to use it), the idea of a beauty regime has largely passed me by. Does bulk-buying Body Shop Maca Root deodorant stick count? It\u2019s more a survival technique, a stock-piling approach to consumerism adopted a few years ago when every branch I went into seemed to have run out. Yes, other brands are available, but when you find a product that works, and you realise how inadequate the other options are (too smelly! Not smelly enough!), it\u2019s a lot easier to stick to what you know. </p> <p>Perhaps my aversion to anything more elaborate comes down to growing a beard after deciding that the industry dedicated to relentlessly smooth shaves is a bit ridiculous. Free yourself from the tyranny of shaving cream and five ninja-blade razor tech and it\u2019s easy to stop buying everything else. Well, apart from the odd bottle of eau de parfum, that is. <a href=\"http://comme-des-garcons-parfum.com/\">Love those wonky Comme bottles</a>. <strong>Richard Vine</strong></p> <h2>\u2018It makes me smell like nice trees\u2019 </h2> <p>My beauty regime is limited by a desire to spend the maximum amount of time in bed before a long commute. But one does what one must ... </p> <p>My face is kept clean by the Cidal soap which my wife has been using since she was a teenager. I\u2019m not sure whether I like it because it\u2019s good for spots or because the smell reminds me of having zero responsibilities at university. I usually attempt to control my cowlick with some fancy Phyto hair paste that my old hairdresser, Charlie, insisted I start buying in 2013 (which, like a mug, I did). Naturally, any effort is quickly annulled by wearing a bike helmet. Cycling also makes aftershave a bit pointless, but when I do it\u2019s <a href=\"http://czechandspeakefragrance.com/product-category/spainish-cedar/\">Czech &amp; Speake\u2019s Spanish Cedar</a>. Which makes me smell like nice trees. </p> <p>In the winter, I occasionally get dry skin, which is something else bike-affected; it\u2019s exacerbated by the freezing, wet morning rides. I\u2019ve got a bottle of Clinique For Men moisturiser which, at \u00a325, is about \u00a323 more than I want to pay for moisturiser. Thankfully, it was a Christmas present and is still about half full. For most of the year, my face is usually \u2013 how to put this \u2013 moisturised enough. Who needs moisturiser when you\u2019ve got chips? <strong>Will Dean</strong></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p>",

The government of Catalonia will make every effort for bullfights not to return to our country. We want a country where it is not possible to make a public spectacle of death and suffering to an animal. This is what we decided at the time in Catalonia and is unalterable for us.\u201d</p> <p>Rull added that when the Canary Islands introduced a similar ban the constitutional court took no action.

He added: \u201cShe suffered a number of painful and debilitating conditions which there were no cure for.\u201d</p> <p>The full details of the police raid were not given in court but it is understood that she surrendered some of the drugs in her kit after officers forced their way into her home \u2013 but kept half without officers realising.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/21/academic-kills-herself-after-importing-euthanasia-kit-illegally\">Police were called back</a> to her cottage in the village of Brampford Speke in Devon a few days later and Henry, who was a professor of English medieval culture at the University of Exeter until 2000, was discovered dead in her bath.</p> <p>At the time of her death in April, the Australian euthanasia campaigner Prof Philip Nitschke, who founded Exit International, said Henry was furious at the intervention by Devon and Cornwall police, accused the force of being heavy-handed and said Exit International was warning other members of what had happened. </p> <p>The inquest in Exeter was told that Henry had \u201ca number of painful and debilitating conditions\u201d including arthritis, spinal pain, incontinence, cardiac failure, chronic deafness, sleep problems, asthma and swollen feet.</p> <p>Her GP, Dr Stephen Vercoe, said she first mentioned euthanasia in November 2013 when she told him: \u201cLife is not really worth living any more.\u201d </p> <p>She told other health workers that she wanted to go to Dignitas in Switzerland to end her life but they told her it was illegal for them to help her \u2013 which she accepted. </p> <p>Vercoe said: \u201cMyself and several other medical professionals were well aware of Prof Henry\u2019s intention but we all felt she had mental capacity, was not sectionable and there was no further action we could take.\u201d </p> <p>She ordered drugs from Mexico on the internet but police were tipped off and raided her home. However, this did not stop her taking her life a few days later. In a note she said her death had been \u201claboriously planned\u201d and described the law that prevents people being helped to take their own lives as \u201cillogical\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d.</p> <p>Henry said she did not believe there needed to be a postmortem examination and asked that her body be buried in her orchard. A postmortem examination found Henry\u2019s death was caused by the drugs she had taken.</p> <p>Of the raid, William Michelmore, her solicitor, told the inquest: \u201cTwo armed police officers smashed a glass panel in Avril\u2019s door and came into her house. She was very upset by the infringement on her personal space by the police forcing their way in.\u201d </p> <p>She instructed Michelmore to lodge a complaint with Devon and Cornwall police. The coroner said: \u201cDr Henry appeared to start considering ending her life before she became too unwell. This goes back to November 2013, when she first spoke to her GP about this.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, she made no secret of her intentions and was assessed by her GP and psychiatrist on more than one occasion. The medical profession all concluded that she wasn\u2019t depressed, she had full mental capacity to make decisions about when and how she would end her life.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence to me is quite clear. Dr Henry set about a course of action that was intended to end her life at a method, a time and place that she decided herself.\u201d </p> <p>In April when Henry died, Nitschke said: \u201cPolice need to realise that in the UK suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention.</p> <p>\u201cHer death was a clear case of \u2018rational suicide\u2019 and her decision to die at her own time and in her own place should have been respected. As it is the authorities did everything they could to make her last days on this earth a misery.\u201d</p> <p>After the inquest Nitschke told the Guardian there were about five more police raids around the UK following that on Henry\u2019s house. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThe pattern was always the same \u2013 local police visiting at night asking to come in for a talk as they \u2018were concerned about the person\u2019s wellbeing\u2019. Generally they were let in, at which point they said they had information \u2018from Interpol\u2019 that they had imported the euthanasia drug and that they should hand it over. </p> <p>\u201cThe information was always correct. Generally the drugs were handed over and they were asked about their involvement with Exit.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe effect on our membership was dramatic. Lots of anxious people wondering where the breach in security had come from. In retrospect it looks as though it was the email communication with a particular Mexican supplier. This supplier now uses email encryption.</p> <p>\u201cMy best guess is that these bouts of enthusiastic activity are designed to \u2018send a message\u2019 to Exit\u2019s elderly membership to stop seeking internet euthanasia drugs. If this is the case it\u2019s been remarkably successful.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Exit International is a not-for-profit Australian company that says it has an online membership of 18,000 supporters around the world.</p> <p>It says the average age of Exit members is 75 years.

  "<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucia-graves\">Lucia Graves</a>: \u2018Hillary Clinton spoke directly to women\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b72cb7920bd461392b581c8560214d184520edf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b72cb7920bd461392b581c8560214d184520edf7/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Lucia Graves\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday night, in the last presidential debate of what has been an emotional tornado of a campaign, Hillary Clinton spoke directly to women.</p> <p>It began with a commitment to upholding the values laid out in Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion in the United States. Clinton spoke of protecting healthcare centers like Planned Parenthood that make upholding those values possible.</p> <p>Trump proceeded to make a fool of himself: \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying,\u201d he began, \u201c ... you can take baby and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">rip the baby out of the womb</a> in the ninth month, on the final day. That\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also not true. Late term abortions are extremely rare, and Trump\u2019s insistence that a baby can be torn out of its mother moments before childbirth is pure malarkey. Roe v Wade is meant to protect women\u2019s right to abortion up until \u201cfetal viability\u201d, which in Planned Parenthood v Casey, in 1992, was defined as 23 or 24 weeks or earlier. More recently fights in Congress have centered around an abortion ban at 20 weeks \u2013 in other words nowhere near the ninth month.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s obliviousness to these facts underscores his lack of understanding of the abortion debate and women\u2019s issues generally, a trait that was on display earlier this year when he suggested women who have abortions should face \u201csome sort of punishment\u201d. That\u2019s something no one on either side of the aisle wants, and tonight made clear Trump hasn\u2019t done any homework since his earlier blunder. </p> <p>But the evening was also a referendum on Trump\u2019s personal treatment of women. At one point, Clinton more or less said so. \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like.\u201d</p> <p>And unlike his infinite malleability on policy issues, misogyny is the one philosophy Trump clearly hasn\u2019t changed and seems genuinely unable to. He bristled when Clinton recalled his referring to former Miss Universe Alicia Machado as an \u201ceating machine\u201d, but soon after, he was interrupting to call Clinton not just the usual \u201cliar\u201d, which has by now become banal, but \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">such a nasty woman</a>\u201d, an even more baseless character attack.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the election writing about the women who\u2019ve known Trump. But this isn\u2019t just about the women I interviewed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Machado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">Sheena Monnin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth</a>.

He began it by saying Mexicans were rapists, and he continued in that vein the final debate, saying: \u201cWe have some bad hombres here and we have to get them out\u201d \u2013 using a not-so-subtle dogwhistle to stoke sexual fears of Latino men. The comment was ironic, given his admission, on tape, of his own sexually predatory actions, and the claims of his many accusers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-bad-hombres-us-presidential-debate-las-vegas-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58apd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822647\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: deport 'bad hombres' \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58088131e4b005f21833b5db\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020hombres_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020hombres.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020hombres_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-bad-hombres-us-presidential-debate-las-vegas-video\">Trump vows to rid US of \u2018bad hombres\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps Trump\u2019s biggest grievance is the possibility of losing.

But she also fumbled needlessly, at one point answering a question about Syria by saying the US must work with \u201cAmerican Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks,\u201d then awkwardly following up with a non-sequitur: \u201cThe killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.\u201d</p> <p>The night was devoid of poetry, and ended as depressingly as the entire campaign has been conducted.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamie-weinstein\">Jamie Weinstein</a>: \u2018The only question is whether he now faces a Mitt Romney-style disaster or a Michael Dukakis-style catastrophe\u2019<br></h2> <p>Donald Trump needed a devastating knockout. At best he narrowly lost on points.</p> <p>He came into the third and final presidential debate far behind in the polls. With tens of millions watching, he did little to change the trajectory of the race.</p> <p>Compared to the first two debates, Trump did do a better job hammering home his message that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for the status quo.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been doing this for 30 years \u2013 why didn\u2019t you do it over the last 15, 20 years,\u201d Trump said of Clinton when talking about negotiating better trade deals.</p> <p>\u201cYou talk but you don\u2019t get anything done Hillary,\u201d he later added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Trump also did a better job at controlling his emotions when Hillary tried to bait him by calling him a choker and a \u201cpuppet\u201d.

The only question that remains is whether Donald Trump faces a Mitt Romney-style disaster or a Michael Dukakis-style catastrophe \u2013 and, in that loss, whether Trump brings the Republican House, Senate, party and even conservative movement down with him.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopher-r-barron\">Christopher R Barron</a>: \u2018Trump stuck to the issues and forced Hillary to talk policy\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d07b62588db36e5f2f2ad87ddc32e036d46f0263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07b62588db36e5f2f2ad87ddc32e036d46f0263/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Christopher Barron\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump came to this behind in the polls and reeling after weeks of negative media coverage.

Tonight, however, we saw a much more disciplined candidate. Trump stuck to the issues and forced Hillary to talk policy and \u2013 quite frankly \u2013 she had her worst debate performance. </p> <p>Unlike previous moderators, Chris Wallace was willing to properly challenge both Trump and Clinton. His line of questioning, particularly when it came to the Clinton Foundation, kept Hillary off balance.</p> <p>Clinton also found herself on the defensive on foreign policy, where she seemed more like a George W Bush Republican than a Democrat.</p> <p>As a result, this ended up being Trump\u2019s best debate. For far too long, the Republican candidate has let the campaign be about the circus and not about policy. If this race is about the circus then Hillary Clinton wins.

At which point, Trump leaned into his microphone and said: \u201cShould have gotten it.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s one thing to lose your self-control on Twitter. It\u2019s another to thing to lose it while talking about Twitter.</p> <p>Clinton goaded Trump as easily as an older sister drives her brother into a full-blown tantrum. She called him a puppet of Vladimir Putin. His response? \u201cNo, you\u2019re the puppet.\u201d</p> <p>She said the intelligence agencies blamed election-related cyberattacks on Russia. His response? \u201cShe has no idea whether it\u2019s Russia, China or anybody else,\u201d said the puppet. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>Barely a limo ride away from the Pyramids, the Grand Canal and the Eiffel Tower (the Vegas versions, at least) the GOP nominee explained his foreign policy in remarkable detail. He accused US forces of attacking Isis in Mosul simply to help Clinton get elected, before giving us his Cliffs Notes on the city. \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cMosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, she took everybody out. We lost Mosul. Now we\u2019re fighting again to get Mosul.\u201d</p> <p>Like the Hangover series, this Trump debate trilogy has grown wan and tired in its final outing. The scriptwriters have run out of ideas.

  "<p>There is no doubt that the <a href=\"https://www.mi5.gov.uk/threat-levels\" title=\"\">threat from international terrorism is real</a> and that it requires proportionate and evidence-based strategies to confront it.

On Wednesday, the Open Society Justice Initiative published a groundbreaking, <a href=\"https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/eroding-trust-20161017_0.pdf\" title=\"\">evidence-based report</a> entitled Eroding Trust, which concluded that \u201cthe current Prevent strategy suffers from multiple, mutually reinforcing structural flaws\u201d, adding that there are \u201cserious indications that Prevent is counterproductive\u201d. In the report, the former security official and Prevent strategy\u2019s architect, Sir David Omand, observed: \u201cThe key issue is, do most people in the community accept [Prevent] as protective of their rights? If the community sees it as a problem, then you have a problem.\u201d</p> <p>The concerns are well-founded and cannot be dismissed as mere misunderstandings. Take the government official reported to have <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160120/halltext/160120h0001.htm#16012030000552\" title=\"\"> told Gavin Robinson MP</a>: \u201cDon\u2019t push the issue too far. It is really a counter-Islamic strategy,\u201d after he asked why Northern Ireland was not included in the counter-extremism strategy. Or when the former education secretary Nicky Morgan on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/videos/10153464670856939/\" title=\"\">Channel 4 News</a> said that converting to Christianity is \u201cof course not\u201d a sign of radicalisation (while converting to Islam is).

Indeed, there are numerous case studies of young children, teachers and health patients being referred to Prevent for spurious reasons, making up <a href=\"http://www.mcb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20150803-Case-studies-about-Prevent.pdf\" title=\"\">80% of a growing number of referrals</a>.</p> <p>Rather than detect early signs of radicalisation, Prevent is seen as a government strategy that forces the public sector to make Muslims pass subjective and discriminatory counter-extremism litmus tests. But a <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/657617/Britain-Cameron-core-deradicalisation-policy-FAILING-Prevent-Islamic-extremism\" title=\"\">poll earlier this year</a> showed that 96% of Britons think that Prevent is not keeping us safe.

But what are the alternatives?</p> <p>There is no silver bullet for this problem, and ultimately it is our security services and police who bear the responsibility of keeping our nation safe and secure. Moreover, like any other responsible members of society, Muslims must (and already do) help our law enforcement authorities by reporting any criminal activity, including terrorism, come what may. But at the same time, there is justifiable scepticism at the notion that Muslims must police their own communities and take \u201cownership\u201d of the problem, when in fact the current terrorist threat often originates on the margins and fringes of British Muslim communities and away from British mosques.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/25/prevent-strategy-muslims-children-school\">Treating Muslim children as terror suspects does not make Britain safer | Homa Khaleeli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Notwithstanding this scepticism, there is a real desire in the community to explore grassroots-led responses to the challenge of terrorism. That is why the Muslim Council of Britain is carrying out a nationwide consultation to find out what Muslim communities would like the government to do to tackle terrorism together.</p> <p>Initial feedback from this listening exercise suggests that the Prevent strategy is seen as a top-down government-led effort to create a more palatable version of Islam, targeting so-called non-violent extremists without a robust definition. Instead, Muslim communities support a greater focus on violent terrorism specifically, while community cohesion efforts unrelated to terrorism are dealt with separately.</p> <p>While intelligence-led policing cannot be seen as the only tool, it is clear that reporting to the police remains vital in tackling terrorism and requires the support and engagement of communities. And according to a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31293196\" title=\"\">BBC/Comres poll last year</a>, an overwhelming 94% of Muslims would report terrorists planning violence to the police. However, we cannot and should not be complacent \u2013 and sharing best practice of the many communities who engage well with their local police forces is key to co-operation in tackling terrorism.</p> <p>Rather than mosques and madrasas being targeted as potential hotbeds of terrorism, a claim that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/20/uksecurity.terrorism1\" title=\"\">no basis</a> in fact, many have suggested that they be the centres of our community. Imams and teachers should more loudly and innovatively articulate the normative understanding of Islam to create more resilient communities that uphold <a href=\"http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&amp;verse=143\" title=\"\">\u201cthe middle\u201d</a> path and unequivocally reject the violence of the likes of al-Qaida and Islamic State.</p> <p>In addition, one of the outcomes of a roundtable discussion on Muslim Youth Services convened by the MCB was the need for safe open spaces, unmonitored by the state, in which young people were free to express their political views openly, even when against the conventional norms.</p> <p>Finally, many responses have highlighted the importance of mosques expanding their efforts even further to support the needs of our communities. These include helping to improve literacy and addressing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/20/police-study-radicalisation-mental-health-problems\" title=\"\">mental health</a> issues, which is a serious problem within many Muslim communities; and providing support for families dealing with challenges presented online.</p> <p>The MCB does not claim to have a definitive solution, nor an end-to-end alternative to Prevent. But it is critical that we engage with such ideas received from communities, which the government has consistently <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-uk-did-not-consult-any-muslim-organizations-about-flagship-anti-radicalization-website\" title=\"\">failed to do</a>. This has to be the precursor to any counterterrorism plan. We hope the government will listen.</p>",

We are bringing to life little-known individuals of the past, putting a spotlight on the diversity of those working today, and showing that far from being isolated and struggling, women have always collaborated and created networks of their own.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with a quiet giant of early 20th century archaeology, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Garrod\">Dorothy Garrod</a>. She worked on a huge number of sites through her career, and became <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.com/dorothy-garrod/\">the first woman professor in any field at Oxbridge</a>. In 1929, less than a year after women got the vote in the UK, Garrod directed an excavation at Mount Carmel with an international all-female team. Charming one-off story? Nope - also in 1929, <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.tumblr.com/post/62730801575/gertrude-caton-thompson-society-girl-suffragist-and\">Gertrude Caton Thompson</a>, a friend of Garrod, dug Great Zimbabwe with two young women as assistants. One was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kenyon\">Kathleen Kenyon</a>, who became one of the most influential archaeologists in Britain (and a Dame besides). Look back further to the turn of the century, and Caton Thompson\u2019s teacher, Egyptologist <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.com/margaret-murray-the-marvellous-mud-marching-mummy-unwrapping-margaret-murray/\">Margaret Murray</a>, was also excavating with other women. And it goes on and on: 100 years before Great Zimbabwe, Mary Anning was busy exchanging letters with <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.com/elizabeth-philpot/\">fellow female fossilists</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fb10fa6f09d8c05c764ff494d896c94850a2f15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fb10fa6f09d8c05c764ff494d896c94850a2f15/80_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There have been female trowel blazers working in archaeology, palaeontology and geology for longer than most people might think.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There have been female trowel blazers working in archaeology, palaeontology and geology for longer than most people might think.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonora Saunders and Chris Church</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We can trace how this interconnected-ness over 150 years was key to women slowly gaining ground.

Yet in the 21st century we\u2019re starting to see a push back, with women advancing across different specialisms and career stages.<br><br>The Raising Horizons exhibition is about celebrating this heritage, and showcasing the contemporary face of the geosciences. We\u2019ve chosen 14 women working today, ranging from field leaders, to those at early career stages but still experts in their areas.</p> <p>Marie Carmichael Stopes (yes, she of the family planning clinics) was a pioneering early 20th century expert in ancient plants; unable to go with Sir Robert Scott to source fossils from Antarctica, she nevertheless studied those he collected. Her counterpart Dr Jane Francis is the Director of the British Antarctic Survey, and has actually been to the frozen continent; she\u2019s even worked on the same deposits as Marie.<br><br>Professor Nicky Milner of the University of York works on one the most important post-Ice Age site in Europe: Star Carr, in Yorkshire. Her research is redefining our understanding of this period, just as Dorothy Garrod did for near Eastern cultures of a similar age.</p> <p>Jacquetta Hawkes spent a lifetime mixing archaeology with history, art, and film; the author of visionary literature (A Land), she was a multimedia master of science communication. In the 21st century, Dr Colleen Morgan\u2019s career has already explored the fuzzy edges between archaeology and contemporary cultural media such as photographic practice, and she worked on the re-creation of a Neolithic village inside the hugely popular MMORPG Second Life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8b19a9f9734513fd0dc8aa06e963c47eed542d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8b19a9f9734513fd0dc8aa06e963c47eed542d7/0_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tori Herridge and Chris Church shooting the crowdfunding film at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.

The more we raise, the more people we can reach- if we double our target, we can take the exhibition on a national tour, organise even more events and expand the interview archive.</p> <p>Role models are not the only answer to the geosciences\u2019 diversity problem, but they matter, and if we want to fix this, we need to think seriously about the face we are presenting to the rest of the world.

  "<p>Pep Guardiola had been asked on Tuesday how he might stop Lionel Messi. The Manchester City manager simply laughed. There is no way to stop one of the all\u2011time greats, as Guardiola himself knows better than most from his four years in charge at Barcelona, and the Argentina international re\u2011emphasised the point to make this a difficult homecoming for his former manager.</p> <p>Messi\u2019s hat-trick came courtesy of three sumptuous swipes of that left foot and the latest statistic to laud his genius shows that he now has 16 goals in 15 games against English clubs. In truth he has been punishing all-comers for as long as anybody can care to remember. This was the 37th hat-trick of Messi\u2019s career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/barcelona-manchester-city-champions-league-pep-guardiola\">Pep Guardiola pays the price for keeping Sergio Ag\u00fcero from the reunion | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardiola felt this daunting assignment would offer a gauge of the progress of his City team and there were some positives for him to take. He was extremely adventurous with his tactics, which took in the headline decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/barcelona-manchester-city-champions-league-pep-guardiola\" title=\"\">omit Sergio Ag\u00fcero from the starting XI</a>, in an attempt to get an extra body in midfield and he watched his players work the Barcelona goalkeeper, Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, on a number of occasions.</p> <p>There were spells when City imposed themselves while the shots-on-target count was only eight to six in Barcelona\u2019s favour. And yet Guardiola was damned by the final scoreline and there would be the inevitable questions about the wisdom of the decision to introduce Ag\u00fcero with only 11 minutes to go \u2013 in other words, when the game was gone. Barcelona had lost two of their key defenders in Jordi Alba and Gerard Piqu\u00e9 to injuries in the first half and it was tempting to wonder how Ag\u00fcero might have troubled what became a makeshift back-line.</p> <p>In the end, though, City were undone by errors. There was Fernandinho\u2019s slip that ushered in Messi for his first goal and the loose pass from Ilkay G\u00fcndogan that found only Luis Su\u00e1rez, who laid on Messi\u2019s third. But the most horrible mistake was the 52nd minute one from Claudio Bravo, which led to the goalkeeper\u2019s red card. Up until that point City were in the game. After it they were taken apart.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s fingerprints are all over this City team already and it was noticeable how keen they were to play short and cutely. It was Barcelona who were prepared to be direct. Bravo\u2019s downfall stemmed from his attempt to make a little pass to Fernandinho, after he had left his penalty area and he got it all wrong. The ball went straight to Su\u00e1rez and Bravo\u2019s next mistake was when he instinctively saved Su\u00e1rez\u2019s subsequent attempted lob with his hands, while still outside the box. The referee, Milorad Mazic, had no option but to send him off.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s tactical nuances underscored the occasion. His starting formation could best be described as 4-1-4-1 but, when City had the ball, Pablo Zabaleta, the right-back, stepped up and inside into midfield, alongside Fernandinho. John Stones, the central defender, too, was encouraged to step up and so were the more advanced central midfielders, G\u00fcndogan and David Silva.</p> <p>It felt as though long spells were spent in an attempt to decode it all, and the ever-evolving formations served to ask questions of Luis Enrique. Then again the Barcelona manager had Messi and that is some comfort. Remember what Indiana Jones did when confronted by the bad guy who wielded his swords so dramatically? He just shot him. Here Messi shot Guardiola.</p> <p>The opening goal owed everything to Fernandinho\u2019s slip, because he was the favourite to get to the ball before Messi, after it had squirted loose following Stones\u2019s challenge on Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. Guardiola\u2019s approach was utterly meticulous but he cannot be relied on to check whether his players are wearing the correct studs. Messi\u2019s finish was marked by class and composure.</p> <p>Barcelona had chances in the first half to add to their lead. Su\u00e1rez found the side-netting with a shot; Ivan Rakitic headed over from Messi\u2019s free-kick and Bravo had to back-pedal, leap and tip over his own crossbar, after he had only half-saved a shot from Su\u00e1rez.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/arsenal-ludogorets-razgrad-champions-league-match-report\">Mesut \u00d6zil scores Arsenal hat-trick and S\u00e1nchez chips in to beat Ludogorets 6-0</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But City, too, had their moments in a purple patch before the interval; flashes when they got in behind Barcelona. Guardiola could enjoy a dividend from his elaborate attempts to win space. Silva played in Nolito and Ter&#xa0;Stegen had to make a regulation save, and minutes later the Barcelona goalkeeper was extended fully by G\u00fcndogan, after he had skipped past Piqu\u00e9. In first\u2011half stoppage time Stones headed wide of the near post from Silva\u2019s free\u2011kick. It was a glaring miss.</p> <p>The tie turned sharply after the red card. Messi scored his second when he jinked and threaded a low shot into the corner from the edge of the area and the hat-trick followed G\u00fcndogan\u2019s aberration and Su\u00e1rez\u2019s assist. Neymar added the fourth, after dancing and shooting inside the area, having earlier seen a penalty saved by City\u2019s substitute goalkeeper, Willy Caballero. It had been awarded after a burst from Messi \u2013 who else? \u2013 was crudely halted by the sliding Aleksandar Kolarov.</p> <p>For City there were further flickers. Kevin De Bruyne and Kolarov extended Ter Stegen but by then it was too late. The Barcelona substitute J\u00e9r\u00e9my Mathieu\u2019s dismissal for a second yellow card on 73 minutes was a footnote.

She said the card had arrived on Thursday, two days after her partner was killed. <br></p> <p>\u201cI have just received the most heart breaking card from my lovely Jamal this morning. Words will never describe how myself and his family is feeling. Forever loved, forever in our hearts,\u201d she wrote. </p> <p>Inside the card Mahmoud had written that he had \u201cunconditional love\u201d for her and their son, adding \u201cwithout you I don\u2019t think I couldn\u2019t have come this far. You make everything easy for me every single day.\u201d</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cYou are a strong minded individual person and I\u2019m proud to say that my son has the best mother in the world. You have grown to become a mature woman and I hope I can make you proud by becoming a better man and father to both of you. Love you Baby.\u201d</p> <p>Opposite the message he had drawn a childlike picture of a detached house, with a smiling sun. In front were simple drawings of the three of them together. </p> <p>In an emotional previous post Modeste wrote: \u201cSleep tight my darling Jamal. I miss you, I love you, forever and always.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI miss the amazing head rubs, I miss giving you back rubs, I miss us always going Nandos, I miss sharing a bed with you, I miss waking up to you, I miss the morning kisses \u2026 I miss us talking about having another baby in the future, I miss us planning to get our marriage registered, I miss going for walks with you, I miss holding your hand. I miss you.\u201d</p> <p>The family of Mahmoud, who was of Somali descent, have called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/pentonville-prison-knife-attack-second-inmate-arrested\">Pentonville to be shut down</a>. <br></p> <p>Aisha Salah, Mahmoud\u2019s cousin, told the BBC: \u201cI blame the prison. It\u2019s very disturbing. I just hope that place gets shut down as soon as possible because it\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the attack, about half of the 200 prison officers at the jail passed a vote of no confidence in its governor, Kevin Reilly.<br></p> <p>The officers claim they are unable to prevent the influx of weapons and drugs being thrown over the prison walls while also monitoring prisoners, BBC London reported. </p> <p>It is understood that they have insisted on talks with the deputy governor about reducing the number of inmates allowed in the yard at the same time and increasing the number of staff on prison landings.</p> <p>John Attard, from the Prison Governors Association, said the death had come as \u201cno massive surprise\u201d and added that the PGA had called for a public inquiry a week earlier. </p> <p>Speaking outside the prison gates following the attack, Attard said: \u201cThe reduction in staffing is a key factor, there\u2019s no doubt about that, but synthetic drugs also had some part in that. What we would like to see is a regime that can be managed safely with the right number of staff.\u201d</p> <p>Mahmoud was jailed for six and a half years in July as one of two gang members sentenced after hiding a loaded Skorpion machine gun and ammunition in a garden in Enfield, north London, the previous July. He was already serving five and a half years in prison for a separate robbery. </p> <p>Following his killing his sister, Souzan Mahmoud, said: \u201cYou think your brother is in safe hands, you know, and to hear that he had to die that way, alone, where we thought he would be safe, it really hurts us. Everyone is in pieces, as you can see.\u201d<br></p> <p>Speaking to ITV News, she said: \u201cThe case ended a long time ago. Why was he still there [at Pentonville]? He should have been shipped out a long time ago.</p> <p>\u201cWe just thought the guards would be there \u2026 I blame the prison more than the actual person that\u2019s done it. They owed him a duty of care and they just neglected him.

I can\u2019t ever forget, never ever, my son.\u201d</p> <p>Danny Rynne, a scaffolder from Enfield, described Mahmoud as \u201clovely\u201d and \u201cplacid\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame what happened.

  "<p>When Prentiss Mayo showed up to traffic court on 19 October 2015, he tried to explain that he was blind and that his impairment affected his case. </p> <p>Judge Taylor Culver wasn\u2019t having it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe any of it,\u201d Culver said repeatedly in his Oakland, California, courtroom before he ordered Mayo to pay a $221 fine on fare evasion charges.

You really got style. It\u2019s all lies. Sit over there on the right-hand side of the courtroom.\u201d</p> <p>Mayo, 34, was stunned to hear the mockery and asked again where he should go.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find it,\u201d Culver replied.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so embarrassed in my whole life,\u201d Mayo said in a recent interview, explaining that he lost his vision after a stabbing attack. \u201cIt just really felt like he denied my whole experience.\u201d</p> <p>This week, Culver, who some attorneys say is one of the cruelest traffic judges in the state, was accused of \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d by the California commission on judicial performance.

[Culver] seemed like a person who was angry with the world ... and took it out on the people who appeared before him.\u201d</p> <p>Culver is facing 10 counts in the misconduct case, including charges that he is \u201cunfit to serve\u201d and that he is \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d.</p> <p>In one case, Culver screamed \u201cKeep your mouth shut!\u201d at a female defendant, according to the complaint. He then allegedly threatened to \u201cfight\u201d her, saying: \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have this robe on. We would straighten it out.\u201d</p> <p>In another case, a man pleaded for leniency for running a red light and driving without a license, saying that he has a \u201cbig family\u201d and couldn\u2019t pay the $1,043 fine. Culver mocked him in his response, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna let you break the law, walk out \u2019cause you made a bunch of kids.\u201d</p> <p>Culver told one man accused of \u201creversing his vehicle in an unsafe manner\u201d that he \u201cbetter be quiet\u201d, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t make me put you through door number two.\u201d This apparent threat to jail him was an \u201cabuse\u201d of power, the charges alleged.</p> <p>When one woman tried to present photo evidence, the judge responded: \u201cMa\u2019am, now you gonna keep runnin\u2019 your mouth, I\u2019m gonna have to call somebody to have this dealt with.\u201d</p> <p>The complaint also revealed that Culver repeatedly implied that police are always right and defendants are generally lying, regardless of evidence. That\u2019s a problem that critics say is pervasive in traffic courts where, unlike criminal court, defendants do not have a right to a public defender.</p> <p>In one dispute over a charge of failing to come to a full stop, Culver told a defendant: \u201cI\u2019m interested in why a cop would put his career on the line to lie about you.\u201d </p> <p>Culver also scolded an Asian woman for saying \u201csorry\u201d in English when she had an interpreter: \u201cWhy you talking about \u2018sorry\u2019? You got an interpreter. Cut it out. Use the interpreter like I told you.\u201d</p> <p>When fines are more than $1,000, Culver has consistently refused to let defendants do community service instead of paying, regardless of their income, the charges said. One day in court, prior to arraignments, he told a group of defendants: \u201cDon\u2019t waste any time talking about your drama \u2019cause nobody in here cares about it. There\u2019s nobody special in here but me.\u201d</p> <p>The judge is also accused of making inappropriate sexual remarks, allegedly talking about \u201ckissing\u201d staff and joking about his \u201cability to sustain an erection\u201d.</p> <p>Culver did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyer, Arthur Harris, told the Guardian that the judge \u201cdisputes the charges\u201d, adding: \u201cHe looks forward to a full, fair and impartial hearing to respond to those allegations.\u201d </p> <p>Although Culver\u2019s language may be unique, advocates said his actions reflect unfair policies that are common throughout the system.</p> <p>\u201cTaylor Culver said out loud what many judges are unfortunately putting into practice, which is: \u2018The court needs money and therefore we don\u2019t care whether you can afford to pay this ticket,\u2019\u201d said Elisa Della-Piana, legal director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, who has appeared before the judge.</p> <p>The charges against Culver come more than a year after a local paper, the <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-high-cost-of-driving-while-poor/Content?oid=4269240&amp;showFullText=true\">East Bay Express</a>, published an investigation on the judge. \u201cThere are many courtrooms across California where there is no one watching,\u201d Della-Piana added.</p> <p>While consequences for one judge can have an impact, activists said the system should be overhauled so that the courts can no longer require low-income people to pay steep fines.</p> <p>Last year, one <a href=\"http://ebclc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Not-Just-a-Ferguson-Problem-How-Traffic-Courts-Drive-Inequality-in-California-4.20.15.pdf\">report</a> found that more than 4 million California residents have lost their driver\u2019s licenses because they can\u2019t afford to pay traffic fines and fees. The suspensions make it harder for many to find and maintain employment and keep up with daily responsibilities.</p> <p>\u201cIt puts you in a spiral,\u201d said Brandon Greene, staff attorney with East Bay Community Law Center. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough money, and they can\u2019t pay the debt.\u201d</p> <p>Another recent <a href=\"http://ebclc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Stopped_Fined_Arrested_BOTRCA.pdf\">study</a> also found that the license suspensions are much more common in black and Latino neighborhoods and areas with high poverty rates.</p> <p>Culver\u2019s courtroom was often 90-95% people of color, Neumann said. Without a lawyer, few have a chance of winning a case in front of Culver, he added. \u201cThere was never any sympathy ... and it has genuinely devastating consequences.\u201d</p>",

However, in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/policies-for-election-observers.aspx#access\">at least 40 states</a>, partisan observers must be accredited or appointed. </p> <p>It\u2019s very possible that Trump\u2019s informal observers will be turned away if they haven\u2019t obtained the proper accreditation.</p> <p>Observers are typically allowed to watch the casting of ballots, testing of voting equipment and the counting of the ballots. States generally specify the number of partisan observers allowed at the polling place, how they are appointed and trained, when and where they are allowed to operate and what their responsibilities entail. </p> <p>Monitors are strictly prohibited from interfering with the electoral process, which includes intimidating voters, election officials and poll workers. If an issue arises, observers are allowed to alert the election officials or the authorities. </p> <p>Yet despite Trump\u2019s repeated calls for supporters to register to be poll watchers, there appears to be no real effort underway for them to do so, according to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/politics/donald-trump-voting-election-rigging.html\">New York Times report</a> from this week. Local officials in battleground states told the Times that the numbers of people seeking to be poll watchers are \u201con par\u201d with years past. </p> <h2>What are poll workers?</h2> <p>Poll workers are civically minded recruits or volunteers who agree to give up their election day to work extremely long hours for very little pay. Because election day is on a Tuesday and is not a federal holiday, the job disproportionately attracts retirees and the marginally employed.</p> <p>Each state has a different set of laws and rules governing the selection and eligibility of a poll worker. But in general, they are eligible voters registered in the state where they are stationed. Training is typically offered or required both online and in-person, and workers in some states receive increased pay for having the extra instruction. Poll workers are not expected to be politically agnostic, but they are deployed to stations in a bipartisan manner. </p> <p>A typical day\u2019s work can be 11 or 12 hours, and includes opening and closing the polling stations, issuing ballots to registered voters, registering voters, monitoring the voting equipment or counting votes. Poll workers are typically paid for working election day and afforded a small stipend for meals and travel. </p> <p>US elections suffer from a dearth of volunteers. The shortage can result in longer lines, which can in turn depress voter turnout.</p> <h2>What are observers watching for?</h2> <p>There are several categories of observers, all of whom have different goals. The types of observers include partisan, nonpartisan, nonpartisan international and academics. Trump is specifically asking his supporters to ensure that election officials do not disadvantage his campaign. </p> <p>Nonpartisan observers are typically focused on ensuring integrity and transparency in the electoral process and should not have a stake in the outcome of the election. If carried out properly, these observers can provide useful feedback to improve election procedures going forward. </p> <p>Many poll watchers consider themselves voter rights activists,<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-monitors-arent-trump-thinks_us_57bcae40e4b03d51368b46b6\"> there to help prevent</a> instances of disenfranchisement \u2013 intentional and unintentional. In an essay for the Huffington Post, a poll monitor in California said instances of alleged voter fraud are incredibly rare. The most common problems watchers observe are related to a poll worker\u2019s failure to provide proficient translation or requiring a voter show ID that is not required. </p> <h2>What is voter fraud?</h2> <p>Voter fraud is committed when there is a deliberate interference with the election process. Examples of this include casting more than one ballot, voting under the name of a deceased person, casting a ballot by a felon who is not eligible to vote, registering to vote as a fictional person or someone else, impersonating another voter or manipulating the ballots by election officials. </p> <h2>Is voter fraud rampant? </h2> <p>Americans are sharply divided along mostly partisan lines about the extent to which voter fraud is committed. Conservatives have long alleged voter fraud is widespread and that preventing it is paramount to preserving the integrity of the election process. Yet critics note that many of the measures designed to reduce voter fraud and passed by Republican legislatures disproportionately impact poor and minority voters.</p> <p>Furthermore, research indicates that instances of voter fraud are relatively rare, and that claims of widespread voter fraud are greatly exaggerated. A <a href=\"http://votingrights.news21.com/interactive/election-fraud-database/\">News21 investigation</a> found just 2,068 cases of alleged election fraud between the years 2000 and 2011, when the report was published. Similarly, an investigation by Justin Levitt of the Loyola Law School found even fewer instances of voter fraud:<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\"> just 31 \u201ccredible\u201d incidents </a>of voter impersonation out of 1bn votes cast between 2000 and 2014.</p> <p>Recent allegations of widespread voter fraud are often misrepresented. Multiple fact checks have debunked accusations of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/12/viral-image/internet-philly-rigged-2012-presidential-election-/\">voter fraud in Philadelphia</a> in 2012. The allegations stemmed from the fact that 100% of voters in 59 zones voted for Obama over Mitt Romney.</p> <p>While some saw the numbers as evidence of foul play, fact checkers deemed it wholly plausible and mathematically possible. The average number of registered voters in these small divisions within Philadelphia is 616, and the average number of registered Republicans in the divisions is 17,<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/12/viral-image/internet-philly-rigged-2012-presidential-election-/\"> according to Politifact</a>. In a 2012 lawsuit over a voter identification, lawyers for the state of Pennsylvania <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/pennsylvania-admits-it-no-voter-fraud-problem/2012/07/24/gJQAHNVt6W_blog.html?utm_term=.e9d6b05d5e06\">conceded</a> that there have been \u201cno investigations or prosecutions of in-person voter fraud in Pennsylvania\u201d. </p> <p>In addition to Philadelphia, Trump has singled out Chicago and St Louis as cities where observers should expect voter fraud. There is no evidence to support that these cities are particularly beset by voter fraud. </p>",

The following month, another conviction, for a lingering aggravated assault charge \u2013 hitting an army sergeant over the head with a bottle at a party \u2013 resulted in an additional three-year sentence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/27/gucci-mane-released-early-from-indiana-prison\" title=\"\">He was released on 26 May this year</a>, and entered into the period of house arrest that ended on 20 September.</p> <p>\u201c[Prison] was one of the best things that ever happened to me, looking back on it,\u201d he tells me, the day before the private party, on an Astroturf-covered balcony at another New York hotel.

The future is looking bright, with new faces in his corner and a new top-five album under his belt, July\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/24/gucci-mane-everybody-looking-review\" title=\"\">Everybody Looking</a>, and a follow-up, Woptober, released on 17 October.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a225334b551bf532585c26cb5fc18e78019e2587\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a225334b551bf532585c26cb5fc18e78019e2587/0_4_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Onstage with Shawty Lo in Atlanta, Georgia, 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Onstage with Shawty Lo in Atlanta, Georgia, 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like regretting,\u201d he says. \u201cAnybody that I ever hurt, if I had the opportunity to apologise to them for doing something out the way to them, I\u2019ve already done that.

So I just keep pushing forward.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a good moment to do it \u2013 the beginning of a new, wholly open-ended period in Gucci\u2019s life. Just two days earlier, he had taken to Instagram to cut off his GPS-monitored ankle bracelet, which had kept him in his pearly walled, palm-tree-studded mansion in suburban Atlanta, or at \u201cwork-related\u201d events in the metropolitan area, since May. He <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/09/22/gucci-mane-celebrates-freedom-drops-10k/\" title=\"\">celebrated by hitting a strip club in midtown Manhattan</a> with his girlfriend Keyshia Ka\u2019oir, Atlanta producer Metro Boomin, and Brooklyn rapper Fabolous. They spent roughly $10,000 in $100 bills and feasted on a triple-decker cake encrusted with 24-carat gold.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anybody that I ever hurt, if I had the opportunity to apologise to them, I\u2019ve already done that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite the fact that the only beverages Gucci touches are coffee and water, he seemed to savour every minute of the experience. \u201cI love just going to the club and listening to music, seeing what people vibe to,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was just watching. How do people move? What\u2019s the new hot song? It was kind of like a research thing \u2013 intel. I\u2019m kind of out of the loop.\u201d</p> <p>Being on house arrest didn\u2019t cut him off entirely, though. In addition to recording and shooting music videos, he was allowed to perform at the BET awards, and at the Atlanta leg of Drake\u2019s sold-out Summer Sixteen tour \u2013 invitations that demonstrate the surprisingly warm welcome-home he has had from the hip-hop community at large. Drake \u2013 a passing target in Gucci\u2019s Twitter rant \u2013 was an early post-prison visitor, swinging by the house with a new song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0NkO7GtMQ4\" title=\"\">Back on Road</a>, all ready for Gucci\u2019s verses.</p> <p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Gucci says, gratefully \u2013 then, matter-of-factly: \u201cAnyone who say they ain\u2019t a fan of Drake\u2019s music is lying.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOmsxhn6F90\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pOmsxhn6F90?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>An even more unexpected gesture came from Kanye West, who emailed Gucci for a verse for the GOOD Music posse track Champions the week he got out. West returned the favour by guesting on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyeWk8J3uvs\" title=\"\">Pussy Print</a>, a particularly seedy highlight on Everybody Looking. Outkast also contacted Gucci recently about getting permission to use an old verse of his, but he has little insight as to why.</p> <p>That Gucci is making these kinds of connections shouldn\u2019t be that surprising. His swaggering and unrepentant variety of Atlanta trap music \u2013 trap refers to where drug deals are made and the difficulty of escaping the dealing life \u2013 has only cast a wider shadow since his incarceration. There is the growing influence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/12/future-rap-rock-hendrix-honest\" title=\"\">Future</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/young-thug-hits-bring-money-lil-wayne\" title=\"\">Young Thug</a>, two former Gucci proteges turned superstars, and the unprecedented success of crossover acts from beyond Atlanta, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\" title=\"\">Fetty Wap</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/16/travis-scott-hip-hop-critics\" title=\"\">Travi$ Scott</a>. Today, even Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9 integrate Gucciesque stop-and-start rhythmic cadences into their vocal lines, collaborating with one of his go-to producers, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbEoRnaOIbs\" title=\"\">Mike Will Made It</a>.</p> <p>While in prison, Gucci followed musical trends as best he could. Some developments surprised him: \u201cThere was a lot of reggae and Caribbean-vibe music \u2013 it\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s not really my zone.\u201d He heard some emerging trap stars he liked; soon after returning to Georgia, he sent a verse to his favourite, Florida\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_mWyjJQxWg\" title=\"\">Kodak Black</a>, for the 19-year-old rapper\u2019s Lil Big Pac mixtape. Gucci\u2019s biggest source of creative inspiration, though, was hearing the new types of beats his favourite producers were making.</p> <p>\u201cI would hear Mike Will do tracks with [Atlanta rap duo] Rae Sremmurd and be like: \u2018Damn, that hard,\u2019\u201d Gucci says. \u201cI\u2019d be writing stuff in there thinking what I would have matched to that.\u201d He scribbled down phrases on scraps of paper, and when possible, left verses as voicemails for his oldest and most trusted producer, Zaytoven; eventually, this material would become the backbone for Everybody Looking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c2529b2dd6651cb87b94d60910193cb6cda1040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c2529b2dd6651cb87b94d60910193cb6cda1040/0_0_3000_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Snoop Dogg at the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"823\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Snoop Dogg at the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paras Griffin/BET/Getty Images for BET</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once home, Gucci quickly established a routine based on working out two or three times a day, eating right \u2013 \u201ca lot of seafood, cut out beef and pork,\u201d he suggests \u2013 spending time with Ka\u2019oir, and logging long hours in the studio. Gucci estimates that he has recorded between 80 and 100 songs since May \u2013 he tries to knock out four or five in a session, working exclusively with in-house producers who can draft a beat within his preferred timeframe: five to 10 minutes. That productvity meant that no sooner had Woptober been released than he was able to announce yet another new album, The Return of East Atlanta Santa, to be released on 16 December.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got two studios in the house, so we\u2019ll just be bouncing back ideas. They\u2019ll get on the keyboard and I\u2019ll just start brainstorming, or matching a melody. I\u2019m just throwing out topics, and they\u2019ll be like: \u2018That was slick, what you just said.\u2019 I want it to go somewhere that I don\u2019t even know where it\u2019s gonna go. I don\u2019t like to catch the vibe of the beat you send me \u2013 let\u2019s go ahead and make it from scratch. When we look back on it, it\u2019s like two different people didn\u2019t even make it. It\u2019s more fun for me like that.\u201d</p> <p>Gucci is unclear what his next musical move will be after The Return of East Atlanta, but he doesn\u2019t seem too concerned about it. For him, the journey is more important than the destination; whatever else is true, making music feels better to him than ever before. \u201cBack when I was always high, I was numb,\u201d Gucci explains. \u201cI\u2019d go in there, and if I did good, it was still just routine. But now, I can feel it \u2013 it\u2019s exciting again, like: \u2018Damn, I crushed that shit.\u2019 Back then, you\u2019d send me a bunch of beats and it was like clockwork.\u201d</p> <p>After the dinner at Dirty French, Gucci heads to Up and Down, an upscale club in Chelsea, to perform a short set. The highlight is 2009\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wBOiO5ptJk\" title=\"\">Wasted</a>, the fratboy-slang-flipping anthem that remains the biggest hit of Gucci\u2019s career. Hearing him rap lines from a perspective so remote from his current one (\u201cRockstar lifestyle, might don\u2019t make it / Living life high, every day clique wasted\u201d) is odd and cathartic \u2013 a reminder of what an amazing, varied and contradictory career he has already had in just more than a decade. At the time of the song\u2019s release, the rapper was churning out more mixtapes than anyone could keep track of, and courting mass commercial appeal while preparing to release his new studio album, The State vs Radric Davis. But that same month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/03/gucci-mane-arrested-traffic-violations\" title=\"\">Gucci would disappear for six months on a parole violation charge</a>, breaking a momentum he would never be able to regain.</p> <p>But revisiting old music seems to revitalise Gucci, not depress him; he likes to listen to it when he works out or drives. That store of memories will likely be a helpful resource for him while putting the finishing touches on the autobiography he wrote in prison \u2013 \u201ca story of resilience,\u201d he says \u2013 that Simon &amp; Schuster is likely to publish next year.</p> <p>\u201cI never wrote anything down, so you can just hear how [the songs are] all over the place,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look back, but it\u2019s good to reminisce \u2013 like a history book. Like: \u2018This is how I was at 26, I was wild.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to go through that no more, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p> <p><em>Everbody Looking and Woptober are out now on Atlantic.</em></p>",

Economies that are dependent on a single city hub are less resilient to global economic shocks. A regional visa system could facilitate and promote economic development outside of London,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Immigration has been a key part of the Brexit debate. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">raised the idea of companies disclosing the proportion of foreigners they employ</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cBy allowing the regions to control immigration this will recognise the fact that the needs of London and Yorkshire will differ dramatically. Whilst all regions will have to adhere to the same overall requirement criteria set by the Home Office they will be allowed to control the numbers of migrants and the skills they require for their region,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>It is not clear what visa regime will apply to EU workers after Brexit, but the report said that if the current visa system was applied around three-quarters of Britain\u2019s EU workforce would not meet these requirements. This could have an impact on the City of London \u2013 where 32% of the workforce is international, with 12% hailing from Europe. It would also affect healthcare, agriculture and construction.</p> <p>Australia and Canada are seen as the most relevant comparisons for a UK regional visa. The report said: \u201cBoth countries designed their systems to attract migrants to help combat problems of sparsely populated regions and declining populations. Whilst we acknowledge that a post-Brexit visa system will have different motivations, the mechanisms and lessons are relevant, as these relate to tying migration to particular area needs.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Australia uses a regional sponsored migration scheme where a three-year visa is granted for workers sponsored by employers. Canada has a four-year programme where employers are able to hire from abroad when they have not been able to recruit at home.</p> <p>The UK could adopt two types of visas \u2013 a 12-month visa for those recruited to fill a skills shortage or one for six years to fill a permanent role that could also lead to permanent residency after five years. Individuals entering the UK on the longer term visa would be permitted to purchase property in the area where they had been granted permission to work.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a London solution to a national problem, but actually something that can support growth outside of the capital across a wide variety of sectors,\u201d said Mark Boleat, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation. </p>",
  "<p>Colorado poll workers are now being trained on how to respond to a mass shooting at the voting booths. </p> <p>Election officials in Denver and Aurora have added the trainings to their roster of staff preparation this year, and other areas across the state and the country may follow. </p> <p>\u201cThis is something we pay a lot of attention to in Colorado, because of the terrible experiences that we\u2019ve had,\u201d Matt Crane, the county clerk who oversees elections in Arapahoe County, said. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re as prepared as possible.\u201d </p> <p>Colorado has seen some of the country\u2019s worst mass shootings, including the July 2012 massacre at a movie theater screening of The Dark Knight Rises, and the 1999 school shooting at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/columbine\">Columbine high school</a>. The state also had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/14/colorado-arapahoe-high-school-karl-pierson\">school shooting at Arapahoe high school</a> in 2013 and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/09/colorado-springs-planned-parenthood-shooting-robert-lewis-dear-court\">attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic</a> in Colorado Springs in 2015. </p> <p>\u201cThis campaign year has been very interesting, to say the least,\u201d Crane said. \u201cThe rhetoric has been a little raised from other years. I just think in today\u2019s day and age, it\u2019s better to send your people out as prepared as possible, as opposed to waiting for something to happen, and then you train them.\u201d </p> <p>Poll workers are prepped to deal with a variety of potential disasters, including fires, water main problems and electrical outages. Adding mass shooting training to that list \u201cis not a typical practice across the country,\u201d said Matthew Masterson, the vice-chair of the federal Election Assistance Commission. </p> <p>But, Masterson added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the first I\u2019ve heard of that.\u201d <strong> </strong></p> <p>In Denver, poll workers will complete an online module on how to respond to active shootings, Amber McReynolds, the director of elections, said. In previous years, some election staff have received in-person training on mass shootings, but this year \u201cthe active shooter training is required for all the election judges that will be in the field,\u201d McReynolds said. The training module was repurposed from an local government active shooter training. </p> <p>Denver has not received any specific threats, McReynolds said. </p> <p>In Arapahoe County, where Aurora is located, poll workers will now trained in person by the sheriff\u2019s department on \u201cactive threat protocols\u201d.</p> <p>This includes how to respond to an active shooter: evacuate if you can, hide or lockdown if evacuation is not possible, and confront the shooter only as a last resort.</p> <p>Learning how to monitor for strange behavior is another part of the training: \u201cWe give them a list of things to look for,\u201d Crane said. </p> <p>Crane said that Denver and Aurora were sharing overviews of their plans with other counties across the state. <br></p> <p>In Philadelphia, election commissioner Lisa Deeley said the commission might discuss the issue of mass shootings with law enforcement officers, and then consider measures the commission might take. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the many things that we are contemplating prior to election day,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that we have to hash out, and it\u2019s a new unfortunate reality that we have to think about these things.\u201d <br></p> <p>Election officials in some other states said they do not have any shooting trainings. </p> <p>In St Louis, Missouri, \u201cthe security is basically provided by the St Louis police department,\u201d said Erv Switzer, the chair of the St Louis board of elections commissioners. The department assigns officers to a special election detail, and those officers \u201cwill be at numerous locations in a roving manner,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In Louisiana, election officials did not have active shooter trainings for poll workers, said Meg Caspar, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana secretary of state\u2019s office, and they were not anticipating any violence at the polls. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a swing state,\u201d Caspar said. </p>",

  "<p>For a manager who is commonly thought to be incapable of building a dynasty Jos\u00e9 Mourinho left a remarkably durable legacy in his first spell at Chelsea. Neither party, it seemed, could ever quite let go. Even as late as 2012-13 Mourinho was referring to Chelsea\u2019s squad as \u201cmy players\u201d which, to an extent, they were.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/antonio-conte-ngolo-kante-chelsea-leicester\">Antonio Conte at a loss to explain why N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 left Leicester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Managers as diverse as Carlo Ancelotti and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas could not escape the Mourinho blueprint. One of the great ironies of Roman Abramovich\u2019s first decade as Chelsea owner is that his relationship with Mourinho soured as he began to sign un-Mourinho-like players and yet, once he had gone, he continued to follow the Mourinho formula. Chelsea\u2019s eventual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/19/bayern-munich-chelsea-champions-league-final\">victory in the 2012 Champions League</a> came after victories over Barcelona and Bayern Munich that, from a tactical point of view, were almost like parodies of Mourinho schema.</p> <p>And then, just as Rafa Ben\u00edtez seemed to have broken the spell, just as he had ended the dependence on the old guard, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/03/jose-mourinho-confirmed-chelsea-manager\">Mourinho returned</a>. It was like Heathcliff taking control of Wuthering Heights once again. There was one glorious high and then a second, crushing end to the affair.</p> <p>Perhaps Mourinho\u2019s influence will not prove so enduring second time round \u2013 although given the way the Stamford Bridge crowd turned on the \u201crats\u201d who had supposedly betrayed him and chanted his name after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/17/chelsea-sack-jose-mourinho\">his sacking last season</a>, it is safe to assume he will receive a warm welcome on Sunday when he visits in charge of Manchester United. Perhaps the knowledge of how badly the second attempt turned out will stifle any enthusiasm to try for a third time. Perhaps the sight of him in the arms of another Premier League club will dull the ardour. But even if the grip of Mourinho proves less persistent this time round, Antonio Conte\u2019s first major task is to move the club on, to make sure they \u2013 players, directors and fans \u2013 are committed to him and not always pining for a former manager.</p> <p>In one sense it should be easier. Not only does Conte have boundless energy and a potent charisma but this group of players has nothing like the affection for Mourinho that Frank Lampard, Petr Cech, Michael Ballack and Didier Drogba did. Even John Terry\u2019s relationship with Mourinho seemed to have cooled by the time Mourinho departed last December. Conte is unlikely to find many of his present squad in regular text conversations with their former manager.</p> <p>But on a broader level the problem remains. Mourinho may have ended up complaining about recruitment at the club \u2013 it was fairly clear what he was talking about in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/03/jose-mourinho-chelsea-sack-best-manager-southampton\">nine-minute soliloquy after the defeat by Southampton</a> \u2013 but this is still a squad built to his template.</p> <p>The players Conte inherited had been assembled to play either a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1, with the back four sitting deep. Previous attempts to introduce a high line, most notably under Villas-Boas, had faltered, largely because of Terry. His performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/29/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league1\">the 5-3 home defeat by Arsenal in October 2011</a> was a case study in the dangers of asking a defender who lacks pace and is slow on the turn to operate high up the pitch.</p> <p>Yet Terry remains, by some distance, Chelsea\u2019s best natural defender. In fact, in a world in which defensive defenders are rare, he is still, even at 35, one of the best handful of centre-backs in the league from a defensive point of view. The problem is that Conte, at Siena, at Juventus and with Italy, has always favoured a high line. That was what made the decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/john-terry-chelsea-new-contract\">to give Terry a one-year contract extension</a> so intriguing.</p> <p>Conte began the season trying to compromise, using the 4-2-3-1 that had been bequeathed to him. The side he sent out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/15/chelsea-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\">against West Ham on the opening weekend</a> featured only one change from the team Mourinho had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/08/chelsea-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">sent out against Swansea</a> on the opening weekend last season. But after the draw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/swansea-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">at Swansea</a> and the defeats by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/16/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal</a> \u2013 and the shambolic 4-2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/leicester-city-chelsea-efl-cup-third-round-match-report\">League Cup win over Leicester</a> \u2013 he has returned to what he knows best.</p> <p>With Terry injured he has turned to a back three, using Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso as wing-backs. It is not clear whether there is any place in such a structure for Terry, who spoke after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/oct/12/newsstory.englandfootballteam\">England\u2019s 2-0 defeat by Croatia in 2006</a> of his dislike of playing in a back three \u2013 which Steve McClaren had misguidedly implemented that night. What is clear, though, is that performances have improved significantly, albeit only in wins over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/01/hull-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Hull</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/chelsea-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester</a>.</p> <p>Chelsea\u2019s back three, in its present guise, feels like a temporary solution, something Conte has patched together from imperfect materials. If they perform well against United that perception may change. But that Conte has made the shift at all is significant. This is a key step in placing his own stamp on the club. Recruitment towards his vision, presumably, will follow.</p> <p>And, of course, there could be few better ways for Conte to assert himself than to vanquish his predecessor on Sunday \u2013 particularly if he does it with a team set up in what is recognisably his way.</p>",
  "<p>The government\u2019s refusal to release secret advice about the legality of British drone strikes in Syria is to be challenged by a human rights group.</p> <p>Rights Watch UK is appealing against a decision by the information commissioner that the Cabinet Office and the attorney general\u2019s office should not be obliged to publish the document.</p> <p>Without publication of the legal justification, it is argued, public debate over the policy of carrying out lethal attacks on UK nationals anywhere in the world will remain uninformed.</p> <p>The dispute follows a series of drone attacks in Syria. Two Britons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/21/briton-reyaad-khan-believed-killed-air-strike-islamic-state-syria\">Reyaad Khan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/uk-drone-strikes-murder-charges-clarify-legal-basis-targeted-kill-policy-isis\">Ruhul Amin</a>, were killed in targeted strikes near the Syrian city of Raqqa on 21 August 2015. </p> <p>David Cameron, then the prime minister, told the Commons shortly afterwards that the attack was carried out on the grounds of self defence because the men were planning attacks in the UK.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/jihadi-john-definitely-killed-syria-raqqa-dead\">death of Mohammed Emwazi,</a> the British-born militant nicknamed Jihadi John who appeared in Isis beheading videos, last November was also attributed to a joint US/UK airstrike.</p> <p>Earlier this week, parliament\u2019s influential joint committee on human rights (JCHR) criticised the government for refusing to explain how targets are selected, whether there was an \u201cimpossibility of capture\u201d test and whether the laws of war were being misapplied outside recognised armed conflicts.</p> <p>The JCHR\u2019s chair, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said: \u201cThe government has chosen not to answer the most important questions raised by our [committee] concerning its understanding of the legal framework which governs the use of lethal drone strikes outside armed conflict. </p> <p>\u201cIt is simply not good enough for the government to refuse to answer this on the grounds that it is a hypothetical question, when in the course of our inquiry it stated that it would be prepared to resort to such use of lethal force for counter-terrorism purposes even outside of armed conflict. </p> <p>\u201cParliament is entitled to expect an explanation of the government\u2019s view of the legal justification for such a use of force before it happens, rather than wait until it does.\u201d</p> <p>Rights Watch UK submitted a freedom of information request in September last year seeking publication of the advice the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, gave on the legality of the Khan and Amin strikes.</p> <p>Both the attorney general\u2019s office and the Cabinet Office declined to release the information. The information commissioner upheld their decisions in August.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/08/human-rights-group-legal-action-uk-government-syria-isis-drone-strike\">Rights Watch UK</a> said there was a disparity between the two departments\u2019 responses: the Cabinet Office said it should be entirely secret, the attorney general\u2019s officials said that only part of it needs to be withheld. </p> <p>Yasmine Ahmed, executive director of Rights Watch UK, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s refusal to clarify its position on the use of lethal force outside armed conflict on the basis that this is \u2018hypothetical\u2019 is a disingenous attempt to evade the crucial question \u2013 one which has profound ramifications for international law and human lives.</p> <p>\u201cThe question lingers as to whether the government is following in the failed footsteps of the United States, reserving the right to kill its citizens outside declared war zones. This would reflect a radical reinterpretation of their international legal obligations \u2013 chipping away at long established constraints on the use of lethal force and creating a dangerous global precedent. </p> <p>\u201cThe public has a right to know what the government is doing in their name, particularly when it involves a significant departure in the use of lethal force that could have implications for the security of the United Kingdom if other countries adopt a similar position.\u201d</p> <p>Appearing before the justice select committee last autumn, Wright acknowledged it was important in such exceptional circumstances that MPs should know that legal advice had been given, but he insisted its precise content could not be revealed.</p> <p>Asked why, Wright said: \u201cIn part, it\u2019s an obligation to ensure that legal advice taken by the government is as full and frank as it can be \u2026 It\u2019s also important to take collective responsibility under cabinet government.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office said: \u201cThe ICO upheld our decision not to disclose the information to Rights Watch as it was related to, or received from, one of a number of bodies which deal with security matters. We are pleased the ICO upheld our decision.\u201d<br></p>",

The government needed quick revenue, which could be generated through agricultural concessions, and jobs for unemployed youth, who could become a major security threat. </p> <p>Post-war Liberia was also a fertile ground for policy experiments by multilaterals, law and business professors, and consultants hired by the likes of businessman George Soros and Tony Blair \u2013 whose <a href=\"mailto:http://www.africagovernance.org/what-we-do/liberia\">Africa Governance Initiative</a> works to build capacity in government ministries \u2013 names that brought status and donor dollars.</p> <p>\u201cWe had some of the best advice in the world,\u201d says Richard Tolbert, former head of the National Investment Commission, the country\u2019s investment promotion agency.

For the government, which had never legally acknowledged indigenous rights to land, this was the way things were done. \u201cWe made a mistake by not involving local communities,\u201d said Tolbert \u201cWe\u2019ve learned our lesson.\u201d<br></p> <p>For economists such as Sam Jackson, however, a former Sirleaf ally-turned-critic, the government is merely reproducing the kind of plantation economy that, since the founding of Liberia in the mid-nineteenth century, has enriched elites and led to three decades of conflict.</p> <h2> Communities fight back</h2> <p>GVL, a beneficiary of this push for investment, has faced community opposition.</p> <p>Open doors, fertile soils, high levels of rainfall and large tracts of uncultivated land made Liberia an obvious choice for palm oil companies, says GVL\u2019s CEO David Rothschild. The company\u2019s long-term investment in Liberia, which it says will reach $1.6bn, was signed in 2010 towards the end of Sirleaf\u2019s first term as president \u2013 although GVL declined to comment on how much has been invested in country to date.</p> <p>Its 220,000 hectare concession area spans two counties, including the district of Tarjuowon in Sinoe County (where Panyonnoh works). The company\u2019s lease agreement grants it access to the concession land for 65 years, with the possibility of extending to 98 years. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec2fa264a243d7f3a7decf331cb365a5c18df666\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec2fa264a243d7f3a7decf331cb365a5c18df666/273_129_1326_795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacksonville, Sinoe County, Liberia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacksonville, Sinoe County, Liberia.

A new <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/will-big-plantations-help-liberia-economic-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>, commissioned by Global Witness, claims communities benefited more economically before GVL came, from subsistence farming, hunting and selling charcoal.</p> <p>GVL says the report is \u201cfactually deeply flawed\u201d, that it overstates both incomes from subsistence farming and the percentage of community land under development, and underestimates the benefit palm oil development has brought in terms of local infrastructure. </p> <h2>\u2018The land is our life\u2019</h2> <p>On top of a hill, a short distance away from where Panyonnoh is working, fellow employees throw palm fruit from the company\u2019s first harvest into vats for boiling and refinement. The small, temporary mill where they\u2019re working is framed by the wide skeleton of a much larger mill in the distance, which GVL says will generate jobs and increase the productivity of the plantation. The mill will be finished in late 2017, with other mills expected as the plantation expands.</p> <p>However, the Blogbo-Teh, a community group in the nearby town of Jacksonville, has called for a halt in construction, saying it did not consent to the company using the land, which they say is sacred. GVL says politics is at play and that the Blogbo-Teh represents a minority. It says the alarm was only raised well over a year after the agreement with the Tarjuowon district was signed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6785fbcf3c2c73c9753191ed975b22921feaeb50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6785fbcf3c2c73c9753191ed975b22921feaeb50/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Sworh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Sworh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Cutting/Banyak</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conflict is broader than the mill. Lee Sworh, a Blogbo-Teh activist, wants the company to leave altogether. He\u2019s calling for the whole concession agreement between GVL and the government to be nullified because, he says, there is no consensus. \u201cLet people make decisions for their own land their forefathers left for them, for the land is our treasury, the land is our bank, the land is our life.\u201d</p> <p>Sworh and his family own a sprawling farm in Geetroh, Sinoe County, where GVL is said to be interested in land. \u201cWhen the people come and take this land you will not farm like this any longer, all of these places will be controlled by the investors,\u201d Sworh says. \u201cYou can\u2019t farm here, you will not do anything here. They will plant their palm.\u201d</p> <p>Sworh fears the little independence rural people have will be taken away. Negotiations between GVL and Blogbo-Teh were being mediated by Parley, an NGO focused on land rights disputes, but came to a standstill last year. The company says it is unclear what the community wants or how to move forward. </p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Operations on GVL\u2019s plantation have moved slowly over the past six years, with clearing and planting in only 15% of the designated concession area. This has been in part due to the time it takes for the communities and company to reach agreement.</p> <p>These agreements, often signed with blue inked thumbprints, promise to provide communities benefits such as drinking water, schools and access to clinics, but they aren\u2019t legally binding and have vague timelines for delivery.</p> <p>A land rights bill presented to the legislature almost two years ago, which for the first time would legally recognise customary land rights, could hold the key to disputes around concession areas and empower local communities, says Brandy. But land rights activists are skeptical that the bill will be passed before the presidential and legislative elections in 2017.</p> <p>Rothschild says GVL is in favour of the bill, adding that the company has acknowledged community rights through negotiating directly with the community rather than government. </p> <p>For GVL, the gains for the community from palm oil are tangible, if gradual. \u201cThe history of the industry is such that the first generation goes in as unemployed workers, the children go into the schools, get educated through the school system that we provide, and the next generation become the managers of these farms,\u201d says Rothschild.</p> <p>But workers such as Panyonnoh and his generation, whose lives have been put on hold by conflict and poverty, are growing impatient. They say the company needs to offer more training so they can progress beyond fieldwork. \u201cYou should continue to provide the opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cOther people they are stuck. They are still doing the same thing, still slashing.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Register to attend our seminar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/13/africa-palm-oil-environment-communities-foreign-investment-liberia-cameroon-proforest-olam-rspo-event\">Africa the new palm frontier: can we avoid the mistakes of the past?</a>, in London on 23 November 2016, 6pm-8.30pm (GMT)</li> </ul> <p>This piece was amended on 21 October 2016 to clarify that Richard Tolbert is the former head of the National Investment Commission.</p>",
  "<p>The sixth-wicket pairing came to the rescue once again as England clawed their way to a working total \u2013 258 for seven \u2013 rather than an imposing one on a beguiling day of Test cricket. There was relief when Alastair Cook won the toss, but that emotion did not return until Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow combined to drag the score beyond 200 on a pitch that offered the spinners much more help than expected.</p> <p>These conditions were brilliantly exploited for Bangladesh by Mehedi Hasan, who made a sensational debut. The 18-year-old bowled the second over of the match and finished the day with five for 64 from 33 overs of cleverly crafted off\u2011breaks. Mehedi will be around for a long time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/20/england-moeen-ali-reprieved-bangladesh-mehedi-cricket\">England\u2019s Moeen Ali admits: \u2018Today was the hardest 60 I\u2019ve ever made\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a little known statistic \u2013 except for those within earshot of Test Match Special\u2019s scorer, Andrew Samsom \u2013 that England\u2019s most prolific partnerships throughout the calendar year have been for the sixth wicket. So it was on day one. The average number of runs produced in 2016, albeit aided by 399 runs in Cape Town where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/03/ben-stokes-south-africa-england-jonny-bairstow\" title=\"\">Ben Stokes and Bairstow ran riot</a>, is 84, far higher than any other combination.</p> <p>On Thursday the sixth-wicket pairing of Moeen and Bairstow added a vital 88. These numbers remind us of two things: the virtue of so many all-rounders in the England side and the frailty of their upper order. On Thursday in an innings that began myopically before offering moments of majesty, Moeen oversaw a recovery while Bairstow hungrily gathered runs in the final session until he, too, became a victim of the marvellous Mehedi.</p> <p>In fact the off-spinner is no conjurer. He is a conventional bowler who propels the ball accurately and spins it vigorously. Mehedi calmly took possession of the new ball against England\u2019s debutant, Ben Duckett, and of the two novices he was the one who looked more comfortable with this situation.</p> <p>No doubt Duckett would have preferred something more conventional, some early pace on the ball. Instead he wafted at a 50mph delivery that was his first ball in Test cricket; he hit a couple of boundaries against the relative pace of Shafiul Islam before being bowled by Mehedi, when playing inside the line of an off-break.</p> <p>From the start the young off-spinner found turn on an arid surface; more remarkably he was able to control a shiny new ball with aplomb. His pedigree is suddenly obvious since he had captained Bangladesh\u2019s Under-19s in their past two World Cup campaigns. And they say he can bat as well.</p> <p>Next Alastair Cook was bowled in an undignified manner. He tried to sweep a delivery from Shakib Al Hasan, who had been hastily introduced into the attack; the ball hit Cook\u2019s glove as he overbalanced before plopping on to the stumps. Once Gary Ballance had been given lbw to Hasan after an artful review \u2013 the ball hit Ballance\u2019s pad just before his bat \u2013 England were in some disarray at 21 for three.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59192f1f2cf21646aa8465cb4a991019f37080f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59192f1f2cf21646aa8465cb4a991019f37080f2/46_81_3525_2115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bangladesh v England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moeen Ali of England is caught behind by Mushfiqur Rahim from the bowling of the debutant Mehedi Hasan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joe Root batted masterfully as if this was a routine crisis alongside Moeen, who was much less assured and seemed to be looking for the ball rather than watching it. On either side of lunch he had what must have been a traumatic experience. Three times in the space of six deliveries he was given out lbw by the umpire Kumar Dharmesena when facing Shakib. Each time Moeen opted to review the decision; each time, after what seemed an interminable delay, he was reprieved.</p> <p>This sequence of events capped a frustrating day for Bangladesh when using DRS. On two other occasions they reviewed unsuccessfully against Moeen. Moreover, when he was on one they declined to review a leg\u2011before appeal from Mehedi that TV pictures soon demonstrated had all the right ingredients for dismissal.</p> <p>However, after the interval Bangladesh could celebrate the swift departure of Root, caught at slip via the thigh of the wicketkeeper when fencing at another Mehedi off-break. Soon after Stokes, stuck on the crease, was deceived by a quicker ball from Shakib, which passed through his gate and England were 106 for five.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/20/bangladesh-v-england-first-test-day-one-live\">Bangladesh v England: first Test, day one \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now Moeen found some fluency; he skipped down the pitch to hit Mehedi for six over mid-on and this one stroke seemed to restore his confidence. Along with Bairstow, dropped at slip on 13, the familiar pattern of lower-order restoration of an England innings commenced.</p> <p>Eventually Moeen was defeated by a classic delivery from Mehedi, which just brushed the outside edge of his bat. To save time and to give some respite to the third umpire Sundaram Ravi, who must have been compelled to desert countless cups of tea in the pavilion on the busiest of days, Moeen marched off. Bairstow busily reached his half-century before he, too, was defeated by the young off-spinner. But the increasingly dependable Chris Woakes snatched important runs as dusk approached.</p> <p>On Friday morning England will be hoping to reach beyond 300, which may yet be a good score on this surface perhaps bolstered by the knowledge that for the first time since 1992 all 11 of their players can boast first-class hundreds. Then an intriguing test for England\u2019s triumvirate of spinners awaits. They will do well to match the performance of Mehedi, who began his Test career like a veteran.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cBread or potatoes?\u201d I have sometimes been asked, in reference to which carb I would keep for the rest of my life and which I would lose. For many in my adopted home of the UK, this is a painfully difficult question, but I would choose neither. For me, it\u2019s rice \u2013 always rice. </p> <p>My partner Ana and I share a love of rice. I am Chinese, she is from Portugal; rice is ingrained in our cultures, so it is something of a staple for us both, much how others see bread or potatoes. In northern China, where I grew up, rice is served plain and is very much a vessel for other dishes. Usually medium or short-grained, it is offered at the end of a meal, when you\u2019d typically expect dessert.<br></p> <p>Ana\u2019s first rice memory is of eating her mother\u2019s <em>arroz de cabidela </em>(chicken and blood rice), with its addictive, velvety sauce and topped with plenty of fresh coriander and vinegar. This is a Portuguese classic, and her family ate it whenever her grandparents, who lived in a little village called Azere near the former capital of Coimbra, killed a chicken. When she moved to London, Ana was well-versed in Portuguese rice varieties, like <em>carolino</em> \u2013 used for the wet, loose and saucy rice dishes typical in Portuguese cuisine \u2013 and <em>agulha</em>, a more structured grain akin to basmati used for oven-baked dishes \u2013 but Asian rice was a new world to her, something different altogether. In China, rice is steamed with just enough water, which eventually all evaporates, while the Portuguese way is to boil it in generous quantities of liquid. We often exchange stories, memories and, of course, recipes; and although rice remains a common thread, the types of rice and ways we grew up eating it in Portugal and China are vastly different, as you\u2019d expect.</p> <p>We met in 2009 at Nuno Mendes\u2019s The Loft Project, where people could experience fine dining in a home setting \u2013 probably the first initiative of its kind. Cooking was never the plan for either of us: Ana was a graphic designer \u201cwith the cooking bug\u201d and I\u2019d been studying fine art at Falmouth. It was only when working on a final project that I fell upon Ferran Adria\u2019s Food For Thought: Thought For Food, which totally changed my trajectory. Cooking called us both. Seven years into our friendship, we got together.</p> <p>Our love of rice runs so deep that we decided to build our first project, Tata Eatery, around it, showcasing innovative cooking served over bowls of it. Our food doesn\u2019t belong to any one cuisine, nor is it a Chinese-Portuguese fusion. I\u2019d say it is based loosely on <em>don</em>, the Japanese way of eating bowls of short grain rice \u2013 shiny after cooking, slightly chewy, and full of aroma \u2013 with different types of topping. It\u2019s a mish-mash of everything we\u2019ve been exposed to in the kitchen to date, things we like to eat ourselves: aubergine and rice, rice with seafood (like the two raw fish recipes below), or leftover rice from the night before, fried up for breakfast the following morning. We draw on many influences, but wanted to create a homeliness we feel to be emblematic of traditional Chinese dining \u2013 a table full of little things to be eaten over rice and a meal that brings people together around the table.</p> <p><em>Gr\u00e3o a gr\u00e3o enche a galinha o papo</em> (\u201cgrain by grain, the hen fills her belly\u201d) is a food proverb fondly recited by Ana; she takes this to mean that, with patience, we can make our dreams reality. In our case, the grain that started our dream is rice. So that seems a sensible place to begin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c692a11eea129c09f6b6861e6f6c4d36fa706c6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c692a11eea129c09f6b6861e6f6c4d36fa706c6e/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Goncalves and Zijun Meng\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ana Goncalves and Zijun Meng created Tata Eatery, which offers bowls of rice with various toppings, inspired partly by the Japanese <em>don </em>method of serving food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A perfect bowl of rice</strong></h2> <p>This is how we cook rice at home.</p> <p><strong>Serves 2</strong><br>200g short grain rice<br>200g water</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Put the rice in a bowl.

Put the washed rice in the pot and top it with water until it comes up to 400g in total.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Once you have the measurement right, cover with a lid and bring it to the boil, reduce the heat to minimum and cook until all the water has disappeared and you can see some holes on the surface of the rice.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Turn off the heat and let it steam for 10 minutes with the lid on.

  "<p>A draft bill on a second independence referendum has been published by the Scottish government after the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, pledged to hold a new poll in the event of a hard Brexit in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/nicola-sturgeon-challenges-may-with-second-referendum-bill-scottish-independence-snp-conference\">direct challenge to Theresa May</a>. </p> <p>The draft legislation, which was formally unveiled by the constitution secretary, Derek Mackay, despite the Scottish parliament being in recess until next week, sets out proposals for the rules governing the campaign, the conduct of the poll and how votes are counted. </p> <p>Mackay said the proposed franchise would be the same as for the Scottish parliament. \u201cThat will mean two important groups of people would have a voice denied to them in the recent referendum on EU membership: 16- and 17-year-olds and citizens of EU countries who have made Scotland their home.\u201d</p> <p>The eight-page document proposes that any referendum would be run in a way similar to 2014, using the same yes/no question: \u201cShould Scotland be an independent country?\u201d It also suggests that the vote would similarly not be subject to any minimum turnout requirement or an approval threshold. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f9e19dd5a8006051b75e3899f652969b472716b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f9e19dd5a8006051b75e3899f652969b472716b/0_78_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sturgeon said she would put forward proposals for maintaining Scotland\u2019s position in the single market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the bill was published, Sturgeon said: \u201cWe will continue to work UK-wide to seek to avert a hard Brexit and we will also bring forward proposals that seek to protect our place in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, if we find that our interests cannot be properly or fully protected within a UK context then independence must be one of the options open to us and the Scottish people must have the right to consider it.\u201d</p> <p>She added that any decision on holding a referendum, including the timing of it, would be for the Scottish parliament \u2013 where a pro-independence majority exists between the SNP and the Scottish Greens \u2013 to take. Despite May\u2019s stated intention to oppose another independence poll, Holyrood would then ask the UK government to grant a section 30 order to allow the vote to take place.</p> <p>Sturgeon, who will next meet May in London on Monday with other heads of devolved governments, has said she will put forward specific proposals in the coming weeks for maintaining Scotland\u2019s position in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves, as well as pushing for substantial additional powers for Holyrood as part of the UK\u2019s article 50 negotiations, including over international trade deals and immigration.</p> <p>In her foreword to the consultation, which will run until 11 January 2017, Sturgeon writes: \u201cIn May 2016 the current Scottish government was elected with a clear mandate that the Scottish parliament should have the right to hold an independence referendum if there was clear and sustained evidence that independence had become the preferred option of a majority of the Scottish people \u2013 or if there was a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cThe UK government\u2019s recent statements on its approach to leaving the EU raise serious concerns for the Scottish government. We face unacceptable risks to our democratic, economic and social interests and to the right of the Scottish parliament to have its say.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed those statements contradict the assurances given before the independence referendum in 2014 that Scotland is an equal partner within the UK and that a vote against independence would secure our EU membership.\u201d</p> <p>But the Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, described the draft bill as \u201cirresponsible economic vandalism\u201d, warning: \u201cOur economy is in trouble following David Cameron\u2019s reckless Brexit gamble, and the very last thing we need is more uncertainty for employers.\u201d</p> <p>And speaking before the publication, the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, vowed that her party would fight proposals for a second referendum \u201cevery step of the way\u201d.</p> <p>Dugdale has also written to the Scottish parliament\u2019s presiding officer, Ken Macintosh, asking for clarification over how the SNP\u2019s plans will be examined, arguing that the SNP is trying to dodge scrutiny by publishing the consultation during parliamentary recess.</p>",

In most of the Nordic countries, victims\u2019 sexual histories are not considered relevant evidence in rape cases and generally victims have the right to have their own lawyer appointed. Importantly, in Finland, Sweden and Norway, rape complainants are also extended certain procedural rights which give them a much stronger legal position in relation to the criminal justice procedure. That allows them to partly participate in the criminal justice process, as opposed to only having the status of a witness.</p> <p>However, even these countries have not cracked the code. Along with the UK they also suffer from low conviction rates and some of the same biases. Victims\u2019 medical histories can be subject to legal scrutiny, and offenders in <a href=\"http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/overgrepp-mot-kvinnor-och-barn-den-rattsliga-hanteringen-9789139014263\" title=\"\">Sweden</a> are more likely to be convicted if their victim belongs to a higher social class. In <a href=\"http://www.dkr.dk/voldt%C3%A6gt-der-anmeldes-vi\" title=\"\">Denmark</a>, the alleged perpetrator\u2019s alcohol consumption is likely to work in his favour, but if the victim was under the influence it works against her.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://edda.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Einkenni-og-me%C3%B0fer%C3%B0-nau%C3%B0gunarm%C3%A1la-okt%C3%B3ber-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">Iceland</a>, charges are significantly less likely to be issued if the victim was intoxicated when the rape took place. And cases that are reported within 24 hours to the police are more likely to proceed, even though we know that it normally takes victims more time to come to terms with what actually happened.</p> <p>Indeed, some Nordic countries are looking to the UK for better practices. Sweden is likely to become the first Nordic country to discard its current definition of sexual violence, which focuses on the use of force, and adopt a consent-based one. That focus is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrijeaqc04A\" title=\"\">far from perfect</a> and is not necessarily likely to increase conviction rates, given the high burden of proof in criminal cases.</p> <p>However, the message is considered important, and some hope that when coupled with a gross negligence provision \u2013 modelled on Norwegian law \u2013 a new legal definition could lead to more convictions. That way the prosecutor would not need to prove intent but to establish that the accused acted in an extremely careless manner.</p> <p>As for England and Wales, <a href=\"http://kunskapsbanken.nck.uu.se/nckkb/nck/publik/fil/visa/197/different\" title=\"\">report</a> after <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> (after <a href=\"http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/75/where-are-we-now\" title=\"\">report</a>, after <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110608160754/http://www.equalities.gov.uk/PDF/Stern_Review_acc_FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a>, after <a href=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/Publications/equality/vaw/dame_elish_angiolini_rape_review_2015.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a>) has outlined how the justice system can be improved, and how better to address the context in which violence against women takes place.

The criminal justice system provides little incentive for accused persons to take responsibility for their actions \u2013 something reflected, perhaps, in the number of perpetrators.

  "<p><em>London Lies Beneath</em> is set in the London slum of Walworth in 1912, and revolves around three families whose 12-year-old sons are friends. The bones of the story are factual: the disaster at the&#xa0;centre of the plot occurred at the time given and some of the characters share names and dates with those in the historical record. But it\u2019s a neo-Victorian novel in that the narrative style is modern and the political concerns closer to our moment than to&#xa0;the 19th century.</p> <p>At first it\u2019s hard to keep track of the characters: everyone lives in extended families and the narrative voice flits from the childhood memories of grandparents (invariably recollections of social injustice) to the small-scale domestic resentments of cohabiting sisters-in-law. The narrative mimics the overcrowding of slum housing, voices interweaving so that it takes most of the first half of the book to establish who is talking about whom. There is the Jewish family who \u201clived in Russia, before the Cossacks came\u201d, now negotiating assimilation in ways that tend to part the generations, although young Itzhak enjoys a good relationship with his garrulous grandfather. There is Ida, the local wise woman and seller of folk medicines to those who can\u2019t afford a doctor. Ida, mother of Tom and three unnamed and underfed girls, has some kind of second sight and is married to overworked costermonger Bill. Ida and Bill are neighbours of Rose and pearly king Charlie, whose son is Jimmy. Rose spends what time she can spare from work and housework looking after her dying mother Emily, which involves a lot of pus and stories of bygone days.</p> <p>All the working-class characters are virtuous and hard-working, all the women unbowed by the relentless drudgery that is their lot and all the men adoring husbands and fathers behind closed doors, however rough they may appear on the streets: strivers not skivers. All three boys show special promise and energy, and all three families note their sons\u2019 strengths with cautious hope for a better future.</p> <p>The reader guesses from the mothers\u2019 premonitions that the boys\u2019 involvement in the Scout movement is&#xa0;not going to end well and disaster comes daringly early in the book, leaving a lot of aftermath and not much resolution. Novels of aftermath depend heavily on the reader\u2019s investment in characters, so the size of&#xa0;the cast here may challenge the attention of all but the closest readers.</p> <p>There are interpolations from beyond Walworth. Edward Lovett, a Victorian collector whose hoard is now <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/edward-lovett\" title=\"\">kept by the Wellcome Collection</a>, stalks the streets buying charms and amulets from slum dwellers reduced to selling their most precious possessions to buy food. Lovett, in Duffy\u2019s account, is entirely without feeling, a man who spends his days in a bank counting other people\u2019s money and his evenings avoiding the sons he dislikes to hunt for poor people\u2019s last treasures. The charms are passed down through families, bringing luck or protection and carrying stories of hardship until they are consumed by the capitalist collector. In&#xa0;case we should imagine the contrast between the loving poor and the soulless rich is coincidental, the point is hammered home. Middle-class visitors to Walworth are \u201cpoking and prying\u201d, \u201cshaking their heads as if they couldn\u2019t quite believe it\u201d.</p> <p>One of the sources acknowledged is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/30/round-about-pound-maud-pember-reeves\" title=\"\"><em>Round About a Pound a Week</em></a>, written in 1913 by the trade unionist, Fabian and feminist Maud Pember Reeves precisely to undermine rhetoric about the deserving and undeserving poor. Duffy\u2019s relentless insistence that the&#xa0;proletariat is all good and the bourgeoisie all bad is a simplification of history; it was the work of middle-class liberals \u2013 including Marx \u2013 that brought about most of the social reforms of Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries. Gavin McCrea\u2019s recent novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/25/mrs-engels-gavin-mccrea-review-historical\" title=\"\"><em>Mrs Engels</em></a>, addressing exactly this issue, offers a much more subtle and linguistically lively exploration of class in the Victorian city.

It reveals Obama has now become the very establishment he ran against in 2008. Maybe one shouldn\u2019t drink the water in Washington after all.</p> <p>Remember the soaring pre-packaged and poll-tested promises of hope and change Obama sold the nation in his first electrifying presidential bid? It seems he gave up on those ideals when Republicans pummeled his party in the 2010 midterms.</p> <p>Or maybe Obama got a renewed sense of what\u2019s really wrong with Washington when he won the popular vote in his 2012 reelection, while Republicans maintained their majority in the House of Representatives.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong: gerrymandering is a huge national problem. But partisan solutions to a national problem just breed more soul-sucking partisanship.</p> <p>Look at Washington DC\u2019s two neighbors: Virginia and Maryland. Virginia has two Democratic senators, yet Republicans hold eight of the state\u2019s 11 House seats \u2013 conservative gerrymandering at its worst.</p> <p>But Democrats in neighboring Maryland are no better. The state had long had two Republicans serving in the US House until former governor Martin O\u2019Malley teamed up with fellow Democrats to oust one of those Republicans by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/in-maryland-anti-gerrymandering-activists-take-message-to-their-target/2014/09/21/2f3dce36-4180-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html\">creating a district</a> that zigs and zags across four disparate counties for some 225 miles.</p> <p>Both sides are guilty, which is why gerrymandering should be dealt with by setting up a national bipartisan commission that removes party from the process of drawing district lines, not by having Democrats out-gerrymander their Republican counterparts. What the nation needs right now is healing, not more pitched partisanship funded by the nation\u2019s political class.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/early-voting-lines-georgia\">Early voting lines are so long, people are fainting. That harms democracy | Barrett Holmes Pitner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Obama of 2008 would likely be teaming up with a Republican, maybe even George W Bush, to get partisanship out of redistricting altogether. But the politicized Obama of 2016 is leaving office with what seems to be a chip on his shoulder and a vendetta against Republicans whom he and his insular team <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harry-reid-gop-obama_us_57ed1c78e4b082aad9b97321\">say</a> blunted their progressive mandate.</p> <p>But Obama isn\u2019t blameless in the slide from \u201chope and change\u201d to partisan gridlock. Republican leaders often bemoan the lack of communication from the White House even though they control the gavels on both sides of Capitol Hill. And even congressional Democrats have complained they haven\u2019t heard enough from President Obama, even as they\u2019ve done the heavy lifting for getting parts of his agenda through Congress.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, a quarterback that doesn\u2019t communicate with his offensive line can still win games,\u201d Democratic Congressman Jim Moran told me of Obama\u2019s hands-off style before he retired at the end of the last Congress. \u201cBut they don\u2019t generally win as many games as the quarterback who, you know, embraces the line and works with them and communicates with them on a regular basis.\u201d</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t fit well into the GOP\u2019s narrative that Obama\u2019s a power grabbing socialist, but, then again, that narrative has never been accurate (just don\u2019t tell the GOP base that\u2026).<br></p> <p>But Obama\u2019s post-presidency focus on gerrymandering does fit into the GOP narrative that Obama\u2019s a partisan who\u2019s to blame for the gridlock that\u2019s only become worse since he entered office.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Obama is young and still has a lot of fight in him, and it\u2019s a shame he appears to be planning to use that energy towards partisan gains.</p> <p>When Obama\u2019s out of office, he\u2019d be wise to instead spend some time reviewing his soaring promises from 2008. They may wash away the cynicism and bitterness that marks most everyone in contemporary Washington and enable him to follow his predecessor\u2019s examples and spend his post-presidency focusing on doing national and international good. That would be a much richer legacy than perpetuating the petty, partisan squabbles that marred much of his time serving as commander-in-chief.</p>",
  "<p>There was a time when Jonjo Shelvey appeared a big part of the problem at Newcastle United but these days he seems very much the solution.</p> <p>Rafael Ben\u00edtez had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/11/newcastle-united-sack-steve-mcclaren-rafael-benitez\">barely succeeded Steve McClaren</a> as manager at St James\u2019 Park last spring before he dropped the midfielder from the team. Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/five-games-newcastle-relegation-premier-league\">Newcastle\u2019s fall into the Championship</a> Shelvey then began this season warming the bench and, when liberated from it, persistently attempting too many \u201cHollywood passes\u201d and over-ambitious long-range shots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/qpr-newcastle-championship-match-report\">Newcastle flying high as Jonjo Shelvey scores twice in mauling of QPR</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the last few weeks, though, things have changed radically. Endless hours of painstaking training ground work with Ben\u00edtez have taught a 24-year-old who claims to have grown up to apply a precious, game-changing talent properly. And with Newcastle having risen to the top of the Championship, Ben\u00edtez has even dropped heavy hints that Gareth Southgate should give serious consideration to adding to Shelvey\u2019s six England caps.</p> <p>If he is unlikely to supplant the technically assured Vurnon Anita as his club manager\u2019s favourite player, Shelvey has become that rarity in a Ben\u00edtez squad: a player who does not find himself subjected to regular rotation.</p> <p>Strutting through games with accuracy and aplomb, not to mention unusual mental courage, Shelvey has been dictating play from an anchor role in Newcastle\u2019s 4-2-3-1 formation. Crucially he finally appears to have acquired the knack of knowing precisely when to unleash those devastating, defence-splitting passes over 40 to 60 yards.</p> <p>In a football world crammed with neat and tidy midfielders specialising in the low-risk short and sideways ball, Shelvey\u2019s vision, technique and raking passing range set him apart. The difference now is that the familiar swagger is underpinned by a substance sorely lacking in the wake of his \u00a3<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/12/newcastle-united-jonjo-shelvey-bid-swansea-city\">12m, \u00a380,000-a-week switch</a> from Swansea to McClaren\u2019s Newcastle last January.</p> <p>\u201cWe have other players who can play that position,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cBut Jonjo\u2019s playing every game. He\u2019s technically good and, when he plays well, the team plays better. In Jonjo we have a player who has it in him to deliver the final pass. He can control games.\u201d</p> <p>And England? \u201cWhen he\u2019s playing as he is now, why not,\u201d added the former Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid manager. \u201cThere were never any doubts about Jonjo\u2019s ability but he\u2019s playing at a really good level now. That\u2019s very clear. I\u2019m very happy with him.\u201d</p> <p>This harmony did not prevent moments of creative tension between coach and midfielder as Ben\u00edtez questioned Shelvey\u2019s passing decisions during Saturday\u2019s 3-1 win against Brentford, in which Shelvey helped to create all of Newcastle\u2019s goals. Such constructive criticism appears to be bringing out the best in the former Charlton and Liverpool player.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the same person I was before,\u201d said Shelvey. \u201cRafa\u2019s helped me understand myself. He\u2019s a very good manager. I\u2019ve grown so much at Newcastle.\u201d</p> <p>Shelvey has also contracted, shedding well over a stone in weight, as well as a \u201cchildish mind-set\u201d after hiring a personal trainer during the close season. \u201cMy mentality\u2019s better because I feel better physically,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/20/jonjo-shelvey-swansea-city-interview\">Jonjo Shelvey: 'Growing up it was rough, people were getting stabbed'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The resultant metamorphosis may have come too late to save McClaren\u2019s job on Tyneside but it does not surprise Ian Holloway, who took Shelvey on loan from Liverpool to Blackpool in 2011 and quickly detected his potential. \u201cJonjo\u2019s probably the best player I\u2019ve ever seen play in the Championship,\u201d Holloway said after watching Newcastle beat Brentford. \u201cHe can get it off the centre-halves, dictate play and go beyond into the final third. He never looks to play the simple ball, he\u2019s always looking to hurt you. He\u2019s like a puppet; he\u2019s always moving his head. He\u2019s so aware of everything around him.\u201d</p> <p>Described as faultless by Roy Hodgson when the then England coach gave him his debut, Shelvey \u2013 who started 31 games during three years at Anfield having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/28/liverpool-jonjo-shelvey-charlton\">been signed by Ben\u00edtez</a> (who left soon afterwards) as Steven Gerrard\u2019s heir apparent \u2013 has enjoyed purple patches before. The difference this time is that his bravery and ability are now reinforced, and sometimes rationed, by Ben\u00edtez\u2019s instilled discipline.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been confident \u2013 you have to be when you\u2019ve got alopecia and a bald head,\u201d said a man who has emerged as a vocal leader, on and off the field. \u201cBut I feel much more confident and fearless now.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Championship is helping me and helping Newcastle. \u201cThere\u2019s a buzz in the city, the fans are back onside \u2013 we\u2019re getting 52,000 at home games \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot of love for the club. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Southgate could do far worse than take a close look at a player capable of switching the lights back on for England.</p>",

  "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/who-won-the-final-presidential-debate\">last debate</a> of the election, Hillary Clinton emerged the way she hoped she would, as the all-but-certain first female president of the United States.</p> <p>By refusing to pledge that he would accept the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">results of the election</a>, Donald Trump all-but-certainly disqualified himself for the position of president. The peaceful transfer of power after a presidential election has been the pillar of our democracy. By refusing to accept the results of the vote, Trump would be flouting the tradition of American politics and the democratic beliefs of almost all voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/who-won-the-final-presidential-debate\">Who won the final presidential debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like the two earlier debates, this one was contentious and marked by sniping between Trump and Clinton. But Trump\u2019s claims were often far-fetched and lacked a shred of factual evidence. Especially bizarre was his baseless charge that the Clinton campaign was behind the allegations of nine women that Trump improperly groped or kissed them, charges that Trump has denied.</p> <p>Some analysts thought Trump may have lost the election the day the disgusting tape of him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragging</a> about his ability to kiss women and \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d became public. His standing in battleground states and national polls did <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">drop precipitously</a> and steadily after the tape became public.</p> <p>But his constant claims of a rigged election and refusal to join his running mate, Mike Pence, in saying he\u2019d accept the election results are equally, if not more, outrageous. They are intended to damage people\u2019s confidence in the election process itself.</p> <p>So Trump blew his last best chance to present himself as a credible president, while Clinton, who maintained her composure throughout, radiated solidity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Going into Wednesday\u2019s debate, her stature as a candidate was much greater than in the previous two. Most national polls of late show her with a prohibitive lead over Trump. With 20 days remaining before election day, it is all but impossible for him to make up the lost ground necessary to win the presidency.</p> <p>So the debate had far lower stakes for Clinton than Trump. Her strategy was fairly simple: show Trump as not fit for the presidency, defend herself without seeming defensive or evasive and, most important, maintain the demeanor of an all-but-president.</p> <p>She did a masterful job of not letting Trump\u2019s sharp attacks rile her. She did not assault Trump with as much sting as she had in the two past debates, though she still obviously got under his skin. He blurted out that she is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">a nasty woman</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump began the debate talking in a quiet voice and scoring some points against Clinton on issues like trade. But he soon lost focus and eventually fell to pieces, denying, when there is tape to prove it, that he had demeaned the appearances of his female accusers and interrupting Clinton repeatedly, practically shouting \u201cwrong\u201d after some of her assertions about his record.</p> <p>There was substantive discussion of issues, on foreign policy, the supreme court, the US budget deficit and abortion. Clinton repeated her support for a woman\u2019s right to control her body, while Trump showed his revulsion of late-term abortions and repeatedly described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">rip[ping] the baby out of the womb</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton evaded direct answers posed by the moderator, Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace about her ethics and used her answers to accuse Trump of being Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet,\u201d a remark that clearly rankled with him.</p> <p>But she was careful to be positive, too, saying that America is great because \u201cits people are good\u201d. She said she had devoted her life\u2019s work to women and children and would devote her presidency to protecting them. Trump again provided a very dark vision of the United States.</p> <p>At times Clinton projected an almost regal bearing. She wore an elegant suit in white, a color she has favored at other key moments in her climb to the White House, including her Brooklyn victory rally after the primaries and at her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton-speech-artful-response-trump-dnc-verdict\">acceptance speech</a> at the Democratic convention.

They won again, slightly less flamboyantly, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/31/leicester-saracens-premiership-final-report\">pushed the Tigers all the way</a> in one of the most entertaining finals at Twickenham. In the 2014 European Cup semi-final at Twickenham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/26/saracens-clermont-auvergne-heineken-cup-semi-final-report\">they overwhelmed Clermont Auvergne</a>, running from all parts.</p> <p>They are a two-tone team, as the All Blacks have been over the years, able to tailor their tactics to suit who they are playing and the weather conditions. Not for nothing were they the first Premiership club to lay an artificial surface, and while they have thrived on being a side that no one outside Allianz Park loves, the Millwall syndrome, they demand admiration and respect.</p> <p>While Toulon reached the top of their league and Europe with (largely) an old side, Saracens have a much younger average age with a core of homegrown players rather than overseas recruits. One aspect where they resemble the All Blacks is in developing a squad who are mates as well as team-mates. No one dares let down his friends; strength in unity.</p> <p>They are, with all respect to Wasps, the leading club in England by some way at a time when the clubs who were with them in the top four in the early years of the decade \u2013 Leicester, Northampton and Harlequins \u2013 have been losing their way. Exeter are still recovering from the way they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/saracens-exeter-premiership-final-rugby\">dismantled by Sarries in the final</a> in May, while the team who were beaten by the men in black <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/30/bath-saracens-premiership-match-report\">the season before</a>, Bath, took a year to get over it.</p> <p>Within the space of six days, and despite having a number of their players involved in the England training camp in Brighton, Saracens not only defeated two of their closest challengers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/saracens-wasps-premiership-match-report\">Wasps</a> and Toulon, but stripped them of their pride. They did so in contrasting styles, wearing down the former and taking on the latter from the kick-off.</p> <p>The victories, and the manner of them, are a tribute to their director of rugby, Mark McCall, a man so quietly spoken that he is rugby\u2019s equivalent of Whispering Bob Harris; unless you place a tape recorder close to his mouth, all you hear on replay is background noise. His recruitment is spot on: while Toulon assembled some of the game\u2019s biggest names and threw them together, with no little success, Saracens look for players who will complement the squad and fit in with an ethos that has resurrected a part of the amateur era.</p> <p>Schalk Burger is the latest example, the highly experienced South Africa flanker who plays with the relish of a rookie, along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/saracens-exeter-alex-lowzowski-premiership-rugby-union\">Alex Lozowski</a>, the third-choice outside-half at Wasps last season. Billy Vunipola did not look a natural Saracen when he was recruited from Wasps, individual and not particularly aware, but he has turned into one of the game\u2019s leading No8s. Charlie Hodgson was another shrewd signing, and while there is the occasional mistake, such as James Johnston, Saracens have a knack for discerning qualities in players to whom other clubs are blind.</p> <p>They face a testing few weeks when the Premiership returns and their England contingent turn their attention to the autumn international series. They are a second-row light, which is why they considered signing South Africa\u2019s Eben Etzebeth this month, and perhaps a difference this season is that some of their key players have proved themselves to be top quality.</p> <p>The England head coach Eddie Jones said on taking up the position that England needed world-class players. The likes of Billy Vunipola, Farrell and George Kruis are getting there, Mako Vunipola has developed into an all\u2011purpose prop of the kind usually seen in a New Zealand shirt and Maro Itoje and Jamie George have developed significantly in the past year.</p> <p>Saracens play seven Premiership fixtures during the autumn international series and the Six Nations: Gloucester and Sale home and away, Bath, Newcastle and Worcester on the road. With England players also given two rest weekends during the club season, there may come a point when Saracens wonder if producing so many players for the national side is a good thing.</p> <p>That is for the future. For now, they are pre-eminent in England. Wasps have assembled a strong squad but, as Saracens did, they have to learn from the pain of losing big matches and become multidimensional, hard to pin down. And, perhaps, hope that Saracens become victims of their own success.</p> <p><em>This is an extract taken from the Guardian\u2019s weekly rugby union email, The Breakdown.

  "<h2><strong>Winning tip: </strong><strong>Solovetsky islands, White Sea</strong><br></h2> <p>This archipelago is in the White Sea in the far north-west. You will find lots of history, including, on Bolshoy Solovetsky, mysterious ancient stone labyrinths, an infamous 1920s gulag, and a medieval monastery surrounded by a kremlin. The nature is beautiful here too \u2013 some of the islands are tundra-bound; others covered in wildflowers and wild berries. The islands also offer a taste of Russian village life, but with lots more to do (excursions, bikes and boats available to rent, etc) than in most Russian villages. We stayed in Hotel Pryut (doubles from \u00a335, breakfast \u00a33.50, email <a href=\"mailto:shelter_solovki@mail.ru\">shelter_solovki@mail.ru</a>, no website), which has loads of charm and is close to the monastery.

The trip takes 75 minutes and costs about 3,000 roubles (\u00a338 return). Here you\u2019ll find the remarkable Kizhi Pogost, a compound of two huge and ancient multi-domed cathedrals built entirely of wood, with not a nail to hold them together. Their onion domes are scaled with silvery shingles made of aspen and gleam in the sun. You can wander around the island\u2019s open-air museum with its wooden farmhouses and chapels for glimpses of daily life in pre-revolutionary Russia and admire the painstaking carpentry of the restoration workshop.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://go-karelia.com/news/5699/\"><em>go-karelia.com</em></a><br><strong>LucyGulland</strong></p> <h2><strong>Traditional village near Vladimir</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a935799e637babd4d4d9e51f306835da5d4357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a935799e637babd4d4d9e51f306835da5d4357/0_337_5010_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colourful scarfs, Suzdal, Russia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If you are lucky enough to be in the countryside near Vladimir, 190km east of Moscow, for a bit, Suzdal is an absolutely beautiful village with traditional wooden house, churches and kremlin.

We learned Russian songs, sat outside at night with stars and bonfires and experienced the delights of rural Russian cuisine, with daily meals of salted <em>kasha</em> (buckwheat porridge) with jam and shashlik kebabs. A day trip to the island of Olkhon (the fourth-largest island in a lake in the world), organised by the Sarminskaya holiday park, offers a terrifying but exhilarating ride in a rickety old school bus (manned by a one-eyed driver) and a journey into the heart of the <a href=\"http://www.rusnature.info/zap/106.htm\">Pribaikalsky national park</a>.

This 1990s throwback is the bizarre system whereby the hugely unattractive bouncer gets to decide whether you are attractive (or wealthy enough) to enter his establishment. While back home, being female is usually enough to get you in, here the situation is reversed. The abundance of beautiful Russian girls, as well as the general idea that only men can pay for drinks, means being female isn\u2019t necessarily enough. My advice? Dress up, go in small mixed-gender groups, smile, have someone try to speak Russian to the bouncer and, in the background, someone else speak English.

On average, premiums have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">risen</a> by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in the nine years before Obama, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">Politifact found</a> earlier this year. Trump, however, is cherry-picking data from <a href=\"http://acasignups.net/\">various states</a> and <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX19n4kcCdR5qUI27%2BwHheoDO2VGbcEEfi84Zrt9YzdawzO8%2BdPHtCLfThVI4mtetRmr28iQ8w29yvQ%3D%3D\">providers</a> where <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX186EmjG4AR6ruydOJE2fGfzzCgpYCDVKZngFNf0hgLfrIhE%2BJuoUQjwImgHKotCy9LrONfdtvsk4im1VSMZcQCpaU3VHLZUiPU%3D\">rates have had higher</a> jumps. The most common healthcare plans will increase 9% on average, according to an <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/\">analysis</a> by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWe take care of illegal immigrants \u2026 better than we take care of our vets\u201d</strong></p> <p>This claim flies in the face of evidence and logic. Like all US citizens, veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by US law (voting rights, social security, Medicaid, etc), while undocumented migrants (noncitizens) do not. Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration\"> drawn a $113bn price tag from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation</a>. He also inflated that number. </p> <p>The campaign has said the US spends $2.8bn on housing migrants in prisons, combining an estimate <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421673/report-us-spent-187-billion-incarcerate-illegal-immigrant-criminals-2014-joel-gehrke\">on prison costs</a> and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the US without adults. The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of $69.7bn. Veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to K-12 education, though few veterans would likely seek it, and veterans have access to the Affordable Care Act, military benefits and health benefits, while migrants do not.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cOur inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store, you have no education, no jobs\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump\u2019s repeated claim that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-lies-this-week-taxes-bankruptcy\">African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell</a>\u201d defies most of American history, from antebellum slavery through the Jim Crow decades, great depression and segregation. Even if Trump is only referring the past half century, he is still wrong by most metrics. </p> <p>Data on employment, education and health show empirical evidence for the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">persistent reality</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">discrimination</a> against black Americans, but also show major gains in the last few decades.

Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy.

She seems to be citing another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, about the debt, and possibly overstates its estimated consequences. </p> <p>That center warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d. According to that group, half of Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have income gains of less than 1%.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWhen you ran the State Department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct.

A Trump contractor hired undocumented Polish workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1983 union members sued one of their organizers. Trump appeared in court in 1990 and blamed the contractor overseeing the project, which was for Trump Tower.</p> <p><strong>Trump: Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d</strong></p> <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process. The US has among the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with State Department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then Homeland Security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee, and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

He said nice things about me \u2026 He has no respect for our president.\u201d</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether Trump has ever spoken with the Russian president. Putin was invited to but did not attend a 2013 beauty pageant in Moscow, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html\">one of the oligarchs</a> who helped organize the event. \u201cWill he become my new best friend?\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640\">wondered</a> beforehand.</p> <p>The pair may have communicated through intermediaries. In 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKkKQmbyECw\">told a National Press Club luncheon</a>: \u201cI was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.\u201d A year earlier, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-putin-tried-arrange-meeting-moscow-source-n619006\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI do have a relationship and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today.\u201d</p> <p>Last November, Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/\">claimed in a debate</a> that he \u201cgot to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes\u201d. They appeared in separate, pre-taped segments and were not on set together.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia, and his refusal to release tax returns prevents him proving that he has no assets there. </p> <p>Putin has never called Trump \u201ca genius\u201d; he used the Russian word \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439, which means \u201ccolorful\u201d or \u201cflamboyant\u201d. Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light. Putin also called him \u201ctalented, undoubtedly\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our business to decide his merits; that\u2019s for US voters,\u201d Putin said earlier this year.

Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News will have questions cued to the six topic areas announced in advance: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president.</p> <p>But the candidates\u2019 preferred messages in recent days, especially as Trump is concerned, touch on different themes. Trump has been talking a lot about a rigged election and promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington. In recent days he has proposed ethics reform laws and congressional term limits. Meanwhile, Breitbart, Trump\u2019s phantom media arm, published today (for the first time, it seems) the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/former-tv-reporter-accuses-bill-clinton-of-sexual-assault-229987\">story</a> of a former Arkansas broadcaster, Leslie Milwee, who says Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980. She\u2019s invited to the debate.</p> <p>Trump says that Clinton emails released by Wikileaks show she is part of an international cabal, with banks and the media, to destroy the country and enrich and empower themselves. He has contended that the state department offered the FBI a quid pro quo for declassifying certain Clinton emails just as they were to come in for public scrutiny. Any of these would-be scandals might be expected to come up.</p> <p>Clinton, for her part, may want to discuss the attack by Trump on his Republican colleagues; Trump\u2019s increasingly wild talk about voter fraud; or the astounding outpouring since the last debate of women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault. (He denies all the claims.) Here is a video telling their stories:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/19/161018womenst_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/19/161018womenst.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/19/161018womenst_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T00:10:01.443Z\">at 1.10am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580802f1e4b005f21833b3c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T23:37:30.704Z\">12.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Confirmed: Wayne Newton is coming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/788884708327165952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/debate2016?src=hash\">#debate2016</a> guests tonight include Marcus Luttrell, Pat Smith, and the legendary Wayne Newton.</p>&mdash; Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/788884708327165952\">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m_giioppT4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0m_giioppT4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Speaking of legendary Las Vegas acts... did anyone think to invite Britney?</p> <p>Doesn\u2019t matter.

It\u2019s hard to feel excited or even relieved, though, when her road to victory is so slick with the odium of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Between the video of Trump bragging about sexual assault and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller\">woman after woman</a> coming forward to claim he did just that, it\u2019s hard to stave off that sick-to-your-stomach feeling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/michelle-obama-speech-transcript-donald-trump\">Michelle Obama described so powerfully last week</a>. For those of us who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/jessica-valenti-my-life-as-a-sex-object\">endured a lifetime of unwanted leers and touches</a>, this last leg of the campaign has been painful. And as Trump surrogates and supporters \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/melania-trump-billy-bush-groping-tape-cnn-interview\">even his wife</a> \u2013 continue to shrug off the offenses as \u201clocker room talk\u201d or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787990502415167488\">outright lies</a>, we\u2019re reminded of just how easily women are disbelieved.</p> <p>There is one thing, though, that\u2019s giving me hope in the midst of this ugliness: the outcry from men who refuse to characterize sexual harassment and abuse as normal male behavior. Too often, discussions about sexual assault center only on women \u2013 our victimization and perceived culpability. Since the tape\u2019s release, though, the national conversation has shifted: men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that \u201creal men\u201d talk about abusing women \u2013 that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else.</p> <p>Read further:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-sexism-misogyny-men\">The silver lining of Trump's misogyny?

Fox News anchor Chris Wallace - the first anchor from that network to host a presidential debate - will moderate tonight\u2019s engagement. For a network that has been embroiled in scandal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">brought down its chief executive</a>, Wallace\u2019s position is an opportunity to hit the reset button on a miserable year - although Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump\">willingness to feud</a> with Fox News personalities means that Wallace will not be protected from onstage criticism from the candidate just because he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/06/trump-only-goes-on-hannity-megyn-kelly-clashes-with-friend-at-10-oclock\">besties with Sean Hannity.</a></p> <p><strong>What is the format? </strong>The debate will consist of six 15-minute segments, following the same format as the first presidential debate. Each segment will be approximately 15 minutes long. Wallace will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Clinton and Trump will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. Wallace may use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic. Those topics, <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">as revealed by the Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Debt and entitlements</li> <li>Immigration</li> <li>The economy</li> <li>Supreme Court</li> <li>Foreign hot spots</li> <li>Fitness to be president</li> </ul> <p><strong>Where is the debate being held? </strong>The debate is being held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which means that the journalists covering the debate are going to come home broke and hung over (they\u2019ve earned it, trust me).</p> <p><strong>How do I watch the misery? </strong>That\u2019s the easy part!

Trump\u2019s response - that the accusers were Clinton plants with the goal of \u201crigging\u201d the upcoming election - may have appeased some of his supporters, but a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/18/fox-news-poll-clinton-tops-trump-by-6-points.html\">late-breaking survey</a> from Fox News last night shows just how far the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s chances of victory in November have fallen:</p> <ul> <li>Clinton has a 6-point national lead over Trump, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg ...</li> <li>The poll, one of the first to be conducted entirely after the full slate of Trump\u2019s accusers came forward, shows Clinton leading among women by 7 points.</li> <li>Whites with a college degree, long a Republican bloc, favor Clinton by 9 points.</li> <li>Voters believe, by a two-to-one margin, that Trump committed at least some of the sexual assaults of which he has been accused.</li> <li>Clinton <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2016/10/18/fox-news-poll-october-18-2016/\">leads on every single issue</a>, minus the economy, as well as on qualifying attributes like temperament, judgment and making decisions about the use of nuclear weapons.</li> </ul> <h2><strong>So how does this affect tonight?</strong></h2> <p>Tonight\u2019s debate may be Trump\u2019s last opportunity to salvage the dwindling support that in recent weeks has seemingly placed the election increasingly out of the Republican nominee\u2019s reach - and if we\u2019ve learned anything about Trump over the past 16 months, it\u2019s that he\u2019s at his most vicious when backed into a corner.

I have a desk at home and do not need the portability of a laptop, but I would like an all-in-one to stop me hunching over the screen. I will use it for web browsing, sending emails, collating photos, and tasks like my ancestry research. What would you recommend? <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Kate</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>All-in-one computers generally use much the same technologies as laptops, but they are packaged differently. You are correct in thinking that all-in-ones are much better ergonomically, and they usually have bigger screens than laptops \u2013 typically 20-30in rather than 10-17in.</p> <p>All-in-one PCs are much tidier than desktop PCs, especially if you use a wireless keyboard and mouse. Also, they take up less room and are easier to move around. However, they are not as easy to repair or to expand. Buying more power and more memory than you need will provide some future-proofing.</p> <p>Either way, I recommend you visit a retailer than stocks all-in-ones, such as John Lewis or Currys PC World, so that you can check the screen, construction quality and finish first hand. The keyboard and mouse are not so important as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/oct/13/which-keyboard-and-mouse-should-i-buy-for-my-pc\">you can easily upgrade these later</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Recommended systems</strong></h2> <p>For best results, go for an all-in-one with an Intel Core processor, 8GB of memory, a 1TB or larger hard drive, and Microsoft Windows 10. You should be able to do everything you want with a Core i3, but if you can afford it, it\u2019s better to have a Core i5. You don\u2019t need to pay for the extra power of a Core i7.</p> <p>At the time of writing, I\u2019d go for the <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/uk/AllinOne-PCs/Zen-AiO-Pro-Z220IC/Performance/\">Asus Zen AiO</a> ZN220IC. This has a 21.5in touch-screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, a Core i3-6100U processor, 8GB of memory and 1TB hard drive, all for <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/asus-zen-aio-21-5-touchscreen-all-in-one-pc-10146124-pdt.html\">\u00a3579.99</a>. The same AiO PC is also available with a faster Core i5-6400T for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Z220ICUT-21-5-Inch-Desktop-Windows-Touchscreen/dp/B017YQAWLY/\">\u00a3665</a> or <a href=\"http://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/asus-intel-core-i5-6400t-8gb-1tb-integrated-graphics-bt-cam-no-odd-23.6-to-z220icut-gg009x/version.asp\">less</a>. Prices and services vary so shop around.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a version with a Core i3 and only 4GB of memory for <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/asus-zen-aio-21-5-all-in-one-pc-10146349-pdt.html\">\u00a3499.99</a>. If that\u2019s as far as your budget stretches, it will do the job.</p> <p>The Zen AiO is built like an Apple iMac all-in-one \u2013 from the back, they look almost identical \u2013 but cheaper. The main drawback is that it\u2019s extremely difficult to open, to add more memory or a faster hard drive.</p> <p>Don\u2019t like the Zen? Dell sells a similar but less stylish all-in-one, the <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/uk/p/inspiron-22-3263-desktop-aio/pd\">Inspiron 22 3000</a>, with a Core i5-6200U, 8GB of memory and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3649 including delivery. Be careful not to confuse it with the older model, which had a <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/dell-inspiron-22-3000-21-5-all-in-one-pc-10147063-pdt.html\">kick-stand</a>. HP offers the <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/hp-pavilion-23-q252na-all-in-one-desktop-pc-intel-core-i5-8gb-ram-2tb-23-/p2789163\">HP Pavilion 23-q252na</a> with a Core i5-6400T, 8GB of memory and a 2TB hard drive for \u00a3749.95. I suspect that\u2019s too much for you.</p> <h2><strong>Budget options</strong></h2> <p>If you want to spend as little as possible, look at the Lenovo C20. It has a 19.5in non-touch screen, an Intel Celeron J3160 processor, 4GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive and a built-in DVD for \u00a3319.99 at <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/lenovo-c20-19-5-all-in-one-pc-10146496-pdt.html\">PC World</a>, <a href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/5532212.htm\">Argos</a> and other stores. It\u2019s obviously not a premium product, but it\u2019s terrific value for money.</p> <p>It has two drawbacks. First, the screen resolution is only 1366 x 768 pixels. Like your old laptop, it\u2019s HD instead of Full HD. Second, the Celeron J3160 is fairly a slow processor, roughly equivalent to an Intel Atom x7-Z8700. The J3160\u2019s main advantage is on-chip support for H.264 and VC1 encoding and decoding, which helps when playing videos.</p> <p>There\u2019s a slightly cheaper version of the Lenovo C20 with a 500GB instead of a 1TB hard drive for <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/lenovo-c20-19-5-all-in-one-pc-10146063-pdt.html\">\u00a3299.99</a>. There\u2019s also a slightly more expensive version (<a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/lenovo-c20-19-5-all-in-one-pc-10146065-pdt.html\">\u00a3349.99</a>) with a Pentium J3710 processor. However, this is basically the same chip with a slightly faster graphics unit. In Intel branding terms, Pentiums are better than Celerons, but in this case, it\u2019s not really worth the extra cost. However, both the Celeron J3160 and Pentium J3710 are better than the old <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/lenovo-c20-19-5-all-in-one-pc-10141697-pdt.html\">Celeron N3050</a>, which only has two processor cores instead of four.</p> <p>John Lewis also offers a C20 variant with the slightly better Pentium J3710 processor and 8GB of memory instead of 4GB, which is reasonable value at <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-c20-all-in-one-desktop-pc-intel-pentium-8gb-ram-1tb-19-5-black/p2915903\">\u00a3379.95</a>.</p> <p>However, at that level, you\u2019d be better off paying \u00a3399.99 for the 21.5in <a href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/5483268.htm\">HP 22-b020na</a>. This has a Full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels), a Pentium J3710 processor, 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD. It looks nicer than the Lenovo C20, and the extra \u00a380 buys some significant advantages: much better screen resolution, twice the memory, and a slightly faster processor. (Note: be careful not to buy an <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/hp-22-b000na-22-all-in-one-pc-white-10146433-pdt.html\">HP 22-b000na</a>, which has a dual-core Celeron J3060 instead of the quad-core chip.)</p> <h2><strong>Upmarket all-in-ones</strong></h2> <p>There are plenty of options for users with up to \u00a32,000 to spend on an all-in-one PC. The extra money usually buys you high-resolution 24in, 27in or larger screens, faster Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, dedicated graphics cards, 16GB or 32GB of memory, and very responsive SSD (solid-state disk) drives instead of slow rotating hard drives.</p> <p>There are lots of more powerful versions of the Asus Zen AiO, up to and including the <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/asus-zen-z240-all-in-one-pro-desktop-pc-intel-core-i7-32gb-ram-1tb-hdd-512gb-ssd-23-8-ultra-hd-4k-touch-screen-icicle-gold/p2961908\">Z240</a>. This has a 4K (3840 x 2160-pixel) screen, an Intel Core i7-6700T with 32GB of memory, an Nvidia GeForce GTX960M graphics card with 4GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive and a 512GB SSD for \u00a31,999.95.</p> <p>HP\u2019s Envy range also has some interesting widescreen models. The <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/hp-envy-curved-34-a090na-all-in-one-pc-intel-core-i7-8gb-ram-1tb-128gb-ssd-34-quad-hd/p2311206\">Curved 34-a090na</a>, for example, has a 34in widescreen with a resolution of 3440 x 1440 pixels, a Core i7-6700T processor and 8GB of memory for the same \u00a31,999.95 price.</p> <p>For people who prefer the macOS operating system, there are several all-in-one iMacs. The entry level model has a 21.5in screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, a Core i5, 8GB of memory and a 1TB hard drive for \u00a3899. A 4K Retina display and a faster Core i5 pushes the price up to \u00a31,119. You can also get iMacs with 27in 5120 x 2880-pixel screens, Core i5 processors and 8GB of memory for \u00a31,449 to \u00a31,849. Upgrading the top model to a fast Core i7, 32GB of memory etc enables you to spend from \u00a32,500 to well over \u00a33,000.</p> <p>However, Apple is launching some new PCs next Thursday (27 October) in San Francisco. I\u2019m not expecting the iMacs to change dramatically, but best wait and see. The Apple event will take place one day later than a Microsoft launch in New York. This could include a rumoured Surface AIO all-in-one, but it won\u2019t be cheap.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

  "<p>Near a sacred volcanic lake for the Oromo people in the Ethiopian town of Bishoftu, a boisterous crowd seized an unusual opportunity to chant anti-government slogans during their annual Irreecha cultural celebration.</p> <p>Disregarding the Oromo officials and traditional leaders at the 2 October ceremony, the youthful protesters crossed their arms in a symbol of defiance and edged forward towards police armed with batons.

The crackle of gunfire followed from armed officers and an armoured vehicle sped into action, exacerbating the panic. People fell into a deep ditch and were crushed. Others drowned in the lake, contributing to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-protests-idUSKCN1231PL?il=0\">an official death toll of 52</a>, while rights groups estimate that more than 100 died.</p> <p>Social media activists characterised the bungled dispersal as a \u201cmassacre\u201d, falsely accusing soldiers of shooting people from a helicopter, and called for \u201cfive days of rage\u201d. A week later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/ethiopia-declares-state-of-emergency-as-deadly-protests-continue\">the government announced a state of emergency</a> after protesters rampaged across Oromia, burning government buildings, and torching farms and factories.</p> <p>The events may mark a turning point in the 11-month uprising by the Oromo, Ethiopia\u2019s most populous ethnic group, who cite frustrations over political and economic marginalisation. The movement, along with a series of violent demonstrations occurring since late July in the historically powerful Amhara region, had already threatened the authority of the government, a favoured <a href=\"https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/countries/ET\">partner of the UK</a> and other donors that provide <a href=\"http://dagethiopia.org/new/oda-to-ethiopia\">close to $4bn</a> (\u00a33.2bn) in aid a year.</p> <p>The state of emergency is likely to mean the increased use of federal security forces, including the military, to quell unrest at the expense of regional states\u2019 autonomy, as well as occasional curfews and suspensions of due process. The US Department of State said the move could \u201cfurther enshrine\u201d the repression that has contributed to the crisis.<br></p> <p> The government has killed about 500 Oromo demonstrators so far during the crisis, while detaining tens of thousands more in an effort to discourage civil resistance. The message from those efforts and the latest round of unrest, however, is that it will be hard to subdue protesters, who see the government as discredited and embattled. That means the possibility of escalating violence in Africa\u2019s second-most populous nation.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government persists with the current stand, Ethiopia may be in for long-term instability,\u201d said Hassen Hussein, a US-based regional analyst who has written sympathetically about the Oromo struggle.</p> <p>The Bishoftu violence was preceded by a two-month lull, as new Oromo ruling party leaders emerged and pledged reforms. Before that, on 6 August, activists called for a day of \u201cgrand Oromo protests\u201d, which resulted in about 70 deaths and included a rare demonstration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/29/insider-guide-addis-ababa-car-crashes-coffee-contemporary-art\">Addis Ababa</a>, the capital. Federal police dispersed that rally, scattering attendees with batons and boots.</p> <p>Among those subsequently detained was an educated young man calling himself Gudina Jalata. He\u2019d previously stayed away from protests out of fear, but felt compelled to participate by witnessing continuing injustice across the sprawling region that encircles the capital. \u201cFirst you have to be respected for your dignity \u2013 that is why I got involved. There is a lot of discrimination against the Oromo,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Before the government came to power in 1991 by removing a socialist junta, Ethiopia was a unitary state. A 1995 federal constitution ensured self-rule for minorities and promoted local languages in schools and government.

Far from being oppressors, TPLF elites say their community made huge sacrifices during a 16-year struggle that liberated the Oromo and other groups from Amhara domination. They add that ethnic federalism now protects those hard-won rights, and power is shared equitably within government, while the statist development model pushed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-renaissance-meles-zenawi\">Meles Zenawi</a>, the former TPLF chairman and prime minister who died in 2012, helped Ethiopia advance.</p> <p>For Gudina and the other detainees, such claims seem fanciful. After time in a cramped cell, his group was driven to a federal police facility in the Awash area; some were held for a week and then released, others were held for up to two weeks. There were no showers or toilets and they were given only small amounts of bread and water. The camp had three components: gruelling barefoot exercises on gravel under a scorching sun, political lessons and bouts of investigation.</p> <p>The workouts included being forced to hop forwards with hands behind their head. Even the injured had to participate; if there was any slacking off, they were beaten. \u201cIt was really inhuman,\u201d Gudina said.</p> <p>Tigrayan officers, the interviewed detainees claimed, gave lessons on federalism and ruling coalition doctrines. While they felt contempt for their instructors, the prisoners were compliant, although one bucked the trend and was severely beaten. \u201cThe constitution they are teaching us is not broken by us \u2013 they themselves break the law. For example, it\u2019s our right to protest,\u201d one explained.</p> <p>Mass detention is not a new tactic for a government that has largely failed to move Ethiopia on from an authoritarian past.

The two sets of figures will be merged into the overall headline figure in January.</p> <p>John Flatley of the ONS said: \u201cViolent crime covers a wide spectrum from minor assaults, harassment and abuse that result in no physical harm to the victim through to incidents of wounding and murder.</p> <p>\u201cThe latest figures present a complex picture, with the crime survey for England and Wales estimating similar levels of violent crime to that seen in recent years, but the number of offences recorded by the police increasing.</p> <p>\u201cWe think the rise in the police figures is due to a combination of factors. First, the expansion of the police series to cover new harassment offences. Second, a greater proportion of incidents reported to the police being recorded as crimes. At the same time, the crime survey has shown a greater proportion of victims of violent crime reporting to the police. Finally, it appears there has been a small but genuine increase in some categories of violent crime.\u201d</p>",

During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal. But the justice department only sentenced Petraeus to two years\u2019 probation and a $100,000 fine, provoking accusations that this relatively lenient sentence was evidence of a double standard for the powerful. The justice department\u2019s lenience toward Petraeus actually made it more difficult, in part, for prosecutors to recommend charges against Clinton.<br><br>This week Cartwright pled guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation into leaking classified information about operations against Iran to journalists.

  "<p>Is Georges St-Pierre a UFC fighter?</p> <p>For the first time since January 2004 the answer could be something other than \u201cyes.\u201d</p> <p>After failing to finalize a new promotional contract to compete in the UFC \u2013 following a three-year hiatus and several months of negotiations \u2013 the 35-year-old welterweight announced on Monday that, per the advise of his legal counsel, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/gsp-free-agent-1.3808944\">his contract with his promoter had been breached</a> and, as a result, he was free to fight for any mixed martial arts organization he wished.</p> <p>The termination was based on St-Pierre\u2019s assertion that the UFC was required to produce an opponent and a fight date once the former welterweight champion declared he was willing, ready and able to return.</p> <p>This summer St-Pierre (25-2) made his intention to return to mixed martial arts known, going so far as to enter the UFC\u2019s antidoping testing pool. Ironically it was issues around drug testing that set off a firestorm between St-Pierre and the UFC ahead of his last bout with the company. He unsuccessfully attempted to secure third-party drug testing for himself and Johnny Hendricks ahead of their clash at UFC 167, and claimed he would not return to fighting without a third-party anti-doping testing program in place. Last year the UFC enacted one of the most stringent anti-doping programs in sports.</p> <p>This was among the significant shifts in the landscape of the UFC that occurred after St-Pierre stepped away that impacted his recent negotiations with the company.</p> <p>In 2009, St-Pierre entered into an apparel agreement with Under Armour that was considered a milestone when it was signed. The status of that deal was imperiled, however, when the UFC partnered exclusively with Reebok in 2015 and <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/the-new-ufc-reebok-deal-is-screwing-fighters-out-of-so-1704258703\">mandated that its athletes must wear Reebok gear</a>. This was a significant roadblock in the way of St-Pierre\u2019s return to the UFC, however he and his team believed they were making headway with former UFC majority owner and chairman Lorenzo Fertitta.</p> <p>Following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/11/ufc-sale-4bn-dana-white-wme-img\">the decision to sell the UFC for $4.2bn</a> this year to entertainment powerhouse WME/IMG, any chance for a resolution regarding what St-Pierre could wear in the Octagon was seemingly put to bed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/09/ufc-michael-bisping-middleweight-dan-henderson\">UFC may be \u2018half panic and half lunacy\u2019 but buzz and cash keep fighters hooked | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe put them on notice that we believe that they had not lived up to their obligation and that they had 10 days under the contract to cure that problem,\u201d said James Quinn, a respected sports litigator who was hired by St-Pierre in mid-September to determine the fighter\u2019s rights under the terms of his contract and whether or not the UFC had abided by the deal. \u201cAt the end of the 10 days they made, we believe, an ineffective attempt to cure their breach because they offered a \u2018will o\u2019 wisp\u2019 offer of a contract for a fight. No date. No time. No specifics. That obviously didn\u2019t live up to either the letter of the contract or industry practice.\u201d</p> <p>The UFC responded to St-Pierre\u2019s statements, which came during an interview on the MMA Hour on Monday, by stating that one of the best competitors and most successful box office draws ever to step into the Octagon remained under their control.</p> <p>\u201cZuffa intends to honor its agreement with St-Pierre and reserves its rights under the law to have St-Pierre do the same,\u201d the company said in a prepared statement.&#xa0;</p> <p>Acknowledging the UFC\u2019s alternate view, Quinn said whatever occurs next is up to them. &#xa0;\u201cUFC has options,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can take a legal option. We\u2019re certainly prepared to deal with all that if necessary.</p> <p>\u201cThe notion of a free agent is that he\u2019s no longer under contract to the UFC. It doesn\u2019t exclude the possibility of having a negotiation with the UFC, but obviously if he\u2019s not under contract with the UFC he has the ability to negotiate with other folks if that were to occur.\u201d</p> <p>Quinn had previously represented several parties and advised them on their rights with regards to the UFC. The language of UFC contracts are a \u201cthrowback to the 1940s,\u201d he said, when professional athletes endured limited authority over many aspects of their careers.</p> <p>\u201cBasically if you look at those contracts you have to step back and say there\u2019s no way these could possibly be legal,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at them, having been involved in all the other sports in the US, and just shake my head. This is a very, very 21st century form of slavery.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2016/1/26/10829794/ufc-antitrust-lawsuit-status-update-six-issues-strikefarce-mma-news\">An ongoing anti-trust lawsuit</a> pitting former UFC fighters and the promotion is slowly making its way through the federal court system, and Quinn said it\u2019s likely other legal challenges to the contracts will emerge. Quinn labeled the agreements \u201ccontracts of adhesion,\u201d essentially suggesting fighters signed to the UFC are put in a take-it-or-leave it position.</p> <p>Despite this, St-Pierre raked in millions of dollars and became one of mixed martial arts\u2019 first mainstream commodities while he put together an unprecedented championship run at 170lbs.</p> <p>St-Pierre walked away at the end of 2013 with the status as a major sports star in North America, especially Canada. The native of Montreal drove big business in his home nation, most notably on pay-per-view where he ranked as one of the UFC\u2019s most bankable stars.</p> <p>The UFC held 14 pay-per-view events in Canada prior to St-Pierre\u2019s departure. The five headlined by the Quebecois fighter averaged 750,000 buys, and included a massive stadium show at Rogers Centre that brought out 55,000 fans for a gate of more than $12m. Without St-Pierre, Canada-hosted pay-per-views produced just over 400,000 buys, and since his departure the UFC\u2019s business there took a sharp downturn.</p> <p>The year following St-Pierre\u2019s decision to hand over the belt, the UFC announced a five-city schedule featuring three pay-per-view events, however UFC 178 was moved to Las Vegas from Toronto and the Montreal event was scrapped. The UFC announced it would hold between three to five Canadian events in 2015, but only two took place. This year, the UFC has visited Canada twice.</p> <p>Their third card, a pay-per-view event in Toronto, is set for 10 December. It was here, in the face of UFC president Dana White\u2019s continued assertions that St-Pierre did not really want to fight, that \u201cRush\u201d was clamoring to return.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a certain mentality you have to have to be a fighter, and Georges St-Pierre hasn\u2019t had that mentality for a long time,\u201d White said on Fox Sports 1. \u201cAnd sometimes that\u2019s not a bad thing. Listen, the guy went out on top. How many athletes really go out on top? Go out the way you want to go out? The guy made a lot of money and when you take \u2013 this isn\u2019t a sport you take a three-year layoff from.\u201d</p> <p>When the UFC made it official that St-Pierre would not appear on the Toronto card, UFC light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier was left to headline against Anthony Johnson. Front row tickets are in the neighborhood of $400 a pop, and St-Pierre\u2019s camp estimated they could have gone for double the price had he appeared.</p> <p>For the first time in three years, though, St-Pierre has declared himself ready to fight. And for the first time since he stepped away from the sport in 2013, St-Pierre has a heavy hitting opponent to contend with.</p>",
  "<p>About halfway into his introduction to <a href=\"http://zestbooks.net/death/\">Death: an Oral History</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caseyjarman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Casey Jarman</a> lets the reader in on the impetus of the project: \u201cI wrote this [book] in the hopes of beating death altogether.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an impossible objective \u2013 the reader knows it, the writer knows it \u2013 but not a disingenuous one, and Jarman\u2019s literary debut is a testament to the value of doggedly pursuing a goal that has never and can never be realized. We can\u2019t beat death, but maybe we can beat fear of it. The 18 interviews contained within Death are Jarman\u2019s investigation into the possibility.</p> <p>For a writer responsible for a work so ambitious in scope and often devastating in content, Jarman is disarmingly humble and upbeat. When we speak on the phone, he immediately acknowledges his discomfort with being the interviewee and offers a precautionary apology should he come across as trying to steer the conversation. (He doesn\u2019t.) He pokes fun at himself for his desire \u2013 which he describes as being born of inherent laziness \u2013 to \u201cget out of\u201d dealing with death, and he speaks on the subject more with wonder than authority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/11/lets-talk-about-death-what-does-it-mean-to-you\">Let's talk about death: what does it mean to you?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps this is because Jarman\u2019s background is not in philosophy, or science, or any death-specific discipline. He received his journalism degree from the University of Oregon, and has since focused primarily on music, holding positions as music editor for the Portland, Oregon-based alt-weekly <a href=\"http://www.wweek.com/homepage/\">Willamette Week</a> and as managing editor at <a href=\"http://www.believermag.com/\">the Believer</a>. When his friend Adam Grano, art director at Zest Books, suggested he pitch an idea to Zest\u2019s editors, Jarman decided to pivot.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to spend a year thinking about albums or doing music criticism, which is kind of the most natural thing for me, and the one thing that\u2019s constantly on my mind is death,\u201d Jarman says. \u201cWhen I do interviews, I always wind up talking to artists who tackle that subject. One day I\u2019m not going to exist and none of the things I\u2019m doing now are going to matter \u2013 how do you come back from that? How does anybody make art or build houses or wash dishes? That\u2019s the thought I linger on every single day, and sometimes it\u2019s positive, and sometime it\u2019s negative, but it\u2019s just always been there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02a7e671ba6a83f1e86f10ab458ee47c22f995d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02a7e671ba6a83f1e86f10ab458ee47c22f995d4/0_0_3416_2809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mourners, wearing black clothing after the death of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, exit from the subway in Bangkok, Thailand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"822\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mourners, wearing black clothing after the death of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, exit from the subway in Bangkok, Thailand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His was a simple pitch on a broad theme (\u201cWhat if I talked about death with a bunch of people \u2013 people who work in death-related industries and people who\u2019ve had close emotional experiences with death?\u201d) but his limiting factors came in the form of convictions about what he didn\u2019t want the book to be. It wouldn\u2019t be \u201cX celebrity\u2019s thoughts on this or Y celebrity\u2019s thoughts on that\u201d, nor would it stray too far from the humanity of the stories. Jarman didn\u2019t speak with funeral directors or undertakers about the physicality of death. He wasn\u2019t necessarily interested in the gritty details; he wanted an inroad to the emotions surrounding it \u2013 emotions often silenced or self-censored by notions of propriety.</p> <p>Perhaps most significantly, it wouldn\u2019t be about Jarman himself, because Jarman hasn\u2019t yet been affected by a profound loss.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to be upfront about this being a curiosity to me, and I did have a certain sense of feeling like an imposter,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so grateful to everyone that I spoke with for giving me such emotional access, but there were a lot of times when I\u2019d be sitting in a room with someone and we both knew there was that bridge that neither of us could fully cross. Nobody could really explain loss to me in a way that I would fully understand, and I couldn\u2019t quite ask the right questions. It was a lot of fumbling.\u201d</p> <p>The fumbling is one way in which the format mirrors the content \u2013 meandering stories about groping for a clear path through grief. Jarman largely steps out of the way of the narratives, removing his voice save for his introductions to the book and each interview. The result is an unhindered intimacy with each subject: the scientist whose sister\u2019s death spurred her research in a \u201cpsychedelic hospice\u201d, the former death row warden now working to repeal the death penalty, the Black Lives Matter activist trying to find solace in proactive grief, the social worker grappling with her mother\u2019s recent death, to name just a few.</p> <p>Still, Jarman\u2019s presence is felt through the reader\u2019s experience of yearning for a solution that simply doesn\u2019t exist. His curation keeps the book agnostic, not only in the literal sense of presenting the possibilities of multiple belief systems, but also in its refusal to settle on any one ritual, coping mechanism, or method of grieving as the correct or optimal action in the face of death \u2013 whether one\u2019s own, or of a loved one. The frustrating fact is there is no right way of handling it, but perhaps the most consistent theme throughout each interview is a collective impulse toward preparation, a desire to do work now that would ensure future resilience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82c55cae1997e6a52a5f3ed4daf0814f019b73a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82c55cae1997e6a52a5f3ed4daf0814f019b73a3/0_0_2228_1506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ivy and other plants grow over the gravestones at Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivy and other plants grow over the gravestones at Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol, England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Usually this prep work is in deliberate exposure. In one interview, Holly Pruett, a memorial officiant and organizer of <a href=\"http://deathcafe.com/\">Death Cafes</a> in Portland, Oregon, says she became interested in social gatherings built around discussions of death because, \u201cI thought at the time, maybe I could befriend the concept of death and just develop a greater capacity to handle it, be more prepared.\u201d Undoubtedly this book is Jarman\u2019s own exercise in preparation for the inevitability of death, though he now acknowledges its futility.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality of the situation is that there are muscles you have that you don\u2019t know exist until you\u2019re grieving for someone,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom what I learned from everyone I talked to, if you try to prepare for the steps you\u2019re going to have to take when something awful happens, 99% of the time you\u2019re going to find yourself taking wholly unexpected steps when you actually confront the terrible thing. Grief isn\u2019t something that you do, it\u2019s something that happens to you. The best you can do is prepare to be moved how everything moves you.\u201d</p> <p>But all hope is not lost. The collection never falls into the gratuitously maudlin or morbid. Yes, it will make you cry in public, but those hoping for tragedy porn should look elsewhere. Jarman recalls being surprised often throughout the interviews, but most keenly when subjects \u2013 especially those who \u201chad more than a professional relationship with death\u201d \u2013 found their way to a discussion of the beautiful moments, or as Jarman calls it, the \u201cart to death\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo many people talked about a kind of beauty that\u2019s inherent in the process of being there as someone\u2019s dying, or going through the grieving process. There\u2019s a lot of garbage, of course, but there are also these beautiful moments, and especially in the outpouring of support and sympathy and love.\u201d</p> <p>And though Jarman isn\u2019t cured of his fear of death, he at least has mitigated it \u2013 thanks, in large part, to his conscious attempt at breaking through the silence that usually surrounds it.</p> <p>\u201cSix months ago, I don\u2019t know that I would\u2019ve had this answer, but now I do feel a little more at peace with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we have real conversations about what death means to us, and what our friends and family members have gone through around death, then suddenly it\u2019s not such a crazy albatross to drag around any more. I left this process with a bigger toolkit, not even so much to deal with death but just to be a human being.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to solve this riddle,\u201d he adds, laughing. \u201cThat used to frustrate the hell out of me. Now I\u2019m kind of intrigued by it.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Death: An Oral History is available in the US from Zest Books.</li> </ul>",

His arrival certainly came as a surprise for followers of the Yellow Canaries.</p> <p>Turkish football is no stranger to extravagant welcoming parties for new signings but the arrival of Van&#xa0;Persie set a precedent. By the time of his arrival at the Sabiha Gokcen airport the party was in full swing. Thousands turned out to welcome the player to Istanbul. Flares were lit. The crowds had already been chanting his name for a good hour. Television channels were tracking his flight live on air. Once the private jet in which Van&#xa0;Persie arrived had landed, it was pandemonium. There was a carnival atmosphere. A sea of raucous supporters jumping up and down smothered in a thick clouds of colourful smoke from the flares, with some fans crowd-surfing in order to get to the front and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2015/jul/13/sport-picture-of-the-day-fenerbahce-fans-go-wild-for-robin-van-persie\" title=\"\">grab a glimpse of their new star acquisition</a>.</p> <p>For Van Persie it came as a shock . \u201cI have seen a lot over the years but I have never seen anything like this,\u201d he told a TV crew at the time. \u201cI hope that I\u2019m going to make you happy. It\u2019s an honour.\u201d</p> <p>The forward was a huge star in the Premier League but in his first evening in Istanbul he had reached a new level of cult status. It was love at first sight, but this story of romance also has a villain \u2013 the former Fenerbahce head coach Vitor Pereira felt it necessary to demonstrate his control over the team by showing he had the power to play and drop anybody. And that included Van&#xa0;Persie.</p> <p>Pereira\u2019s plan soon backfired as fans grew increasingly frustrated that Fernand\u00e3o \u2013 who had been Super Lig\u2019s top scorer the previous season for Bursaspor \u2013 locked down a starting spot ahead of Van&#xa0;Persie. To make matters worse, Pereira played a brand of football that was lacking in flair and attacking guile. After a summer of big spending \u2013 approximately \u00a322.9m \u2013 and bringing in attacking talents such as Van&#xa0;Persie, Nani, Diego and Lazar Markovic, expectations were high. Fenerbahce had a squad most other teams in the league could only dream of, but they were not displaying that on the pitch.</p> <p>In fairness to Pereira, the Portuguese was in charge of a side in transition, one newly built at great expense that required time to gel. Results-wise, Fenerbahce actually had a decent 2015\u201116 league season; they dropped just six points at home and finished second, beaten to the title by a Besiktas team that had been building up steam over the previous two seasons.</p> <p>For Van Persie, however, often watching on from the substitutes bench, it had been a frustrating campaign. A few months in he said: \u201cTo be honest, I am not very happy at this moment. I was not happy that I started on the bench. I am fully fit, physically very well and able to play for 90 minutes. The only right answer I could give was with what I did: helping the team to get the victory.\u201d</p> <p>The Dutchman still managed to score 22 goals in all competitions and, in general, he settled well to life in Turkey. His son Shaqueel enrolled in the Fenerbahce academy and his wife Bouchra learned Turkish to the point she felt confident enough to give an interview to the media agency DHA in her new language. \u201cWe are happy in Istanbul as a family, it is a huge city like London,\u201d she said. \u201cJust as crowded, multicultural, with all the shops and a warmer climate.\u201d</p> <p>This season Van Persie has featured in five of Fenerbahce\u2019s seven Super Lig fixtures, not to mention their two Europa League qualifiers and two Europa League group matches, scoring once. And this has come under a new manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/15/dick-advocaat-fenerbahce-coach-holland\" title=\"\">after Pereira was sacked</a> in August following the club\u2019s defeat against Monaco in the Champions League qualifiers. Dick Advocaat came in and, having lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/05/valencia-nani-signing-fenerbahce\" title=\"\">Nani to Valencia</a>, signed Jeremain Lens, who played under the Dutchman at Sunderland, and the former Yellow Canaries striker Moussa Sow on loan from Al-Ahli in Dubai.</p> <p>Another summer of transition has told on the pitch, with Fenerbahce sitting ninth in the Super Lig, eight points behind the joint leaders, Basaksehir, Besiktas and Galatasaray. But they arrive in Manchester in decent European form having taken four points from their opening two Group&#xa0;A fixtures. Van Persie is fit and almost certain to start.</p> <p>Back in 1996, Elvir Bolic scored the winning goal in Fenerbahce\u2019s 1-0 win against United at Old Trafford. Van&#xa0;Persie has yet to have a defining moment for his latest club and for the 33-year-old there could be no greater one than emulating Bolic and scoring against his old one on Thursday.</p>",

Guns for votes, Labor thundered in the chamber, not quite believing its luck.</p> <p>And the facts stranded Abbott, particularly after he doubled down, saying his office had known nothing about that arm twisting and bargaining in the Senate \u2013 which would be unusual to say the least, given that the main complaint about the Abbott office is that nothing got done without Peta Credlin\u2019s approval.</p> <p>In Abbott\u2019s mind, the sunset clause was a temporary sop to the Nationals, who want to import the guns, not a sop to Leyonhjelm \u2013 which was probably true, or at least true enough, but saying it out loud did hang Dutton and Keenan out to dry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2016/oct/20/heres-why-gun-control-advocates-want-to-restrict-the-adler-shotgun-interactive\">Here's why gun control advocates want to restrict the Adler shotgun</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saying it out loud meant that Dutton and Keenan had hoodwinked a critical crossbencher, which is an intolerable position to find yourself in if you are cabinet ministers who need to work with the Senate crossbenchers to achieve the government\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>So Tony got a taste of his own medicine in an extraordinary question time, where the Coalition indulged its own civil war on the floor of the House of Representatives.

  "<p> A radical overhaul of Westminster constituency boundaries in Scotland has been condemned as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d by both the Scottish National party and Scottish Labour.</p> <p>The proposals from the Boundary Commission for Scotland leave only one existing constituency unchanged, in addition to two island groupings protected by legislation. They come a month after similar plans for England and Wales were dismissed as gerrymandering by Labour, after analysts suggested they could result in the opposition losing 23 sitting MPs.</p> <p>The changes, initiated by David Cameron as part of an effort to cut the number of politicians in the House of Commons from 650 to 600, will result in the number of Westminster constituencies north of the border being reduced from 59 to 53.</p> <p>Two of these 53 \u2013 Na h-Eileanan an Iar, or the Western Isles, and Orkney and Shetland \u2013 are defined in legislation and will not be subject to change. </p> <p>The shifting boundaries aim to ensure that each person\u2019s vote is of similar value by equalising the number of registered voters in each constituency to within 5% of 74,769, and will inevitably hit the SNP, which won 56 seats out of 59 in the 2015 general election, hardest. Only 11 existing Scottish constituencies have electorates within 5% of the quota, largely because of the country\u2019s divergent population distribution between rural and urban areas. </p> <p>The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, described the proposals as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The newly elected SNP deputy leader said: \u201cAt a time when Scotland already faces a deep and growing democratic deficit, with a Tory government that we didn\u2019t vote for imposing increasingly rightwing policies against our will, it is vital that the Scottish people have strong elected representation at Westminster to stand up for Scotland\u2019s interests and to hold the UK government to account.\u201d</p> <p>Robertson added: \u201cFurthermore, it is outrageous and undemocratic that the UK government is planning to cut the number of Scottish MPs while it continues to pack the unelected and unaccountable House of Lords with yet more Tory donors and cronies to do the government\u2019s bidding.\u201d</p> <p>The proposals include a significant redrawing of constituency boundaries in the north of Scotland, with the largest new constituency by area, Highland North, taking in Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross along with the bulk of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, currently held by the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford.</p> <p>Blackford told the Guardian that the plans showed little appreciation of geography, or the particular challenges of representing a widely spread constituency. \u201cIt is not right to have such large constituencies in the north of Scotland. It would appear from the plans that about 50% of the land mass of Scotland is to be represented by three MPs, which brings about basic issues of democratic accountability and accessibility to constituents.\u201d</p> <p>Proposed changes to urban areas have also drawn criticism. Plans to cut Glasgow\u2019s constituencies to six would leaving the city\u2019s seven sitting SNP MPs facing a round of musical chairs.</p> <p>Scottish Labour\u2019s Westminster spokesman, Ian Murray, described plans for six new constituencies for Edinburgh as being drawn \u201cby someone who knows very little about our capital city\u201d.</p> <p>Murray\u2019s own constituency of Edinburgh South would face a split between the once traditionally Labour-supporting Edinburgh East, whose voters migrated to the SNP at the last election, and the more affluent Edinburgh South West and Central seat. He said: \u201cThe proposals would split communities down the middle, with one seat stretching from Bonaly Country Park in the shadow of the Pentland Hills all the way to the top of Leith Walk in the city centre.\u201d</p> <p>Murray said: \u201cThese Tory proposals to redraw constituency boundaries are unfair, undemocratic and unacceptable. They are based on an out-of-date version of the electoral register with nearly two million voters across the UK missing.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, ministers have argued that cutting the number of MPs will save the taxpayer \u00a312m, but David Cameron created scores of extra unelected peers in the House of Lords, costing \u00a334m. Labour has proposed abolishing the House of Lords, replacing it with an elected senate of the nations and regions.\u201d</p> <p>Prior to publication, the prospect was raised of the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, the only Tory MP in Scotland, losing his seat to the SNP. However, the planned changes to his Dumfriesshire constituency appear to take only a bite of the central belt likely to be diluted by still more of the rural Conservative demographic that elected him previously.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The UK minister for the constitution, Chris Skidmore, said the proposals, which will now be subject to consultation, with final recommendations submitted to the Commons in autumn 2018, would cut the cost of politics.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring fair and equal representation for the voting public across the UK is in place by the next general election.\u201d</p>",

This will have minimal impact on the majority of firearm owners in the Territory.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said: \u201cCurrently, the majority of states and territories, including Victoria, support reclassification of the Adler to ensure we restrict its access.</p> <p>\u201cThis needs to be a national approach and in the spirit of the national firearms agreement.</p> <p>\u201cIf the states can\u2019t agree at tomorrow\u2019s meeting of ministers, then the current importation ban on the Adler put in place by the commonwealth will continue.\u201d</p> <p>The Australian Capital Territory was in caretaker mode <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/16/act-election-labor-light-rail-and-the-liberal-surge-that-never-eventuated\">after the recent election</a>. But a spokesman for ACT Labor said: \u201cFrom the ACT\u2019s perspective, if and when the commonwealth seeks input on whether to allow importation of the Adler A110 and other lever-action shot guns, a reelected ACT Labor government will strongly argue that such weapons are unnecessary, potentially very dangerous, and should not be allowed in the country.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the Turnbull government is even considering watering down Australia\u2019s gun-control regulations for political purposes. ACT Labor will not be supporting any watering down on gun control in his country.\u201d</p> <p>The Tasmanian government did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>The Western Australian premier, Colin Barnett, has already signalled he wants the ban to remain in place.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Queensland police minister, Bill Byrne, said: \u201cThe minister will not be commenting before the meeting. He is looking forward to hearing what is said at the meeting.\u201d</p> <p>The Gun Control Australia chair, Sam Lee, said \u201ccategory A and B firearms are the most commonly registered firearms in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIt is estimated around 83% of firearm licence holders own a category A licence and around 70% own a category B licence. In fact, many firearm licence holders hold both a category A and B licence.</p> <p>\u201cChanging the Adler from a cat A to a cat B would be like a car changing lanes in a traffic jam \u2013 it won\u2019t make much difference.\u201d </p> <p>New South Wales Greens MP David Shoebridge took particular aim at the NSW government\u2019s decision.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Mike Baird at his tricky best, pretending to support a national ban on this dangerous weapon and then agreeing to a reclassification which would pave the way for its importation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course the Adler A110 should be reclassified as the dangerous category 3 weapon that it is. The current state of play that sees this multi-round shotgun have the same classification as an air rifle is just ridiculous.</p> <p>\u201cFirearms ownership in NSW is only increasing, and there is absolutely no need to allow this weapon to be added the already overstocked arsenals around the state.\u201d</p> <p>A separate proposal has been floated by the NSW government to wind back restrictions on heavy firearms classified as category D weapons that could allow people to obtain an \u201cunlimited\u201d number of pump action or semi-automatic shotguns.

The migration of displaced people is massive and ongoing. Yes, more will come, however many fences are erected; yes, immigration has effects. It is no good simply saying that we are a rich country and can afford it, when so many feel very far from rich.

  "<p>Google has finally launched an own-brand smartphone, the Pixel, to challenge Apple head on and provide a premium Android experience with the hardware tailored to the software by the people who actually make it..<br></p> <p>The new smartphone succeeds Google\u2019s Nexus line of devices and the company claims that the Pixel is now 100% Google, unlike the Nexus devices where Google provided the software and had some input into the devices but not total control. The Pixel phone joins the Pixel C Android tablet and Chromebook Pixel as Google\u2019s first in-house devices. </p> <p>But for Google, the Pixel isn\u2019t just a smartphone, it\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/05/google-pixel-phone-market-apple-iphone\">referendum on whether Google</a> as a brand sells.</p> <h2>Wedge shape</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53744fcfc7f54caeb4cd76be62846d405edf7047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53744fcfc7f54caeb4cd76be62846d405edf7047/1_0_3875_2326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pixel is thicker at one end, but you might not notice unless someone pointed it out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With an all-metal body, all-glass display, rock-solid build, fingerprint scanner and headphones socket, the Pixel ticks most of the boxes expected of top-end smartphone, except for a lack of waterproofing. It\u2019s slightly different looking too, with a glass panel covering the top third of the back and a wedge-shape that\u2019s thicker at the top and hides any camera lump. How attractive it is as a design divides opinion.</p> <p>The Pixel feels great in the hand, with nicely curved edges and flat sides that make it easy to grip and hold on to. It\u2019s also not too thick, with the wedge shape meaning the bit you hold is thin and has good weight distribution.</p> <p>At the Pixel\u2019s base it is 7.3mm thick and it weighs 143g. In comparison to the competition, namely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/iphone-7-review-poor-battery-life\">Apple\u2019s 7.1mm thick, 138g iPhone 7</a> and Samsung\u2019s 7.9mm thick, 152g Galaxy S7, the Pixel is right in the middle. It\u2019s thinner than last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/google-nexus-5x-review-android-60-marshmallow-smartphone-battery\">7.9mm thick Nexus 5X</a> and but 7g heavier.</p> <p>The Pixel has a 5in full HD AMOLED screen on the front, which makes it one of the smaller premium smartphones available, with most others having 5.1in or larger screens. The display is crisp and vibrant, with deep blacks and excellent viewing angles. It\u2019s relatively easy to read in direct sunlight too, making it one of the best displays fitted to a smartphone, although not quite as good as Samsung\u2019s best.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen:</strong> 5in 1080p AMOLED (441ppi)</li> <li><strong>Processor: </strong>quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821</li> <li><strong>RAM: </strong>4GB of RAM</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 32 or 128GB</li> <li><strong>Operating system: </strong>Android 7.1 Nougat</li> <li><strong>Camera:</strong> 12.3MP rear camera, 8MP front-facing camera</li> <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-C and GPS</li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 143.8 x 69.5 x 7.3-8.6 mm</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 143g</li> </ul> <h2>DayDream ready</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"465ed67410edaf8a460385cff07ed82d407ebc7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/465ed67410edaf8a460385cff07ed82d407ebc7c/0_0_3262_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s Pixel still has a headphone socket, but doesn\u2019t actually come with any headphones in the box.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pixel is one of the first handsets to use Qualcomm\u2019s new Snapdragon 821 processor, which is essentially a tweaked version of the 820 found in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/oneplus-3-review-flagship-phone-at-mid-range-price\">OnePlus 3</a> and other smartphones.</p> <p>Performance is not an issue. From Prisma images to graphically intensive games, the Pixel chewed through everything I threw at it, which you\u2019d expect for a \u00a3600 smartphone. It\u2019s one of the most powerful Android smartphones currently available. It\u2019s well optimised, snappy, fast and, perhaps most impressively, it doesn\u2019t get that hot when under load.</p> <p>Most smartphones heat up considerably when downloading a lot of data, such as when setting up a phone, but the Pixel didn\u2019t. It also ran games such as Dan the Man without heating up in the slightest, where last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/google-nexus-5x-review-android-60-marshmallow-smartphone-battery\">Nexus 5X</a> became noticeably hot.</p> <p>The Pixel is also the first smartphone to be certified for use with Google\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/google-launch-pixel-xl-iphone#img-4\">DayDream virtual reality platform</a>. Whether that means anything in reality will depend on how successful Google\u2019s latest push for VR ends up being. It\u2019s not yet available, so how it performs is still unknown.</p> <h2>A day between charges</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"242f9bea2af1ca3213fd130ab187e220b0766b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/242f9bea2af1ca3213fd130ab187e220b0766b6a/1_0_4072_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The USB and single speaker at the bottom (the left-side hole).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Using the Pixel as my primary device, it lasted just over 24 hours without charging, managing three hours of app usage and browsing, hundreds of emails and push notifications, a couple of photos, five hours of music over Bluetooth headphones and the odd game of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.dantheman\">Dan the Man</a> during my one hour and 20-minute train commute to and from work. It means you\u2019ll get through a day and a night out, but you\u2019ll have to charge it overnight or it\u2019ll most likely be dead before you get to work the next day.</p> <p>The Pixel has fast charging through USB-C\u2019s power delivery specification, not Qualcomm\u2019s QuickCharge or any other accelerated charging system. A full charge from completely flat took one hour 45 minutes, reaching 25% capacity in about 15 minutes, 40% in 25 minutes and 66% in about 50 minutes. It\u2019s not the fastest charging smartphone available, but it\u2019s considerably faster than Apple\u2019s iPhone 7. </p> <h2>Android 7.1 Nougat</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd983680d868f1ec71caaffd8c608af066806dec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd983680d868f1ec71caaffd8c608af066806dec/0_0_4521_2713/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pixel comes installed with Google\u2019s latest launcher complete with a new-look homescreen and app drawer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pixel comes with the latest version of Android 7.1 Nougat and is the first smartphone to do so. Most other smartphones are still running Android 6 Marshmallow, let alone version 7 or 7.1.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/android-7-nougat-review-battery-life-multitasking-operation-notifications-facial-recognition-android\">Android 7.0 Nougat</a> introduced some solid battery and time-saving features, which are all present on the Pixel. Google\u2019s version of Nougat 7.1 introduces a few more new and useful things including the ability to block visual alerts when do not disturb is activated, such as the flashing LED notification light \u2013 handy for those that charge their smartphone overnight next to their heads.</p> <p>The Pixel also has a new version of Google\u2019s launcher \u2013 previously known as the Google Now launcher \u2013 which shipped with Nexus devices and is available for other <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.launcher\">Android smartphones and tablets on the Play Store</a>. The Pixel\u2019s launcher has a new-look Google search bar and home screen weather widget, neither of which can be removed limiting vertical icon space to four rows, and now hides the app drawer behind a swipe up from the five-icon-wide tray at the bottom of the screen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa5f87817f86e99bb737a00ad4f7c5cae1efbc21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa5f87817f86e99bb737a00ad4f7c5cae1efbc21/0_0_4620_2772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Launcher shortcuts pop-up on a tap and hold, but can be dragged from the menu to make a dedicated icon for the shortcut on the homescreen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest functional change for the home screen, however, is the new launcher shortcuts, which mirror Apple\u2019s 3D touch gestures on iOS, but without the need for a pressure-sensitive screen. Tapping and holding an app icon pops up a list of quick actions, from phone calls to specific people to recent text messages, options to jump straight to a selfie or video in the camera app, and other similar functions.</p> <p>The launcher shortcuts can also be dragged from the main app to quick buttons on the home screen, meaning a button for jumping straight to the front-facing camera for a selfie can be placed anywhere on the home screen for one-tap access.</p> <p>Most of Google\u2019s apps support the new feature, while some third-party apps, including Evernote will soon be updated to add quick actions of their own. How much utility you get out of them will depend on which apps you use, but being able to pin launcher actions as a separate icon to the home screen could be useful for some commonly used functions.</p> <p>Google\u2019s also included a collection of attractive live wallpapers that change in real time while the screen is on. A collection of Google Earth shots pan across a view of fields in Kent or the Pantheon in Rome, while live data wallpapers display battery charge levels, the current weather conditions, or the time. There\u2019s also the option to cycle through a collection of still images on a daily basis for various different topics such as cityscapes, aerial shots, landscapes and other themes.</p> <p>Android 7.1 also now has a built-in night mode, which aims to reduce blue tones from the display to limit the amount of blue light shone into the eyes during the hours of darkness. Doing so is meant to help smartphone users sleep by stopping the blue wavelengths of light stimulating cells in our eyes and waking us up. Third-party apps have been doing similar for a while and Apple added a night mode to iOS 9.3, so it\u2019s not a new feature, but it is good to see built into Android.</p> <h2>Google Assistant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4964fd3937e9073366f5468d4f2db7360294e5ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4964fd3937e9073366f5468d4f2db7360294e5ba/0_0_4338_2603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google Assistant hides under the home button, ready to answer questions and perform basic functions such as setting timers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most hyped feature of Google\u2019s new version of Android <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/google-launch-new-assistant-home\">Google Assistant</a>, formerly known as Google Now. The biggest difference is now it will talk back to you and is much more focused on conversational voice interaction. You ask a question, it answers but keeps listening for a follow-up command or further questions about the subject.</p> <p>Activated by either a long press on the home button or by saying \u201cOK, Google\u201d, Assistant can perform quick tasks such as setting timers, sending messages and playing music, fire up searches and other standard virtual-assistant functions, but it is also the most personal Google assistant to date. It will actively learn from your preferences, either by your searches or by your explicit command.</p> <p>For users or any other Android smartphone, Assistant is essentially a slightly better Google Now with a much clearer name, but it\u2019s also one of the most capable voice assistants available and makes Apple\u2019s Siri look a bit behind the times. Google\u2019s voice recognition is top notch, and it has access to so much more data it\u2019s more surprising when it can\u2019t answer a fact-based question than when it can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"babea087986ac50f523dbfa3c6c1f9ab78ade0d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/babea087986ac50f523dbfa3c6c1f9ab78ade0d0/0_0_4026_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pixel, phone by Google.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It will apparently eventually be able to interact with third-party apps and services allowing users to simply say \u201cOK, Google, order me an Uber\u201d or similar, but they\u2019re not available yet. You can also only directly interact with Assistant via voice from the launcher, but you can type text into the Google search bar or in Allo. It seemed an odd omission, as there were times when I wanted to silently ask it a question using the keyboard.</p> <p>To get the most out of it you must give your digital life over to Google and that certainly has some privacy implications \u2013 it knows where you are, what you\u2019re searching for, can read what\u2019s on the screen and collates all that data \u2013 but that isn\u2019t a new phenomenon and is simply a progression of what Google\u2019s been doing for the last couple of years on Android. Whether that matters to you depends on whether you trust Google. You do not have to use Assistant, it can be turned off.</p> <p>The real promise of Google Assistant, however, is that no matter where you interact with it, it\u2019s the same assistant. For UK users the Pixel phone and Google\u2019s Allo app are the only two places Assistant is available for active interaction, but US users will also be able to buy Google Home, an Amazon Echo competitor. Home will also come to the UK next year.</p> <p>Google Assistant isn\u2019t a massive step forward in the AI wars, but it\u2019s a solid start for Google in the next phase of conversational assistants. If you\u2019re expecting it to know and be able to do everything about the phone, your life and other things a flesh-and-blood personal assistant might, you\u2019ll be disappointed.</p> <h2>Fingerprint scanner</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"827dd31a461b85ce5e6ae58ef7ad4a8ce158322d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/827dd31a461b85ce5e6ae58ef7ad4a8ce158322d/0_0_4503_2702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fingerprint scanner on the back doubles as a pad to swipe down the notification shade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year\u2019s Google Nexus phones had brilliant fingerprint scanners on the back. The Pixel continues to use the same winning formula: it\u2019s fast, accurate and can now be used to bring down the notification shade with a swipe on the pad \u2013 something other manufacturers including Huawei have been doing for a while. The Pixel Imprint scanner is arguably the best in the business, but if you use your phone on a desk, you can\u2019t activate it without picking it up.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cec53afc436d77fc8ab49eb3513a2a94fd39c3d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cec53afc436d77fc8ab49eb3513a2a94fd39c3d0/1_0_4617_2771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camera app has a few more bells and whistles, but doesn\u2019t have the extensive manual controls third-party camera apps have from Samsung, Huawei, LG and others.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pixel\u2019s 12.3-megapixel camera is cracking. Camera rating firm DxoMark ranked it slightly above all other smartphone cameras and it\u2019s clear why, as it\u2019s very difficult to take a rubbish photo with it.</p> <p>In good light you get crisp, well judged photos with an excellent amount of fine detail. Google\u2019s HDR+ feature is particularly good, producing some of the best high dynamic range photos I\u2019ve seen and without the image blur that can creep in with other systems.</p> <p>Low and poor light performance is also excellent, despite the camera not having optical image stabilisation, while the Google Camera app now has some much needed extra features, including the ability to switch the automatic white balance with the tap of a button and a golden ratio grid, which helps you frame your photos. The camera struggled to correctly identify office fluorescent lighting, however, leaving images with a yellow tint. Selecting the fluorescent lighting option corrected it.</p> <p>Full manual control isn\u2019t included \u2013 you\u2019ll need a third-party app for that \u2013 but it has most of what many will need on a day to day basis. Shooting burst photos by holding down the shutter button even creates a gif out of the resulting stills.</p> <p>The 8-megapixel selfie camera is also very good, producing images with good depth and colour. Most selfie cameras are either soft and lack detail or hard and capture every wrinkle and pore on the face, but the Pixel\u2019s treads that fine line with soft, flattering focus without losing too much detail.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af0f6e657da8571a5e6db8887564c039b516e5f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af0f6e657da8571a5e6db8887564c039b516e5f5/0_0_3725_2235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"google pixel review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The back has a glass panel covering the top third of the device.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>The glass panel on the back aids grip by the index finger</li> <li>It only has one down-firing speaker on the bottom, which is easily blocked by hands when gaming</li> <li>Google Photos on the Pixel comes with free, unlimited full resolution photo and video backup, not just up to 16MP and 1080p video</li> <li>The notification LED is not enabled by default, but is available in notification settings</li> <li>Gif search is built into Google\u2019s Keyboard for apps that support it such as SMS Messenger app</li> <li>The calendar app now shows the correct date on the home screen</li> <li>The charging meter is inaccurate: at 96% it says four minutes until done but took 17 minutes to reach 100%</li> <li>Wallpapers are normally things I set and forget, but I really liked the new live Google Earth images</li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Pixel costs \u00a3599 with 32GB of storage or \u00a3699 with 128GB of storage in black or silver. It is also available in blue in the US.</p> <p>For comparison, Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/iphone-7-review-poor-battery-life\">iPhone 7 costs \u00a3599</a> with 32GB of storage, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 costs around \u00a3500, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/18/huawei-p9-review-smartphone-leica-camera-fingerprint-scanner-emui-software\">Huawei P9 costs \u00a3449</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/14/oneplus-3-review-flagship-phone-at-mid-range-price\">OnePlus 3 costs \u00a3329</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Pixel is an interesting device. A phone designed by Google, the maker of Android. The software side is top notch: the smoothest, newest and best optimised version of Android available at the moment and most probably into the future, what with rapid updates coming straight from Google.</p> <p>But the phone itself is only up to par with the best of the rest and not leagues ahead.

  "<p>Japan is likely to face international criticism at a whaling summit this week for killing whales in the Southern Ocean in defiance of a court ruling.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160325-Japan-whaling-minke-whales-Antarctica/\">Japanese fleets killed more than 300 minke whales</a>, many of them pregnant, when they resumed so-called scientific whaling in 2015-16 after a hiatus the year before because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/31/japanese-whaling-halt-antarctic-international-court\">international court of justice decided the hunts were not scientific and should cease</a>.</p> <p>Pro-conservation countries at the International Whaling Commission\u2019s (IWC) biennial conference, which opens in Slovenia on Thursday, will step up pressure on Japan. The meeting comes during the 30th anniversary of the commission\u2019s whaling ban, which is estimated to have saved more than 100,000 whales despite Japan, Norway and Iceland killing whales via loopholes.</p> <p>Australia has put forward <a href=\"http://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/iwc6611_dr_on_improving_the_review_process_for_whaling_under_special_permit.pdf\">a resolution</a> to the conference that would require Japan to get approval from the IWC for its \u201cscientific\u201d quotas. Countries may also formally rebuke Japan for flouting the court ruling.</p> <p>\u201cJapan\u2019s unilateral resumption of its so-called \u2018scientific\u2019 hunt in the Southern Ocean last year is a slap in the face not just for the International Whaling Commission but also for the rule of law, as the international court of justice clearly ruled Japan\u2019s previous Antarctic \u2018research\u2019 programme to be illegal,\u201d said Kitty Block, vice-president of the Humane Society International.<br></p> <p>But Japan will fire back with <a href=\"http://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/iwc6616_discussion_paper_on_ways_forward_on_stcw.pdf\">its own proposal</a> to allow small-scale hunting of whales in its territorial waters, a plan which it has doggedly pushed for decades despite being <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2016.00121/full\">defeated 17 times at previous IWC meetings</a>. Japanese officials argue such \u201ccoastal whaling\u201d could be done without harming whale stocks.</p> <p>Ghana, Ivory Coast and Guinea have put forward a separate draft resolution calling for whale meat to address food shortages in developing countries, a move which would help Japan, which has stores of frozen whale meat. The sale of whale meat internationally is banned, with a few exceptions. But earlier this week a UK-based wildlife charity, Whale and Dolphin Conservation, <a href=\"http://us.whales.org/news/2016/10/illegal-sale-of-japanese-whale-meat-exposed-by-wdc-on-eve-of-international-whaling-0\">revealed that a Japanese website had been illegally selling whale meat overseas</a>. </p> <p>A plan to create a whale sanctuary is also on the agenda of the whaling conference, though it requires three-quarters of countries voting to support it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/16/japan-opposes-marine-sanctuary-whales-international-whaling-commission\">Japan has previously led opposition to the sanctuary</a> and is expected to be successful at doing so again at the meeting, which runs until 28 October.</p> <p>The UK government is strongly opposed to whaling and the so-called scientific whaling that Japan undertakes, but is not opposed to the exemptions granted for indigenous people for subsistence. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the environment department said: \u201cThe UK has a strong track record in global wildlife conservation and we fully support the existing ban on commercial whaling. We will continue to champion the protection and welfare of whales and other cetaceans, both here and overseas.\u201d<br></p>",

We look at regulations all the time. I moved to disallow a few of them. <strong>There is no such thing as an automatic sunset clause in regulations.</strong> That is just false.

The sunset clause is about to kick in. \u201cIt was a week before the 12 months was up and it was about to kick in so the ban would be lifted. We did a deal. You are renegotiating on the deal. His answer was, \u201cWe never intended to allow it in anyway.\u201d <strong>In other words, they were intending to do me over.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Q: Has it hardened since what happened this week?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it has made it a bit more awkward.

The administrators were called in in April this year, later leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a pensions black hole.</p> <p>On Tuesday Green made a last-ditch plea to save his knighthood, hinting that he is close to agreeing a rescue deal for the BHS pension fund and stating he is \u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d for the collapse of the business.</p> <p>In an interview with ITV News Green said his advisers were engaged in \u201cstrong dialogue\u201d with the Pensions Regulator. \u201cIf we arrive at the place where we hope to arrive, there will be no requirement for [industry lifeboat] the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) [to step in],\u201d he said. He would not put a figure on the amount he was prepared to invest in a rescue scheme but said he believed the situation was fixable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbd16746eba5e162b75ed72387dc87d445ae2f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbd16746eba5e162b75ed72387dc87d445ae2f41/0_0_2634_1581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green during his ITV News interview.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green during his ITV News interview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV News/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The regulator later issued a statement saying it had \u201cyet to receive a comprehensive and credible written proposal and have made clear what we require in this regard\u201d. But it is understood that all sides are hoping to reach some kind of agreement before the year end.</p> <p>Chris Martin, chair of the BHS pension fund\u2019s board of trustees, told MPs at a new work and pensions committee inquiry into pensions regulation on Wednesday that discussions are continuing with Green. But he said there was no \u201csingle concrete proposal on the table at the moment\u201d.</p> <p>Martin told the committee that pension holders were not likely to get the full benefits they had expected before the collapse of BHS, although his aim was to secure a better deal than that offered under the PPF.</p> <p>\u201cI think the trustees have to be realistic about this, on behalf of the members,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cSettling somewhere between PPF and full benefits might be the best outcome that can be delivered.\u201d</p> <p>Ros Altmann, the former minister of state for pensions, also told the committee that she was \u201cpuzzled\u201d as to why Green didn\u2019t seek clearance from the Pensions Regulator before selling BHS in 2015. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve not seen or understood was what plan there was for how the pensions deficit was going to be paid once the business had been sold,\u201d Lady Altmann said.</p> <p>Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee \u2013 which was one of two select committees that undertook the inquiry into BHS earlier this year, said on Wednesday that he believed there was little to justify Green holding on to his knighthood.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe key thing was coming up with a generous pension settlement, but he\u2019s never done so. The flavour of this would change if he put concrete proposals which ensured that the pensioners were better off than they are now, heading for the Pension Protection Fund, that would help.\u201d</p> <p>The debate on Thursday will not automatically lead to a vote among MPs, but will be subject to the speaker\u2019s approval. If MPs do vote to strip Green of his prestigious title, it would be \u201cpersuasive\u201d only. The house\u2019s honours forfeiture committee makes its decisions independently, although the prime minister could make a recommendation.</p> <p>Field and Green <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-criticises-mps-report-bhs-collapse\">have repeatedly clashed through the course of the parliamentary investigation</a> into the high street retailer.

Now they want to be out, with many opt-ins.\u201d</p> <p>There is a strong feeling in EU capitals that Britain is being unrealistic \u2013 even deluded \u2013 in its expectations, that it cannot possibly walk away with a better deal than it was offered to stay, and must in any event end up with a worse one than it (and everyone else) currently enjoys.</p> <p>One reason for this is straightforward concern about other Eurosceptic populists knocking at the gate: in the Netherlands, France and Germany, the likes of Geert Wilders, Marine Le Pen and Frauke Petry will make further inroads in elections during 2017.</p> <p>Mark Rutte, prime minister of the traditionally Anglophile Netherlands, told his parliament this week he was \u201ctraining like a boxer\u201d for Brexit negotiations. Kees Verhoeven, a member of the same assembly\u2019s European affairs committee, said there was simply \u201cno political space to make it easy\u201d for the UK, and that \u201cthe only thing that matters is, don\u2019t make the UK an argument for populists to leave\u201d.</p> <p>Even deeper than that, single-market solidarity, upholding the four freedoms, maintaining the integrity of the bloc\u2019s institutions have, of necessity, hardened into top priorities. Whatever Brexiters may say about UK sales of Mercedes and prosecco, they will take second place. </p> <p>For many on the continent, Brexit is a political project \u2013 so the EU will respond politically. Two of Germany\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/german-trade-bodies-back-angela-merkels-tough-stance-over-brexit\">largest trade associations this month again backed this stance</a>, even if it comes at a short-term cost, saying allowing any British opt-out from the four freedoms would mark the beginning of the end of the single market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/19/el-brexit-la-brexit-eu-divided-over-gender-of-uk-departure\">Europe's first ruling on Brexit: it's masculine, unless you're Italian</a> </p> </aside>  <p>EU diplomats speak, too, of genuine shock at proposals by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">oblige British firms to disclose how many foreign workers</a> they employ.

She need not even be aware.\u201d</p> <p>Now India\u2019s supreme court looks set to declare triple talaq, and another law forcing women who re-marry their husbands to first sleep with another man, unconstitutional. Banning the custom would free up to 90 million Muslim women in the country from a potential trapdoor divorce. </p> <p>But Soman, whose Muslim reform group is fighting the case, wants something even more radical: \u201cTo tell the ulema [Muslim scholars], and the whole world, that ordinary Muslim women are fully capable of reading the Qur\u2019an, understanding the Qur\u2019an, interpreting the Qur\u2019an \u2013 and obtaining justice for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Arshiya\u2019s husband did finally try to divorce her. She never even heard him say the words. \u201cOne day, suddenly, he told me he had given me talaq. He said, \u2018I gave it to you four days earlier\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI literally begged him,\u201d she says. \u201cI went down on my knees and said, if you want to have affairs, go, just don\u2019t throw me out of the house. Where will I go with my child? I don\u2019t have a steady job \u2013 what will I do?\u201d</p> <p>Because her husband chose an Islamic divorce, rather than one under India\u2019s more progressive secular law, Arshiya was also denied the third of his salary she would be legally due in alimony.</p> <p>The 45-year-old, now working up to 16 hours a day as a teacher in south-west Delhi, is trying to have her husband\u2019s divorce overturned, and pursuing him for the meagre compensation Indian courts have carved out for triple talaq victims.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t want to get back together.

A <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B620GpkWZ9-UQmx1T212WHpWelE/view\">national study</a> released last year by her group, the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), found roughly 1 in 11 Muslim women were survivors of triple talaq \u2013 the vast majority receiving no compensation.</p> <p>Bookish and slight, Soman, 51, speaks in long, elegant paragraphs, that rain criticism on India\u2019s clerics like bombs. \u201cThe reason triple talaq has persisted,\u201d she begins, \u201cis first and foremost because Indian Muslims are poor, socially backward, economically backward and educationally backward.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result, there is a stranglehold by patriarchal elements posing as religious leaders. And they have spread rampant misinformation and misunderstanding.\u201d</p> <p>Under British colonial rule, India\u2019s various religious groups were permitted to organise their own personal affairs, including marriage and divorce. To this day, Indian law says Muslims can be being governed by the shariah, or Islamic jurisprudence.</p> <p>\u201cBut the law doesn\u2019t state the minimum age of marriage, the procedure for divorce, or polygamy, or the guardianship of children,\u201d Soman says. \u201cThe law just says they\u2019ll be governed by sharia. But which sharia? Whose sharia?\u201d</p> <p>Male-dominated groups such as the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) have filled the gap, pushing an interpretation of the Qur\u2019an of which Soman is scathing.</p> <p>\u201cI doubt they\u2019re capable of understanding the Qur\u2019anic values of justice, kindness and wisdom,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The BMMA\u2019s challenge to Muslim divorce laws, and to India\u2019s entire Muslim establishment, is nothing less than this: that she, and any Muslim woman, has as much right to interpret the Qur\u2019an as any cleric or scholar.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Qur\u2019an nowhere has any mention of triple talaq.</p> <footer> <cite>Zakia Soman, activist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTriple talaq is totally un-Qur\u2019anic,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Qur\u2019an nowhere has any mention of it. A Muslim marriage is a social contract and the right to divorce is given to both husband and wife.</p> <p>The women\u2019s group has already had one major victory this year: winning a case to overturn a ban on women <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37193266\">entering the inner sanctum</a> of the 15th century Haji Ali shrine in Mumbai. </p> <p>Now triple talaq is in its sights, after the Indian supreme court announced last year it would measure a raft of Muslim marriage laws against the Indian constitution\u2019s guarantee of gender equality.</p> <p>The AIMPLB, the peak body for Indian Muslims, is bitterly opposed to any change. Its affidavit, filed last month, argued that absent the right of instant divorce, a husband \u201cmay resort to illegal, criminal ways of murdering or burning [his wife] alive\u201d.</p> <p>It has also raised less risible fears of India\u2019s Muslims \u2013 still marginalised, 70 years after Partition \u2013 being subsumed under a wave of Hindu nationalism, which has swelled in the past decades, and is surging under prime minister Narendra Modi.</p> <p>Indeed, one of the reasons triple talaq has remained legal so long is the fear, propounded by Muslim community leaders, that if the government is allowed to tamper with Islamic personal laws, it might one day scrap them completely, \u201cand the majority will swallow you up\u201d, says Seema Mustafa, a Muslim journalist and author.</p> <p>Sure enough, as the supreme court has examined triple talaq these past weeks, members of the ruling Hindu nationalist party have raised the prospect of replacing all religious personal laws with a uniform civil code, which some Muslims fear might be Hindu-inflected, and ride roughshod over their beliefs.<br></p> <p>Soman and the BMMA know this sensitivities well. The group was formed in the embers of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which left 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead. They are careful to argue that the alternative to instant divorce should still be Islamic in character: requiring two \u201ctalaqs\u201d, delivered three months apart, and only after negotiation between the couple and their families.</p> <p>Soman is adamant: \u201cThe Qu\u2019ran insists that if and when divorce happens it has to be just and fair to both parties.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen if the supreme court is on her side. But is God? \u201cOf course,\u201d she says, peering hard over her glasses. \u201cGod is on the side of those who work hard, those who are truthful, those who are just, and those who are fair.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>All new Tesla models are being built with hardware to enable them to be fully self-driving, Elon Musk has announced.<br></p> <p> The company has said its Model S and Model X electric cars are already being produced with the new system, which includes eight cameras, 12 updated sensors and radar with faster processing.</p> <p> The software to go with the new hardware package was still being tested and would be installed once ready, Musk said.</p> <p>The death in May of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/01/tesla-driver-killed-autopilot-self-driving-car-harry-potter\">Tesla driver using the company\u2019s existing Autopilot system</a> prompted an investigation by safety regulators.</p> <p>The German government has called on Elon Musk\u2019s company to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/17/germany-calls-on-tesla-to-drop-autopilot-branding\">stop using the Autopilot branding</a>, while the maker of the original version decided to stop selling it to Tesla, accusing the electric car company of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/15/autopilot-supplier-disowns-tesla-for-pushing-the-envelope-on-safety\">\u201cpushing the envelope\u201d on safety</a> by using the system for a purpose for which it was never designed.</p> <p>But Musk said he expected that by the end of 2017 a Tesla would be able to drive safely in full autonomous mode from Los Angeles to New York \u201cwithout the need for a single touch\u201d on the wheel.</p> <p> He has set ambitious deadlines for Tesla many times, only to see timetables slip. Rival automakers have said they expect to be able to field autonomous driving capability by 2019 or 2021.</p> <p> Older Tesla vehicles without the additional cameras, sensors and upgraded processors would not be able to drive autonomously but their Autopilot software would continue to be improved, Musk said.</p> <p> For a time cars with the new hardware would have less capability to assist drivers with steering or braking than older cars running Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, Musk said. By December, he said, he expected the newer models to reach parity with the older vehicles.</p> <p> Musk said the software was being built in-house and would run on an Nvidia Titan chip.</p> <p>It is unclear how Tesla\u2019s future autonomous driving system will be greeted by regulators. Musk said it would be twice as safe as a human driver. However, federal and state regulators in the United States are proposing new, more rigorous standards to control the development and deployment of such systems.<br></p> <p> Edmunds Inc analyst Jessica Caldwell questioned the value of purchasing a self-driving car before regulations catch up, calling it a \u201cvanity purchase\u201d that could not be used in the real world.</p> <p> In the meantime rival carmakers could introduce better solutions, Caldwell said, potentially making Tesla\u2019s hardware \u201cobsolete almost as soon as it\u2019s activated for prime time\u201d.</p> <p> Most notably Tesla has chosen not to include Lidar laser-based sensors, a technology most other car makers believe is necessary for full autonomy.</p> <p> Tesla\u2019s self-driving announcement is the latest in a series of efforts over the last few months by Musk to maintain investor interest in Tesla as its stock price has fallen. The company is expected to raise more cash from capital markets within the next 12 months.</p> <p><em>With Reuters</em></p>",
