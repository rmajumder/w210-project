  "<p>The world\u2019s biggest wine forger started small. It was the early 2000s, and a young man who went by the name of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/california-man-wine-fraud-prison\">Rudy Kurniawan</a> began to make a name for himself on the Los Angeles scene. He had swept-back hair and a hearty laugh. More importantly, he had pockets of seemingly infinite depth, so his new friends overlooked his mysterious origins. It was said he came from a wealthy Sino-Indonesian family, living large off handouts. But nobody pressed too hard as long as the dinners \u2013 and booze \u2013 kept flowing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In one auction alone in 2006, Kurniawan sold $24.7m of wine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kurniawan also had a palate of rare finesse, better than most at identifying the characteristics of different vintages. Or at least, that\u2019s what the people he fooled said. At first he was interested in Californian wines, in particular pinot noir, but soon developed a taste for Burgundy, made mainly from the same grape but far more glamorous. In Burgundy\u2019s Byzantine system of appellations, Kurniawan sensed hard profits. He became a major player at auctions, buying \u2013 and selling \u2013some of the 20th century\u2019s greatest wines. He bought so much <a href=\"http://www.romanee-conti.com/#/Accueil\">Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti</a> he became known as \u201cDr Conti\u201d, which presumably later amused some of those he defrauded.</p> <p>In one auction at <a href=\"https://www.ackerwines.com/\">Acker Merrall &amp; Condit</a> in 2006, Kurniawan sold $24.7m of wine, beating the previous record by $10m. These were the days of the first dotcom boom, when Silicon Valley had more money than sense, a combination which has always been drawn to fine wines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c47f4f011df860709a71b63208218eb46ab05a78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c47f4f011df860709a71b63208218eb46ab05a78/0_162_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corked: foil capsules, labels and corks that were used as evidence in the trial of Rudy Kurniawan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corked: foil capsules, labels and corks that were used as evidence in the trial of Rudy Kurniawan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In time, however, discrepancies appeared in the market. Bottles of Clos St Denis from Domaine Ponsot, of vintages between 1945 and 1971, started to turn up. Laurent Ponsot, the head of the house, found this surprising as his family only started making the wine in 1982. He set out to investigate.</p> <p>Around the same time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/24/wine-fraud-lawsuit-billionaire-bill-koch\">Bill Koch</a>, an American billionaire who found fake bottles in his collection, hired private detectives and filed a lawsuit. Authentication experts saw more and more dodgy consignments emerging from these record-breaking auctions. At last the FBI got involved. In March 2012 they raided Kurniawan\u2019s house in Arcadia, California. They found a fully equipped counterfeiting workshop, complete with corking tools, labels, empty bottles and extensive tasting notes. Kurniawan had been taking cheaper wines \u2013 though still better than you will find in your average off-licence \u2013 and putting them in more expensive bottles, or altering bottles to appear more valuable.</p> <p>The most expensive wines are so rarely drunk few can claim to be expert on how they taste. On the occasions they are opened, it is usually courtesy of a generous host. It is poor guestmanship to lob aspersions on any proffered bottle, let alone one that cost as much as your car. What\u2019s more, several scientific studies have shown that even professed experts are hardly better than chance at identifying different wines. The entire industry hangs on the word of the critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/may/21/foodanddrink\">Robert Parker</a>, whose scores are a benchmark against how wines are priced. A Princeton economist came up with an algorithm based on weather data from the grape crop\u2019s growth period that nearly exactly mimicked Parker\u2019s scores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7f9b5bde8b29086da6ec559189aa0e691468ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7f9b5bde8b29086da6ec559189aa0e691468ef7/57_78_3846_2308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caught red-handed: bottles being prepared att Kurniawan\u2019s California home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caught red-handed: bottles being prepared att Kurniawan\u2019s California home</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The feeling of being scammed will be familiar to almost anyone who has ordered wine in a restaurant: Kurniawan simply scaled it up. In 2014 he was sentenced to 10 years in a California prison, the first person to be convicted of wine fraud.</p> <p>A new documentary, <a href=\"http://www.sourgrapesfilm.com/\"><em>Sour Grapes</em></a>, revisits the story. It came about after two directors met by chance at Kurniawan\u2019s trial. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/donor-unknown-jerry-rothwell-review\">Jerry Rothwell</a>, an Englishman who had been working on a film about the founders of Greenpeace, was following Laurent Ponsot on the trail of his faked wine. Reuben Atlas, an American, was coming from the opposite view. Having read about the arrest in <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/rudy-kurniawan-wine-fraud-2012-5/\"><em>New York Magazine</em></a>, and not being a wine buff himself, Atlas thought Kurniawan sounded like a Robin Hood figure, taking only from those who could afford to pay.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The FBI found a fully equipped counterfeiting workshop at Kurniawan\u2019s house</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were always at the back of the line for interviews in court, so we ended up talking to each other a lot,\u201d says Rothwell. \u201cPretty quickly we worked out that we could work together, and given the nature of the story it was helpful to have someone in Europe and someone in America. It\u2019s like the opposite of an Agatha Christie story, where there is one detective and multiple suspects. Here there were multiple detectives.\u201d</p> <p>The tale is told through a mixture of interviews and archive footage. A film crew had followed Kurniawan for a few days early on, for a pilot of a food and wine show that was never made. These scraps let us see Kurniawan as he must have appeared to the world he conned: boyish, charming, evasive. \u201cCan we put the cork back in the bottle,\u201d he jokes at one point. Knowing how his story ends, it is compelling, and very funny. Like Atlas, you cheer along as he toys with his new friends. One group calls itself the Angry Men because of the way they feel when they take a good bottle to a party and find everyone else has bought plonk. At Angry Men dinners, $200,000 might be drunk in a night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e76cc53d819e0e0389574d6a824478b7bdc4fc85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76cc53d819e0e0389574d6a824478b7bdc4fc85/0_341_4378_2627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spot the difference: three bottles of wine used as evidence in Rudy Kurniawan\u2019s trial.

The magnum dates from a time when magnums were not available</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atlas and Rothwell tried in vain to secure an interview with Kurniawan. Once they knew they wouldn\u2019t have time with him, the nature of the film changed. \u201cIt became a film about being conned, rather than the conman,\u201d says Rothwell. Even then it wasn\u2019t easy to get hold of the collectors: few want to admit they have been duped.</p> <p>Ponsot was essential to Kurniawan\u2019s unravelling. Unlike many in the wine community, he does not take himself too seriously. Above a well-kept grey and black beard, his eyes have a Gallic twinkle. He saves seriousness for the concept of Burgundy. \u201cThe fakes are like a piece of dirt on the name of Burgundy,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to wash it off.\u201d</p> <p>From the American end, the pursuit was led by Bill Koch, brother of Charles and David who run Koch Industries and are part of a vast oil and gas dynasty. With an estimated fortune of $2bn, Bill left the family firm and became a collector of sculpture, ancient Greek coins, model ships, real ships (his team won the America\u2019s Cup in 1992) and impressionist art. Interviewed in front of a wall of Monets in his Florida mansion, he comes across like a teddy bear with a temper.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Can we put the cork back in the bottle,' Kurniawan jokes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI hate being cheated,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a code of silence in the wine industry \u2013 I was not going to take it. With super-fine wines you can taste the love the vintner had in making it, and that to me is almost a religious experience. We collectors like precious things. What price can you put on love?\u201d he says, before correcting himself. \u201cWell, when you get divorced you can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways Bill had more resources than the FBI,\u201d says Rothwell. Without Koch, the trial might never have come to pass. He hired Brad Goldstein, a private investigator who prefers beer and clearly finds the whole wine scene preposterous. Goldstein had spotted a magnum of P\u00e9trus from 1921, a time when they made no magnums.</p> <p>Those duped were almost exclusively male. These were men showing off, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jay-mcinerney\">Jay McInerney</a>, the Manhattan literary enfant terrible who has mellowed into a wine critic. There is \u201cHollywood\u201d Jef Levy, a red-nosed sunglass-clad producer of films you won\u2019t have heard of. There\u2019s a drawling suit-clad investor, swirling a glass in a taxi across town. \u201cBuy \u201906 Champagne,\u201d he tells us. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford that, buy \u201902. If you can\u2019t afford that, drink fucking beer.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s striking how easily those in the boys\u2019 club were prepared to believe in the character of Kurniawan \u2013 an ingenue immigrant with plenty of cash, who wanted to be part of their gang. \u201cEveryone in the story could play themselves in the Hollywood movie,\u201d says Atlas. \u201cThey were all so perfectly cast: you pick up on who they are very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The effect of the rogues\u2019 gallery is that Kurniawan comes across as a more sympathetic figure. As with a diamond heist, you root for the plucky conman rather than the rich victims, and like any great forger, Kurniawan is a skilful artist himself. Part of the reason it took so long for the fraud to emerge is that as long as a bottle of fake wine is passed from cellar to cellar, nobody loses out. In one of those gleaming snippets of old footage, Kurniawan tells his fellow diners to beware of online auctions, where you can\u2019t be sure of the wine\u2019s provenance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One expert suspects 80% of pre-1980 Burgundy is counterfeit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen we started out I thought: \u2018Here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s sticking it to rich people, and good on him,\u2019\u201d says Atlas. \u201cBut as I got to know the people involved, and understand the process of wine-making, I became less sympathetic. My perspective changed.\u201d</p> <p>Kurniawan\u2019s was the first case of wine fraud to be successfully prosecuted in the US. But the government did not chase the paper trail back to Indonesia. There are signs he was not acting alone. Ponsot believes it would have been impossible for one man to produce so many counterfeit bottles, and also that wine fraud is a much bigger problem than has been acknowledged. In a recent interview he said he suspected 80% of the Burgundy allegedly from before 1980 is counterfeit.</p> <p>\u201cRudy is by no means the only faker,\u201d Rothwell agrees, pointing to the stories from France about \u201cwine terrorism\u201d, where a group of activists has taken to smashing up vineyards and storage facilities, partly out of fears over cheap Spanish imports.</p> <p>Kurniawan\u2019s family is tantalising, and in the far reaches of his story lie implications darker than the cellars of a few movie moguls. The investigators allege that Kurniawan\u2019s real name is Zhen Wang Huang \u2013 \u201cRudy Kurniawan\u201d is a compound of two famous Indonesian badminton players \u2013 and he was denied a US visa in 2003. The documentary traces his mother\u2019s brothers, Hendra Rahardja and Eddy Tansil, back to an infamous bank fraud, where $800m was stolen and has not been recovered. Tansil is still at large, supposedly in China. In 2007 alone, Kurniawan wired $17m to his brothers in Hong Kong and Indonesia. And although email documentation shows Kurniawan was often desperately short of money, he still lived in a mansion and drove a Ferrari.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that some of his friends from the wine world still don\u2019t want to believe what Kurniawan did. Hollywood Jef slips between the past and present tenses talking about his old friend, incredulous that this could have happened. \u201cI still don\u2019t know whether Rudy got into wine and then saw an opportunity, or saw wine as the opportunity from the start,\u201d says Rothwell. \u201cAnything that depends on what people want to believe is a complex area.\u201d When rich men want to spend money, they\u2019ll find a way to do it, in other words. To prove the point, a market has already emerged for Kurniawan\u2019s wines \u2013 both the unadulterated bottles in his collection and also the fakes that survive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f2e9551805bd2056c86a873a8f16982e6e7ee90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f2e9551805bd2056c86a873a8f16982e6e7ee90/0_0_3080_3847/801.jpg\" alt=\"Bad bottles: a magnum of P\u00e9trus 1947 from the trial\u2026 only it isn\u2019t.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bad bottles: a magnum of P\u00e9trus 1947 from the trial\u2026 only it isn\u2019t.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTaste is obviously really subjective and contextual, and it\u2019s hard to put into words,\u201d says Rothwell. \u201cBut with wine it\u2019s not as simple as saying it\u2019s the emperor\u2019s new clothes, or that this was a victimless crime. There are bigger questions of authenticity, which is why Ponsot is so important to the tale. This reaches deep into French soil and French history, and for him is quite abstract. Whether you\u2019re into wine or not, it\u2019s a story about human fallibility.\u201d</p> <p>Whose, though? Wine is meant to bring people together, in warmth, conversation and laughter. Beyond this we add history, mystique and science, mainly because they are fun. The spirit of wine frolics around naked; it is not a suited accountant. Few drinkers, as they uncork an \u00a38 bottle from Tesco, think in terms of investment, or the authenticity of the bottle. Rudy Kurniawan broke the law, but Dionysus would surely have chuckled.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sourgrapesfilm.com/\">Sour Grapes</a><em> is released on 16 September</em></p>",
  "<p>In an industry that swaggers with bombast and fury, the continuing presence of BBC Alba in Scotland\u2019s television firmament is a delight. The Gaelic-medium station, which launched eight years ago, often reaches out to the rest of us and when you lift the silken veil and take a peek from time to time you are never disappointed.</p> <p>It sits bashfully between ITV2 and STV Glasgow and just a few places along from the big channels. On Thursday night, forsaking all others and dodging the Redneck Zone (though I do have a soft spot for<em> Ice Truckers USA</em>) I watched a splendid documentary on the life of Eva Braun, Hitler\u2019s mistress, which also chronicled the final descent into physical and mental decay of the F\u00dchrer and in which it was revealed that Fraulein Braun doted on her two Scots terriers. The programme appeared to have been made by BBC Alba itself as the commentary was in Gaelic with English subtitles. It was the best thing I\u2019ve watched all week.</p> <p>Its coverage of football, out with the Old Firm, is both refreshing and ground-breaking. It dispenses with the tired, decades-old format, favoured by the BBC, of spoiling the half-time interval with worthless, predictable and semi-literate nonsense by former footballers. Instead, there are mini-documentaries behind the scenes at the clubs. It is sharp and innovative, unlike the coverage on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/bbc-scotland-scottish-six-downgraded-television\" title=\"\">BBC Scotland</a>.</p> <p>BBC Alba has reached a watershed in its existence when, despite its success, it is at a point where the corporation chiefs in London must decide if it will assist further in its development for a relatively modest outlay. The station, by any of the instruments used to measure such things, has been an outstanding success. Seven out of 10 Gaelic speakers in Scotland watch BBC Alba every week, which is the same reach that BBC1 enjoys nationally. Astonishingly, 15% of all viewers in Scotland have a look at least once every week. Soon though, the station\u2019s health will be threatened because it is running out of the oxygen of new programmes. Of its current output, 74% consists of repeats, a figure that, no matter how much goodwill is extended to the station, is unsustainable in the long term.</p> <p>As the BBC finalises its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/09/bbc-charter-renewal-government-white-paper-scheduling-pay\" title=\"\">charter renewal</a> offering, BBC Alba is asking London to commit to 10 hours of new programming per week. The current level stands at 4.2 hours. It is not an unreasonable request and does not affect BBC Scotland\u2019s struggles for more consideration from London. A 10-hour new programme commitment from London would bring BBC Alba into line with the weekly quotient granted to S4C, the Welsh language public service television station for the past 30 years. BBC Alba currently gets 3p of the \u00a312.13 monthly licence fee, yet its Welsh Language equivalent gets 10 times that sum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/12/bbc-to-launch-online-tv-channel-scotland\">BBC to launch online TV channel for Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both the Scottish and UK governments have commended Alba for its excellence and for having surpassed all the targets that it has ever been set since its inception eight years ago. The BBC Trust annual review report and Westminster\u2019s culture, media and sport committee have both expressed support.</p> <p>The station also has a fruitful relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/sep/08/could-an-independent-scotland-keep-the-bbc\" title=\"\">BBC Scotland</a>. On more than one occasion I\u2019ve heard a BBC producer at Pacific Quay say: \u201cI wish we\u2019d thought of that\u201d in response to another good documentary offering from its wee Gaelic sibling.</p> <p>The future of BBC Alba is bound up with ideas of cultural diversity in modern Scotland. Its fate will form part of what we would like our Scotland to look like. Astonishingly, in this country there are still voices raised in exasperation whenever there is talk of public funding for the Gaelic language. It was a shrill cry heard occasionally on the Unionist side of our great constitutional debate. \u201cWhy must we bother about a language spoken by only 60,000 people?\u201d It exhibits the same absence of imagination that is suspicious of anything that isn\u2019t uniform or safely ordered by Control Centre.</p> <p>It also betrays a shocking ignorance of what the Gaelic society and history have added to Scotland\u2019s cultural exchequer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unlike Scotland, Ireland and Wales preserve and nourish their ancient tongues as a rare and delicate gift</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a nation, Scotland has neglected its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/29/dont-neglect-uks-indigenous-languages\" title=\"\">Gaelic culture</a> and language; allowing it to wither from lack of funding at a time when Ireland and Wales, by comparison, are eager to preserve and nourish their ancient tongues, each in the knowledge that they have been bequeathed a rare and delicate gift. In parts of civic Scotland, a Roundhead attitude persists over funding for Gaelic culture that dictates that if it doesn\u2019t seem to have a significant cost benefit then it\u2019s not worth pursuing.</p> <p>Yet BBC Alba has been at the centre of a grassroots cultural renaissance in the Highlands and Islands and beyond that is sparking employment opportunities in the creative industries. During 2015-16, BBC Alba commissioned 454 hours of content from 26 Scottish production companies. MG Alba, which operates BBC Alba, estimates that more than 300 jobs are driven by its work, of which 40% are in the Highlands and Islands, a region that has suffered from depopulation as generations of young people migrate. This trend is beginning to be halted and, in places, reversed and BBC Alba is at the heart of the reawakening.</p> <p>Recent documentaries on Jock Stein and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/10/jim-baxter-great-scots-premier-league\" title=\"\">Jim Baxter</a> and one on Hamish Henderson, the Scottish poet and songwriter, have equalled the best of anything the national broadcaster has offered. It also covers those smaller arts and music festivals deemed not to be sufficiently large for the big broadcaster. In this way, it stimulates interest and creativity in the arts in Scotland\u2019s more remote areas, which just happen to cover most of our landmass. In particular, the runaway success of the Gaelic drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/sep/12/how-the-inbetweeners-movie-triggered-a-gaelic-film-and-tv-new-wave\" title=\"\"><em>Bannan</em></a> has boosted the economy of the Highlands and Islands. Already, it is estimated that the drama provides 14 full-time jobs alone on the island of Skye.</p> <p>BBC Alba is not simply showcasing the Gaelic language \u2013 it is at the centre of a quiet cultural reseeding of an area that Lowland Scotland has long ignored. Now is the time to let BBC Alba spread its wings a little further.</p>",
  "<p>The arcane study of language has a new literary entrant: the famed New Journalism author Tom Wolfe. Never one to back away from a fight, Wolfe, 85, has picked two disputes in his new book, <em>The Kingdom of Speech</em> \u2013 one with Charles Darwin and a second with linguist Noam Chomsky, 87, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p> <p>Skirmishes broke out over the summer and look set to continue.

Cuvier orchestrated his belligerence from sweet reason to outbursts of perfectly timed and rhetorically elegant fury. In contrast, nothing about Chomsky\u2019s charisma was elegant.\u201d A late 60s radical of Chomsky\u2019s description, he writes, \u201cgot himself arrested in the late morning or early afternoon, mild weather. He was booked and released in time to make it to the Electric Circus, that year\u2019s New York nightspot of the century, and tell war stories.\u201d</p> <p>But Chomsky disputed Wolfe\u2019s characterisations. \u201cWhat he is up to I have no idea,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWhat amazes me is that any of it is taken seriously, since the errors and, in fact, outright falsifications are so transparent. That includes incidentally slanderous lies about my personal life that any reader can tell at once must be fabrications, since he couldn\u2019t possibly know these things even if they were true.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfe\u2019s excoriation of Chomsky follows a long line of satirical examinations that have followed his famous adventures in New Journalism (<em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</em> in 1968 and <em>The Right Stuff</em> in 1979) and social novels such as <em>The Bonfire of the Vanities</em> (1987). In this other realm, he\u2019s taken on modern art in <em>The Painted Word</em> (1975) and modern architecture in <em>From</em> <em>Bauhaus to Our House</em> (1981).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6457145033aa5622c3a6ef5106f8da3e5287c2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6457145033aa5622c3a6ef5106f8da3e5287c2f/0_269_2481_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Darwin was accused by Wolfe of being a \u201cflycatcher\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Darwin was accused by Wolfe of being a \u201cflycatcher\u201d.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: English Heritage/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But to take on Chomsky and Darwin, whom Wolfe portrays as a \u201cslick operator \u2026 smooth \u2026 smooth \u2026 smooth and then some\u201d, who stole his ideas from Alfred Russel Wallace and was a mere \u201cflycatcher\u201d, is of a different order.</p> <p>Wolfe told the <em>Observer</em> that his interest in evolutionary theory stemmed from a speech he gave in Washington in 2006 on Emile Zola\u2019s novel <em>La B\u00eate Humaine</em> published in 1888, just 29 years after Darwin\u2019s <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThe more I thought about it, the less Darwin\u2019s doctrine held, up in my opinion,\u201d he said. Evolutionary development of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, in particular, \u201cdrifts into periods where there is no evidence\u201d. Those doubts segued into doubts about the origin of language \u2013 man\u2019s singular gift \u2013 that he believes was not the product of evolution but a man-made tool.</p> <p>\u201cMy contention is that language is not the result of evolution but essentially a verbal trick that was invented by human beings. It\u2019s a memory aid \u2013 a mnemonic \u2013 that enables human beings to store away a piece of information and compare it to a new piece of information and draw conclusions.\u201d No other species has a similar ability, making it the secret of our dominance as a species and Wolfe writes: \u201cHumans are pretty pathetic physically. If you weigh 150 pounds and you come up against a 150-pound butterfly in battle, you\u2019re done for. It must be 10 feet tall. But, with planning, humans control every animal on Earth. We\u2019re very generous \u2013 we even create animal preserves where wild animals can live. But, oh boy, if they cross the line of the reserve, they\u2019re done for.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfe then moves on to Chomsky. In 1957, when he was 28, Chomsky published <em>Syntactic Structures</em>, a ground-breaking work that laid out his theories of language, including the evolutionary manner of their development.</p> <p>\u201cThe \u2018organ\u2019 \u2026 the \u2018deep structure\u2019 \u2026the \u2018universal grammar\u2019 \u2026 the \u2018device\u2019 \u2014 as Chomsky explained it, the system was physical, empirical, organic, biological,\u201d Wolfe writes. \u201cHe drove the discipline indoors and turned it upside down.\u201d Even a visiting Martian \u201cwould immediately realise that all the languages on this planet were the same, with just some minor local accents\u201d.</p> <p>Wolfe claims new evidence presented by anthropologist Daniel Everett on the Brazilian Pirah\u00e3 tribe proved that language was not the product of evolution but a tool that man created.</p> <p>Not so, countered Chomsky. \u201cThe Pirah\u00e3 speakers learn Portuguese like everyone else, so of course they have the same faculty of language, and therefore his entire argument collapses.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no new argument. Everett presented his Pirah\u00e3 data. The matter has been studied carefully by linguists [some of whom Wolfe cites and dismisses without argument], who showed that it appears to be incorrect; also by experimental cognitive scientists who have drawn the same conclusions. But it was evident at once, and has been pointed out repeatedly, that whatever the facts, they don\u2019t bear on universal grammar. So there is nothing to discuss.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfe is unlikely to reverse his claims. \u201cThe first thing one notices,\u201d he said, \u201cis that language organs, universal grammar, the language acquisition device, none of it exists.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfe said he was careful to not conflate Chomsky\u2019s theories of language with his radical left point of view. He said: \u201cThe combination of the scientific stance and the political stance is what made him so famous but, no, I\u2019ve never thought there was a political side to this.\u201d</p> <p>For his part, Chomsky said he knew little about Wolfe and that the pair had never had any contact until Wolfe requested an interview. But he considered that Wolfe had misunderstood the argument because, in effect, there was no argument.</p> <p>\u201cUniversal grammar, in the modern sense, is the theory of faculty of language (a biological object, like the faculty of vision), not about particular manifestations of it (like my visual system, which differs slightly from yours). If some tribe were to be found where people wear black patches over one eye, it would be of no interest to scientists studying binocular vision.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI\u2019m frankly astonished at the publicity this is receiving.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The urge to bluster is universal among reckless men who have risked everything. They boom that events have proved them right, as if booming can drown the thought that they have made a colossal error. As their mistakes can cause the worst damage, politicians, propagandists and the politically committed in general are the worst blusterers of all.</p> <p>The front page of the <em>Daily Express</em> of 8 August 1939 contains one of the finest blusters in British history. Lord Beaverbrook, the proprietor, had so supported appeasing Hitler he dropped Winston Churchill from his pages for warning of the Nazi threat.</p> <p>Beaverbrook and his journalists were desperate to prove that they had not betrayed their country. Under the headline \u201cNo War This Year\u201d, the<em> Express</em> assured its readers that no less an authority than \u201cMr Selkirk Panton\u201d, its Berlin correspondent, believed that \u201cHerr Hitler, despite all his mysticism, is a hard-headed, hard-boiled politician\u2026 He will not risk everything over some <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11238013\" title=\"\">hasty action</a>\u201d.</p> <p>On 1 September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. On 3 September, Britain and France declared war on Germany. As luck would have it, on 3 September 2016 \u2013 77 years to the day after its \u201cno war this year\u201d prediction failed so spectacularly \u2013 the print edition of the <em>Express </em>led with the headline that Britain was in a \u201cBrexit boom\u201d. Along with the rest of the rightwing press and the politicians who have led us to this pass, the <em>Express</em> is loud in its insistence that the \u201cdoom mongers\u201d had been proved wrong.</p> <p>Now, as then, we see the same desperation to believe that the Conservatives have not betrayed their country and the same refusal to face reality. We are not in recession because the Bank of England has pumped cheap money into the economy with Weimaresque abandon and reduced interest rates to their lowest level ever.</p> <p>Keynes\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://medium.com/@DuncanWeldon/negative-yields-the-euthanasia-of-the-rentier-political-economy-dc3131d8d85e#.rpiyp0vn0\" title=\"\">euthanasia of the rentier</a>\u201d is upon us and might be an appealing prospect if the rentiers whose interest payments were vanishing were the misers of 19th-century fiction. As everyone saving for a pension is a rentier now, however, the Brexit \u201cboom\u201d rests on the bank ordering a miserable future for millions.</p> <p>The lie direct of the Brexit campaign was that the European Union cost us \u00a3350m a week. The bigger lie, which some Leave supporters may even have believed, was that there were no hard choices. We could have it all. Immigration controls, prosperity, access to EU markets, without compliance with EU laws\u2026 Whatever we wanted, at no cost at all.</p> <p>Or as Boris Johnson, a politician who has never made the mistake of believing what <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">he says</a>, told his credulous supporters: \u201cThis is a great country and great economy and I think people know we can do brilliantly if we take back control.\u201d</p> <p>An honest version of Johnson (if you can imagine such a creature) would have gone to the Nissan car workers in Sunderland and said words to the effect of: we may be able to deliver the immigration controls you want if we leave the single market but there is a risk that you will lose your jobs if we do.</p> <p>The cynicism of Johnson, Gove and Farage\u2019s failure to lay out the difficult decisions shocked the naive.

You can see us shrinking in the way leaders at the G20 treated Theresa May as an awkward \u201ccrasher\u201d who had got in by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/g20-theresa-may-warns-of-tough-times-for-uk-economy-after-brexit\" title=\"\">mistake </a>; in Japan\u2019s undiplomatic hints that not just Nissan but all Japanese businesses in Britain will think about leaving if we leave the single market; and in America and Australia\u2019s announcements that securing a trade deal with the EU came before securing trade deals with the UK.</p> <p>Not that we can secure trade deals just like that.

How many jobs will be lost and foreign investors driven away in the process is a subject the prime minister needs to start talking about.</p> <p>Instead of facing up to the scale of the uncertainty, today\u2019s Conservatives kid themselves as their ancestors did in the 1930s. Listen to Conservative ministers and read the rightwing press and delusion is on display everywhere.</p> <p>Boris Johnson says we are a great country. Not any more. What greatness we possessed came from our alliances. By voting to leave we have ignored the advice of every friend we had in the world. Now we are asking the countries we spurned to help us and they are finding reasons to look away.</p> <p>The right says the EU will want to give us a better deal out than we had in because the EU nations will still want their exporters to sell to us. They don\u2019t look at how politically impossible it would be for Europe\u2019s leaders to tear up EU rules when they are having to face down their own xenophobes and Europhobes.</p> <p>They don\u2019t have a shred of evidence that the EU will appease us. Just a forlorn hope and an echo of voices from the time of the British appeasers. They were as convinced that they were dealing with \u201chard-headed, hard-boiled politicians\u201d, who would do whatever Britain wanted and not \u201crisk everything over some hasty action\u201d. They were as befuddled.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later today</p>",
  "<p>On a drizzly morning in Stroud on Saturday, anxious parents sat in their cars across from Marling school as 300 boys sat a two-paper entrance test. One of seven grammar schools in Gloucestershire, Marling offers 150 places for entry next September.</p> <p>One father had brought his son 30 miles from Swindon for the test. \u201cIt was an easy choice because every parent wants the best for their kids, and at least we can say we tried. We told him this will not determine his success in later life. Ultimately it\u2019s a decision he would have to make as well.\u201d</p> <p>A mother who had made the journey with her son from Malmesbury, 17 miles south of Stroud, said she was studying all the options. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve made a choice yet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just increasing our options. I\u2019m quite relaxed about it. Our local secondary school is amazing, so most people go there.\u201d</p> <p>The morning before, it had also been the familiar language of choice and options that dominated at least the first half of Theresa May\u2019s first major speech on education. \u201cFor when you are working two jobs and struggling to make ends meet, it is no good being told that you can choose a better school for your children if you move to a different area or pay to go private,\u201d the new prime minister told an audience at the British Academy. \u201cThose aren\u2019t choices that you can make. And they are not choices that you should have to make.\u201d</p> <p>So far, so obvious. But it was a gentle start to a speech that everyone in the room knew would end with the launch of a wrecking ball to a political consensus entrenched since David Cameron in 2007 described talk of the return of grammars as \u201coutdated mantra\u201d.</p> <p>The country had been softened up ahead of May\u2019s bombshell; and not only through the usual practice of trailing some top lines into that morning\u2019s newspapers. Jonathan Slater, permanent secretary at the Department for Education, had allowed photographers a sneaky look at a discussion paper on the return of selective schools as he walked into Downing Street on Tuesday. The apparently accidental document malfunction had moved commentators on from picking apart the government\u2019s apparent lack of vision for post-Brexit, and set the chattering classes alight on a subject close to the hearts of millions.</p> <p>And on Friday morning May launched the debate with chutzpah. \u201cI want to relax the restrictions that stop selective schools from expanding, that deny parents the right to have a new selective school opened where they want one, and that stop existing non-selective schools becoming selective in the right circumstances and where there is demand,\u201d May announced.</p> <p>\u201cFor we know that grammar schools are hugely popular with parents. We know they are good for the pupils that attend them. Indeed, the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils is reduced to almost zero for children in selective schools.\u201d</p> <p>The touch paper had been lit.</p> <p>The arguments against grammar schools are well known. Less than 3% of entrants to grammar schools are entitled to free school meals \u2013 an important indicator of social deprivation \u2013 whereas almost 13% of entrants come from outside the state sector, largely fee-paying preparatory schools. Grammars have lower proportions of black pupils than other schools. Pupils are less likely to attend a grammar school if they attend primary schools with a high proportion of pupils from deprived backgrounds. And testimonies abound of those who talk of being cast on to the scrap heap of secondary moderns, condemned to poor teaching and endless woodwork classes.</p> <p>May said in her speech that she would require new or expanding grammars to take a proportion of pupils from lower-income households to ensure that selective education is not reserved for those with the means to move into a catchment area or pay for tuition to pass the test. Yet no sooner had she finished taking questions, at times testily, from the assembled press than it became clear that she had managed to unify against her the seemingly un-unifiable Labour party, along with a coalition made up of the likes of Teach First, the University of Oxford and King\u2019s College London. The last Tory education secretary, Nicky Morgan, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/mays-grammar-school-plans-put-six-years-of-educational-progress-at-risk\" title=\"\">described the proposals</a> as \u201cweird\u201d and a step towards a \u201cmore unequal education system\u201d.</p> <p>More widely in May\u2019s party, the dissenters are understood to be many and powerful. There is talk that one of her whips, responsible for voting discipline in the party, believes the return of grammars to be a disaster in the making. It would seem difficult, if not impossible, for the prime minister to get the legislation past the House of Lords, where the Conservatives do not have a majority \u2013 and where peers will feel that the government does not have a mandate for such a reform, given it wasn\u2019t in any recent party manifesto.</p> <p>And yet, some unlikely voices are asking for people to listen to what the prime minister is saying. \u201cThey obviously have thought about this a lot, and that came across in the speech,\u201d said Dr Lee Elliot Major, chief executive of the Sutton Trust, which has produced the most recent research warning of the problems with grammar schools in entrenching inequality. \u201cOften these debates are plagued by simplistic arguments that polarise the debate,\u201d he said. \u201cLike all educational arguments, there are nuances to it.\u201d</p> <p>Elliot Major said he welcomed the idea of keeping the age at which children are selected as flexible as possible. \u201cOne of the reservations in crude one-off tests is that, if a child has a poor day, one thing can rule your destiny,\u201d he said. And it was right, he added, that May was focusing on how the disadvantaged could be given better access.</p> <p>Yet it is on this point, so pivotal to the success or otherwise of grammars improving social mobility, that the prime minister may have her political courage tested. It is often forgotten that grammar schools became hugely unpopular in the 1950s, among the middle classes in particular, because their children weren\u2019t always the ones selected. If 30% of children are placed in grammar schools, 70% are not \u2013 and their parents have reacted angrily to that in the past, staging protests and voting accordingly at the ballot box.</p> <p>For the new grammar schools to live up to May\u2019s boasts of promoting social mobility, children from less affluent backgrounds will have to be offered lower thresholds to take a place, said Elliot Major \u2013 a place that would otherwise be taken by someone from a better-off background. \u201cThe challenge will be that all our research shows that gaps at 11 are already quite stark,\u201d he said. \u201cA generation ago some working-class young people were able to get in because there wasn\u2019t the private tutor industry that there is now.</p> <p>\u201cSo I think you would have to have lower grades for people from poorer backgrounds. Universities do this, and we would say it is good practice. When the children get into these universities or schools, they do just as well. It is just whether the government is going to back those sort of quite radical measures. If you don\u2019t do it properly, they will just end up middle-class enclaves.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Back in Stroud</strong>, those fears are certainly felt. On the dot of 3.10pm on Friday, pupils streamed out of Archway comprehensive school, eager to start their weekend, and probably relieved that they are not taking the grammar school entry tests scheduled for the next morning. But if they were oblivious to the revolution now being planned, their parents were not. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said one mother. \u201cSelection is just wrong. They are just going to choose the most able children. Who is going to pick up all the rest?\u201d</p> <p>Another mother, Sarah Blackwell, said: \u201cMy son did want to go to the grammar, but he missed out in the test by a couple of points. The places went to pupils from out of district. It\u2019s incredibly unfair.\u201d</p> <p>May is seeking to define herself as a prime minister willing to make difficult decisions, putting public relation concerns aside for the betterment of the country. Announcing the return of grammars has been a big decision. Its benefits to the country are as yet unproven. For May, it\u2019s a tough first test.</p>",
  "<p>So familiar have we become with transitions, aerobars and the Brownlee brothers, it\u2019s easy to forget that the triathlon is still in its infancy. Most agree that swim-cycle-running races began in the 1980s, and became an Olympic event only in 2000. This weekend brings further validation for the sport with a debut appearance at the Paralympics.</p> <p>Three events were contested in Brazil on Saturday, with the men \u2013 in classifications PT1, PT2 and PT4 \u2013 diving into the water at the western end of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Copacabana beach then swimming 750m in open water, cycling 20km and finishing with a 5km run. Andy Lewis, a lower leg amputee, won the PT2 event in one hour, 11 minutes and 49 seconds, the 13th gold medal for ParalympicsGB.</p> <p>On Sunday it is the turn of the women: British athletes Lauren Steadman in the PT4 race and Alison Patrick, who has less than 10% sight and competes with her guide Hazel Smith in the PT5 class, are both strongly fancied to win gold.</p> <p>Triathlon, both able-bodied and disabled, is one of the fastest-growing participation sports in the UK: in the six years from 2009 to 2015, numbers competing swelled from 120,000 to about 205,000, with 24 events a week. It has also proved popular for those who don\u2019t want to squeeze into neoprene and spandex: viewing figures show 4.4 million and 4.3 million, respectively, watched the BBC\u2019s live coverage of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s races in Rio last month.</p> <p>All of which will make it disappointing for many that there is no live feed of Sunday\u2019s three races, which start from 2pm BST, and will not be screened in full on Channel 4. The broadcaster will, however, have a reporter and expert at Copacabana beach and plans to provide updates during the race and interviews afterwards. Highlights of the action will be shown later in the day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"320a2d148dac9b47f2b48e36526727810e8eea6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/320a2d148dac9b47f2b48e36526727810e8eea6c/410_170_1976_2470/800.jpg\" alt=\"British paralympic triathlete Alison Patrick\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British paralympian Alison Patrick is competing in the women\u2019s triathlon with her guide Hazel Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cParatriathlon is making its debut and this is our big opportunity in the limelight,\u201d says Jack Buckner, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.britishtriathlon.org/london\" title=\"\">British Triathlon</a>. \u201cWith the spectacular backdrop of the Copacabana, there\u2019s never been a better chance to make the most of the attention, but it\u2019s a shame that there\u2019s unlikely to be any live TV coverage. We are seeing more and more people \u2013 both able-bodied and those with a physical disability \u2013 looking at the likes of Alistair and Jonny Brownlee, Vicky Holland or Lauren Steadman, and thinking, \u2018I want to have a go at this.\u2019 Our job is to ensure that there are opportunities to take part, whatever fitness level or background someone has.\u201d</p> <p>The first official paratriathlon in the UK took place in 2008 in the Rother Valley country park in South Yorkshire. Back then, there were 26 disability categories, almost as many as there were competitors. These have since been trimmed to just five. In December 2010, the International Paralympic Committee voted to include the sport from the 2016 Games onwards. The British Paralympic Association assigned funding of \u00a33.1m, mostly from the national lottery, for 2013-2017 and a target was set of three to seven medals.</p> <p>As with the Team GB Olympic triathletes, the paratriathletes will be rewarded with an increase in funding if they exceed this goal, and a decrease if they don\u2019t. British athletes considered to be gold medal contenders in either the Olympics or Paralympics receive about \u00a328,000 a year towards preparations.</p> <p>Steadman, although only 23, is competing in her third Paralympics. In Beijing and London, she was a swimmer, although she didn\u2019t win a medal at either sport. She competed in her first triathlon in 2011 after encouragement from her uncle. Born without a right forearm \u2013 PT2 athletes are the most severely impaired, PT4 the least \u2013 she has dominated her class, especially the swim leg, since 2014. Her only defeat in the last two years came at the world championships in July when she fell off her bike riding on cobbles in Rotterdam and had to abandon the race. Steadman\u2019s main competition is expected to come from 18-year-old American Grace Norman, a leg amputee, who is the strongest runner in the field.</p> <p>\u201cAs a child, I would always want two arms,\u201d says Steadman, who studied psychology at Portsmouth University and has just completed a master\u2019s in business management. \u201cBut over the years I have come to love being individual and relish all the challenges.\u201d</p> <p>Patrick and Smith can also expect a stern test in the PT5 class; their rivals are the Australian pair of Katie Kelly and Michellie Jones. Visually impaired athletes swim together, tethered at the ankle, and ride together on a tandem. This leg is often where races are won because it is where the guide can have the greatest impact. The guides are often very talented athletes in their own right: Smith narrowly missed out on competing for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in swimming, while Jones is a two-time world champion in triathlon.</p> <p>It should be a compelling race: expect skulduggery in the swimming (competitors tend to swim on Steadman\u2019s stronger, left side to lessen her advantage) and breakneck sprints to the finish.</p> <p>For anyone inspired to take part, British Triathlon is organising eight training days across the country at the end of October for those interested in paratriathlon. First-timers and all fitness levels are welcome and, according to the organisers, there is still time to make the team for the Tokyo Games in 2020.</p>",
  "<p>I am a pretty keen consumer of culture. I read two books a week, some for work but most for pleasure.

Lastly, there\u2019s television, which I love.</p> <p>You might, then, expect me to have been thrilled by the announcement that, this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/06/bbc2-culture-arts-programming-saturday-night-audience-poetry-dance\" title=\"\">autumn, BBC2</a> will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/bbc-bbc2-repeats\" title=\"\">junk the repeats</a> and devote Saturday nights to the arts, all the more so because I have no beef at all with the euthanasia by stealth that has mercifully taken <em>The Culture Show</em> from our screens (it always seemed superficial and a bit try-hard to me). But, alas, I am the diametrical opposite of thrilled by the prospect of a film about Adrian Mole creator Sue Townsend; a documentary following Alan Bennett as he visits \u201ciconic\u201d places in his life; an interview by Julie Walters with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/17/julie-walters-willy-russell-how-we-made-educating-rita\" title=\"\">Willy Russell</a>, writer of <em>Blood Brothers</em> and <em>Shirley Valentine</em>; and a celebration of the travel writer Jan Morris by Michael Palin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/04/bbc-hits-back-at-report-that-claims-it-doesnt-take-enough-risks\">BBC hits back at government report claiming it doesn't take enough risks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At times, reading about what is soon to be on offer at the Beeb was not unlike flicking through back issues of <em>Radio Times</em>: if the names of Russell Harty or Catherine Cookson had appeared, I would hardly have been surprised. Last week, as excitable talk of BBC2 as a \u201ccultural destination\u201d emanated from Broadcasting House, all I could think was: why would anyone stay in for this flavourless, geriatric stuff, let alone choose it ahead of <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>?</p> <p>Yes, there were a few concessions to the youthful and \u2013 contain yourselves \u2013 the highbrow. Some good contemporary poets, Liz Berry, Andrew McMillan and Sean O\u2019Brien among them, have been commissioned to \u201cinterpret\u201d the stories of passengers on board a train from Glasgow to London, in what the BBC is billing as a reworking of WH Auden and Benjamin Britten\u2019s <em>Night Mail</em>. The critic Alastair Sooke will explore the life and work of the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/29/robert-rauschenberg-tate-modern-cy-twombly-jasper-johns-autumn\" title=\"\">Robert Rauschenberg</a>, ahead of Tate Modern\u2019s major retrospective of the American artist. The writer and spoken-word artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/may/24/kate-tempest-book-at-bedtime-radio-4\" title=\"\">Kate Tempest</a> will perform live from the Battersea Arts Centre (I once saw Tempest in Manchester, in a hall full to the brim with the kind of hip young crowd that the BBC struggles to attract; she was completely breathtaking).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48e528a2ec26fcab9ac308030fa0cce338df0a68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48e528a2ec26fcab9ac308030fa0cce338df0a68/0_233_5738_3443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spoken-word artist Kate Tempest could reach the hip young crowd that BBC2 struggles to attract\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spoken-word artist and poet Kate Tempest could reach the hip young crowd that BBC2 struggles to attract</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But elsewhere, even when the commissioners had apparently hit the mark, I couldn\u2019t help but sniff compromise and shoehorning. I would, for instance, be quite interested to see a documentary about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/14/marlon-james-marley-murder-and-me\" title=\"\">Marlon James</a>, the Jamaican writer who won the Man Booker prize in 2015. But why must it be presented by, of all people, Alan Yentob? I wouldn\u2019t mind, too, watching a film about the history of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/12/beyond-buttocks-turner-prize-shortlist-cheeky-smart\" title=\"\">Turner prize</a>, though why anyone would choose to tell its story through its winners and judges I can\u2019t imagine. Even those who treat the Turner with utmost seriousness know it has lately teetered on the brink of irrelevance. Why not take a more provocative approach? Why not lob the odd Molotov cocktail in its direction?</p> <p>How strikingly odd it is that the BBC, whose funding model insists that it must cater to minority interests as well as to the mainstream, should have such trouble programming good and exciting arts television. After all, its director general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/24/bbc-tony-hall-nice-changes-tough\" title=\"\">Tony Hall</a>, arrived from the Royal Opera House promising more of a focus on culture. And elsewhere in the organisation, by which I mean on the radio, coverage of the arts thrives. Last week, I listened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/20/melvyn-bragg-wilton-westminster-crossrail-tv-review\" title=\"\">Melvyn Bragg</a>\u2019s essays celebrating the history and culture of the north on Radio 4, every blessed moment of which was replete with interest and the right kind of informed passion.</p> <p>Yet still it goes on, this feeling that output is designed by committee, the better to tick certain boxes: the favouring of the general over the particular, the old and the established over the new and the untested; the overreliance \u2013 often, one size fits all, irrespective of expertise \u2013 on certain key presenters; the conviction that things must always be e-x-p-l-a-i-n-e-d because no one (save those who work at the BBC) can possibly understand them otherwise; the sense that things aren\u2019t interesting in and of themselves, but must be <em>made</em> interesting; a determination that a certain kind of deadening earnestness must trail something that is supposed to be pleasurable; and, above all, the fear of appearing elitist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why not take a more provocative approach? Why not lob the odd Molotov cocktail?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The BBC makes much of its partnerships with other organisations, yet it seems to be incapable of learning anything from them. At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/may/06/effects-of-live-satellite-broadcasts-national-theatre-rsc\" title=\"\">National Theatre</a>, risk-taking is beginning to pay off \u2013 the number of audience members under 35 has grown by 75%. Ticket sales are good \u2013 on average, 88% of capacity\u2013 but there is also a tacit acknowledgement that not everyone will like everything and that this is perfectly all right. When I recently saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/06/novelist-alan-warner-love-ladies-of-perpetual-succour\" title=\"\"><em>Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour</em></a>, Lee Hall\u2019s ribald musical adaptation of Alan Warner\u2019s novel <em>The Sopranos</em>, the middle-aged woman sitting next to me walked out after 40 minutes. But if she loathed it, others were wild for it, and better to have that, you might say, than an audience that felt, well, kind of neutral. Sometimes, neutral is just bored by another name.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the media hail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/08/sir-nicholas-serota-appointed-chairman-arts-council-england-tate\" title=\"\">Nicholas Serota</a>, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/09/nicholas-serota-who-next-tate-director\" title=\"\">Tate</a> who is to leave the gallery after 28 years to chair Arts Council England, as \u201cthe man who taught us to love modern art\u201d. However you measure it \u2013 whether by visitor numbers, the burgeoning of contemporary galleries outside London or the frequency with which politicians name-check the cultural economy \u2013 I think there is, Turner prize aside, some truth in all this.</p> <p>However, the more pressing question is: how did Serota do it? Mostly, I think, he simply said: \u201cLook at this.\u201d Even as attention fell on the Tate\u2019s glamorous new buildings the work was always what mattered. And he, too, was prepared to bet on the future, to countenance the esoteric and the idiosyncratic as well as Matisse and Picasso and (the formerly esoteric and idiosyncratic) Damien Hirst.</p> <p>Serota\u2019s ethos is stubbornly high-minded, almost Reithian you might say. And therein lies the irony. The BBC craves, above all else, ratings: how else to explain its attachment to Bennett, Palin and Walters? In the end, though, there is more than one way to put backsides on sofas and the right kind of backsides \u2013 younger, more diverse.</p> <p>Let art, and those who make it, speak. Trust <em>them</em>, not your wretched committees.</p>",
  "<p>Fleabag, the heroine of BBC3\u2019s latest comedy hit, is a mess.

It\u2019s easy to dismiss Fleabag\u2019s honesty as simply \u2018shocking\u2019 but as the series goes on there\u2019s more revealed about her that makes sense of why she says and does the things she does early on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0122574aea2a3ad833e58735fb1e899a82bfc0a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0122574aea2a3ad833e58735fb1e899a82bfc0a6/0_131_2016_1210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One Mississippi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dark and honest: One Mississippi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patti Perret/Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor is <em>Fleabag</em> alone in telling its heroine\u2019s story with a dark and often brutal honesty.

Next month Sky Atlantic will air <em>Divorce</em>, Sharon Horgan\u2019s latest excavation of the human soul, this time starring <em>Sex and the City</em>\u2019s Sarah Jessica Parker as a brittle fortysomething housewife whose marriage is falling painfully apart. The hugely anticipated <em>Insecure</em> in which Issa Rae\u2019s likeable, directionless heroine navigates her way through her late 20s in LA arrives on the same channel later this year.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most exciting time I can remember for shows depicting the lives of women,\u201d says <em>Variety</em>\u2019s television critic, Maureen Ryan. \u201cThere are so many wildly different portrayals. For far too long women have been the objects of TV stories, something to be looked at, talked about, observed, hurt, seduced, murdered etc. Even if a show had a prominent role for a woman or prominent roles for multiple women, their storylines often revolved around what the men in their lives wanted or thought of them. Now we have a wave of shows that are told from the inside of women\u2019s lives in which women aren\u2019t the object, they\u2019re the subject, and it makes all the difference.\u201d</p> <p>Waller-Bridge agrees. \u201cIt seems very dated now for a show not to explore the complexities of their female characters as much as their male ones,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had decades\u2019 worth of shows with actresses playing \u2018roles\u2019 rather than characters. You could categorise a lot of female parts into the one-dimensional \u2018mother, virgin, whore\u2019 bracket but now it seems more on trend, thankfully, to write parts that are individual and complex and un-boxable, which is a great improvement and long overdue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26e7bab3547a7046f087cb76154bc39cd674d396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26e7bab3547a7046f087cb76154bc39cd674d396/0_119_3150_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Issa Rae in Insecure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Issa Rae in Insecure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John P Fleenor/2016 Home Box Office</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019ve been here before, of course, most notably with Lena Dunham\u2019s <em>Girls</em>, which wallows in heroine Hannah Horvath\u2019s flaws while granting her enough self-knowledge to be aware of how horrible she is to all in her orbit. Similarly Comedy Central\u2019s hit series <em>Broad City</em> allows its two heroines to be complex, rounded individuals, capable of being silly and serious, both good friends and bad. \u201cI think in the US some kind of logjam was broken open by <em>Orange Is the New Black</em> which has such an extensive array of varied female characters of all backgrounds, cultures and races,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cThere\u2019s been an explosion of shows in which women are at the centre of the narrative and carrying all kinds of stories forward in all kinds of ways.\u201d</p> <p>And while these shows are very different in subject matter they\u2019re linked by a refusal to shy away from life\u2019s more awkward moments. In <em>Insecure</em> when Issa wants to attract her crush\u2019s attention she volunteers to rap on stage. The problem? Her chosen subject is best friend Molly and her \u2018broken pussy\u2019. It\u2019s a hugely funny scene that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in a Bridget Jones movie were it not for the rather more x-rated subject matter. \u201cWe can definitely get away with more because of the medium,\u201d admits Rae. \u201cBroadcast TV in America has to be clean and family friendly but being on cable allows us to be more free with our themes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"427e72da0a45854bed03ee631ebdf041433eea75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/427e72da0a45854bed03ee631ebdf041433eea75/0_302_2835_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan in Catastrophe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan in Catastrophe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Thompson/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly in <em>Divorce</em> we watch Parker\u2019s Frances sit through an excruciating dinner party with her boorish husband. As the numb horror flits slowly across her face it\u2019s as though we\u2019re watching the flip side to <em>Sex and the City</em>, the moment when Carrie woke up and realised she might have a closet full of spindly shoes but the price she\u2019s paid is being forced to listen to Big pontificate for the rest of her life. Yet later in the same episode we learn something about Frances that makes us view that scene in an entirely different, less forgiving way.</p> <p>\u201cThese half-hour shows are often more dramatic and meaningful than dramas,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cThey concentrate and distil many powerful themes and ideas but the shorter running times mean that they\u2019re punchier and less sprawling. They have to be focused and selective and that makes for better TV.\u201d</p> <p>They also work because they\u2019re so strongly rooted in character. We care about Fleabag because we slowly come to realise that this is a story about loss and loneliness as much as a woman behaving badly. Similarly <em>Insecure</em>\u2019s heart comes from Molly and Issa\u2019s complicated, believable friendship, which feels firmly rooted in reality, sharp one-liners and all. \u201cIt was extremely important to me that the friendship between Issa and Molly was at the heart of the show,\u201d says Rae. \u201cIt always irked me that black women are on the sidelines even in female friendly shows plus there\u2019s such a history of black women fighting on TV from reality TV shows in particular and I wanted to say no, here is an honest, realistic portrayal of black female friendship that is true to my own experience of life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89f87548b7695e36be6d5e1e0d48b24610e72907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89f87548b7695e36be6d5e1e0d48b24610e72907/0_259_4050_2430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jessica Parker in Divorce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Jessica Parker in Divorce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Insecure</em> doesn\u2019t hesitate to tackle the many different issues black women face, with Issa frequently reduced to venting her frustration with her white work colleagues in a series of bathroom raps. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bang people over the head saying this is the message of this show but at the same time being black you deal with this sort of stuff every day both in the background or more openly,\u201d Rae says. \u201cSometimes it affects you and sometimes it\u2019s just another day with this sort of stuff. I liked the idea that the bathroom is where she can be fully honest. She can let out the bravado and aggression and whatever she needs to get out and just be fully honest in a way she can\u2019t be in her real life.\u201d</p> <p><em>Fleabag</em> is similarly interested in the gap between how you present yourself to the world and the more bleak reality. \u201cFleabag\u2019s candour about sex and the more everyday aspects of life are used to distract the audience from what she\u2019s really going through,\u201d Waller-Bridge says. \u201cShe\u2019s bold about her experiences but she\u2019s not entirely honest about how they make her feel. Owning your foibles and laughing about them is very empowering but it can also be about self-preservation.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately while these shows go to some very dark places we respond positively because it\u2019s a refection of our lives in all their messy, incoherent glory. \u201cIt\u2019s important to reflect human behaviours and experiences honestly and bravely but first and foremost we go to TV for entertainment,\u201d says Waller-Bridge. \u201cThe reality of women\u2019s lives if told truthfully is undoubtedly going to entertain and if that makes people feel a little less alone then all the better for it.\u201d</p> <p><em>Fleabag is available on iPlayer</em></p> <h2>SINGLE LIVES</h2> <p><strong>That Girl (1966-1971)</strong><br>Best known for its bubbly credits, That Girl focused on would-be actress Ann Marie\u2019s attempts to make it big in New York City.</p> <p><strong>The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970-77)</strong><br>Groundbreaking in numerous ways, this was a show that celebrated Mary Richards as a single, modern woman.</p> <p><strong>Murphy Brown (1988-1998)</strong><br>The story of sharp-tongued, ambitious journalist Murphy Brown, this sitcom was also notable for tackling serious issues from alcoholism to single motherhood.</p> <p><strong>Sex and the City (1998-2004)</strong><br>Early seasons of Sex and the City were clear-eyed dissections of the life of Carrie Bradshaw as a single woman in New York.</p> <p><strong>Girls (2012\u2013)</strong><br>Brash and refreshingly unapologetic about her body and her enjoyment of sex, Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham) redrew TV\u2019s idea of the girl about town.</p>",
  "<p>The first fact mentioned in the new report on prostitution by the home affairs select committee is that \u201caround 11% of British men aged 16\u201374 have paid for sex on at least one occasion\u201d. The home affairs select committee is composed of eight men and three women. Given the men\u2019s ages, their resources and arguably enhanced opportunities, as MPs, to conclude such transactions, maybe it is not so remarkable that at least one of the parliamentarians deciding on the future legality of prostitution may also have been a sex buyer.</p> <p>It\u2019s more surprising, really, that no one on the committee, principally its chairman, Keith Vaz, seems to have questioned whether, with that level of gender imbalance, it was the ideal investigator of the overwhelmingly gendered issue of prostitution. During its second hearing, an entirely male committee would question two women, both former sex workers. Vaz assured witnesses that he approached the hearings with no \u201cpreconceived views\u201d, as required. \u201cAfter we have completed our inquiry, parliament probably will not look at this again for many years.\u201d</p> <p>There was, back then, no obvious reason to doubt his sincerity. As with so many Westminster scandals, insiders have been quick to assure the public that they always found this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/09/police-to-investigate-keith-vaz-allegations\" title=\"\">fallen star</a> distinctly creepy \u2013 \u201cfishy,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3773578/Camp-Keith-fishy-old-sardine-QUENTIN-LETTS-Vaz-s-sordid-fall-grace-escort-texts-scandal.htm\" title=\"\">said one</a>. As a more gullible spectator, I was inclined, if I never noticed anything actively virtuous about this MP, to assume there must be some basis for his occasionally homiletic manner. Vaz has not been reluctant, for instance, to shake his head over threats to \u201cmoral development\u201d, or to diagnose hypocrisy, or to draw attention to his endearing naivety, in comparison with worldly colleagues, where a sex-related commodity such as poppers is concerned. Besides, some superior qualities must have earned him the chairmanship from which he last week resigned, having allegedly paid two Romanian prostitutes for sex.</p> <p>For his supporters, of course, none of this, any more than his alleged unsafe sex or companions\u2019 use of cocaine (and poppers), has a bearing on the Vaz prostitution report. We would not, Peter Tatchell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/05/keith-vaz-home-affairs-committee-chair-prostitutes-sex-trade\" title=\"\">argued</a>, \u201cdemand that MPs who drink and smoke declare an interest when they discuss legislation affecting the alcohol and cigarette industries\u201d. No, not unless the covert smoker or drinker in question were an esteemed committee chair tasked with advising parliament on prohibition (or its opposite) and was later shown to have feigned complete ignorance of the habit. That degree of concealment might well fascinate the public.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the chief medical officer, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3431444/The-health-hypocrite-Chief-medical-officer-told-women-think-cancer-reaching-wine-pictured-enjoying-drinks-family.html\" title=\"\">Dame Sally Davies</a>, having exhorted the nation to copy her in drinking tea, not wine, was pilloried after photographs emerged suggesting only inconsistent domestic enforcement of her rule.</p> <p>On the other hand, if personal habits \u2013 Davies\u2019s occasional glass, Vaz\u2019s alleged use of prostitutes \u2013 really have no bearing on their official advice, this is marvellous news for MPs on all sides, from surreptitiously devout opponents of the right to die to the Labour elite now struggling, having sent their own children to strenuously selective schools, to muster some non-hilarious-looking opposition to Theresa May\u2019s revival of grammars.</p> <p>Far from being some weird, thoroughly sex-minded exception to an indulgent rule, public interest in Vaz\u2019s alleged involvement in prostitution surely accords with a growing expectation of openness from \u2013 or refusal to be lectured by \u2013 MPs whose personal sympathies, as well as personal finances, can shape legislation. Though in Vaz\u2019s case, maybe these could have been guessed at.</p> <p>Long before leading the inquiry, he advertised, in a 2009 debate, his opposition to interfering with paying sexual transactions. To be fair, a tender concern for prostitutes, or fallen women as they used to be known, is something of a parliamentary tradition, dating at least back to Gladstone. \u201cMinisters have used the phrase, \u2018Let us tackle the demand for sex,\u2019\u201d Vaz objected. \u201cWe cannot just say to people, \u2018Do not have sex\u2019, or, \u2018Do not have sex in these circumstances\u2019; governments should not be involved, in my view, in making such statements.\u201d</p> <p>Presumably this very clear position changed at some point before he assumed command of a government inquiry set up to, among other things, examine the \u201cdemand which drives commercial sexual exploitation\u201d. Anyway, full disclosure: I was recently a member of a commission that supported the introduction in Britain of \u201cNordic model\u201d legislation that aims, precisely in the way once unacceptable to Vaz, to reduce demand for prostitution by penalising the buyers and not, as now, the sellers of sex. Introduced in Sweden in 1999, and now enacted, with variations, in four more countries, including France, the legislation proceeds from the principle, endorsed by the European parliament and many women\u2019s organisations (and opposed by an equally vehement lobby), that prostitution amounts to acutely gendered exploitation, with horrifying costs to the many of the women and girls whose bodies are thus commodified.</p> <p>To take just one figure that emerged in the Vaz hearings, when assistant chief constable Nikki Holland wanted to illustrate prostituted women\u2019s vulnerability: \u201cWe have had 153 murders since 1990, which is probably the highest group of murders in any one category, so that gives the police cause for concern.\u201d</p> <p>But murders, such as those of five women in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-33025298\" title=\"\">Ipswich</a>, and a recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/man-guilty-murder-sex-worker-leeds-daria-pionko-lewis-pierre\" title=\"\">homicide in Leeds</a>, did not appear to worry Mr Vaz overmuch. He was more captivated, for no obvious reason, by the number of eastern Europeans in prostitution and, equally, with websites where, he explained to uninitiated witnesses, young women advertise for \u201csugar daddies\u201d. \u201cIs it perfectly fine,\u201d he <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/home-affairs-committee/prostitution/oral/30023.html one witness\" title=\"\">pressed</a>, \u201cif they do this with consent on either side?\u201d What was wrong, he persisted, with \u201ctwo consenting adults being able to come to an arrangement such as a prostitute would have with someone who is involved with her? What role does the state have in this?\u201d</p> <p>Thanks to the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>, his chairmanship can now be understood as something more complex than, as it earlier appeared, mingled indifference and inattention. Indeed, to go over these transcripts is not unlike, at key moments, rereading a novel featuring an unreliable narrator, so as to identify the places where vital information has been withheld.</p> <p>True, the Vaz inquiry is not exactly <em>Villette</em>, nor even <em>Gone Girl</em>, but what went through Vaz\u2019s head when Chuka Umunna speculated about \u201coften everyday guys who just do this because they think they can get away with it and can exploit women\u201d? Alas, buyer-witnesses were thin on the ground. \u201cWhat about that guy who is in a stable, happy situation and has children?\u201d Umunna asked ACC Holland. \u201cThat person really often gets away scot-free.\u201d</p> <p>If Vaz\u2019s interim <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/26/26.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> is not dismissed as fatally compromised, family guy now buys sex with the official blessing of the home affairs committee. Sceptical of most research, it is airy about trafficking, artful in describing rights-based arguments as quaintly \u201cmoral\u201d and wilfully obtuse about the power imbalance between sex buyers and sellers. In what, on the evidence of his hearings, may well be the authentic voice of Vaz, it denies any connection between sexual exploitation and \u201cprostitution between consenting adults\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s his way of declaring an interest.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later</p>",
  "<p>There was a deep irony at the heart of the <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/09/the-prime-ministers-speech-on-schools-and-meritocracy-full-text.html\" title=\"\">prime minister\u2019s speech</a> on increasing selection in the school system. She accused her predecessors of putting dogma and ideology before the interests of ordinary people in their failure to expand grammar schools. Yet the only arguments for a selective school system are themselves based on emotion, dogma and ideology. There is a wealth of evidence selection works against the working-class families May claimed will be at the heart of her government\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>There are serious problems in the English school system. Social background remains a much stronger predictor of how children do at school than in top-performing countries such as Canada, Finland and Korea. A much larger proportion of children, mostly from less affluent families, fail to reach basic standards of attainment than in these countries: this is not only unjust, but it creates huge economic costs. And there are significant geographical disparities; while London has the country\u2019s best state schools, children in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/dec/01/north-midlands-secondary-schools-ofsted\" title=\"\">north and Midlands</a> are much more likely to attend poor schools.</p> <p>The argument advanced in favour of expanding grammars is that they tackle social inequalities by stretching bright children from poor backgrounds. This is an important objective, but there is no evidence selection does anything to achieve it. Where they exist, grammars are dominated by children from affluent families whose parents can afford the private tuition to coach them for the high-stakes 11-plus. Even if new grammars had a proportion of places reserved for children from low-income families, it\u2019s easy to imagine how affluent parents desperate to get their children in would deploy creative means to get around an income test: taking year-long unpaid sabbaticals or artificially reducing earnings from self-employment, for example. Yet introducing selection comes at great expense to the children who fail the 11-plus, by creaming off able children from affluent backgrounds from all-ability schools. In Kent, one of the few areas that has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36662965\" title=\"\">selective schools</a>, children from low-income backgrounds do worse than elsewhere in the country.</p> <p>May is wrong to argue grammars can be part of a diverse school system that offers parents choice. A school system is either selective or it is not. By having a negative impact on the majority of children in areas where there is selection, selection takes away their parents\u2019 choice. Expanding grammar schools will make the biggest failing of the English school system \u2013 the large numbers of young people who leave school without good basic qualifications \u2013 even worse.</p> <p>It is entirely rational for parents to do everything in their power to get their child into a grammar school where they exist. But unlike parents, the government has a responsibility to all children. To pursue education reform in the hope of helping a small number of children at a guaranteed cost to others is not just misguided: it is immoral.</p> <p>The model that government should be looking to is not Kent, but London. London\u2019s comprehensive school system outperforms Kent\u2019s for children from every social background. The top-ranking school systems internationally similarly shun selection.</p> <p>Government should instead be doing much more to address the lack of good schools across some parts of the country, to ensure all children have access to a robust, stretching education. Great schools have great teachers and great heads. The government should be investing far more in attracting the best teachers to the poorest-performing areas, for example, by offering support with housing costs or waiving tuition fee debt. Children from less affluent backgrounds are far less likely to attend a good school; government should be addressing backdoor social selection via inflated house prices by expanding catchment areas and allocating places at oversubscribed schools by a lottery.</p> <p>Yet May is focusing energy in all the wrong places. She has indicated she will lift restrictions on selection by belief for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/06/faith-british-schools-hope\" title=\"\">new faith schools</a>, despite the fact they are already less ethnically and socially mixed than other schools in their area and this will make them more so. Requiring universities and private schools to sponsor academies will at best bring very marginal benefits; some of these existing partnerships have been successful, while others have produced <a href=\"http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2014/jun/ofsted-rules-ucl-academy-requires-improvement\" title=\"\">very disappointing results</a>.</p> <p>Michael Gove christened his critics in the progressive education establishment \u201cthe Blob\u201d. The voices that have come out in criticism of May\u2019s proposals are far more broad-based: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/sep/17/michael-wilshaw-interview\" title=\"\">Michael Wilshaw</a>, the chief inspector of schools who ran one of the country\u2019s first academies; Nicky Morgan, education secretary until just two months ago.</p> <p>Not even the current education secretary, Justine Greening, the first occupant of that office to have been educated at a comprehensive, mounted a convincing defence.</p> <p>While expanding selection has terrible implications for the education system, the politics may have been what proved tempting for May. Her greatest challenge will be negotiating the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Her strongest opposition in parliament will come not from a Labour party that has never looked weaker, but from critics to her right. Electorally, May will be more worried about leaking support to Ukip than to Labour and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeilGarratt/status/774341490260705281/photo/1\" title=\"\">expanding grammars is popular among </a>Leave and Ukip voters. In the wake of the EU referendum, Labour\u2019s failure to provide any credible electoral threat will help ensure the politics of the next parliament will be dominated by this dynamic, rather than a traditional left-right one.</p> <p>But just as Brexit is unlikely to directly benefit those whom globalisation and structural economic change have left behind, expanding grammars, even with the stipulation they reserve places for children from low-income backgrounds, is likely to have the most negative impact on white, working-class boys. Places reserved for low-income children will most likely go to those from the ethnic minority groups that outperform white working-class children at age 11.</p> <p>So far, May\u2019s rhetoric has been carefully pitched around standing up for ordinary, working-class people against the interests of the wealthiest and the most powerful. Yet so far the substance of her domestic policy \u2013 watering down plans to combat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/observer-view-childhood-obesity-strategy-sugar-tax\" title=\"\">childhood obesity</a> and expanding selective education \u2013 will achieve the opposite, even if that is not her intention.</p> <p>It suggests it is she, not her opponents, who stands guilty of allowing dogma and ideology to get in the way of addressing social inequity.</p>",
  "<p>One party contested the last general election with a commitment to create more grammar schools. That party wasn\u2019t the Conservatives \u2013 it was Ukip. So why did Theresa May pick a fight for which she lacks a mandate? Why start it now when she was under absolutely no pressure to do so? Why unfurl her standard on terrain that looks heavily stacked against her from the start? In seeking to understand why she has chosen to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a> her first domestic battlefield, we will find that political psychology is a more useful guide than anything else.</p> <p>There was no public clamour for a programme of expanding grammar schools. Even in the minority of counties where they have survived the wave of abolitions that began in the 1960s, only a small segment of the electorate have any direct experience of them. That is why I don\u2019t place much trust in opinion polls suggesting that there is a lot of public support for expanding the number of schools allocating places by academic selection. I am not confident that most people responding to these polls understand what grammars are and what more of them would mean. In her big speech on Friday, Mrs May contended that her new version of the grammar is intended to be \u201cinclusive, not exclusive\u201d. But exclusivity is the whole point about them and it is so for both their supporters and opponents. Giving to the gifted child a different, and implicitly superior, kind of schooling is precisely the attraction of grammars to those who think they are a fantastic idea; just as it is why they are so passionately opposed by the many critics, among them the chief inspector of schools, who think that segregating children is a dreadful concept.</p> <p>It is a political problem with grammars as well as a social and educational one that they divide children into winners and losers. This was one of the major reasons that previous Tory governments have not attempted to restore them. Margaret Thatcher may have been a proud alumnus of Kesteven and Grantham Girls\u2019 School, but as education secretary she presided over a record number of closures and never sought to revive the grammar/secondary modern split when she was prime minister. \u201cBring back the grammars\u201d has, though, always been an effective way of harvesting applause from Tory audiences. It is especially popular with Conservatives who, like the current prime minister, had a grammar school education themselves and believe that it explains their life stories. Autobiography may be a bad way of making policy, but in my experience it has an especially potent influence on politicians when it comes to education. Full declaration of my own background: I went to all-ability state primary and junior schools, sat what was then the 12-plus and attended a grammar in Warwickshire before going on a scholarship to a private school. I hope that multi-environment experience gives me a bit of insight into how the protagonists are thinking.</p> <p>During the exchanges about the government\u2019s intentions in parliament, some of the Tory contributors lingered affectionately on their school days. <a href=\"http://www.chrisphilp.com\" title=\"\">Chris Philp</a>, the MP for Croydon South, declared: \u201cI went to a state grammar school in south London and I owe my place here to that school.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/greening-struggles-to-produce-evidence-to-back-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">Justine Greening</a>, the comprehensive-schooled education secretary, responded rather icily: \u201cI think all of us are here because of the education that we were lucky enough to have.\u201d</p> <p>Education is one of those subjects that provokes Conservatives to fight a form of class war with each other. It is rare for this war to be openly declared, but it is lurking in the background and becomes visceral when they debate schooling. Grammar Tories think of themselves as the product of intelligence allied to effort and ambition. They often feel this most intensely. When Michael Howard was Tory leader, I never saw him more passionate than when he shouted over the dispatch box at Tony Blair that he, Howard \u201cthis grammar-school boy\u201d, was not going to take any lectures about privilege from \u201cthat public-school boy\u201d.</p> <p>This sense of moral superiority among grammar-school Tories is felt just as keenly, even more so in fact, when they compare themselves with private-school Tories whom they often regard as unmerited beneficiaries of wealth and inherited advantage. \u201cMeritocracy\u201d was a word that David Cameron struggled to use without being mocked because of where he went to school. Mrs May is much more comfortable with it and \u201cmeritocracy\u201d made repeat appearances in her speech. Her declared ambition was to make \u201cBritain the great meritocracy of the world\u201d. Many Tories of her background hated Mr Cameron for his refusal to countenance a revival of grammars. They regarded this as a man with an expensive education denying life chances to people who had not enjoyed his early advantages. Mrs May has made a big feature of the opening period of her premiership of defining herself through contrasts with her predecessor. This is a way of virtue-signalling to other Tories and the wider electorate that she is a friend of aspiration and opportunity in a way her predecessor was not.</p> <p>Let us assume that she sincerely wants to do more for gifted children from less advantaged backgrounds. In taking this road, she simply ignores the great weight of evidence that says her chosen instrument will not do that and might very well sharpen inequalities. Specialist after specialist has reminded the prime minister of this since she declared her intentions. So have many colleagues from her own party. David Willetts, the Tory minister for the universities in the last parliament, has pointed out that if your aim is to lubricate social mobility, then expanding the number of grammars is not the way to go about it. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, bluntly calls the policy a \u201cweird\u201d distraction from driving up the performance of all schools while Ms Greening couldn\u2019t sound less enthused. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/grammar-schools-expansion-disaster-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburn\" title=\"\">Alan Milburn</a>, the chairman of the government\u2019s commission on social mobility, predicts that it will be a \u201cdisaster\u201d because it will not lead to more selection by ability but more \u201cselection socially\u201d. Mrs May has had to acknowledge that affluent parents will try to maximise the chances of their offspring prospering from an extension of selection. She has also conceded that no one has yet managed to come up with a test that is \u201ctutor-proof\u201d. She can\u2019t or won\u2019t say how many new grammars she would like.</p> <p>When you get into the detail, the government is not putting all that much money where the prime minister\u2019s mouth is. She envisages spending \u00a350m a year on expanding grammars, a tiny fraction of an education budget totalling more than \u00a380bn. That\u2019s not really the supposed \u201cschools revolution\u201d blared in some of the headlines. This suggests it is more about symbolism.</p> <p>That symbolism is nevertheless important because expanding grammars is an implied repudiation of the idea that every school should strive for excellence. It upsets a well-grounded consensus that the most effective way to drive up educational attainment is to concentrate on recruiting talented teachers and put them under effective leadership. There is also plenty of evidence about the best way to tackle underachievement, which is to focus extra help on poorer children through mechanisms such as the pupil premium and paying extra to good teachers who work in disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>Projecting grammars on to the top of the news bulletins has also obscured other ideas from Mrs May that were potentially more radical and more likely to gather wide support. It was arresting to hear a Tory prime minister say that private schools must do more for their communities to earn their charitable tax breaks. That has largely gone unremarked upon because of the emotional potency of the grammars issue. Opposition will be wide, deep and fierce. This is one of those rare issues \u2013 in fact, it is the only one \u2013 which unites the teaching unions, Michael Gove, the Lib Dems, the Scottish Nationalists, Jeremy Corbyn and the parliamentary Labour party. It will require legislation. Memo to Mrs May: your working majority in the Commons is just 17. A chunk of Tory MPs, among them the Conservative chairman of the education select committee, are already indicating that they are not comfortable. Further memo to Mrs May: you do not have a majority at all in the Lords. The upper house will not be constrained by the Salisbury Convention that binds peers not to oppose a policy that was in the ruling party\u2019s election manifesto because expanding the number of grammars was not in the Tory manifesto.</p> <p>The prime minister is setting herself up for a ferocious battle for which she does not have an electoral mandate over a relatively trivial amount of money to implement a policy that will have an impact only on a tiny minority of schoolchildren and with no evidence that it will have the intended effect. \u201cMy teachers made me the woman I am today,\u201d Mrs May wrote for yesterday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3782457/My-debt-grammar-schools-Theresa-s-personal-crusade-child-chance-education-revolution-attacks-fee-paying-schools-divorced-reality.html\" title=\"\"><em>Daily Mail</em></a>. She must have missed the lesson about only starting battles worth fighting and where there is a good chance of winning.</p>",

The outcome cost Williams not only a chance at a history-making 23rd grand slam title to eclipse Steffi Graf\u2019s professional-era mark for major championships but also the No1 ranking that she\u2019s held since February 2013 \u2013 a span of 186 weeks that equaled Graf\u2019s record for consecutive weeks on top.</p> <p>It marks the second straight year Williams has fallen at the penultimate hurdle in a bid for history at the season-ending major.

Jessie is what is known in the surrogacy world as a gestational carrier, where IVF is used to impregnate a surrogate with the intended mother\u2019s egg and the intended father\u2019s sperm, resulting in a baby not biologically related to the surrogate. </p> <p>\u201cWe are so fortunate to have been blessed with two healthy children and it was our decision how many children we wanted to have,\u201d Jessie says. </p> <p>\u201cSome people don\u2019t get to make that choice so I felt it was something that I could help out with. Our children are our life, we live for them and I couldn\u2019t imagine how hard it would be to feel that your family is not complete and not being able to do anything about it yourself. Being able to help someone with their dream is a pretty good feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Commercial surrogacy is illegal in all jurisdictions except the Northern Territory, so Jessie will not receive any money for her role in helping Emma and Michael become parents, apart from having her medical and legal costs covered by them.</p> <p>It is only legal to advertise for a surrogate or to advertise an offer to become a surrogate in New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory and the advertisement must not be a paid one. </p> <p>This leaves many, including Jessie and Emma, turning to online forums to find surrogates or intended parents. Many more couples abandon their hopes of finding a surrogate in Australia altogether, flying overseas and entering into commercial surrogacy arrangements. Despite traveling overseas for such arrangements being illegal in Queensland, NSW and the ACT, many Australians do it anyway, though there has not been a single prosecution for doing so.</p> <p>According to a study led by Surrogacy Australia, 269 babies were born through overseas surrogacy on behalf of Australians in 2011. Comparatively, just 35 babies were born to gestational surrogates within Australia and New Zealand combined in 2013, <a href=\"https://npesu.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/npesu/data_collection/Assisted%20reproductive%20technology%20in%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand%202013.pdf\">the latest available statistics</a> from the Australian and New Zealand Assisted Reproduction Database show.

Jessie was contacted in an online forum by several parents but connected most with Emma and Michael. The couples met for the first time about one year ago and have visited each other several times since.</p> <p>\u201cShe lives in Rockhampton, I live in Canberra, we have no common friends, we don\u2019t have similar lives, she\u2019s 33 and I\u2019m 40, she\u2019s a teacher\u2019s aid and I\u2019m a high school teacher and playwright,\u201d Emma says. \u201cBut it has become a fantastic friendship. Jessie will always be acknowledged as the \u2018tummy mummy\u2019 and she\u2019ll always be a part of our family.\u201d</p> <p>Emma wants people to know that for most people going down the surrogacy route, the option is a last resort and often follows years of heartache. Emma and Michael had their first child, Edward, nine years ago, but it took them two years to conceive him. Emma discovered her fallopian tubes were blocked about 18 months into trying and, after a medical procedure to repair her fallopian tubes, became pregnant with him six months later.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought we\u2019d had it tough because we\u2019d tried so hard to conceive him but we had no idea how tough things could get,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One month after Edward was born, they conceived again, which excited them given their desire for more children and earlier difficulties. But Emma miscarried at nine weeks, discovering she had been carrying twins.</p> <p>In 2010 Emma became pregnant again, this time through IVF, having failed to conceive naturally for two years. At 15 weeks, when she went to the toilet one night, her waters broke.</p> <p>\u201cWe went to hospital and they said; \u2018you\u2019ll have to have a termination and deliver the baby, even though it\u2019s still alive\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was terrible. Doctors had different viewpoints about what had happened but no one could tell us clearly why. But it was clear the baby could not survive without the waters to help it develop its lungs and other vital organs. </p> <p>\u201cWe tried IVF again with the hope that it might have been a one-off and hoped for the best.\u201d</p> <p>However, in 2011, again at 14 weeks into the pregnancy, an ultrasound revealed her baby had died. Again, she had to give birth. </p> <p>At 12 weeks, when Emma went to the toilet and felt the baby coming, she was taken to hospital where she had an emergency operation to attempt to push the baby back and stitch up the cervix. Doctors said her baby probably died sometime after this due to the trauma of that procedure.</p> <p>\u201cIt was awful,\u201d Emma says. \u201cAfter that we were in despair. I was 36 by then and Michael was 39.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/25/surrogacy-sweden-ban\">All surrogacy is exploitation \u2013 the world should follow Sweden\u2019s ban | Kajsa Ekis Ekman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doctors by this stage believed Emma may have a medical condition where the cervix is weak and begins to dilate and thin before a pregnancy can reach term. To complicate matters, she had also been diagnosed with an autoimmune illness that could, in itself, cause pregnancy loss.</p> <p>But, to their shock, Emma and Michael became pregnant again in 2014, this time conceiving naturally despite believing they were unable to. They had not been trying for a child. Emma was terrified of losing another baby and asked for a surgical stitch to be placed around her cervix to strengthen it and hold it closed. She was advised by her obstetrician that the stitch would not be necessary, because there were other, safer ways to support the cervix. A routine scan at 15 weeks found her cervix had begun to open and she was at this point given a surgical stitch and placed on strict bed rest. </p> <p>\u201cNearly four weeks into the bed rest I was given an ultrasound that revealed my waters had seeped gradually away and so, just like the first time, I had to give birth to a living baby that would not survive,\u201d Emma says. </p> <p>\u201cWe felt cursed. It was our third second-trimester loss. We named them all \u2013 Pat, Pip and Rose. </p> <p>\u201cThe doctor said he felt my cervix during my last procedure and it was like butter. He said he didn\u2019t know why, it was a mystery, but there was just something wrong, but that it was also clear there was no hope that I could carry a baby.</p> <p>\u201cThen Jessie came along and she saved our sanity. She\u2019s just extraordinary.\u201d</p> <p>However, the surrogacy process has not been without its difficulties. Unfortunately the first embryo transfer to Jessie, in January, ended in miscarriage about seven weeks into her pregnancy. </p> <p>\u201cThat was the first time I have experienced anything like that and was very tough for all of us,\u201d Jessie says. </p> <p>But, to Emma and Michael\u2019s relief, Jessie agreed to try again.</p> <p>\u201cWe were fortunate that the second transfer has been successful,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cIn the beginning especially, it was near impossible to relax. As time goes on and everything seems to be going great, I can relax and try and enjoy the pregnancy a little more each day.\u201d </p> <p>She is now 25 weeks pregnant.</p> <p>While there is no limit to the number of IVF cycles that can be claimed through Medicare, surrogates who become pregnant through IVF are not entitled to a Medicare rebate. It makes surrogacy an option only to those who can afford it.<br></p> <p>Emma says she stopped keeping track of the medical and legal costs when they reached about $50,000. This is, however, still cheaper than it is for those who travel overseas to find a commercial surrogate, with a study published in the Medical Journal of Australia finding the average total costs for couples travelling to India was $69,212 and $172,347 for those traveling to the US. </p> <p>The president of Surrogacy Australia, Robert Reith, says the organisation wants the government to allow a Medicare rebate for couples who require a surrogate to start a family, to decriminalise commercial surrogacy and to create a compensated surrogacy framework consistent across Australia, including allowing for surrogates and intending parents to advertise.</p> <p>\u201cCommon factors for requiring surrogacy include infertility, being unable to carry a child due to disease or cancer, being part of a same-sex relationship, or Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome [a disorder that occurs in women and mainly affects her reproductive system],\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cMost surrogacy pregnancies are very positive. After 10 years of heartbreak, my wife and I are currently 17 weeks pregnant. My sister-in-law is our surrogate.

  "<p>A new wave of grammar schools will deliver a boost for the fee-paying sector as middle-class parents whose children fail the 11-plus look to dodge what they see as a second-rate state education, said Neil Roskilly, who represents headteachers of nearly 400 private schools. He said parents were already using them as \u201cinsurance\u201d in case their children failed to be selected in areas where there were grammars.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-grammar-school-selection-middle-class\">Theresa May\u2019s grammar school nostalgia is heartfelt - but wrong | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roskilly, chief executive of the Independent Schools Association, said he believed that this behaviour could be reproduced across England and represented a dangerous flight of the middle classes from the state sector.</p> <p>On Friday, Theresa May announced her plans for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/tory-rebels-quash-theresa-mays-grammar-school-plans\" title=\"\">more selection in the state system</a>, a policy which received a boost with the defection of the Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne to the Tories, in part due to the prime minister\u2019s speech.</p> <p>Roskilly, however, said that May had questions to answer over the introduction of more grammar schools, although he believed it could offer a boost to the smaller private schools. He said: \u201cThe most thriving independent schools are actually in areas where there are grammar schools now.</p> <p>\u201cThe expectations of parents are raised through preparation for the 11-plus test in places such as Kent \u2013Tunbridge Wells is a classic example. And those parents then say, \u2018We didn\u2019t get in but I am not going to go into the maintained sector\u2019. For every grammar school that is created, there are three or four of what used to be called secondary moderns. That\u2019s the great fear for the middle classes. So they then look at the independent schools as an insurance offer in those areas. I can see that happening more and more across the country.\u201d</p> <p>May faces a battle to see through plans for more selection in the state system. Sam Freedman, a former policy adviser at the Department for Education under Michael Gove, and a critic of reviving grammar schools, told the ResearchEd national conference in London yesterday that 20 to 30 Tory MPs could vote against legislation allowing new grammars to open.</p> <p>The government is also challenged today by the Sutton Trust to ensure that children from less affluent families win places at grammar schools by offering them lower thresholds to pass selection tests.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said they would consult on how best to improve social mobility but that such a policy had not been \u201cruled in or out\u201d.</p> <p>Lee Elliot Major, the Sutton Trust\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI think the challenge will be that all our research shows that gaps at 11 are already quite stark \u2026 I think you would have to have lower grades for people from poorer backgrounds. Universities do this and, we would say, it is good practice.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the children get into these universities or schools, they do just as well, the evidence would suggest. It is just whether the government is going to back those sort of quite radical measures. Because if you don\u2019t do them properly, they will just end up being middle-class enclaves.\u201d</p> <p>Announcing her defection to the Conservatives on Saturday, Nicholson praised the prime minister\u2019s \u201creal commitment to delivering for the next generation and building a country that works for everyone\u201d.</p> <p>Nicholson, who defected from the Tories to the Lib Dems in 1995, said: \u201cI am rejoining the Conservative party with tremendous pleasure.

Lucas Leiva, deputising for Dejan Lovren, who picked up a monstrous shiner after a clash of heads in training on Friday, found James Milner on the left and that was the signal for Firmino to lose Daniel Amartey with a piercing run. Milner delivered the required pass, the Brazilian cut inside Robert Huth and beat Kasper Schmeichel with an intelligent finish. The mood and flow of the game were transformed. \u201cWe started well but after the first goal we lost our counter and they played so, so well,\u201d agreed Ranieri.</p> <p>Man\u00e9 was a devastating menace throughout and teed up Sturridge for a close-range shot that Schmeichel saved well. The Dane was powerless, however, when Sturridge returned the favour and Man\u00e9 doubled Liverpool\u2019s lead in thrilling fashion. Lucas, Firmino and Jordan Henderson were all involved as the Liverpool captain sent Sturridge clear with a measured chip over the top. The striker\u2019s control was excellent, his second touch even better as he back-heeled inside for the unmarked Man\u00e9 to scoop the ball over the Leicester goalkeeper\u2019s despairing grasp and over the line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fe2e81ddebef2f94c5376948457a114ab2ac9d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fe2e81ddebef2f94c5376948457a114ab2ac9d7/0_115_5568_3342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sadio Man\u00e9 lifts the ball over Kasper Schmeichel to put Liverpool 2-0 up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sadio Man\u00e9 lifts the ball over Kasper Schmeichel to put Liverpool 2-0 up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anfield purred over the comfortable lead but was left aghast by not one but two errors from Lucas. The makeshift centre-half mis-controlled a routine goal-kick from Mignolet and, with Shinji Okazaki closing in, compounded the error by clearing straight to Jamie Vardy. The striker accepted the gift from close range and Leicester almost equalised when Mignolet missed a long throw from Luis Hern\u00e1ndez, a replacement for the hamstrung Danny Simpson, and Huth\u2019s looping header landed on the top of the bar.</p> <p>Ranieri tried to sharpen his attack with the introduction of Ahmed Musa, the \u00a317m summer signing from CSKA Moscow, but Liverpool\u2019s tireless and tricky front three monopolised the danger. Lallana, fresh from saving England in Slovakia, drove an unstoppable finish into the top corner following a neat lay-off from the impressive Georginio Wijnaldum. The fourth arrived in the final moments when Henderson, earlier guilty of a glaring miss, released Man\u00e9 behind a square Leicester defence and a needless rush by Schmeichel. Man\u00e9 unselfishly squared for Firmino to seal victory with a nonchalant finish.</p> <p>There was a bizarre moment at 3-1 when, with the Kop singing his name, Klopp reacted furiously to the tribute and pointed to his watch to say the serenading was premature. His grievance may have been supported by Vardy breaking clear and forcing an important save from Mignolet but the manager\u2019s concern was out of context with Liverpool\u2019s dominance. \u201cPlease don\u2019t sing my name before the game is decided,\u201d he requested. \u201cIt is nice but not necessary.\u201d It is also hard for supporters to resist with victories like this.</p>",
  "<p>Dozens of birds have mysteriously fallen out of the sky in Boston, prompting health officials to launch an investigation.<br></p> <p>A total of 47 grackles rained down upon the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston on Thursday. The <a href=\"http://www.arlboston.org/\">Animal Rescue League of Boston</a> said that 32 of these birds died, either at the scene or afterwards as rescuers attempted to tend to them.

  "<p>Laura Mongan started the week saddling the last horse home in a six-runner, Class Five handicap at Brighton. She ended it as a Classic-winning trainer, and the first female winner of the St Leger, after Harbour Law got up in the final strides to beat Ventura Storm in a dramatic race that was thrown wide open when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/05/aidan-obrien-idaho-st-leger-jim-crowley-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Idaho, the odds-on favourite</a>, unseated his rider, Seamie Heffernan, with just under half a mile to run.</p> <p>Idaho was travelling well when he appeared to take a false step and stumble not long after the turn for home. Heffernan was bounced to his right and had no chance to stay in the saddle as Idaho regained his balance before galloping on riderless.</p> <p>The sell-out crowd at Town Moor was still trying to absorb the sudden departure of the 4-6 favourite as the race developed in earnest with two furlongs to run. Ventura Storm and Housesofparliament duelled for the lead for much of the last quarter-mile, but both began to empty with the finishing line in sight, just as Harbour Law started to stay on strongly for George Baker, his jockey. He surged into the lead well inside the last 100 yards, earning Classic success for Mongan\u2019s stable at 22-1 with her first runner in a Group One race.</p> <p>Mongan has a mixed string of about 20 horses at Condover Stables in Epsom. \u201cTo go down in history as the first woman to win it is amazing, at least I\u2019ve done something right,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a surprise to us. It might be to others [but] we wouldn\u2019t have brought him otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cHe proved to everyone that he could do it. George knows the horse and did the right thing on him, so credit to him. It was a really professional performance from the horse, we knew he was classy and we knew he was going to go somewhere in life and today he has.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a great team at home and it proves that we can do it with the right ammunition and it proves that Epsom can do it.\u201d</p> <p>Heffernan was taken to hospital, but was not believed to have suffered any significant injury in the incident. \u201cThe medical staff feel he may have had a knock to the head when he fell,\u201d said Kevin Buckley, the UK representative for the Coolmore Stud syndicate that owns Idaho. \u201cThe doctor wants to send him to Sheffield hospital for a precautionary scan just to be 100% sure. Seamie is sat up in the medical room and chatting away and seems fine.\u201d</p> <p>Rivet had to work to justify his status as favourite for the Group Two Champagne Stakes, but a hard-fought head defeat of Thunder Snow showed that he has the attitude to make the most of his talent, while the first two drew five lengths clear of D\u2019Bai in third.</p> <p>\u201cHe looked to make heavy weather of it, but he won and that\u2019s all that matters really,\u201d William Haggas, the winning trainer, said. \u201cI would definitely like to run him again this season, but whether that is over seven furlongs or a mile, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s in every smart race that I could find, so we will take it from there.</p> <p>\u201cI need to see it again to assess it. They pulled clear of the third in a slowly-run race, which is a good sign. Andrea [Atzeni, his jockey] said he would get a mile and now probably wants it. He thought the ground was a bit loose on top for him but, all in all, he\u2019s won and, when you come for a race like this from a maiden, you hope they do.\u201d</p> <p>Atzeni completed a double in the first three races when Breton Rock moved from last to first in the space of a little more than a furlong to catch The Happy Prince, ridden by Heffernan, with a stride to spare in the Group Two Park Stakes. He later added another success when Khalidi, at 5-2, took the card\u2019s nursery handicap.</p>",
  "<p>Tensions between Facebook and the news industry boiled over this week when the social media corporation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-napalm-girl-photo-vietnam-war\">censored</a> a Pulitzer-winning Vietnam war photo, because it featured a naked child and violated site \u201ccommunity standards\u201d.</p> <p>The dispute over the \u201cnapalm girl\u201d image, which a Norwegian writer published in a post about <a href=\"http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentar/Dear-Mark-I-am-writing-this-to-inform-you-that-I-shall-not-comply-with-your-requirement-to-remove-this-picture-604156b.html\">historic warfare photography</a>, ended Friday when Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-reinstates-napalm-girl-photo\">reversed its decision</a>, acknowledging the \u201cglobal importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time\u201d.</p> <p>But the spat has exposed what journalists and ethicists say are fundamental flaws in the way Facebook controls and spreads news. Critics say the company\u2019s decisions were driven by PR concerns and should serve as a wake-up call to free speech advocates about how powerful Facebook has become\u2013 and how ill-equipped the corporation is for its role, however unwilling, in journalism.</p> <p>Some hope the scandal will be a turning point for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who critics say has a moral obligation to recognize his role as the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful editor\u201d and take meaningful steps to make Facebook accountable for what it distributes. </p> <p>\u201cWhat Facebook has to do now is think very hard about what it really means to be a publisher,\u201d said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. \u201cIf they don\u2019t,\u201d she warned, \u201cthis is going to happen to them over and over again.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We need more than just algorithms\u2019</h2> <p>Whether Facebook and media executives like to admit it, the social media site now plays a vital role in how people consume news, carrying an influence that is difficult to overstate. Studies have <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/new-pew-data-more-americans-are-getting-news-on-facebook-and-twitter/\">repeatedly</a> found that Facebook has become the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/24/how-social-media-is-reshaping-news/\">primary news source</a> for many people, and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/15/facebooks-news-publishers-reuters-institute-for-the-study-of-journalism\">publishers\u2019 revenues</a> have been hit hard as a result. </p> <p>To some journalists, the decline in advertising revenue is less alarming than what the row over the war photo revealed: Facebook\u2019s control over the news has become so vast that it could censor stories in ways that deeply threaten the free press.</p> <p>Whether Facebook knows what to do with that power is an open question.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like these are kids playing with a toy above their age bracket,\u201d said Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe surely need something more than just algorithms. We need people who are sentient beings who will actually stop and analyze these things.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg has refused to acknowledge that Facebook is a publisher or <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/08/30/facebook-media-company/\">media company</a>, instead sticking to the labels of \u201ctech company\u201d and \u201cplatform\u201d. But the idea of an unbiased platform was recently called into question when it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/09/facebook-newsfeed-censor-conservative-news\">revealed </a>that Facebook staff curated news articles in its \u201ctrending\u201d section.</p> <p>The company then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/facebook-fires-trending-topics-team-algorithm\">fired the team</a> that managed the trending pieces and let an algorithm take over, and Facebook immediately began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/facebook-trending-news-editors-fake-news-stories\">pushing fake and vulgar stories</a> into users\u2019 feeds.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook wants to have the responsibility of a publisher but also to be seen as a neutral carrier of information that is not in the position of making news judgments,\u201d said Jim Newton, a former Los Angeles Times editor who teaches journalism ethics at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they are going to be able to navigate that in the long term.\u201d</p> <p>Bell said Facebook was a \u201cspectacularly well resourced and brilliant organization from a technological perspective\u201d \u2013 and that its editorial efforts should start to reflect that rigor and dedication. Some have called for someone responsible for tough newsroom decisions to take over: an editor in duties and title.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook needs an editor \u2013 to stop Facebook from editing,\u201d Jeff Jarvis, journalism professor at the City University of New York, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffjarvis/dear-mark-zuckerberg-d0b48675dfaf#.gvnedan3c\">wrote</a> on Friday. \u201cIt needs someone to save Facebook from itself by bringing principles to the discussion of rules.\u201d</p> <p>Jarvis argued that Facebook should allow editors of reputable news organizations to make key decisions related to how they use the platform \u2013 such as publishing a war photo that may technically violate policy. A Facebook editor could intervene when there are disagreements, he said.</p> <p>Edward Wasserman, dean of the University of California, Berkeley journalism school, said Facebook should create a team of journalists to address these complex issues \u2013 instead of reacting on reflex when a mistake goes viral.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are in the news business, which they are, then they have to get into the world of editorial judgement.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018Black boxes\u2019 that no one understands</h2> <p>To some in media, a key first step to making Facebook a respectable news publisher is increased transparency.</p> <p>Aside from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-trending-news-leaked-documents-editor-guidelines\">leaked documents</a>, the public knows little about how Facebook\u2019s algorithms work and what role employees play. Both algorithms and editors can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/artificial-intelligence-beauty-contest-doesnt-like-black-people\">heavily biased</a>, and until Facebook is more open about how and why certain news stories are permitted and promoted, the company will continue to earn the ire of journalists, whose stories can live or die by Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook and Google are like black boxes. Nobody understands the algorithms except the people inside,\u201d said Jonathan Taplin, former director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab.</p> <p>Without knowledge of how Facebook determines a war photo is pornographic, there is an assumption that a machine or an ignorant low-level staffer made the call \u2013 and there is no one to hold accountable. </p> <p>\u201cIt was probably a human who is 22 years old and has no fucking idea about the importance of the [napalm] picture,\u201d Taplin said.</p> <p>While news organizations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust\">like the Guardian</a> operate as a public trust, Facebook has a different agenda, he added. He noted that the Facebook board continues to include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/peter-thiel-gawker-philanthropy-paypal-mogul-secret-war-billionaire\">Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire</a> who secretly funded a lawsuit that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/peter-thiel-gawker-philanthropy-paypal-mogul-secret-war-billionaire\">bankrupted Gawker</a>.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s in Facebook\u2019s best interest in the long run to become a reliable and reputable system for news, said Kathleen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-trending-false-news-stories\">Facebook fact-check: from Hillary's health to 9/11, the latest lies we read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFacebook is trying to deliver a platform that people want to advertise on,\u201d she said, \u201cand [one that] users want to be on.\u201d Culver compared the network to MySpace, which had failed to attract ad revenue because it was so unregulated and chaotic.</p> <p>A Vietnam war image would not discourage advertisers or users, she said, but a constant stream of fake or obscene stories can be a legitimate turnoff. </p> <p>\u201cIf I go right now to trending topics, I guarantee I can find you conspiracy theories [and] misinformation,\u201d said Culver.<br></p> <p>On Friday, when Facebook was still censoring the photo of nine-year-old Kim Ph\u00fac running away from a napalm attack, the site\u2019s trending bar began posting something indisputably offensive \u2013 a story <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/9/12866332/facebook-trending-topics-september-11th-hoax-conspiracy\">suggesting</a> that the September 11 terrorist attacks were caused by a \u201ccontrolled demolition\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018People have to stand up\u2019</h2> <p>While Facebook has vowed to discuss the matter with publishers, journalists said the case highlighted the importance of media pressure on the social media giant to rethink its practices.</p> <p>The blistering open letter by Espen Egil Hansen, editor of Aftenposten, the Norwegian paper that launched the controversy, offered a strong blueprint for how media should push back against Facebook censorship, Culver said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important for journalists and news organizations to be fully defending free expression.\u201d</p> <p>News outlets including <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/posts/10154511391951323\">the Guardian</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost/posts/10154121067412293\">Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/time/posts/10153981873806491\">Time</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/msnbc/posts/1271396299623286\">NBC</a> posted articles with the napalm photo on their Facebook pages after Hansen\u2019s front-page rebuke of Zuckerberg began to spread. \u201cMore and more people have to stand up and say this is not the role that Facebook should have,\u201d Taplin said.</p> <p>But although the Aftenposten letter pushed Facebook to back down, Wasserman remained perturbed by the company\u2019s intransigence. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a front-page expression of disgust,\u201d he said, \u201cto get their attention.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Fulham\u2019s longest unbeaten run since the beginning of the 2010-11 season has ended, but what will really irk Slavisa Jokanovic is the diabolical nature of their performance against a team that would have enjoyed a larger margin of victory had they possessed a more ruthless touch.</p> <p>If six league games without defeat, plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/24/fulham-middlesbrough-efl-cup-match-report\">a Premier League scalp in the EFL Cup</a>, had buoyed the Cottagers before the international break, this return to action will have explained in bold terms that they are a long way off anything resembling a promotion challenge.

We had some possession without bringing it to our more offensive players. So many mistakes in one game is not good enough.\u201d</p> <p>Given Fulham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/fulham-newcastle-united-championship-match-report\">quite impressive start to the season</a>, the level of control exerted by the visitors from the beginning was mildly surprising, but it would continue for the majority of the game. \u201cIn the first half we were excellent,\u201d said Gary Rowett, the Birmingham manager. \u201cWe worked well defensively. Even though they had better possession stats, we had 22 shots to their seven.\u201d</p> <p>Only for the goalkeeping of David Button, Birmingham would have been comfortably clear by half-time. He produced a stunning save low to his left to deny Donaldson, a former team-mate at Brentford, from the spot in the 27th minute and followed it up with stops from Robert Tesche and Jacques Maghoma.</p> <p>Michael Madl had conceded the first penalty by bringing down Che Adams, earning a yellow card in the process, and the centre-half was dismissed two minutes before the break for a foul on Donaldson near halfway as the striker countered.</p> <p>In one sense Madl was taking one for the team because the eventual match-winner would have had a clear path to goal. However, the Austrian defender had displayed his shakiness much earlier when shoving Donaldson inside the area. The referee, Tony Harrington, waved away that appeal, but he could not ignore Fulham\u2019s subsequent clumsiness in their own area.</p> <p>Further up the pitch the hosts were toothless and Jokanovic swiftly altered his lineup, removing Johansen from midfield. The Norwegian, signed from Celtic last month, was switched for Jozabed S\u00e1nchez Ruiz, who was scarcely an improvement. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start very well and I tried to change the structure, find a solution,\u201d Jokanovic said.</p> <p>The manager changed personnel once more at the break, introducing Neeskens Kebano for Matt Smith. Yet the second penalty was awarded four minutes after the restart. Again Adams was taken down, this time by Floyd Ayit\u00e9 a yard inside the area. Donaldson insisted on stepping up despite Rowett instructing Maghoma to take over and, confidence still intact, sent Button the wrong way.</p> <p>Fulham did show some degree of intensity with 25 minutes remaining and had a couple of chances to pull level. A jinking run by Tom Cairney yielded a corner, Kebano was denied by Tomasz Kuszczak and the left-back Scott Malone should have done better with a follow-up attempt.</p> <p>Chris Martin, on loan from Derby, was sprung from the bench for his debut for the final 15 minutes but Birmingham should have been out of sight. Maghoma, Jonathan Grounds and Lukas Jutkiewicz, who has been borrowed from Burnley, all spurned decent opportunities.</p> <p>\u201cWe made hard work of it a little in second half and we need to be more clinical,\u201d Rowett said, but his team look decent value for third position in the early standings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e55aa2447cb00f2042466527bf6c1f982b4e712\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e55aa2447cb00f2042466527bf6c1f982b4e712/0_263_3872_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Button saves a first-half penalty from Clayton Donaldson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Button saves a first-half penalty from Clayton Donaldson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leicester/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>Every major film festival is essentially an island \u2013 or at least its own self-enclosed microclimate \u2013 and the fact that the Lido literally is an island can sometimes make the Venice film festival seem entirely cut off from the outside world.</p> <p>This year, however, Venice felt like an integral part of the flow of the bigger universe. One reason was because its opening-night festivities were cancelled in solidarity with those affected by the recent Italian earthquake. Another reason is because you felt that more of its selections were likely to matter to the outside world than in some recent editions.</p> <p>This year, the first few days were ruthlessly front-stacked with big-name films.

Noah Oppenheim\u2019s script presents her story through that time-honoured device of a press interview (Billy Crudup is very good as the journalist), with Jackie talking us through the events in Dallas, her famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUP9gY_5MzI\">1962 TV tour of the White House</a>, and the shock of simultaneously losing a husband and her first lady status. The moment at which Lyndon Johnson is inaugurated, suddenly leaving Jackie an isolated figure on the sidelines, is magnificently poignant. Portman has never quite seemed a heavyweight player before now \u2013 I wasn\u2019t convinced by her in her other Venice feature, eccentric French period piece <em>Planetarium</em> \u2013 but in <em>Jackie</em> she gives an authoritatively nuanced performance. The next awards season seems hers for the asking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f3d3ec824392b059ca5aa89b915b1ffb24b7c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f3d3ec824392b059ca5aa89b915b1ffb24b7c5d/0_224_3937_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jude Law is a \u2018sulphurously charismatic\u2019 pontiff in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s The Young Pope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"604\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jude Law is a \u2018sulphurously charismatic\u2019 pontiff in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s The Young Pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gianni Fiorito/SKY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other auteur names included Paolo Sorrentino, returning to the Roman follies of <em>The Great Beauty</em> with an eccentric peek under the skirts of the Vatican in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ZFdepTu-w\"><em>The Young Pope</em></a>, his TV series for Sky.

This religiose, abstract epic could be described as a prayer in images, and it will bring out the atheist in many a hardened critic. It feels like a bundle of trimmings from his <em>Tree of Life</em> \u2013 a rapturous assemblage of volcanoes, ice floes, creatures of the deep, the odd CGI dinosaur and an extended sequence showing the life of primitive man, like a slightly less hirsute sequel to the opening of Kubrick\u2019s <em>2001</em>. Along the way, Cate Blanchett recites \u2013 nay, intones \u2013 a poetic hymn to a universal \u201cMother\u201d (\u201cOh Life\u2026 Hear my voice\u2026\u201d). There\u2019s barely an image here that isn\u2019t magnificent \u2013 but put them all together and the result is cosmic kitsch.</p> <p>Intergalactic weirdness of a wilder kind came from the Mexican director Amat Escalante, whose name often promises festival controversy (Cannes-goers still speak with shudders of his ultra-violent <em>Heli</em>, known to some as \u201cthe Mexican flaming penis movie\u201d). <a href=\"http://remezcla.com/film/trailer-amat-escalante-the-untamed-clip/\"><em>The Untamed</em></a> is the most unrepentantly outr\u00e9 film here, about a working-class family whose lives are drastically affected by meeting a young woman and her nightmare lover \u2013 a tentacular alien being that embodies the pleasure principle at its intensest. Both distressing and compelling in its mix of HP Lovecraft ickiness and everyday realism, <em>The Untamed</em> got some unlooked-for laughs from a nervous preview audience. But it\u2019s a crazily audacious film \u2013 and no one who\u2019s seen it will touch calamari again in a hurry.</p> <p>While <em>The Untamed</em> is surely destined for cult reputation, a film that probably isn\u2019t \u2013 not least because it insists on practically flashing the words \u201cINSTANT CULT CLASSIC\u201d at you in scarlet neon throughout \u2013 is <em>The Bad Batch</em>. This wearisome piece of post-apocalypse hipsterism is Ana Lily Amirpour\u2019s follow-up to her superb vampire debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/24/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-review-mark-kermode\"><em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em></a> \u2013 but she\u2019s disappointingly turned out a derivative, unpleasantly brutal desert-set fantasy about a young woman (scowlingly blank Suki Waterhouse) getting even after a nasty encounter with some body-building cannibals. Jim Carrey is unrecognisable as a silent, bearded hermit, while connoisseurs of dud Keanu Reeves performances will enjoy him in vintage leaden form as a Hefner-esque tyrant in a Burt Reynolds moustache.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"289badfe107ea8318ed32a5de4af4f6e4a2779eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289badfe107ea8318ed32a5de4af4f6e4a2779eb/0_184_4979_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timothy Spall, who plays a \u2018wheezy, lofty\u2019 Ian Paisley in The Journey, on the red carpet in Venice last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timothy Spall, who plays a \u2018wheezy, lofty\u2019 Ian Paisley in The Journey, on the red carpet in Venice last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer to the mainstream, there was <a href=\"https://teaser-trailer.com/the-journey-movie/\"><em>The Journey</em></a>, Nick Hamm\u2019s imagining of a car trip shared by lifelong opponents Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness before the 2006 Northern Ireland peace talks.

  "<p>As this 172nd Manchester derby began, the chief subplot centred on how Claudio Bravo would fare on his City debut as Joe Hart\u2019s replacement. His \u00a317m acquisition had been Pep Guardiola\u2019s headline summer move as the England man was sent to Torino because his ball skills are not up to the Catalan\u2019s desired standard. Bravo\u2019s first appearance would offer clues about Guardiola\u2019s judgment and the new keeper\u2019s ability.</p> <p>Both City and United entered a seismic occasion propelled by flying starts under their new managers, having won all three league matches. The visitors were without the suspended Sergio Ag\u00fcero and playing away from the Etihad Stadium might further weaken them. The theory was this would further stiffen Bravo\u2019s challenge as the onus was on United to take advantage. But if Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team hoped to expose him from kick-off a trick was missed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City\u2019s derby delight as De Bruyne inspires win over United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead the 33-year-old strolled around his area and watched as his side took the contest to United. What he saw was a lesson in keep\u2011ball, moving the opposition around and penetration at will.</p> <p>Bravo\u2019s first sweeper-keeper action was to collect possession from midway in his half and ping off a pass. When the muted Paul Pogba hit a 25-yard shot he was back in position to watch this sail over.</p> <p>The former Barcelona, Real Sociedad and Colo-Colo goalkeeper\u2019s first full training session with Guardiola\u2019s squad had been only 48 hours beforehand, because of the international break. Yet at this juncture there was no hint of Bravo being anything other than comfortable. There was a neat take, pause, then lay-off to Fernandinho after careful consideration. Later, he was clear in urging John Stones forward when receiving the ball from Aleksandar Kolarov.</p> <p>As half-time neared, City were coasting at 2-0 thanks to a fine Kevin De Bruyne opener and Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s second. Now, though, Bravo\u2019s serene start descended into a horror show. Only two minutes remained before the break when disaster first struck. Over came a high Wayne Rooney free-kick and up went the Chilean for a regulation catch. Instead, Bravo spilled, Zlatan Ibrahimovic pounced and it was 2-1. United were back in a contest City had been coasting through.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-pep-guardiola-reflect-city-win-united-manchester-derby-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52e3e\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2706872\"            data-video-name=\"Mourinho and Guardiola reflect on City's win over United in Manchester derby \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d433fee4b07ac3d446adb9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11872609&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11872609&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11872609&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-pep-guardiola-reflect-city-win-united-manchester-derby-premier-league-video\">Mourinho and Guardiola reflect on City\u2019s win over United in Manchester derby</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Here was Bravo\u2019s first serious test and he failed miserably. Afterwards, Guardiola decided to back his man. \u201cIt is not a mistake because he attacked the ball. I love when goalkeepers take decisions to leave 10, 15 metres in front to attack the ball. It was an outstanding goal from Ibrahimovic that made the difference.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes when that happens maybe the player can think, \u2018It is my fault\u2019. Instead Claudio said: \u2018OK, it\u2019s football. We were unlucky. The situation is unlucky.\u2019 And in that moment in the second half look what he did \u2013 he played again and played again with the ball. Claudio Bravo\u2019s personality showed me a lot today.\u201d</p> <p>Moments later United, in the ascendant owing to the howler, attacked again. When the ball came to Bravo there was a mis-control, then he recovered. The Chilean was rattled, an impression confirmed as the referee, Mark Clattenburg, prepared to blow for the break. Bravo raced out to clear, there was a mix-up with Bacary Sagna and Jesse Lingard could fashion an opening for Ibrahimovic. The latter should have equalised and Bravo should have been staring at a count of two mistakes, two United goals. But the effort was weak.</p> <p>Bravo was now in hoping-not-to-err\u2013again mode. If his handling was shown up, a few minutes into the second half the slick footwork he was purchased for also caused consternation. Stones laid a pass back to him, there was a clumsy drag-back which showed too much ball to Rooney and Bravo was lucky not to concede a penalty when lunging at the forward.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-claudio-bravo-red-rooney-tackle-penalty\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: Claudio Bravo should have seen red for Rooney tackle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another near miss came after the goalkeeper dawdled when looking for an option for a pass near his goalline. This invited Rooney on to him until Bravo finally scrambled away before he was clipped by United\u2019s captain, just as the ball was offloaded. Rooney was booked but for Bravo and his team-mates it was too close a call and the latest incident in what had been transformed from a promising afternoon into a small nightmare.</p> <p>Again, Guardiola backed him. \u201cI know it\u2019s risk,\u201d he said of the desire for his keeper to be the first man in City\u2019s buildup. \u201cIf we lose the ball it is a goal against us but when we win with that, we win many, many, many things.\u201d</p> <p>A precis of Bravo\u2019s day occurred at the death. In came another aerial ball, once more the Chilean could not deal with it and Stones fly-hacked City to safety.</p> <p>Guardiola added: \u201cHe was amazing with his feet, saves, going to attack the ball. I am happy for him. It is not easy the first game after two training sessions coming here and play with that personality.\u201d</p> <p>The hope will be that Bravo\u2019s confidence is not shattered by what happened today. Throughout, the Stretford End dished out pantomime \u201coohs\u201d and \u201caahs\u201d whenever the ball went near him. He should brace himself for more in City\u2019s next few&#xa0;matches.</p>",

This story not only deals with eavesdropping but mass eavesdropping, drones and cyberwarfare. As Snowden said himself the other day, \u2018It\u2019s out of control, the world is out of control.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The film also features a cameo from Snowden himself, who still resides at an undisclosed location in Russia while he searches for asylum elsewhere.

It is the most extensive and invasive surveillance state that has ever existed and he\u2019s built it up.\u201d</p> <p>The film-maker, known for the politically charged dramas Nixon and JFK, finds the current situation, which he likens to a George Orwell novel, to be at odds with the world that he grew up in.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up in a world where I never thought this could happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from 2001 on, it\u2019s very clear that something radical has changed. There\u2019s more to it that meets the eye and whatever they tell you, you\u2019ve got to look beyond.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon-Levitt met with the real Snowden in preparation for the film and believes that it\u2019s his love of America that led him to leak classified information.</p> <p>\u201cI was interested in his patriotism,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was doing what he did out of a sincere love for his country and the principles that the country is founded on. There are two different types of patriotism: there\u2019s the kind when you\u2019re allegiant to your country no matter what and you don\u2019t ask any questions, but there\u2019s another type which I really wanted to show in this character. The privilege of being from a free country like the US is that we are allowed to ask those questions and to hold the government accountable.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about Snowden\u2019s future, Gordon-Levitt said: \u201cI know he would love to come home and I hope for that.\u201d</p> <p>The film has premiered to mixed reviews at the festival, with Variety\u2019s Owen Gleiberman calling it \u201cthe most important and galvanising political drama by an American film-maker in years\u201d yet the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Stephen Farber labelled it \u201ca lackluster opus\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Alan Pardew maintains his two biggest summer-time coups involved acquiring Christian Benteke and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/crystal-palace-reject-tottenham-hotspurs-bid-for-wilfried-zaha\" title=\"\">retaining Wilfried Zaha</a>. That assessment was fully vindicated as the pair not only scored a goal apiece but, at times, thoroughly unnerved and overpowered Middlesbrough. Their impact left Crystal Palace celebrating a first Premier League win of the season and their much-criticised manager breathing a little easier.</p> <p>Not that things were entirely straightforward. \u201cIt was a strange one,\u201d Pardew said. \u201cWe had spells when we were in control, but at the end, we were hanging on against a very competent Boro who showed great maturity and don\u2019t look like a newly-promoted team.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a tough Premier League game and the win was very important for us. In this division, the spotlight comes on you quickly and if you don\u2019t start winning it can affect your confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, Pardew had been sufficiently relaxed to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-claudio-bravo-red-rooney-tackle-penalty\" title=\"\">the lunchtime Manchester derby</a> in the Riverside\u2019s press room. Having relocated to the technical area, he remained similarly unruffled as Benteke headed Palace in front following Zaha\u2019s angled cross.</p> <p>The \u00a327m forward, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/crystal-palace-sign-christian-benteke-liverpool\" title=\"\">recently arrived from Liverpool</a>, easily outjumped the normally dominant Dani Ayala to direct a wonderful looping effort beyond V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s\u2019s reach. While Pardew restricted his celebrations to jotting some notes on a pad, a young visiting substitute seated behind him offered a study in unrestrained delight.</p> <p>Grinning from ear to ear, Jonathan Benteke, Christian\u2019s younger brother, and fellow striker, applauded enthusiastically as his sibling not only scored a first goal for the club, but justified Palace\u2019s strategy of playing to their lone forward\u2019s strengths.</p> <p>Zaha\u2019s crossing proved key to this gameplan and when the winger\u2019s pace swept him beyond George Friend another fine centre resulted in Benteke cueing Andros Townsend up for a very presentable shooting chance. This time, though, Vald\u00e9s was equal to the challenge and saved smartly.</p> <p>Bar an early \u00c1lvaro Negredo volley, directed off target following decent work from Stewart Downing and Adam Forshaw \u2013 impressing in central midfield after keeping Marten de Roon on the bench \u2013 Boro were initially on the back foot. Then, with half-time approaching, they finally rediscovered a measure of the ruthless efficiency that underpinned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/aitor-karanka-thankful-middlesbrough-promotion-premier-league-brighton\" title=\"\">last season\u2019s promotion campaign</a>. Ayala dodged Damien Delaney before connecting with Downing\u2019s corner and powering a header towards the top corner. Possibly slightly slow to react, Steve Mandanda could only help the ball on its journey.</p> <p>Relief flooded the Riverside, but it swiftly became qualified as Boro spurned an unexpected second chance.

  "<p>Mark Hughes told Tottenham Hotspur fans to shut up, but his team could not silence the visiting forwards. Son Heung-min scored twice before Dele Alli and Harry Kane struck their first goals of the campaign and, in doing so, confirmed that Tottenham are up and running for the new season after playing fitfully in their first three matches.</p> <p>Hughes, meanwhile, may have disciplinary matters to fret about in addition to his team\u2019s botched start to the season after being sent to the stands in the first half. Stoke are bottom of the league with one point from four matches.</p> <p>Tottenham took the lead thanks to their ability to keep calm in the storm caused in part by Stoke\u2019s fury with the referee, Anthony Taylor, and the fourth official, Jon Moss. Taylor, acting on advice from Moss, ordered Hughes to vacate the sideline in the 34th minute after the manager stomped out of his technical area to vent his anger at the booking of Marko Arnautovic for simulation.</p> <p>Hughes felt that Stoke should have been given a free-kick before that for a foul on Jonathan Walters and was doubly aggrieved when Taylor judged Arnautovic\u2019s \u201cevasive action\u201d to be a dive.</p> <p>\u201cThose were two decisions I felt should have gone our way so I reacted in a forceful manner,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSometimes you forget that this year you\u2019re not allowed to come out of your technical area. Mr Moss, bless him, felt that warranted a sending off, which, by the letter of the law, it did, so I have to hold my hands up. But I saw Sky say that maybe I swore, which I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>As he left the pitch Hughes made gestures to rev up the home crowd. Then he tried to send a different message to away supporters. \u201cI was telling them to shut up,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry if I did that.\u201d</p> <p>That hoopla created a sizzling atmosphere in which players needed to stay cool. Spurs did so better and were rewarded by Son\u2019s goal in the 41st minute.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/west-ham-united-watford-premier-league-match-report\">Watford in stunning comeback as they hit four to shock West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joe Allen might have thwarted it if he had not overcommitted when trying to dispossess Christian Eriksen, allowing the Dane to sidestep him before pulling the ball back from the sideline to Son, who was unmarked 12 yards from goal. The South Korean guided it first time into the net with his left foot. Such composure in the bedlam can only have encouraged Mauricio Pochettino, bearing in mind how his team lost their heads and the league title at Stamford Bridge last season.</p> <p>Earlier, Spurs had to show resilience to weather a storm of another kind, as Stoke started strongly. Wilfried Bony, making his debut for the hosts after joining on loan from Manchester City, gave the team a much-needed fulcrum up front. The Ivorian threatened as early as the second minute when he exchanged passes with Walters before unleashing a 16-yard shot that was blocked by Jan Vertonghen.</p> <p>Glenn Whelan and Ryan Shawcross also had efforts foiled by defenders. Tottenham gradually took the upperhand, however, thanks to the crispness and swiftness of their passing. Son served notice of his menace by collecting a crossfield pass from Toby Alderweireld on the half-hour and dashing towards the Stoke area. Arnautovic chased back to disrupt his progress but inadvertently played the ball into the path of Alli. He dragged a shot past the advancing Shay Given but wide of the post. Then, following Hughes\u2019s expulsion, Son shot Spurs in front.</p> <p>Half-time brought a chance to regroup and Stoke did hint at a comeback early in the second half. But Son quashed it with a superb strike on the counterattack, collecting another pass from Eriksen at the corner of the area and sweeping a first-time shot in at the far post. Stoke began to unravel. \u201cThe second goal deflated us more markedly than it should have,\u201d Hughes said.</p> <p>Spurs were not minded to show mercy. The visitors inflicted further damage through another rapid counterattack on the hour. Kyle Walker hurtled down the right and picked out Alli, who, like Son for the first goal, had found space in the middle of the area and took full advantage.</p> <p>With Victor Wanyama on a yellow card and guilty of a couple of tackles that the home crowd believed should have resulted in a red, Pochettino made a substitution to ensure Tottenham kept 11 players on the pitch, replacing Wanyama with \u00c9rik Lamela. \u201cIt was better to take the pressure off the referee and Victor,\u201d said Pochettino.</p> <p>All that was missing from Spurs\u2019 point of view was a goal for Harry Kane. So Son helped deliver one. He tricked his way down the left before providing a pass that enabled Kane to end the wait for his first goal of the campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f462aaf5a4b98c2e31f694fc7a61771800384f46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f462aaf5a4b98c2e31f694fc7a61771800384f46/32_0_5500_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Hughes reacts angrily after being sent to the stands by Anthony Taylor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Hughes reacts angrily after being sent to the stands by Anthony Taylor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/middlesbrough-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace and Wilfried Zaha sink Middlesbrough to lift Alan Pardew</a> </p> </aside>",

The placement led the researchers to speculate that the children had been sacrificed as ceremonial \u201cguardians\u201d of tombs. The other graves contained men and women buried supine, and some of the bones showed damage like that of other sacrifice victims from the era.</p> <p>At the center of the tombs, the archaeologists found a grave with various offerings, including two clay pots, a sculpture of a smiling man and a vessel carved into the shape of a <em>coquero</em> \u2013 a person chewing coca leaves. Some of the offerings resembled objects in a large, colorful temple mural, perhaps 700 years old, where anthropomorphized bird warriors march with \u201cwhat look like severed human heads and vegetable bundles\u201d, Klaus said.</p> <p>\u201cWe study sacrifice not for the gruesome details but because rituals like this tend to be reflections of culture, history, society,\u201d he said. \u201cThey provide living windows into rituals that were entwined with economics and politics.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c4847efe0d4685fded89b87e83cf51a5c78fc860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4847efe0d4685fded89b87e83cf51a5c78fc860/0_0_2678_3344/801.jpg\" alt=\"A gold vase decorated with the figure of Naymlap, first king of Lambayeque.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A gold vase decorated with the figure of Naymlap, first king of Lambayeque.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G.

The Sic\u00e1n, who developed Chotuna-Chornancap around then, shared some of those practices. </p> <p>When the Chim\u00fa conquered the area in 1375AD, they let the rituals continue, and the Inca, who wrested control about a century later, merely adjusted to their preferred victims and methods. At one site in the temple complex, the ancient people seem to have broken rib cages to reach victims\u2019 hearts, Klaus said.</p> <p>\u201cKillings could be aimed to destroy the soul of your enemy or desecrate them in death,\u201d Klaus said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s ritualized killing that\u2019s more about creating life in death, surrounded with metaphors of water and fertility and growth.\u201d</p> <p>The Chim\u00fa and Inca also had practical concerns. Klaus said they probably used religious customs to keep the workforce happy \u2013 and to keep the breadbasket region producing as \u201ca boon to the treasuries\u201d. </p> <p>The site may have been legendary in its own day, as well, and some archaeologists have found hints that a centuries-old legend was centered there.</p> <p>According to an oral tradition recorded by two colonial-era Spaniards, a king named Naymlap arrived somewhere on the coast, around 650AD, with a fleet of balsa rafts and nearly all his people. He built palaces and temples and reigned happily until his death, when his servants entombed him in secret to ensure his legend.</p> <p>Naymlap\u2019s successors didn\u2019t fare so well. According to the tale, the last provoked a disastrous flood by giving in to temptation by the devil, ending the dynasty. Signs of a major flood were uncovered in the 1980s by archaeologist Christopher Donnan, who also dated Chotuna-Chornancap\u2019s first buildings to about 650AD \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/archaeologist-sets-out-to-validate-230460\">an uncanny correlation</a>\u201d, as he called it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c8697a735a7532efe8ca02adf5dcd7e163f72a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c8697a735a7532efe8ca02adf5dcd7e163f72a7/0_39_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archaeologists work at Chotuna-Chornancap site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archaeologists work at Chotuna-Chornancap site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR New / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNothing was found that indicated the legend doesn\u2019t apply to Chotuna or Chornancap,\u201d he said in 2012. \u201cOf course, that doesn\u2019t prove that the legend was real.\u201d</p> <p>Researchers continue to test the oral tradition, Klaus said, for more \u201ctantalizing clues that could indicate this is the place of Naymlap, this semi-mythical, cultural hero\u201d.</p> <p>The site has at least kept surprising scientists in the decades since Dannon\u2019s work.

The image, which spread across the internet, elicited quick criticism from addiction advocates and community members who questioned the value of violating the individuals\u2019 privacy. </p> <p>The photos show two adults slumped over with their mouths wide open in the front seats of a car with a four-year-old child in a dinosaur-print shirt staring at the camera lens. It was taken after they nearly hit a stopped school bus while driving on Wednesday afternoon. </p> <p>Both adults were revived with the overdose reversal drug Narcan and have been charged. The image, meanwhile, was shared across the internet and received more than 1,000 comments since it was posted on Thursday. </p> <p>\u201cThis is reality,\u201d John Lane, the East Liverpool police chief, told the Guardian. \u201cEvery day we\u2019re dealing with this.

They also posted the police affidavit, with the names of the adults and a description of the incident. \u201cWe are well aware that some may be offended by these images and for that we are truly sorry, but it is time that the non-drug-using public sees what we are now dealing with on a daily basis,\u201d the post said.<br></p> <p>The 11,000-person city is near Ohio\u2019s border with Pennsylvania and West Virginia, a region hard hit by the latest wash of opioid addiction, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/12/beattyville-kentucky-and-americas-poorest-towns\">affecting the white population at a skyrocketing rate</a>. </p> <p>Lane said the city posted the photo to show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/20/chicago-street-drugs-garfield-park\">the effects of heroin addiction</a> and show how the city does not have enough officers or treatment centers to fight the problem. \u201cWe\u2019re drowning down here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need help here completely and totally.\u201d</p> <p>But addiction experts said shaming two people with a mental illness can inhibit recovery. </p> <p>Dr Marvin Seppala, the chief medical officer at Hazelden Betty Ford, a not-for-profit addiction treatment center, said images like this could be helpful if brought to an individual on a personal level, such as a family member trying to reach a loved one facing addiction, but this type of shaming in a public setting would not be beneficial. </p> <p>Seppala said it could even be detrimental because most addicts do not use drugs to feel good, but because they feel bad. \u201cWe are just adding to the feeling bad, so continued use is the most likely response to shaming,\u201d he said. </p> <p>When it comes to how this affects the public\u2019s understanding of the breadth of the opioid epidemic, however, Seppala softened his stance. \u201cIn some respects, it brings attention to it that it wouldn\u2019t otherwise get, so it\u2019s a little hard for me to argue against this photo the more I talk about it,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He noted that Congress had passed a bill to fight the crisis, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/congress-passes-opioids-bill-anti-addiction-legislation\">the Comprehensive Addiction &amp; Recovery Act</a>, but without funding. </p> <p>\u201cWe need that attention \u2013 we need to get people\u2019s attention to address this and call their Congress folks and tell them pass this, pass the funding for this,\u201d Seppala said. \u201cWe need the money.\u201d</p> <p>But Dr Marc Romano, assistant medical director at Ocean Breeze Recovery, was concerned the photo would contribute to stigma surrounding mental illness. </p> <p>\u201cShaming them is not the answer,\u201d said Romano. \u201cBut yes, talk about how this addiction is so powerful they will even risk the lives of children to use this drug \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p> <p>The controversial photo also appeared just as a row erupted over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-deletes-norway-pms-post-napalm-girl-post-row\">Facebook\u2019s decision to censor the famous image of \u201cnapalm girl\u201d during the Vietnam War.</a> </p> <p>Though the overdose photo could be seen as violating its guidelines prohibiting photos that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\">shame</a>\u201d private individuals, a Facebook spokesperson said the photos did not violate the company\u2019s community standards. </p> <p>Commenters online also raised questions about the decision to post a photo of the child, who was placed in protective services. But Lane said the child\u2019s image was essential to get a reaction from people. \u201cThat\u2019s where the problems at \u2013 [he\u2019s] helpless,\u201d Lane said. </p> <p>He said this was what needed to be done to show how the problem is affecting the country and how badly cities need law enforcement and treatment resources to combat addiction. </p> <p>\u201cIt never ends; it\u2019s the same thing,\u201d Lane said. \u201cYou get frustrated when you\u2019re dealing with the same people, the same issues \u2013 they all have kids and they\u2019re not worried about their kids.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/10/syria-ceasefire-deal-tentative-negotiate-kerry-lavrov-us-russia\">Syrian counter-terror agreement</a> is ambitious, full of pitfalls and the best hope for a resumption of the ceasefire and peace talks in Syria.</p> <p>The kernel of the agreement, reached after 13 hours of talks in Geneva on Friday, is a staged ceasefire, a reopening of humanitarian aid, followed by a grounding of the Syrian air force in those areas dominated by opposition fighters recognised by the west. A specific plan has been set out on how to deliver aid to the 250,000 citizens of Aleppo who are running out of water and fuel.</p> <p>In return the west will coordinate with Russia not just attacks on the forces of Islamic State in north-west Syria, but also the al-Qaida-linked and recently rebranded <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">Jabhat al-Nusra</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/10/syria-ceasefire-deal-tentative-negotiate-kerry-lavrov-us-russia\">US and Russia reach tentative agreement for Syria ceasefire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, the responsibility in the agreement lies in requiring the Syrian air force to ground itself over its sovereign territory, and in ensuring humanitarian aid \u2013 too often callously blocked by the Syrian army checkpoints \u2013 is allowed to flow again. </p> <p>President Bashar al-Assad sees no distinction between the opposition forces, regarding them all as terrorists opposed to his regime. This agreement requires him to change that mindset.</p> <p>For the United States, there is a responsibility to require the Washington-backed Syrian opposition to disentangle themselves militarily, politically and even physically from Jabhat al-Nusra.</p> <p>In practice, there has been a marbling between al-Nusra and Washington-backed fighting forces as they unite against the military advance of Assad.</p> <p>The Pentagon, and some in the state department, are doubtful that Russia has the means or the determination to control the Syrian air force. The new ceasefire is due to start 12 September, and they fear the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has miscalculated. </p> <p>The Washington-based Syria Institute said: \u201cWhile Lavrov mentioned that they agreed on procedures on responding to any breaches or violations of the cessation of hostilities, no details were given. The lack of enforcement or compliance measures in previous agreements has been a key contributor to their failure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlans do not implement themselves,\u201d Kerry pointed out. Details of how the agreement will be enforced, currently being kept private in five separate chapters, include the exchanges of intelligence, the maps delineating the precise distribution of opposition forces, and the sanctions for ceasefire breaches.</p> <p>Lavrov insists he won the agreement of Assad in what they will see as the first east-west agreement to defeat not just Isis in Syria, but other jihadi groups. Russia has long sought US cooperation in this anti-terror battle.</p> <p>Apart from the sincerity of Syrian cooperation, the second biggest question is whether western-backed Syrian fighters will disassociate themselves from al-Nusra.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">Al-Nusra Front cuts ties with al-Qaida and renames itself</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kerry was unambiguous. \u201cGoing on al-Nusra is not a concession to anybody\u201d but \u201cis profoundly in the interests of the US,\u201d he said</p> <p>Bassma Kodmani, a senior figure in the main opposition body the High Negotiation Committee (HNC), insisted the marbling will end, and the cessation of hostilities will allow for the extremists\u2019 influence to be marginalised. She said: \u201cWhen the cessation of hostilities was installed in February, the opposition \u2013 100 groups \u2013 respected it. It was violated by the regime. So a return to a cessation of hostilities has been our demand. We are absolutely in favour of it.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if opposition fighters will separate themselves from extremists, Kodmani said: \u201cIn the cessation in February, when our groups committed to it, the extremists were marginalised. They did not dare to challenge it. Since then opposition forces and extremists have been forced together under siege. </p> <p>\u201cSo the key is ending Assad\u2019s strategy of surrounding whole areas and besieging them. The moderate groups will reorganise and distance themselves from the radical groups. We will do our part.\u201d</p> <p>But Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and expert on the Syrian jihadis, was more dubious. He wrote: \u201cHaving spoken with leadership figures from several dozen armed factions in recent weeks, I can say that not a single one has suggested any willingness to withdraw from frontlines on which JFS is present. To them, doing so means effectively ceding territory to the regime, as they have little faith in a long-term cessation of hostilities holding.\u201d</p> <p>But he added: \u201cThe armed opposition in Syria now faces what is perhaps its biggest and most momentous decision since they chose to take up arms against the Assad regime in 2011. There is no hiding the fact that mainstream opposition forces are extensively \u201cmarbled\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d with JFS forces on frontlines from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/deraa\">Deraa</a> in the south, to Damascus and throughout the north-west of the country.\u201d</p> <p>One best option is that al-Nusra forces will withdraw knowing that to do otherwise would hinder the peace process, and lose fragile popular support. But the next few days will be a big test of the HNC influence on the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/staffan-de-mistura-man-with-toughest-job-in-world-syria\">The man with the toughest job in the world | Janine di Giovanni</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is much that is absent from the agreement, including any commitments on the release of political detainees or any promise by either side to change their stance on the legitimate place for Assad in a future Syria. The previous peace talks designed to map out a transition to a new government did not really travel much past first base, mainly due to the Syrian opposition demand that Assad leave within six months.</p> <p>The two sides did not even meet face to face, preferring to trade insults at sporadic press conferences, as the genteel UN special envoy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/staffan-de-mistura-man-with-toughest-job-in-world-syria\">Staffan de Mistura</a> manfully looked for chinks of light amid the uniform darkness.</p> <p>Since then, and only this week, the HNC set out a coherent road map to a new Syria that is recognisably democratic and does not assume anyone connected with the Assad regime will have to stand aside. It is a plausible alternative for the future of Syria, and one in which Russian influence is not eradicated.</p> <p>But in the entrails of the Kerry Lavrov press conference, Lavrov highlighted the problems ahead in the peace talks, pointing out that the HNC cannot be seen as the sole negotiating body. He pointed to other groups \u2013 the Moscow and Cairo group \u2013 as requiring equal status in any peace talks. The HNC is seen as a creature of Saudi Arabia by the Russians, and representative mainly of Riyadh. So if talks do resume, the basics of the attendees may have to be revisited.</p> <p>There are at least two further difficulties. The Kurds have a nominal role in the HNC, but its chief representatives are excluded. There was also no sign of Iran in these peace talks, yet they have militia fighting on the ground in Aleppo and elsewhere. Iran and Moscow interests do not fully elide in Syria.</p> <p>So no one is pretending after so many setbacks that a corner has been turned, but at least it is possible to see if it can be reached.</p>",

We\u2019ve only had two rounds this year but if this was the 100m Olympic final, Steve Hansen would already be looking to his left and doing a big cheesy grin for the cameras, such is the gulf between his side and their rivals.</p> <p>But while the All Blacks have flown out of the blocks Usain Bolt-style, someone seems to have tied both the Wallabies\u2019 and the Springboks\u2019 shoelaces together Wacky Races-style, such has been their stumbling start to the campaign. And with Argentina improving every year, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who\u2019ll end up with the silver medal this year.</p> <p>But slightly dated Olympics metaphors aside, tonight\u2019s game is crucial for all sorts of other reasons \u2013 mainly revolving around the pressure mounting on Michael Cheika. A win tonight and the previous run of losses will seem a tiny bit more palatable \u2013 the result of playing against the All Blacks and one of the strongest England teams in years. A loss at a home to a Springboks team in transition, however, and more serious questions will be raised.</p> <p>There\u2019s not quite the same amount of pressure on Allister Coetzee\u2019s visitors, although a narrow defeat to Argentina in their previous clash will still hurt and they will be desperate to avoid the wooden spoon again. As we hit the halfway stage, this match should go a big way to answering some of the questions hovering over both sides.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-10T12:50:25.630Z\">at 1.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d37c32e4b08465d44ff273\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-10T03:22:22.697Z\">4.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Richard will be here shortly.

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>During the winter of early 2014 Jones\u2019s only chance for serenity was these late hours. The CIA was demanding his boss, Senate intelligence committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, fire him. Feinstein\u2019s Republican colleagues, once supportive of Jones, were demanding he testify.</p> <p>Testimony was treacherous. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island senator and former federal prosecutor, warned Jones that asserting his rights against self-incrimination or seeking a lawyer\u2019s counsel could give committee Republicans a political lever against his highly controversial work. The CIA would soon formally insist that the US justice department actually prosecute Jones, the Senate staffer who had devoted over six years of his life to investigating the CIA\u2019s infamous post-9/11 torture program.<br></p> <p>Jones, a former FBI counter-terrorism analyst, wanted to testify. The CIA had pushed him past the point where he could back down. Its lies, documented in a 6,700-page secret report which Jones was constantly rewriting that winter, were compounding: to Congress, to Barack Obama, to George W Bush, to the press, to the public. The lies were not random misstatements. They were directional, in the service of covering up the brutality of what it did to at least 119 terrorist suspects \u2013 some clearly innocent \u2013 it held in a global network of secret prisons. Jones was on the verge of exposing the coverup. As he saw it, the personalized intensity of the CIA\u2019s attacks on him, and the unprecedented steps they were taking, validated the account he had compiled after combing through over 6m classified CIA documents. </p> <p>Jones put his Bose earbuds in, cued up a Tragically Hip record, and ran. </p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be that long of a lap, just enough to clear his head and work the frustrations out. Jones would need to be back in the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s secured, classified offices very soon. Each day brought a new calculation: it might be the last that the committee had access to its own classified report. The CIA had gone \u201cinto war mode\u201d with its congressional overseers, Jones told the Guardian. There was no choice but to work deeply into the night, leaving Capitol Hill at 3 or 4 in the morning, with breaks only for a run, and then back to work by 8 or 9 to repeat the cycle.</p> <p>Less than a year had passed since the CIA had communicated to the Senate that its exhaustive torture report, drawn from millions of the agency\u2019s own documents, was significantly incorrect. Less than a year had passed since Jones, unbeknownst to the CIA, had locked in a committee safe crucial portions of one such record, called the Panetta Review, in which the CIA had come to the same conclusions about torture as Jones had. But now the agency was letting the committee know it was not playing around \u2013 and that it was coming for Jones himself. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>From August to September 2013 Jones had more than a dozen meetings with agency officials lasting 60 hours to attempt to reconcile their objections with findings in his 6,700-page classified report. It got to the point where Jones would take a whiteboard with him. That way, he could sketch out the timelines he found in CIA cables for when the agency learned specific aspects of its terrorism intelligence. He attempted to demonstrate contradictions from what the CIA said publicly \u2013 and how the claimed basis for those CIA statements occurred before this-or-that torture session the agency said was the genesis of the information. </p> <p>\u201cIt should be noted that at no point in those discussions did [Senate] staff ask CIA to reconcile the CIA June 2013 response to the Panetta Review,\u201d said CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani. \u201cIn fact, at no time in those discussions did [committee] staff indicate that they had a copy of the Panetta Review.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Support the Guardian\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;

Feinstein was concerned Jones was too close to the report to be objective, but she backed his decision. With the report stuck in limbo, she gave him a new challenge: redo the report, incorporating aspects of the CIA\u2019s response, and putting what they found to be wrong about that response in the footnotes.<br></p> <p>\u201cBasically, her thing was: make them own their response,\u201d Jones said. The effect was to expand a 250-page executive summary to over 500 pages, \u201cdoubling the amount of information\u201d, all as the CIA continued to object. The agency and the committee were arraying for battle.</p> <p>Just before Thanksgiving, Feinstein formally wrote to CIA director John Brennan requesting the entire 1,000-plus page Panetta Review. Jones had not taken the full document back from the satellite location, only the sections necessary to show busy senators that the agency concluded it had misled its political masters about the futility of its torture. The CIA said it would not provide it. This time, it would be Feinstein\u2019s allies on the committee who escalated.</p> <p>On 17 December, the CIA sent its choice for its next top attorney, Caroline Krass, to the committee for a nomination hearing. Shortly before the hearing, a CIA attorney, Darrin Hostetler, met with Jones in private, once again sparring over the agency\u2019s response. Once again, Jones reminded Hostetler that the Panetta Review supported his conclusions. \u201cI\u2019m done talking to you, Dan,\u201d Hostetler said, ending the meeting. An agency official who worked with Jones at the satellite location apologized to Jones for Hostetler\u2019s behavior.<br></p> <p>During the hearing, Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, lit into Krass. Unexpectedly, Udall mentioned the existence of the Panetta Review in public for the first time, demanding the disclosure of the document. Among the reasons for Udall\u2019s fervor: in August 2013, after the CIA had condemned the committee report in contradiction of the Panetta Review, its former chief lawyer Stephen Preston told Udall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/799469-qfr-udall-preston-8-09-13-responses.html\">in writing</a> that the agency provided the committee with \u201cinaccurate information related to aspects of the [torture] program\u201d \u2013 a major point the CIA was now disputing.<br> </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk3ut21ksJ0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qk3ut21ksJ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Jones was <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?316835-1/senate-intelligence-cmte-considers-cia-state-nominees\">visible on the staff dias behind Udall</a>. Hostetler walked out of the hearing. </p> <p>\u201cThen things totally went to hell,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>Unbeknownst to Jones, Udall or Feinstein, the public reference to the Panetta Review so alarmed the CIA as to prompt a milestone event in its history. Since 2009, the CIA had maintained a firewalled network on which the Senate could view internal documents relevant to its torture inquiry. It was known as RDINet, for \u201crendition, detention and interrogation.\u201d By mutual agreement, the CIA was not supposed to access the Senate\u2019s side of the network for any reason aside from picayune IT help. But at least five agency officials would surreptitiously transgress the network firewalls, view the Senate investigators\u2019 work, and reconstruct Jones\u2019s emails. Their rationale, established in a subsequent internal investigation, was to determine if the Senate deliberately exploited an evident flaw in the architecture of the network to digitally acquire the Panetta Review \u2013 which they did not want the Senate to have.</p> <p>It was an extreme step. After Congress overhauled the CIA in the 1970s, the agency was not supposed to spy on Americans domestically except in extremely circumscribed circumstances. Now it was turning its spywork onto the elected officials tasked with overseeing it.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The CIA had gone into war mode</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEvery officer is clearly, I would say rigorously, trained that CIA is a foreign intelligence service. We have a legal mandate to conduct intelligence operations on non-American entities ... It\u2019s very clear, the distinction, and then elaborate, the working out of what may and may not be done,\u201d said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer.</p> <p>Carle continued: \u201cFor the agency to<strong> </strong>penetrate a firewalled network used by the United States Senate is flat criminal activity. There\u2019s no discussion about it. I\u2019m literally laughing. You can\u2019t rationalize that.\u201d</p> <p>Oregon Democratic senator Ron Wyden flatly called it \u201cspying on our staff\u201d. The CIA vigorously disputes that characterization. CIA director Brennan, whom Carle praises as an \u201chonorable guy\u201d, was informed about the firewall breach almost as soon as the agency began its fateful operations. </p> <p>Beginning on 9 January 2014, agency officials created a \u201cdummy account\u201d that looked to the network like it came from Jones\u2019s team, something beyond the limits of the 2009 agreements between the committee and the CIA about network access. They logged in, searched for the Panetta Review on the Senate side of the network and found it. The next day, they searched their own side to determine if they had the Panetta Review. They didn\u2019t find it, presumed they might have been hacked, and set to find out what happened. They took screenshots of what they found. Yet never once did they discuss their findings with Jones, whose technical ineptitude might have disabused them of the theory that he had either deliberately hacked a classified network or been savvy enough to exploit a vulnerability.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1b0b329a698f3da2a602d8fca479d11c5bc219d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b0b329a698f3da2a602d8fca479d11c5bc219d5/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>CIA headquarters at Langley. 9 January 2014</h2> <p>According to a subsequent inspector-general report, an unnamed CIA official \u2013 whom <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-google-search-that-made-the-cia-spy-on-the-us-senate\">Vice News\u2019s Jason Leopold has reported is Hostetler</a> \u2013 got the agency\u2019s Counterintelligence Center involved on 9 January by saying there was a \u201cforthcoming D/CIA tasking\u201d, a reference to Brennan. The unnamed official said Brennan wanted a report by \u201cthat afternoon\u201d into Senate use of the network, stretching from 1 March 2009 to 31 December 2013. The CIA inspector general, David Buckley, would later find that \u201cconflicting information\u201d prevented him from determining \u201cwhether any of D/CIA Brennan\u2019s senior staff, much less the DCI himself, approved any of the taskings.\u201d But an agency attorney, unusually, gave an operational order. </p> <p>Brennan learned at least the outline of what would become the breach on 9 January, the very first day it was conceived. The director would later say he knew then of some review, but did not specifically recall if anyone briefing him explained how they knew the location of, among other documents, the Panetta Review. Brennan discussed the issue with CIA personnel over the next two days, and tasked them to \u201cuse whatever means necessary\u201d to find out how it was that the documents appeared on the Senate side of the firewall. Brennan said he only asked \u201care we sure\u201d the documents were genuine CIA material and that he desired a better understanding of how RDINet worked. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[The CIA] was turning its spywork onto the elected officials tasked with overseeing it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Brennan would later say he denied directing anyone at the CIA to examine the Senate\u2019s use of the system, the technical staff, examined and passed around screenshots of what was on the Senate network drives. By 11 January \u2013 a Saturday \u2013 the CIA official Vice identified as Hostetler spoke with Brennan and learned Brennan had discussed the issue with Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff and a powerful ally. The official would later say he believed himself authorized by Brennan \u201cto gather the necessary agency personnel and components who would normally be involved in such an effort\u201d.</p> <p>Hostetler, through a representative, declined to speak with the Guardian. Nor did the White House make McDonough available for an interview. But an official said: \u201cNeither Denis McDonough nor anyone else at the White House was notified of the searches before they began. As such, and to be sure, the White House did not authorize them.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, 13 January, a meeting gathered, chaired by the third-highest ranking official at CIA, Meroe Park, and attended by Counterintelligence Center personnel. Their concern was determining if there was an \u201cinnocent\u201d or nefarious explanation for the Senate\u2019s acquisition of the Panetta Review, something Brennan would need to know. The meeting heard how it would be possible to perform an operation to find out, one that would involve intrusive digital forensics on their Senate overseers. An attendee would later say no one in attendance objected. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0d2bcfd91db88d7924a1900732a9144bea6d3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0d2bcfd91db88d7924a1900732a9144bea6d3c/231_750_848_453/500.jpg\" alt=\"From a report released by the CIA inspector general in July 2014\" width=\"500\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br></p> <p>Brennan learned of this discussion the next day, 14 January. Multiple official accounts have Brennan essentially alarmed to hear that senior counterintelligence officials were involved in what could easily be understood as spying on the Senate. Brennan indicated a concern that the optics of the situation were perilous for the CIA. He ordered the work stopped \u2013 what he would tell the inspector general was a \u201cstand down\u201d order. The official Vice reported is Hostetler characterized it merely as a \u201cpause\u201d.<br></p> <p>On 15 January 2014, Brennan called an emergency discussion with Feinstein and top committee Republican Saxby Chambliss. They met in a secured room on the Hill. Brennan had brought the acting top CIA lawyer, Robert Eatinger, whom Jones had discovered had provided legal advice to the agency\u2019s Counterterrorist Center, which was deeply involved in the torture. If Brennan was worried, he did not convey that to the senators. </p> <p>Brennan read a statement. He revealed that the agency had conducted a \u201csearch\u201d of the computer network it had set up for the Senate \u2013 unlike every previous investigation at the agency, the CIA had demanded it only produce documentation on torture at a facility it controlled \u2013 and discovered that the Senate investigators had inappropriate access to the Panetta Review. The staffers, he said, had to be \u201cdisciplined\u201d. A CIA network, Brennan was implying, had been compromised. (The CIA would not comment on this meeting, but pointed to <a href=\"http://images.politico.com/global/2014/03/11/brennanltrrereview.pdf\">a 27 January letter from Brennan to Feinstein</a> to characterize it.)</p> <p>Jones understood Brennan\u2019s statement to be a demand for the senators to fire him. Brennan didn\u2019t use his name, but Jones was the chief investigator, the one constantly and most consistently working at the CIA facility. On multiple levels, Jones was shocked. Not only was the director of the CIA telling his legislative overseers that their choice to conduct oversight was unacceptable, he was revealing that the network operated in a manner that the Senate thought \u201cwas impossible\u201d, with the CIA able to access the Senate\u2019s investigative work. </p> <p>Even more startling: although someone at the CIA in 2010 had placed the Panetta Review on the Senate side of the network, Brennan was suggesting that Jones was a master hacker, able to force his way into the CIA\u2019s classified files. In truth, Jones was barely tech-literate: \u201cI am really good at Microsoft Word. That\u2019s it.\u201d </p> <p>But Brennan wasn\u2019t describing the basis for believing his claims. Instead, he told Chambliss and Feinstein the search would not be the CIA\u2019s last. To protect the security of an agency network, Brennan said, the agency would need to conduct more searches, ostensibly to find whatever vulnerability he implied Jones had exploited, and proposed a joint search with Senate assistance. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d31105e43837eec3c79dff16b0a4cf33a65a841e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31105e43837eec3c79dff16b0a4cf33a65a841e/0_107_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CIA director John Brennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Feinstein, in a letter sent two days later, refused. She requested that Brennan not conduct the searches, offering to suspend staff access to the network, and reminded him of the \u201cseparation of powers issues\u201d at stake in the CIA taking such an aggressive step against the Senate. </p> <p>But despite both Feinstein\u2019s refusal and Brennan\u2019s \u201cstand down\u201d order, the CIA continued looking deeper into the Senate\u2019s use of the network. </p> <p>On 16 January, according to CIA documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/274285608/Senate-Docs-Syp-Wm#from_embed\">by Vice News\u2019s Leopold</a>, the agency called upon a digital unit called the Cyber Blue Team, which hunts for vulnerabilities in agency networks. The next day \u2013 the day Feinstein put her refusal to join an inquiry into her staff in writing to Brennan \u2013 Cyber Blue Team reviewed \u201cforensically reconstructed emails\u201d between Senate staffers only accessible on their side of RDINet. The team prepared a report that same day assessing the Senate use of the network, delivering it to \u201csenior agency leadership\u201d on 21 January. </p> <p>Jones had been able to convince Senate Republicans naturally inclined to believe the CIA that his meager tech skills undermined Brennan\u2019s accusation. But that could hardly win them over in what they were seeing as a battle between the CIA and Senate Democrats. Combative, Jones was prepared to testify about the episode. But while he had no family and little to lose, several of his colleagues on the investigative staff had spouses, children and career ambitions. They would be the casualties of escalation. He opted against testimony. The option would ultimately be overtaken by events. </p> <p>The CIA\u2019s move against the Senate committee quickly showed signs of backfiring. In late January, Buckley, the CIA\u2019s inspector general, confronted Brennan about the on-network searches of the Senate investigators. He told Brennan that he needed to open an investigation \u2013 and Brennan responded by ordering Buckley to investigate. But Buckley went further than Brennan apparently calculated, and referred the matter to the US justice department. Suddenly, the CIA was back in a position its leaders thought it had escaped \u2013 in the crosshairs of potential prosecution.</p> <p>Buckley \u2013 who declined comment to the Guardian \u2013 told the committee of his referral on 4 February, only a week after he started examine the breach. It <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/us/new-inquiry-into-cia-employees-amid-clashes-over-interrogation-program.html\">leaked to the New York Times</a> on 4 March.</p> <p>Agency attorney Eatinger launched what the CIA considered a response necessitated by a theft concern and the committee considered a counter-gambit. On 7 February, the senior lawyer made his own criminal referral to the justice department: this one on Jones, ostensibly for improper network access. Eatinger had a conflict: Jones\u2019s narrative referred to his role in the torture program 1,600 times. It took mere weeks for an account of Senate staff taking the Panetta Review from the CIA offsite location to <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article24764827.html\">leak to reporters</a>. To Jones, the whole thing validated the apocryphal credo of spywork: deny everything, admit nothing, make counter-accusations.</p> <p>Everything had escalated past the point of no return. Jones had finished his edits and rewrites to the committee report. It awaited a Senate vote on declassification. But now all of that was overshadowed by a fight with the CIA that had moved into the realm of back and forth criminal accusation. </p> <p>Jones thought the accusation was self-evidently absurd, enough to discredit the agency as engaged in bald-faced retaliation and wounding itself politically. \u201cI was wrong about that. It was actually pretty astute of them,\u201d he recollected.</p> <p>Efforts at de-escalation failed. In mid-January, within days of the network search, Brennan briefed the Senate majority leader, Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. Reid, who is close to Feinstein, told him that in the interests of avoiding a crisis, Brennan ought to apologize. Brennan flatly refused, insisting the agency had nothing to apologize for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70a557fee2a6c73b5805f1d1585c08814f22ac9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70a557fee2a6c73b5805f1d1585c08814f22ac9b/0_327_3899_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Harry Reid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, attempted to contain the damage. Ruemmler came to the Hill that winter, in a series of meetings with both the full committee and its leadership, to take the temperature of Senate-CIA relations down from their white-hot level. According to participants in those meetings, if Brennan was unyielding, Ruemmler was balanced. Feinstein brought up the 2010 document disappearance as a prologue for the current imbroglio. Ruemmler told her she had a valid point. </p> <p>Reid, a pivotal ally for the White House on Capitol Hill, did not want to be backed into a corner. After the criminal referral, Reid spoke to McDonough and conveyed that if Brennan was unwilling to apologize, he was not willing to defend Brennan should the episode become public. McDonough was noncommittal. A week later, Reid received a phone call from Barack Obama.<br></p> <p>To Reid\u2019s surprise, the president defended the CIA\u2019s actions. Obama rattled off the CIA\u2019s side of the story: the Senate staff had taken CIA documents and the agency had no choice but to handle the matter as it did. </p> <p>\u201cMr President,\u201d Reid said, \u201cI wish you could hear yourself.\u201d</p> <p>According to a former senior Senate aide, the episode stiffened Reid\u2019s inclination to defend Feinstein to the hilt. In early March, Reid contacted Feinstein, who was considering exposing the episode, and assured her of his full support in the battle to come. \u201cWe gave them ample opportunity\u201d to settle the issue, he told her. </p> <p>On 11 March, Jones got word that Feinstein was going to say something on the Senate floor. He had written her a speech detailing the origins and developments of the oversight battle with Langley, but he didn\u2019t know if Feinstein would actually deliver it. Feinstein got along well with Brennan on other matters, and taking on Brennan carried the risk of taking on Obama, the president Brennan had cultivated since Obama\u2019s first campaign. </p> <p>Instead, Feinstein laid into the CIA with an intensity unseen since the 1970s Church Committee, where legislators described an unbridled agency that spied on Americans as eagerly as they spied on foreign adversaries. The agency searches \u201cmay have undermined the constitutional framework essential to effective congressional oversight of intelligence activities or any other government function,\u201d Feinstein charged. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/09/dianne-feinstein-cia-torture-report-stain-americas-value-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4439j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2206945\"            data-video-name=\"Dianne Feinstein on CIA torture report: 'A stain on America's values' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418145193706/Dianne-Feinstein-015.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-453298225\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418145193706/Dianne-Feinstein-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/09/dianne-feinstein-cia-torture-report-stain-americas-value-video\">Dianne Feinstein on CIA torture report: \u2018A stain on America\u2019s values\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She foreshadowed the next fight within the committee and wrapped it in the constitution: declassifying the torture report. Not only would a public version ensure torture \u201cwill never again be considered or permitted\u201d, Feinstein said, but the CIA\u2019s reprisal against Jones meant the Senate faced a \u201cdefining moment\u201d testing whether the committee could effectively perform its oversight, \u201cor whether our work can be thwarted by those we oversee\u201d.</p> <p>Feinstein\u2019s speech occurred hours before Brennan had committed to a public appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations. Moderator Andrea Mitchell could not refrain from soliciting a response to Feinstein. To the incredulity of Jones, Brennan, who had been at the very least briefed on all of this from inception \u2013 who had told Feinstein and Chambliss on 15 January it had happened \u2013 denied everything. </p> <p>\u201cAs far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean we wouldn\u2019t do that. I mean, that\u2019s just beyond the \u2013 you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do,\u201d Brennan said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mr President, I wish you could hear yourself</p> <footer> <cite>Senator Harry Reid</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The years of clashing with the CIA behind closed doors had now exploded into public view. The CIA contacted reporters to provide the agency\u2019s preferred version of events, and observers took a scalpel to distinctions between searching and hacking. The implications of Feinstein\u2019s charges were profound. If the CIA would lie about torture, what else would it lie about? If it would spy on its legislative overseers, who wouldn\u2019t the agency spy on? </p> <p>Shocked by Brennan\u2019s denial, Reid had the Senate sergeant-at-arms conduct his own investigation. Reid wrote to the attorney general, Eric Holder, on 19 March to take into account the \u201cserious separation of powers implications\u201d of the CIA\u2019s search, which he said \u201cseemingly attempted to intimidate [the agency\u2019s] overseers\u201d.</p> <p>The sergeant-at-arms inquiry has been a forgotten aspect of the saga. One knowledgeable source said it ended up inconclusive. CIA\u2019s Trapani noted: \u201cDespite pledges of an investigation by the Senate sergeant-at-arms, there is no corresponding public record that sheds light on or explains fully the actions of [committee] staff.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Feinstein\u2019s speech had another impact, this one intentional. On 3 April, the committee voted 11-3 to authorize a declassified version of the torture report. Senate Republicans who had long rejected the report\u2019s findings joined Democrats who embraced them. Even Chambliss voted in favor of declassification, saying : \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/senate-votes-declassify-cia-torture-report\">We need to get this behind us</a>.\u201d </p> <p>Yet the CIA had an ally Feinstein may not have appreciated: the Oval Office. The White House announced that same day that the CIA itself would lead the declassification review. Formally, a White House official told the Guardian, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spearheaded it. The intelligence community would effectively choose which of its embarrassments to spare the public from learning. </p> <p>Carl Levin, a longtime Democratic senator from Michigan who retired in 2015, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the White House\u2019s overall lack of support for the committee.</p> <p>\u201cThe White House declined to lead the declassification effort, and instead gave the declassification review to the very agency, the CIA, that the Senate committee was investigating,\u201d Levin told the Guardian.</p> <p>Brennan\u2019s major ally at the White House was someone Jones knew well from a decade before. Chief of staff McDonough had encouraged Jones to join the security apparatus when Jones was an aspirant Senate staffer and McDonough was a Senate leadership aide. McDonough was one of Obama\u2019s closest confidants, with him on his Senate staff , through the presidential campaign and to his tenure as a deputy national security adviser. He assumed his current job right as Brennan, another White House senior staffer and campaign veteran, went to Langley. </p> <p>\u201cDenis played a much more central role in this than any of us thought he would,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe feeling was that he just backed CIA.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A criminal prosecution does not have to advance particularly far to ruin someone\u2019s life. The arcane provisions of Senate rules place senior staff in an exquisite financial bind. Such staff are banned from receiving gifts worth more than a pittance, as those gifts might be used to purchase influence. But included in that category is pro-bono legal assistance. </p> <p>While senators themselves can get legal aid if needed through campaign funding, they cannot themselves provide it to their staff. Feinstein and her predecessor as committee chair, Jay Rockefeller, set up a defense fund, according to a knowledgable source, but couldn\u2019t actually use it to protect aides facing legal jeopardy.</p> <p>Jones learned all of that when he had to seek legal representation. The cost of the retainer quoted to him made him wince: as a teacher, an FBI officer and a Senate staffer, \u201cI had not amassed a large amount of wealth.\u201d </p> <p>But Jones was single. He did not have children. The potential prosecution of his colleagues on the committee staff who did was having a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect. Emotionally, psychologically, the search scandal hung over everything they did, especially as they were about to do final battle with the CIA over declassification. The longer the process draws out, he said, \u201cyou can destroy someone financially.\u201d </p> <p>But on 30 April, less than a month after the committee voted to declassify the report\u2019s executive summary, the justice department sent word to the CIA attorney that it had \u201cno prosecutorial interest\u201d in pursuing a case against the Senate staffers. It would be the beginning of the Senate\u2019s vindication on this controversy. </p> <p>Jones took no victory lap. His pace was grueling, and they had not even begun the declassification discussions. The Republican senators were still musing about making him testify. The CIA-Senate fight loomed over every conversation with the White House, and in the committee. During that spring and summer, Brennan would still arrive on Capitol Hill to brief the senators on various intelligence matters. Substantive discussion would be consumed by legislators demanding more information about the various investigations around the search, and Brennan declining. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/527pj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2702368\"            data-video-name=\"Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1e96be4b07ac3d446a54f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\">Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Brennan\u2019s position became untenable on 18 July. Buckley, the inspector general, concluded in a classified report that at least five CIA officials \u2013 including, conspicuously, two attorneys \u2013 \u201cimproperly accessed [committee] Majority staff shared drives on the RDINet\u201d. In an ironic echo of the torture report\u2019s findings that the CIA misled the government about its detainee abuse, Buckley called out a \u201clack of candor\u201d among the three technical staff he interviewed. And he found that Eatinger\u2019s prosecutorial referral from February was \u201cunfounded\u201d as it went beyond the findings that the Cyber Blue Team had reached about Senate behavior on RDINet. </p> <p>Although Buckley concluded that the committee and the CIA did not reach \u201csigned memorand[a] of understanding\u201d, his report attached several 2009-era CIA-Senate letters referring to consensus that the only CIA access to RDINet\u2019s committee side would come from IT staff \u201cfor IT maintenance and support\u201d. (\u201cI think we are all in agreement on the computer issue,\u201d an unnamed CIA official had written to the committee back on 8 June 2009.) One of those CIA documents was even called Memorandum of Understanding. It would be an issue in a skirmish to come. </p> <p>The CIA didn\u2019t want the committee staff to have access to Buckley\u2019s report, even in classified form, as it contained the names of agency officials and sensitive units implicated in the episode. But within days, Buckley conveyed his findings to committee senators. While Jones could not attend a members-only briefing, he quickly learned that senators were told, unequivocally, that he had done nothing wrong. </p> <p>\u201cAt that point, I felt significantly vindicated,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA\u2019s own inspector general found that CIA inappropriately searched the Senate\u2019s computers,\u201d said Levin, the former senator. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA and the White House held no one accountable for these actions.\u201d</p> <p>Feinstein had a conversation with Brennan shortly afterward. On 31 July, Feinstein put out a statement that included a devastating line: \u201cDirector Brennan apologized for these actions.\u201d It was less categorical than many on the committee wanted. Vice\u2019s Leopold would ultimately acquire and publish a <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-google-search-that-made-the-cia-spy-on-the-us-senate\">letter from Brennan formally apologizing</a>, but the director never sent it, opting to apologize \u201cin person for the specific search that went beyond his instructions at the time,\u201d the CIA\u2019s Trapani said. But Feinstein got her desired result: <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cia-director-brennan-apologizes-senate-leaders-computer-hack-n169706\">headlines</a> around the world indicated Brennan had taken a step back. Udall immediately called on Brennan to resign. Speculation shot through Washington over whether he would.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe admitted that the CIA\u2019s actions were inappropriate, but he continues to deny that searching through a Senate committee\u2019s files and emails is spying on the committee. It\u2019s pretty bizarre when the CIA director doesn\u2019t seem to know what the word \u2018spying\u2019 means,\u201d said Wyden.</p> <p>Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat and former committee chairman, did not join Udall in calling for Brennan\u2019s resignation. But, he said, \u201cI did express my profound disappointment to Director Brennan on more than one occasion. My assessment at the time was that, despite Director Brennan having perhaps irreparably damaged his credibility with much of the committee, he was still capable of at least partially redeeming himself by holding people at the CIA accountable and publicly apologizing.\u201d There would be no such public apology.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The CIA and the White House held no one accountable for these actions</p> <footer> <cite>Former senator Carl Levin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barely half a year after the CIA had turned its powers against its overseers, the committee had won two consecutive victories. Chambliss, the panel\u2019s top Republican, called on the CIA to deal with the five offending officials \u201cvery harshly\u201d. But the fight was far from over. </p> <p>Brennan announced he would convene an \u201caccountability board\u201d to examine the network-search debacle. More crucially, the very next day, the CIA was set to deliver to the committee the version of the torture report it was comfortable with the public seeing, as Congress and the political world departed for the traditional August recess. If the committee had wanted to release that heavily blacked-out version, it could have done so, and avoided its next battle with the CIA \u2013 and the White House. </p> <p>Unlike in 2010, the White House would not mediate between the agency and the committee. It would simply back John Brennan.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Barack Obama, the president who ended the CIA\u2019s torture program by <a href=\"http:// https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations\">executive order</a> his second full day in office, entered the White House briefing room on 1 August 2014. \u201cWe tortured some folks,\u201d he memorably said. </p> <p>What Obama said afterward received less attention, but Jones can recount it to this day.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job those folks [at the CIA] had,\u201d said the president. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e7fbb151cda21a6994e7f783379676d7cba52d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7fbb151cda21a6994e7f783379676d7cba52d98/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obama White House briefing August 1 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>White House briefing room. 1 August 2014</h2> <p>The proposed declassifications the CIA would deliver back to the committee reflected that sentiment and far more. It would be difficult for a reader to feel \u201csanctimonious\u201d about torture, as it would be difficult to understand what the CIA had actually done.<br></p> <p>When Jones had drafted the report over the years, he had not taken a hardline approach to transparency. The former FBI official deliberately obscured many things he considered reasonably outside the public\u2019s knowledge. No draft of the report had ever contained the true name of a CIA official involved in the program, nor the countries where the black sites were. All were given cover names, and not even the agency\u2019s official cover names at that. It was how it had been in previous committee reports. Jones considered it uncontroversial. </p> <p>But the CIA fought release of all of that. The entire saga of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the admitted 9/11 mastermind whom the CIA waterboarded the most \u2013 a story the report told at great length \u2013 was blacked out, known in official parlance as \u201credaction\u201d. The CIA would not permit publication of the names of the 119 detainees the committee could find the agency detained. No country\u2019s cover name could be public. No pseudonym of a CIA officer could be public. </p> <p>\u201cThey redacted all references to Allah,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLike, really? Under what national security concern?\u201d</p> <p>The effect of the redactions was to obscure the story of what happened. CIA officials involved in the torture had persisted, thrived and been promoted within the agency, including individuals whom Jones had concluded helped mislead the Bush administration and the public. Jones had told, with cover names, that aspect of the story. Readers would have found it difficult to follow detainees from black site to black site, and more so to place pseudonymous interrogators at any. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t follow the narrative arc,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>The CIA\u2019s black magic marker looked cynical when considering that numerous senior agency officials involved with torture had published memoirs covering much of this material. CIA director George Tenet, ex-lawyer John Rizzo, even Jose Rodriguez, whose destruction of videotaped evidence of torture had occasioned the report \u2013 all had books out, books that had been cleared by the CIA\u2019s pre-publication review. The agency, with support from the White House, had permitted Hollywood film-makers unprecedented access for the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, which told the CIA\u2019s torture story the way the agency wanted it told \u2013 and in contradiction of what the Senate had found actually happened. </p> <p>After years of fighting with the CIA for access and accuracy, and brawling over accusations of criminality, Jones\u2019s new brief was to argue for rolling back the redactions. In 2010, when the CIA removed documents from the Senate side of RDINet, both sides turned to the White House to mediate the dispute. Now, the Senate negotiators were across the table from the CIA and the White House together. Meetings that lasted \u201chours and hours\u201d from August to December occurred at the White House \u2013 some even in the Situation Room \u2013 or on Capitol Hill, not the CIA. Jones remembered going practically paragraph by paragraph over declassification in the 525-page executive summary.</p> <p>For the CIA\u2019s part, cover names for agency officials would end up being fig leaves, once attentive readers began poring over the report. </p> <p>\u201cA pseudonym itself is little protection when a host of other information about that officer is made public and will be seen and possibly utilized by adversaries and foreign intelligence services,\u201d said agency spokesman Trapani.</p> <p>Trapani called the declassification discussions \u201cdesigned to preserve the committee\u2019s narrative of the CIA program for the public, while also protecting critical national security interests \u2013 including the safety and security of US personnel and ongoing intelligence operations.\u201d<br></p> <p>McDonough was a presence in the meetings, even those where he delegated attendance to National Security Council staffers or White House attorneys. The fact that the White House chief of staff would personally oversee the negotiations spoke to the gravity of the issue. Jones cannot recall a single issue on which McDonough or his team backed the Senate, and only when the agency would agree to relent would McDonough concur. There would be no help from the White House. </p> <p>\u201cDuring the process,\u201d a White House official said, \u201cDenis represented the views of the president and advocated on behalf of the redactions the inter-agency [process] assessed necessary to protect sensitive information.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62dc5b69a4518d4d0d18fdd43cf202829fbcae0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62dc5b69a4518d4d0d18fdd43cf202829fbcae0b/0_53_3584_2150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denis McDonough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>McDonough\u2019s position was particularly startling to Jones considering that Obama had taken an explicit position on classification. An executive order Obama issued in December 2009, intended to enforce his pledge to run the \u201cmost transparent administration in history\u201d, explicitly barred the agencies from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-classified-national-security-information\">conceal[ing] violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error</a>\u201d. Citing national security exemptions required an argument for why release would harm US \u201cnational defense or foreign relations\u201d, rather than being an end of discussion. </p> <p>\u201cThe administration didn\u2019t come to us with arguments for why they were redacting information, other than \u2018this is hurtful to national security.\u2019 What we would do would be to go to the statute and say, \u2018This is unclassified, because the law says this, this, this and this,\u2019 and they would just say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s a national security issue, we can\u2019t release this,\u201d Jones said. \u201c\u2018The world will end if this information is out,\u2019 and then you find out it\u2019s been out for four years \u2013 either they\u2019ve officially declassified it, or they allowed CIA officers to talk about it in books.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes the administration wouldn\u2019t even do that; or after the negotiators conceded to the Senate there was no national security basis for classification, the White House and CIA had a fallback contention, one for which Jones said made the discussions like beating his head against a wall.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s two arguments. You would put the lives of the CIA officers at risk, the lives of their families at risk. And then, the latter one, which always seemed to be the real reason because the other stuff just didn\u2019t hold any water, was that this will really hurt morale at the CIA, this is a morale issue. And they would openly say that, as if that was a reasonable response to making something classified,\u201d said Jones.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018The world will end if this information is out,\u2019 and then you find out it\u2019s been out for years</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At those points, Jones would pull out Obama\u2019s own executive order and quote it to the CIA, the White House staff, even McDonough. \u201cWe had it with us at every one of our meetings,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Nor was the agency consistent. It would not permit the Senate to publish pseudonyms of its officers. But it relented on allowing the report to use them for the contractor psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who designed the torture program and even participated in interrogations. Although any argument about protecting the safety of the lives and families of agency officials would apply equally to Mitchell and Jessen, the report calls them, unlike any CIA employee, \u201cSwigert\u201d and \u201cDunbar\u201d.</p> <p>The drawn-out discussions would not always involve staff. In mid-October, McDonough flew to San Francisco to speak with Feinstein without Jones present. Feinstein pleaded for the use of agency cover names to appear in the report, but McDonough refused, even as she asked for fewer and fewer of them. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a battle we ended up losing. We wanted to include our own pseudonyms so you could follow a particular individual through the report. We went right up until the end,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>But the White House and the CIA could afford a drawn-out process in a way Feinstein and her staff could not. It was a midterm election year, and the Democrats were widely forecast to lose the Senate, a circumstance that came to pass on election day, 4 November. Feinstein lost her gavel. A GOP that had vacillated between unsupportive of the torture inquiry and hostile to it would be in power come January. The race was truly on. </p> <p>\u201cAfter the election, the declassification of the report is at stake, whether it ever becomes public,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe were not in a position of power.\u201d </p> <p>Exasperation with McDonough exploded immediately after the Democrats lost the election. McDonough attended a Senate Democratic caucus meeting. Feinstein, whose demeanor is universally described as calm, excoriated him \u2013 \u201cjust fucking floored him\u201d, the former senior Senate aide said \u2013 accusing McDonough of being relieved the Democrats lost the chamber because now the administration could run out the clock on making the report public. Feinstein said McDonough had violated agreements they had reached on redactions and called the administration duplicitous. </p> <p>McDonough\u2019s response echoed Obama\u2019s August press conference. He said that the families of hardworking CIA officials would be vulnerable in the event that the Senate\u2019s disclosure of their identities led to physical danger. It was an incendiary charge, given that no CIA agent\u2019s real name appeared even in the classified version of the report.</p> <p>Most party-caucus meetings center around a lunch discussion and break when senators need to leave for votes. But anger at McDonough, both personal and as a proxy for the White House, was white-hot. They held McDonough at the meeting through the voting and came back to vent more spleen. </p> <p>\u201cThey really said flat out to McDonough, \u2018You\u2019re protecting what happened, you\u2019re no better than what had happened in the Bush administration,\u2019\u201d said the ex-senior aide present. </p> <p>\u201cThis was a very spirited conversation,\u201d said Wyden, who was in attendance.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very tense,\u201d said Jones, one of the few staffers at the meeting.</p> <p>There was another issue, one not before revealed, that went down to the wire \u2013 the very last thing on which McDonough and the CIA would not yield an inch. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s pretty bizarre when the CIA director doesn\u2019t seem to know what the word \u2018spying\u2019 means</p> <footer> <cite>Senator Ron Wyden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Senior CIA officials had assured the Senate that the personnel performing the interrogations were vetted rigorously. Former director Michael Hayden told the committee in 2007 that \u201call of those involved in the questioning of detainees are carefully chosen and screened for demonstrated professional judgment and maturity.\u201d </p> <p>It was not always true. The committee had learned that some CIA interrogators had records of violent acts in their personal lives \u2013 to include domestic abuse and even sexual assault. Even without listing names or pseudonyms, Langley refused to let that fact become public, no matter how tenuously connected to US national security it was. </p> <p>\u201cCIA conducted extensive analysis of the possible use of possible pseudonyms in the [Senate] report and determined that to do so would risk publicly revealing the true names of those officers, as well as the names of officers not associated with the program, and the identification of their family members,\u201d said the CIA\u2019s Trapani. \u201cThe administration did not support making disclosures that would put US government personnel and their families at additional risk.\u201d</p> <p>It was Friday 5 December 2014. The lame-duck session of Congress was nearly ended, and with it, Democratic control of the Senate. The committee, the CIA and McDonough had reached agreement on the entire report, except for the section \u2013 a single paragraph \u2013 alluding to the questionable backgrounds of its interrogators. </p> <p>McDonough would not back down. \u201cIt was a long meeting,\u201d Jones remembered, and the CIA was not even present. McDonough said the administration would agree to release the report \u201cas is\u201d. But first the paragraph had to change. </p> <p>The meeting became an endurance test. Finally, the committee representatives found a degree of acceptable language from McDonough. </p> <p>Page 470 of the report, long after the narrative had ended, referred to \u201ca number of personnel whose backgrounds include notable derogatory information calling into question their eligibility for employment, their access to classified information, and their participation in CIA interrogation activities.\u201d Most of that information was known to the agency. The report continued: \u201cThis group of officers included individuals who, among other issues, had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management issues, and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI was like, \u2018Alright, this doesn\u2019t do it justice, but at least people will get the idea,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis was done to water down the backgrounds of people involved in the program.\u201d</p> <p>Six years after Jones began looking into CIA torture, it seemed like a section of the Senate report would finally see the light of day. But at the end of the meeting, the committee received an unexpected surprise. John Kerry, the secretary of state, longtime Massachusetts senator, war hero and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, called Feinstein. It would be a near-death experience for the torture inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612906daf554534931869de02cd89c0ffcc30394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612906daf554534931869de02cd89c0ffcc30394/0_229_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US secretary of state John Kerry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Kerry was urging his old Senate colleagues to delay the report\u2019s release. It was a tenuous moment globally, he argued. The coalition against the Islamic State would be jeopardized by an inflammatory report about the CIA torturing Muslims. Americans\u2019 lives and property abroad could be jeopardized. </p> <p>By that point, there were many aspects of the CIA\u2019s entreaties that no longer held sway with Democratic senators. But Kerry could not be dismissed out of hand. Many senators on the committee had close working relationships, even friendships, with Kerry. They knew him not to inflate threats. </p> <p>Technically, all Kerry was asking was a delay in the report\u2019s release. But the political reality, with the Republicans set to take over the Senate, was that delay was fatal. There was another inescapable certainty. Should the worst occur, and violence follow the release of the torture report, every senator whose name graced its cover would have to answer for it.<br></p> <p>Had James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, not intervened at that critical moment, it is possible that the Democratic senators would have capitulated and buried the report. </p> <p>By the weekend, the committee received a five-page document prepared by Clapper\u2019s office (ODNI), the entity nominally in charge of the 16 intelligence agencies. It purported to forecast the outcome of the report\u2019s release. Jones described it as \u201ca farce\u201d.</p> <p>ODNI\u2019s assessment was riddled with factual errors, and from those errors extrapolated dire consequences, including violence and damage to intelligence relationships. It falsely claimed the report, even in classified form, identified countries that hosted black sites. By that point, even committee senators reliant on staff for details of the report could see how wrong it was. When asked, a senior ODNI official telegraphed indifference to the accuracy of the document. Jones recalls the official saying: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s in the report. It matters what people think is.\u201d </p> <p>If the administration\u2019s goal was to suppress the torture report, Clapper pulled defeat from the jaws of victory. No longer were senators fixated on Kerry\u2019s warning. According to multiple sources, they were convinced an administration they wanted badly to believe was on their side was willing to insult their intelligence, all in the service of helping the CIA cover up an act the president himself had vociferously opposed. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a poorly done intelligence product with clear factual errors and it inaccurately described the study we were about to release,\u201d said Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cUltimately, yes, I think for some senators, the angle and clear errors in that intelligence assessment played a role in their decision to support the release of the redacted Executive Summary of the Study. My only regret is we did not work to declassify more.\u201d</p> <p>Timothy Barrett, an ODNI spokesman, said the directorship supported the redacted release of the summary but \u201chad a duty to warn policymakers about the possible consequences of release of the report in order to enable preparation and effective measures to protect American citizens and interests. This assessment could not be limited to the text of the report in a vacuum, but had to consider the effect of its release in light of other information that had already been reported \u2013 and public perceptions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The report that\u2019s out is not the report we would have chosen to put out</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 9 December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released\">the committee released the executive summary</a>. It sent shockwaves through Washington and around the world, and demands for additional accountability swelled. But it yielded no riots, no violence and no death.</p> <p>\u201cThat lack of violence does not reflect a lack of threats. In fact, the government took steps to mitigate threats \u2014 including from terrorists \u2014 in the wake of the report\u2019s release,\u201d Barrett said. </p> <p>\u201cThe intelligence community stands by its assessment of the potential consequences from release of the report. Indeed, in discussions with senior representatives of the ODNI, members of the committee acknowledged that there were risks to releasing the report.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/documentcloud/index.html?docid=1376762-torture-report\" data-alt=\"CIA torture report released on Dec 9 2014\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/documentcloud/index.html?docid=1376762-torture-report\">CIA torture report released on Dec 9 2014</a> </figure>  <p>Jones\u2019s life had been consumed by the inquiry. </p> <p>\u201cDan Jones always, always, tried to keep this focused on the facts,\u201d said Wyden. </p> <p>\u201cHe spent six years of his life riding point on this.

  "<h2><strong>Best team that won\u2019t make the playoffs</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Buccaneers</strong>. Jameis Winston, Doug Martin and Mike Evans give the Bucs a young and dynamic offense, but the rebuilding defense and having to play in a division with the Panthers will likely keep Tampa Bay on the outside looking in (for one more year). <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The<strong> Raiders</strong> are on the rise with a talented young quarterback and speedy receiver to go with some promising defensive players. By season\u2019s end Oakland will be knocking on the door of the postseason. They will come up just short this time. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I suspect it will come from the AFC West, whose four teams all have enough quality to win the division, but also enough flaws to sink to last place. I\u2019ll take a better-than-expected <strong>San Diego Chargers </strong>team to narrowly miss out despite a renaissance year from Philip Rivers. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>The<strong> Bengals </strong>have made the postseason for five straight years and have demonstrated steady growth in building through the draft even if they don\u2019t have the playoff results to show for it. But despite offensive and defensive lines that rate among the NFL\u2019s best, they\u2019ll be odd men out in the annual wild-card logjam. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Non-playoff team from last year that will make the playoffs</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Indianapolis </strong><strong>Colts.</strong> Not because the Colts will be appreciably better this year than last or because Andrew Luck will finally reach his supposed Hall of Fame potential. It\u2019s just that some team has to win the AFC South and the Colts are mediocre enough do it. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Last season was a disaster of the <strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong> who have been one of the league\u2019s more stable franchises since moving to the east coast. They are healthy again after a year of injuries to key players, including quarterback Joe Flacco. They lost close games last year that they won\u2019t drop this time around. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Oakland Raiders</strong>. For all the focus on Derek Carr and Amari Cooper\u2019s improvement, the Raiders\u2019 biggest gains could be on defense \u2013 with the additions of Bruce Irvin and Sean Smith. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>With a healthy Andrew Luck back under center, the <strong>Colts</strong> will deliver on last year\u2019s dashed hopes. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Team you\u2019re looking forward most to watching</strong></h2> <p>A full season with Tyrod Taylor, Sammy Watkins and LeSean McCoy together in <strong>Buffalo</strong> promises a lot of excitement. And when you throw in the entertainment provided by the Ryan brothers on the sideline, there\u2019s no other choice. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>No team is more intriguing than <strong>Denver</strong> in the season after their Super Bowl win. The Broncos still have what might be the league\u2019s best defense but they lost quarterbacks Peyton Manning to retirement and Brock Osweiler to free agency. Defensively they have the ability to win another title, but offensively they might be lost. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I think some people are getting a little carried away with their expectations for Dak Prescott, but how could you not be fascinated by the prospect of him pairing up with Ezekiel Elliott in an all-rookie backfield for <strong>Dallas</strong>? <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>A Super Bowl loss won\u2019t keep the Panthers from talking loudly, dancing freely and celebrating without restraint. They\u2019re just what the stolid NFL needs. That alone makes them destination viewing, say nothing of the fact that Cam Newton has yet to peak. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Most valuable player</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a64c6eb85a703fc51d0af6e0967d6ee7cfc048a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a64c6eb85a703fc51d0af6e0967d6ee7cfc048a/0_28_3348_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Wilson excelled down the stretch last season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Wilson excelled down the stretch last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Habeeb/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tom Brady</strong> lost his battle with Roger Goodell, but he\u2019ll probably get the MVP as a consolation prize. The Patriots offense will make a big improvement after four games and everyone will hit upon the notion that Brady is rather valuable. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Because the Seahawks struggled so much early last season it\u2019s easy to forget just how great<strong> </strong><strong>Russell Wilson</strong> was in the second half of the campaign when Seattle changed their offense. If he is anything like the player he was in November and December 2015 he will be the league\u2019s best player. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong>, the man who will make sure that the Pats\u2019 offense keeps ticking even with Jimmy Garoppolo under center. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>, the NFL\u2019s best quarterback, will join his predecessor Brett Favre as a three-time MVP. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Johnny Manziel Disaster Waiting To Happen Dept</strong></h2> <p><strong>Johnny Manziel</strong>. Let\u2019s not too quickly overlook the reigning champ. With Tony Romo currently resting and preparing for his next injury, Dak Prescott a question mark and Mark Sanchez a known/disappointing commodity, Jerry Jones could be insane enough to sign Manziel before the season is out. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>In the first Houston Super Bowl since Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d the <strong>Patriots mascot</strong> will have his own \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d revealing a design to spy on opponents\u2019 huddles and steal their play calls. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I fear that the <strong>Ryan brothers</strong>\u2019 collaboration in Buffalo cannot end well. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/17383705/rex-rob-ryan-plan-take-buffalo-bills-playoffs-first-16-years\">Rex has already gained 30lbs</a>, for a start \u2026 <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Roger Goodell</strong> resigns as commissioner in January to assume the office of Secretary of the Interior in Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>One bold prediction</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pittsburgh miss the playoffs</strong>. Do I think it will happen? No. Could it? Definitely. Everyone seems oddly high on a team with a suspect D that will be without Le\u2019Veon Bell, Martavis Bryant, Ladarius Green and Bud Dupree for all or part of the season. The Steelers are one Ben Roethlisberger or Antonio Brown injury away from disaster. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The Cowboys will panic and chase a big-name broken-down quarterback ... oh, wait, you said a <em>bold</em> prediction. How about the <strong>Chargers and Raiders wind up staying in San Diego and Oakland</strong>? <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Despite the fact that he hasn\u2019t played a competitive game since 2014, and won\u2019t play his first of this season until October, I say <strong>Josh Gordon makes the Pro Bowl</strong>. Because if there\u2019s one thing RGIII definitely does have in his locker, it\u2019s the deep ball. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Lamar Miller wins the NFL rushing title.</strong> Houston\u2019s new running back was used lightly in Miami, but the Texans will depend heavily on the 25-year-old as they break in a new quarterback. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Offensive player of the year</strong></h2> <p><strong>Antonio Brown</strong>. If Roethlisberger and Brown stay healthy, Brown will benefit from the absences of Le\u2019Veon Bell and Martavis Bryant by being targeted approximately infinity times per game in Todd Haley\u2019s pass-happy offense. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p><strong>Russell Wilson</strong>. Last season was the year of Cam Newton but with their defense falling back a bit the Panthers offense will too. This is the year people will be talking about Seattle\u2019s offense, not just their defense. It will be because of Wilson\u2019s play. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I keep banging this drum, but <strong>Antonio Brown</strong> would have had a 2,000-yard season last year if it weren\u2019t for Michael Vick. Even when Landry Jones was his quarterback, he kept on producing. He\u2019s the best receiver in the league, and doesn\u2019t have Martavis Bryant to share the load this year, either. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>\u2019 numbers will only swell with Jordy Nelson back in the fold. Look for the MVP to double up here. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Defensive player of the year</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"488c493e6ec303ae72d05c5910c727c25b164ed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/488c493e6ec303ae72d05c5910c727c25b164ed2/0_61_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JJ Watt could be toppled as defensive player of the year by Aaron Donald\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JJ Watt could be toppled as defensive player of the year by Aaron Donald.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry W. Smith/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Aaron Donald</strong>. Donald arguably deserved this award last year, but finished second to noted football brand JJ Watt. With the young Rams defensive tackle now in a bigger media market and Watt opening the season hobbled, Donald will win. (And let\u2019s hope that\u2019s the only win by a Donald in 2016.) <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The Rams won\u2019t be doing much this season but Los Angeles fans will have their first new big star in <strong>Aaron Donald</strong>, who is maybe as good as JJ Watt right now. How many interior defensive players have 20 sacks in their careers let alone their first two seasons? <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>JJ Watt</strong>, as usual. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Khalil Mack</strong>. Oakland\u2019s edge rusher was in the conversation for top defensive honors after a standout sophomore campaign. With an improved secondary and Bruce Irvin applying pressure from the opposite end, look for Mack to challenge the single-season sacks record in year three. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Rookie of the year</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong>. He\u2019s the unquestioned RB1 for a team with quarterback issues and a dominant offensive line. If anyone else wins Offensive Rookie of the Year, it will be an upset. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The easy choice would be to say <strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> who should pile up yards in the Cowboys backfield, but Dallas will stumble without Tony Romo and a great under-the-radar choice should be linebacker Myles Jack, who can fit beautifully in Jacksonville\u2019s system and could be part of a Jags renaissance. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> is going to have some fun behind that great offensive line in Dallas. <strong> PB</strong></p> <p>Tony Romo\u2019s injury means No4 overall pick <strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> will get even more touches behind the league\u2019s best offensive line as the Cowboys jump in a rookie quarterback. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC East champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Patriots</strong>. It\u2019s fun to think about all the ways Tom Brady\u2019s suspension <a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/19/tom-brady-deflategate-suspension-new-england-patriots-nfl\">could lead to New England\u2019s demise</a>, but it\u2019s hard to see them failing to win a division that features Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Ryan Brothers and the Miami Dolphins. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>With or without Tom Brady for every game, the division is <strong>New England</strong>\u2019s to lose. Miami may surprise, the Jets will make the race interesting, Buffalo has enough talent to make a run and will get a shot at the Brady-less Pats in September. In the end, though, The Patriots are the Patriots and Brady is Brady. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Patriots</strong>. For once, I don\u2019t think this is a foregone conclusion. A month without Brady is no small thing, and if any other team in this division can make a fast start then things could certainly get interesting. I\u2019m just not sure who it would be. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>It says here New England is slow out of the gate with Tom Brady sidelined and the <strong>Buffalo </strong><strong>Bills</strong> hang on to win the division and host a playoff game for the first time in 20 years. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC North champion</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"712fbdb67d828fa94a50fbe9ec0beed48c0efab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/712fbdb67d828fa94a50fbe9ec0beed48c0efab3/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Brown could clock up 2,000 receiving yards this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Brown could clock up 2,000 receiving yards this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Steelers</strong>. As long as the Steelers don\u2019t suffer more significant injuries or suspensions, they should have enough to take the division \u2013 and send the Bengals to the wild-card round for their usual postseason demise. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>This is the trickiest of all divisions. Pittsburgh have the kind of offense that can put up huge scores and Baltimore will be better after an injury-filled 2015. Still, <strong>Cincinnati</strong> remains a difficult team to beat, with a good enough mix of a ball-control offense and an aggressive defense to win the title. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I like the <strong>Steelers</strong> a lot this season - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/afc-north-pittsburgh-steelers-super-bowl\">but only if they can stay healthy</a>. Cincy will not be far behind, and on strength of coaching alone I expect the Ravens to be competitive, as well. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>When the <strong>Steelers</strong> finally get their embarrassment of offensive riches on the field together \u2013 Ben Roethlisberger, Le\u2019Veon Bell and Antonio Brown \u2013 they\u2019re clearly the team to beat. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC West champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Chiefs</strong>. If Kansas City is going to win the AFC West, this is the year. The Broncos should take a step back from 2015 and Derek Carr and the Raiders are still likely a year way from being true contenders. Alex Smith can\u2019t let this opportunity slip through his small hands. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p><strong>Kansas City</strong> are a Super Bowl team. If all the pieces are working together and the Chiefs can do what hasn\u2019t always happened and win the big games, they should roll to at least the AFC title game. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>This feels to me like the toughest division to call. I\u2019m going with the <strong>Chiefs</strong>, whose defense remains strong despite departures in the secondary, and whose deep stable of running backs will keep things ticking along on the other side of the ball. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>Denver\u2019s stout defense covered for Peyton Manning last year and Northwestern alum Trevor Siemian won\u2019t prove the downgrade most people think. Look for the <strong>Broncos</strong> to win a sixth straight division crown. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC South champion</strong></h2> <p>Look for the <strong>Colts</strong> to eke out the AFC South with a record in the neighborhood of 9-7, giving them the opportunity to raise another somewhat humiliating banner to the rafters at Lucas Oil Stadium. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>All <strong>Houston</strong> have needed for many seasons now is the quarterback upon whom they can built, and they gave Brock Osweiler a lot of money to be that player. A dark horse here is Jacksonville who have a gifted young defense and a quarterback around whom they can build. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ll back Andrew Luck to haul the <strong>Colts</strong> to first place \u2013 despite glaring weaknesses elsewhere on the roster.<strong> PB</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Colts</strong> will need many more pieces before they\u2019re true contenders, but a healed Andrew Luck should be enough to lift Indy past Houston for the division crown. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC East champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Washington and the Giants</strong>. I\u2019m calling for a tie. It seems fitting for a division that might be won at 8-8. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Once Tony Romo got hurt it seemed the biggest impediment to Washington\u2019s winning a second straight division title was removed. This remains a flawed team and there are questions about whether Kirk Cousins is really the quarterback to take <strong>Washington</strong> to the top but very quietly general manager Scott McLaughlin has put together a roster of talented young players. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Giants</strong>. Having the best healthy quarterback (settle down, Dak devotees) paired with Odell Beckham Jr is a pretty solid starting point in a weak division. Of course, making sure that Eli Manning stays healthy behind that offensive line may not be entirely straightforward. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Philadelphia</strong>. The Eagles ride a surprisingly stout defense and occasionally competent offense helmed by first-year quarterback Carson Wentz to finish 8-8 and win this dumpster fire of division on a tiebreaker with Washington. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC North champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Green Bay</strong>. This division race was wrapped up the second Teddy Bridgewater\u2019s knee was wrapped in an air cast. Is Week 1 too early for the Packers to start resting players for the playoffs? <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>This should have been Minnesota until Teddy Bridgewater got hurt and now the Vikings probably tumble out of the playoffs and Green Bay will step up to win another division title. As long as Aaron Rodgers is their quarterback the Packers will find ways to win games. There\u2019s an excellent chance <strong>Green Bay</strong> will be playing to go to the Super Bowl in January. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Were it not for the Teddy Bridgewater injury, this might have been up for discussion. As it stands, the <strong>Packers</strong>, with Jordy Nelson back in the line-up, are an easy pick. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>With the game\u2019s best quarterback under center and a strength of schedule that ranks 32nd out of 32 teams, <strong>Green Bay </strong>is the pick. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC West champion</strong></h2> <p><strong>Cardinals</strong>. The Cardinals and Seahawks are two of the top five Super Bowl LI favorites in Vegas. Winning the division will be nice, but ultimately meaningless. Both teams look to peak in the postseason. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>It could well be the year of Russell Wilson which means it will also be the year of the <strong>Seahawks</strong>. The Cardinals have made this a very difficult division now. Seattle and Arizona might be the two best teams in the NFC. In the end, Wilson \u2013 and not the Seahawks defense \u2013 will win the division and maybe the Super Bowl. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>On paper, the Cardinals look strongest, but on the field Carson Palmer lost his mojo at the end of 2015 and showed no signs of recapturing it during preseason. I still expect Arizona to be competitive, but for now I\u2019m giving <strong>Seattle</strong> the edge. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Arizona</strong>. The Cardinals, who came within a game of the Super Bowl last year, have experience on both sides of the ball and one of the NFL\u2019s top quarterbacks in Carson Palmer. No team in the league is deeper from top to bottom. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC South champion</strong></h2> <p>The NFC South should be won by <strong>Carolina</strong> with ease. Remember the performance the Panthers put up in the Super Bowl? Even 16 more of those will win them this division. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Carolina without Josh Norman will not be the Carolina of last season. That said, there are no other contenders in the NFC South. The <strong>Panthers</strong> should win the division again with little trouble, especially if Cam Newton has another great season. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Yes, the <strong>Panthers</strong> had a soft schedule last season, and sure, losing Josh Norman hurts. But they did also get back a 1,000-yard receiver in Kelvin Benjamin. They are still the best team in this division. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>No Super Bowl losers\u2019 curse for <strong>Carolina</strong>, who were beaten only once during last year\u2019s regular season and remain the class of the division. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC wild card teams</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"587d8dfe2828849fbee4f4adae1b62ebf2934891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587d8dfe2828849fbee4f4adae1b62ebf2934891/0_0_3600_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It couldn\u2019t happen again, could it?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It couldn\u2019t happen again, could it?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Baltimore Ravens, Miami Dolphins <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>New England Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC wild card teams</strong></h2> <p>Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Arizona Cardinals, Chicago Bears <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Arizona Cardinals, Minnesota Vikings <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>AFC championship game</strong></h2> <p>New England Patriots over Pittsburgh Steelers <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>New England Patriots over Kansas City Chiefs <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Pittsburgh Steelers over New England Patriots <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>Pittsburgh Steelers over Kansas City Chiefs <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>NFC championship game</strong></h2> <p>Carolina Panthers over Seattle Seahawks<strong> DG</strong></p> <p>Seattle Seahawks over Green Bay Packers <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Seattle Seahawks over Green Bay Packers <strong>PB</strong></p> <p>Arizona Cardinals over Green Bay Packers <strong>BAG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Super Bowl LI</strong></h2> <p>Remember all the criticism Cam Newton faced after last year\u2019s Super Bowl? This February he\u2019ll be a hero for the <strong>Panthers</strong> \u2013 and especially to Roger Goodell \u2013 for handing Bill Belichick and Tom Brady their third Super Bowl defeat. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>In a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX the <strong>Seahawks</strong> won\u2019t need to hand the ball to their trusted running back in the final seconds of the game. Instead they will put up more than 30 points and shock the Patriots, who are not accustomed to having teams beat them decisively in Super Bowls. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p><strong>Seahawks </strong>over Steelers. Marshawn Lynch is gone, but offensive co-ordinator Darrell Bevell will get his moment of catharsis as Russell Wilson and an under-rated receiving corps light up Pittsburgh\u2019s patchy secondary. Seattle\u2019s defense has lost a few pieces, but should still be able to slow Le\u2019Veon Bell and Antonio Brown just enough. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>Arizona </strong>over<strong> </strong>Pittsburgh. The NFL\u2019s deepest roster, which got even deeper with the signing of pass rusher Chandler Jones from New England, will exact revenge for Super Bowl XLIII behind the three-pronged rushing attack of third-year back David Johnson, old war horse Chris Johnson and change-of-pace complement Andre Ellington and a commanding secondary led by versatile defensive back Tyrann Mathieu. <strong>BAG</strong></p>",
  "<p>UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic defends his belt for the first time on Saturday. The five-round contest against Dutchman Alistair Overeem in Miocic\u2019s backyard of Cleveland, Ohio, sets up as a coronation for an athlete from a city in unfamiliar territory: a sports town on a hot streak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/22/conor-mcgregor-ufc-future-jose-aldo-nate-diaz\">Conor McGregor is king of UFC again: so what will his reign look like?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Headlines in June noted that Cleveland snapped a 52-year championship drought when LeBron James and the Cavaliers claimed the NBA title in seven games over the Golden State Warriors. It was Miocic, however, who got the good times rolling the previous month with a stellar first round knockout of Fabricio Werdum in front of 45,000 fans in Curitiba, Brazil.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something to be proud of,\u201d Miocic said on Thursday during the final press conference for UFC 203. \u201cYou can say I broke [the drought] or didn\u2019t break it. I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just happy the city has something to be proud of.\u201d</p> <p>UFC booked the home of the Cavaliers, Quicken Loans Arena, with the blue-collar Miocic in mind. A part-time firefighter and paramedic, Miocic led the parade when the Cavs celebrated Cleveland\u2019s first major sports championship since the Browns won the NFL championship in 1964.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have always worn Cleveland shirts and supported Cleveland no matter how bad the teams were or how close we were,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s really all about the city. We\u2019re just hardworking people that love the city and don\u2019t care how the teams do. Now we have a few champions. We\u2019re a city of champions now and plan on keeping it that way for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Not only is UFC 203 a chance for Clevelanders to revel again in the success of one of their own, it\u2019s a nod to the reality that any man holding the UFC heavyweight belt has not done so more than two consecutive defenses. The majority of the promotion\u2019s heavyweight champions haven\u2019t even managed one retention. That truth, plus the intense pressure of delivering a title retention at home, has not appeared to weigh on Miocic, who said he doesn\u2019t really take things seriously until he walks to the Octagon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be curious to see how Stipe handles it,\u201d Overeem said. \u201cHe seems to be very professional but we\u2019ll see on Saturday.\u201d</p> <p>Miocic is as athletic as they come in the heavyweight division. Standing 6ft 4in at 246lbs, Miocic\u2019s fit frame allows him to be light and balanced, promoting quality footwork that leads to the sort of swiftness that aided in his stoppage of Werdum. A former Golden Gloves boxer and amateur wrestler, Miocic has improved by noticeable measures over the course of his MMA career, which began in 2010.</p> <p>After turning 34 in August, the collegiate baseball player and wrestler at the University of Cleveland claims to be more confident a competitor than ever before.</p> <p>\u201cI know I\u2019m better than I was than the last fight,\u201d said Miocic, who enters the Octagon against Overeem with a 15-2 record.</p> <p>The 36-year-old Dutch challenger is considerably more experienced than Miocic, boasting 70 professional fights between MMA and kickboxing over the last 17 years, including six wins over former UFC champions.</p> <p>\u201cI almost feel a little bit sad that I\u2019ll be taking something away from them,\u201d said Overeem (41-14) when he was asked about challenging Miocic in Cleveland.</p> <p>\u201cThis definitely is going to be the crown of my career.\u201d</p> <p>The night\u2019s co-main event features Werdum, 39, against Travis Browne, a replacement for the injured Ben Rothwell. Werdum said it\u2019s his intention to take care of business once again against the tall Hawaiian (Werdum, 20-6-1, out-pointed Browne, 18-4-1, in 2014) and watch closely as the main event unfolds. The Brazilian ousted by Miocic wants nothing more than another crack at UFC gold\u2014that\u2019s why he said he requested to fight on this card.</p> <p>While the heavyweight championship contest has earned its fair share of deserved attention, especially in northeastern Ohio, the night\u2019s most discussed bout features fighters with two pro bouts between them.</p> <p>The long-awaited UFC debut of professional wrestler CM Punk (aka Phil Brooks) has not come to pass without some handwringing.</p> <p>The Ohio Athletic Commission agreed to license Brooks, 37, in lieu of the fact that did not meet the state\u2019s requirements, namely any kind of fighting experience. As these things go, the commission utilized a waiver outlined in its rules allowing the UFC to promote the kind of fight that would be normal fare for smaller cards on any given weekend across the U.S.</p> <p>Brooks signed with the UFC in 2014 after a dispute with the WWE, for which he reigned as the pro wrestling organization\u2019s world champion over 443 days. His last WWE appearance occurred in the same venue he\u2019ll fight on Saturday, and since then he dedicated himself to pursuing MMA.</p> <p>\u201cYou have frustrating days. You have breakthroughs. You turn corners. You make friends. You\u2019re with your team. Your team is your family. It\u2019s been an amazing experience,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cSo no matter how frustrated or bad a day got it was still awesome. I\u2019m enjoying all of this. This is fun for me.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how hard training was I get to go home and kiss my wife, like that\u2019s a luxury in my world that I never used to do. It\u2019s like vacation.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s back to the real world for Chicago\u2019s Brooks when he faces 24-year-old upstart Mickey Gall (2-0).</p> <p>Unlike fellow WWE superstar Brock Lesnar \u2013 a physical specimen who won a national championship while wrestling for the University of Minnesota \u2013 Brooks has been derided as half an athlete whose fighting experiment won\u2019t amount to anything but attention and a payday.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m awkward and uncoordinated, and I\u2019m old, and I\u2019m fat, and I\u2019m lazy, and I suck and I was a fake athlete and I\u2019m not going to be able to do it,\u201d Brooks said when asked about his naysayers heading into his match. \u201cIf you believe all that stuff, then you\u2019re not going to be able to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Brooks suggested working the pro wrestling ranks is like driving an automatic car, while shooting in the MMA world is akin to driving stick. It\u2019s basically the same thing, with a few important differences that will determine whether or not you move or stall.</p> <p>\u201cTo me it\u2019s never too late to start anything you want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think so I\u2019m sorry your dreams are so small.\u201d</p> <p>Many Clevelanders like Miocic might say it\u2019s never too late to dream big. Lacking that, The Land may not have extricated itself from a streak that seemed everlasting, and he may not have won the UFC title. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m from Cleveland. I love this place. I\u2019m never going to leave,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be. It\u2019s amazing to come here. I\u2019m so happy that UFC is finally here. We\u2019ve been starving for it in Cleveland.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I wrote my debut novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/girl-is-a-half-formed-thing.html\"><em>A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing</em></a> in six months, during 2003 and 2004. I wish I could offer a detailed account of that time, explain why I was drawn to my subject matter or exactly how its linguistic style was arrived at, but I can\u2019t. When I began writing there was no real plan and nothing, I thought, that I urgently wished to say. All I had was an idea about a girl walking down a London street over a single day and the feeling that Joyce\u2019s observation \u2013 \u201cOne great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot\u201d \u2013 pointed somewhere interesting. So I wrote it on a scrap of paper, stuck it over my desk and began.</p> <p>Not having a university background, I had no idea how to set about writing a novel, so I decided to write 1,000 words a day and hope something would emerge. It was largely due to this luckily, if inadvertently, arrived at discipline that a hoard of hitherto unmoored images and experiences began to coalesce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/sep/08/eimear-mcbride-webchat-the-lesser-bohemians\">Eimear McBride webchat \u2013 post your questions now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I remembered watching Lars von Trier\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/breaking-waves-trier-arthouse\"><em>Breaking the Waves</em></a> in 1996. How the distressed innocence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/emily-watson\">Emily Watson\u2019</a>s Bess came like a kick in the stomach and made me, probably for the first time, aware of a work of art altering the very molecules of who I was. Six years later I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\"><em>Ulysses</em></a> which turned everything I\u2019d previously thought about literature on its head and showed me that within the novel lay the greatest freedom I would ever possess. Then, as I was beginning the book, I saw a production of Sarah Kane\u2019s <em>Cleansed</em>. There was such uncompromising brutality, and beauty, in her writing that I suddenly recognised the degree of my own prejudice regarding appropriate modes of expression for female writers. This bizarre prudery, which bore no relation to the way I lived my life, came as a shock, but casting off this final, subconscious hobbling meant I was suddenly ready to go.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My naive plagiarism died as the words hit the page</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And what came was nothing like I\u2019d imagined. The naive plagiarism I\u2019d begun with pretty much died as the words hit the page, while the much feared \u201cIrish\u201d themes of sex, death, family, guilt and religion \u2013 all done up in a parochial bow \u2013 began to surface. When I tried to circumvent them my sentences immediately dried into platitudes, so I knew something different was called for and this was when Joyce\u2019s quote woke up in me. But how to describe those parts of life which grammatical English and linear sentences fail to serve? Presumably new methods of binding the reader closer to the character\u2019s experience than \u201cwideawake language\u201d normally allows, had to be explored.</p> <p>So, firstly, I avoided all tangible information about time and place, leaving my inevitable Hiberno-English to fill in those gaps. Similarly, all characters remained unnamed in the hope of closing that very basic sense of separateness down. The reader experiences the narrative from the girl\u2019s perspective, therefore it seemed logical they never receive descriptions of her appearance \u2013 for who walks around describing themselves to themselves? Once all identifying markers were withheld the reader was left with what the girl sees, thinks, how her body reacts to what it experiences and can, from the sum of these, hopefully extrapolate how she feels. I didn\u2019t want the reader to feel separate from her or in a position to pass judgment on her actions. I wanted them to feel they <em>were</em> her, and that what was happening to her, and inside her, was also happening within themselves.</p> <p>Quite a tall order, and certainly not one I knew how to fulfil. What I did know, as a result of three years\u2019 drama school, was how to make people. To express a natural, prismatic experience of life through words \u2013 rather than the performer\u2019s body \u2013 language had to work differently. Be broken, reformed, have its grammar mauled and punctuation recalibrated. With no way of knowing whether this would work, my only option was to try.</p> <p>And my protagonist deserved that effort. She suffers a lot. But she is also the opposite of all those passive female literary victims. She never longs for romance or seeks fulfilment from \u201cthe love of a good man\u201d. She rages against the dictates of her deformed society, seeks control in the places she has been stripped of it, and rebels against dogma\u2019s diagnosis of her chaotic sexuality. She chooses always to choose. And she is filled with so much love. It was such relief to write a woman like that. Well worth the risk of constructing this rickety immersive style which, while owing much to modernism\u2019s \u201cstream\u2011of-consciousness\u201d, might, more accurately, be termed \u201cstream-of\u2011 existence\u201d instead.</p> <p>\u2022 Eimear McBride will discuss <em>A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing</em> at a Guardian Book Club event in London on 29 September.

  "<h2>\u2018Trump is our wakeup call\u2019 </h2> <p><strong>Raul Rodriguez, 74, Apple Valley, California</strong></p> <p>I always carry a bullhorn with me to rallies and campaign events. Into it I shout: \u201cAmerica, wake up!\u201d Americans have been asleep for way too long. We need to realise that the future of our country is at stake.</p> <p>If we don\u2019t elect Donald Trump, we\u2019ll get another four years of Barack Obama and frankly, I don\u2019t know what would happen to this wonderful country of ours. Obama has already done so much to destroy our way of life and Hillary Clinton is promising to carry on where he left off. Like Obama, she wants to change our fundamental values \u2013 the ones people like my father fought to defend.</p> <p>My father was born in Durango, Mexico. When he came to the US he joined the military and served as a medic during the second world war. He was a very proud American \u2013 he truly loved this country. I think I got my sense of patriotism from him.</p> <p>Obama and Hillary Clinton want to have open borders. They let illegal immigrants cross our borders and now they want to accept thousands of Syrians. We don\u2019t know who these people are. If they want to come to this country, they have to do it the right way, like my father did it.</p> <p>I\u2019m tired of politicians telling voters what they want to hear and then returning to Washington and doing whatever their party tells them to do. Politicians are supposed to represent the people \u2013 not their parties or their donors.</p> <p>Part of the reason I like Donald Trump is because he isn\u2019t an established politician. Sometimes that hurts him and people get offended. But the truth hurts. Even if he doesn\u2019t say it well, he\u2019s not wrong. Trump is our wakeup call.</p> <h2>\u2018Democrats treat Latinos as if we\u2019re all one big group\u2019 </h2> <p><strong>Ximena Barreto, 31, San Diego, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1664391d889268076782028fc18866ab4329dab0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1664391d889268076782028fc18866ab4329dab0/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ximena Barreto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ximena Barreto</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edoardo Delille and Giulia Piermartiri/Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was in primary school in my native Colombia when my father was murdered. I was six \u2013 just one year older than my daughter is now. My father was an officer in the Colombian army at a time when wearing a uniform made you a target for narcoterrorists, Farc fighters and guerrilla groups.</p> <p>What I remember clearly from those early years is the bombing and the terror. I was so afraid, especially after my dad died. At night, I would curl up in my mother\u2019s bed while she held me close. She could not promise me that everything was going to be all right, because it wasn\u2019t true. I don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up like that.</p> <p>But when I turn on my TV, I see terrorist attacks in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-bernardino-shooting\">San Bernardino</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\">Orlando</a>. There are dangerous people coming across our borders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> was right. Some are rapists and criminals, but some are good people, too. But how do we know who is who, when you come here illegally?</p> <p>I moved to the US in 2006 on a work permit. It took nearly five years and thousands of dollars to become a US citizen. I know the process is not perfect, but it\u2019s the law. Why would I want illegals coming in when I had to go through this? It\u2019s not fair that they\u2019re allowed to jump the line and take advantage of so many benefits, ones that I pay for with my tax dollars.</p> <p>People assume that because I\u2019m a woman, I should vote for the woman; or that because I\u2019m Latina, I should vote for the Democrat. <a href=\"https://www.democrats.org/\">The Democrats</a> have been pandering to minorities and women for the last 50 years. They treat Latinos as if we\u2019re all one big group. I\u2019m Colombian \u2013 I don\u2019t like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariachi\">Mariachi</a> music. Donald Trump is not just saying what he thinks people want to hear, he\u2019s saying what they\u2019re afraid to say. I believe that he\u2019s the only candidate who can make America strong and safe again.</p> <h2>\u2018Trump beat the system: what\u2019s more American than that?\u2019 <br></h2> <p><strong>Bertran Usher, 20, Inglewood, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c9a789c6ba6d2e81ecc85d4e5b9a044fd800a721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a789c6ba6d2e81ecc85d4e5b9a044fd800a721/0_0_6861_4579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bertran Usher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bertran Usher, centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edoardo Delille and Giulia Piermartiri/Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump is the candidate America deserves. For decades, Americans have bemoaned politicians and Washington insiders. We despise political speak and crave fresh, new ideas. When you ask for someone with no experience, this is what you get. It\u2019s like saying you don\u2019t want a doctor to operate on you.</p> <p>But Trump is a big FU to America. He beat the system and proved everyone wrong. What\u2019s more American than that?</p> <p>As a political science student who one day hopes to go into politics, I am studying this election closely. Both candidates are deeply unpopular and people of my generation are not happy with their choices. I believe we can learn what not to do from this election. I see how divided the country is, and it\u2019s the clearest sign that politicians will have to learn to work together to make a difference. It\u2019s not always easy, but I\u2019ve seen this work.</p> <p>I was raised in a multicultural household. My mother, a Democrat, is Latino and African American, raised in the inner city of Los Angeles. My father, a Republican, is an immigrant from Belize. My parents and I don\u2019t always see eye to eye on everything, but our spirited debates have helped add nuance to my politics.</p> <p>I\u2019m in favour of small government, but I support gay rights. I believe welfare is an important service for Americans who need it, but I think our current programme needs to be scaled back. I think we need to have stricter enforcement of people who come to the country illegally, but I don\u2019t think we should deport the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act\">DREAMers</a> [children of immigrants who were brought to the country illegally, named after the 2001 Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act].</p> <p>Trump can be a nut, but I think he\u2019s the best candidate in this election. Though there are issues of his I disagree with, at least he says what\u2019s on his mind, as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, who hides what she\u2019s thinking behind her smile.</p> <p>It\u2019s up to my generation to fix the political mess we\u2019re in. I plan to be a part of the solution.</p> <h2>\u2018Trump\u2019s The Art Of The Deal inspired me to be a businessman\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Omar Navarro, 27, Torrance, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d2c10107b422012528f905574268315705f19a45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2c10107b422012528f905574268315705f19a45/0_0_7207_4810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Navarro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I was a kid, people would ask what I wanted to be when I grew up. I would tell them: I want to be president of the United States. If that doesn\u2019t work out, I want to be a billionaire like Trump.</p> <p>In a way, I supported him long before he announced he was running for president. He was my childhood hero. I read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trump-Art-Deal-Tony-Schwartz/dp/0345479173\">The Art Of The Deal</a> as a student; it inspired me to become a businessman. Now I own a small business and am <a href=\"http://www.omarnavarro.com/\">running for Congress</a> in California\u2019s 43rd district.</p> <p>Trump built an empire and a strong brand that\u2019s recognisable all around the world; he\u2019s a household name and a world-class businessman. Almost anywhere you go, you can see the mark of Donald Trump on a building or property. When I see that, I see the American Dream.</p> <p>Some people ask me how I can support Donald Trump as the son of a Mexican and Cuban immigrants. They are categorising me. In this country we label people: Hispanic, African American, Asian, Caucasian. We separate and divide people into social categories based on race, ethnicity, gender and creed. To me, this is a form of racism. I\u2019m proud of my Hispanic heritage but I\u2019m an American, full stop.</p> <p>Like all immigrants, my parents came to this country for a better opportunity. But they did it legally. They didn\u2019t cut the line. They assimilated to the American way of life, learned English and opened small businesses.</p> <p>Why should we allow people to skirt the law? Imagine making a dinner reservation and arriving at the restaurant to find out that another family has been seated at your table. How is that fair?</p> <p>We have to have laws and as a country we must enforce those laws. A society without laws is just anarchy. If someone invited you to their house and asked you to remove your shoes would you keep them on? If we don\u2019t enforce the rules, why would anyone respect them? I believe Donald Trump will enforce the rules.</p> <h2>\u2018He has taken a strong stand against abortion\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Jimena Rivera, 20, student at the University of Texas at Brownsville</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"866ac5439ecdffc7b9ae72c603c3cfe422767c31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/866ac5439ecdffc7b9ae72c603c3cfe422767c31/0_178_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimena Rivera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m Mexican, so I don\u2019t have a vote, but I support Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who opposes abortion. He may have wavered in the beginning, but since becoming the nominee he has taken a strong stand against abortion.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is running as the leader of a party that has pushed a very pro-choice platform. Even Democrats like her running mate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/tim-kaine-vice-president-hillary-clinton-2016-campaign\">Tim Kaine</a>, who is a devout Catholic, compromise their faith to support abortion.</p> <p>I don\u2019t always agree with his positions on immigration. I see the border wall every day. I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s effective. The people who want to cross will find a way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that they do, but most of them are looking for a better way of life. A wall won\u2019t stop them.</p> <h2>\u2018Lower taxes and less regulation will create more jobs\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Marissa Desilets, 22, Palm Springs, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"450c2f014822304e0e943cdc41fd5278e5d94229\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450c2f014822304e0e943cdc41fd5278e5d94229/0_0_7236_4829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Desilets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am a proud Hispanic conservative Republican woman. I became politically engaged as a political science and economics major at university. By my junior year, I was a member of the campus Republicans\u2019 club. As a student of economics, I am very impressed with Trump\u2019s economic agenda. I believe we must cut taxes for everyone and eliminate the death tax. Lowering taxes and reeling back regulations will create more jobs \u2013 meaning more tax-paying Americans. This in turn will generate more revenue for the Treasury.</p> <p>I also support Trump because he favours strong leadership and promised to preserve the constitution of the United States. We must have a rule of law in this country. We must close our open borders. Like Trump says: \u201ca nation without borders is not a nation.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean we should not allow any immigrants. We should welcome new immigrants who choose to legally enter our beautiful country.</p> <p>This won\u2019t be the case if Hillary Clinton becomes president. I would expect the poor to become poorer and our country to become divided. I believe that liberals\u2019 reckless domestic spending will bankrupt our future generations. I refuse to support a party that desires to expand the government and take away my civil liberties.</p> <h2>\u2018He has gone through so many divorces, yet raised such a close-knit family\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Dr Alexander Villicana, 80, Pasadena, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a199d0bc6e8382d4633334ad670f81924eb8a0df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a199d0bc6e8382d4633334ad670f81924eb8a0df/0_0_6867_4583/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Alexander Villicana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am an example of the opportunities this country has to offer. My parents came from Mexico at the turn of the 20th century. They were not educated but they worked hard to make a better life for us and it paid off.</p> <p>I went to school and studied cosmetic surgery. Now I work as a plastic surgeon and have been in practice for the last 40 years. I have a beautiful family and my health. I am Hispanic \u2013 but I am a citizen of the United States and I feel very patriotic for this country that has given me so much.</p> <p>I\u2019m supporting Trump because I agree with his vision for our economy. He has experience at the negotiating table, so he knows what to do to create jobs and increase workers\u2019 salaries. In Trump\u2019s America people would be rewarded for their hard work rather than penalised with hefty taxes.</p> <p>The security of our nation is a top priority for me. I think it would be impossible to deport 11 million people who are here illegally, but we have to do a better job of understanding who is in our country and who is trying to come into our country.</p> <p>A lot of what Trump says, especially about security and immigration, is twisted by the media. What he said about Mexicans, for example, that wasn\u2019t negative \u2013 it was the truth. There are Mexicans bringing over drugs and perpetrating rapes. But what he also said \u2013 and the media completely ignored \u2013 is that many Mexicans are good people coming over for a better quality of life.</p> <p>He may be blunt and occasionally offensive but I find him likable. I was so impressed by Trump and his family at the <a href=\"http://convention.gop/\">Republican National Convention</a>. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine that someone who has gone through so many divorces has managed to raise such a close-knit family. None of his children had to work and yet they spoke with eloquence and integrity about their father.</p> <h2>\u2018When Trump is harsh about Mexicans, he is right\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Francisco Rivera, 43, Huntington Park, California</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3639ceafcf54195ed84c6a79ce56a6a7466e6694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3639ceafcf54195ed84c6a79ce56a6a7466e6694/0_0_6675_4455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francisco Rivera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>People ask me how I can support Donald Trump. I say, let me tell you a story. I was in line at the movie theatre recently when I saw a young woman toss her cupcake into a nearby planter as if it were a trash can. I walked over to her and said, \u201cHoney, excuse me, does that look like a garbage can to you?\u201d And you know what she told me? \u201cThere\u2019s already trash in the planter, so what does it matter?\u201d</p> <p>I asked her what part of Mexico she was from. She seemed surprised and asked how I knew she was from Mexico. \u201cLook at what you just did,\u201d I told her. \u201cDonald Trump may sound harsh when he speaks about Mexicans, but he is right. It\u2019s people like you that make everyone look bad.\u201d</p> <p>I moved from Mexico with my family when I was seven. I still carry a photo of my brother and I near our home, to remind people how beautiful the city once was. Now I spend my time erasing graffiti from the walls and picking up trash. Sixty years ago, we accepted immigrants into our country who valued the laws, rules and regulations that made America the land of opportunity. Back in those days, people worked hard to improve themselves and their communities.</p> <p>I\u2019m tired of living in a lawless country. It\u2019s like we put a security guard at the front door, but the Obama administration unlocked the back door. And I have seen what my own people have done to this country. They want to convert America into the country they left behind. This country has given me so many opportunities I wouldn\u2019t have had if my mom had raised her family in Mexico. I want America to be great again, and that\u2019s why in November I am going to vote for Donald Trump.</p> <h2>\u2018I voted for Obama twice, but Hillary gets a free pass\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Teresa Mendoza, 44, Mesa, Arizona</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"18bd81334319772adbf229a3b1f8926ccb313c41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18bd81334319772adbf229a3b1f8926ccb313c41/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teresa Mendoza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In my day job I am a real estate agent but every now and then I dabble in standup comedy.

You can\u2019t say \u201cHand me the black crayon\u201d without someone snapping back at you: \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Donald Trump offended a lot of people when he gave the speech calling [Mexicans] rapists and criminals but he didn\u2019t offend me.</p> <p>I was a liberal Democrat all my life. Before this I voted for Obama twice. I wanted to be a part of history. If it wasn\u2019t for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act\">Obamacare</a> and the ridiculous growth of our federal government, I\u2019d probably still be a Democrat, asleep at the wheel. But I woke up and realised I\u2019m actually much more in line with Republicans on major policy points.</p> <p>I like to joke that I\u2019m an original anchor baby. My parents came from Mexico in the 1970s under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracero_program\">Bracero work programme</a> making me a California-born Chicana.

The networks sensationalise and vilify Trump while they give Hillary Clinton a free pass. It amazes me. I don\u2019t care if Trump likes to eat his fried chicken with a fork and a knife.

  "<p>In 1777 the 23-year-old Polish-German naturalist <a href=\"http://common-place.org/book/a-radical-intellectual-with-captain-cook-george-forsters-world-voyage/\" title=\"\">George Forster</a> published his landmark work, <em>A&#xa0;Voyage Around the World in his&#xa0;Britannic Majesty\u2019s Sloop the&#xa0;Resolution, Commanded by Captain James Cook</em>. The book was a&#xa0;hit, and stands today as a defining work of travel literature, anthropology and even ethnomusicology, as Forster was the first to notate the folk songs of the South Sea Islands.</p> <p>The problem was that Cook\u2019s own account had yet to appear in print. The official version came out six weeks later, and AN Wilson\u2019s novel imagines how contrite Forster became, in later life, for having produced his spoiler: \u201cIt now amazes me that I had the gall, the sheer cheek, to write my <em>Voyage</em> book. I wrote it fast. We finished it before Cook. It sold well \u2013 only now do I see how justifiably angry the Captain must have been! I\u2019d done more than jump the gun. I\u2019d violated him.\u201d</p> <p>Violation of Captain Cook\u2019s reputation is nothing new. Just this summer, a statue of the explorer was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/31/captain-cook-statues-defaced-in-nz-amid-calls-for-maori-chiefs-to-take-his-place\" title=\"\">repeatedly defaced in the town of Gisborne, New Zealand</a>, and a social media campaign denounced him as crooked and a murderer. Cook sailed into Gisborne\u2019s Poverty Bay in 1769, making the first contact between Maori and Europeans. Forster was not present on that voyage, but he was engaged as a botanist aboard the Resolution on Cook\u2019s expedition of 1772-75, which crossed the Antarctic Circle in fruitless search of the inhabitable land mass believed to lie further south than Australia.</p> <p>Cook took a rather dim view of scientists, whom he tended to consider a necessary evil rather than an inexpendable part of a voyage of discovery. Forster gained his berth on the Resolution as assistant to his father, Reinhold, who was a late replacement for Joseph Banks, the aristocratic botanist who accompanied Cook on his first voyage, and whose celebrity tended to eclipse the captain\u2019s own. Banks had been axed due to a&#xa0;list of demands that had grown to include a fully equipped laboratory, a transvestite valet and two horn players for his personal entertainment.</p> <p>What Cook had not bargained for was that Reinhold Forster would turn out to be an even greater pain in the poop deck than his predecessor. Wilson derives great entertainment from particularising the pedantry of Forster senior, nicknamed the \u201ctactless philosopher\u201d, whose \u201clust for knowledge was&#xa0;a twofold thing, everlastingly co-existent with the pleasure of putting another in the wrong\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59f9cf39af4991b835727bc3f9f9918987543435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59f9cf39af4991b835727bc3f9f9918987543435/0_0_2480_3240/765.jpg\" alt=\"Johann Reinhold Forster and his son George in a wood engraving c1772.\" width=\"765\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johann Reinhold Forster and son George in a wood engraving c1772.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cook, by comparison, emerges as the epitome of a self-determined Yorkshireman, characterised by long, impenetrable silences: \u201cThe Captain was a taciturn fellow, and had a Boswell or a&#xa0;Plato been commissioned to write down the table talk of the hero they would not have covered half a page.\u201d</p> <p>That Wilson is able to cover considerably more is due to the fact that his novel is only tangentially about Cook, and focuses on the wider career of George Forster, whose time in the South Pacific and revolutionary Europe reads like the&#xa0;stuff of fiction. He grew up in, of all places, Warrington, where his father taught at&#xa0;the dissenting academy and was succeeded by, of all people, Jean Paul Marat. A decade after sailing with Cook, Forster became a fervent supporter of the French Revolution, and in the final third, the novel turns into a gripping espionage tale involving covert negotiations with the British on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/12/robespierre-revolutionary-peter-mcphee-review\" title=\"\">Robespierre</a>.</p> <p>Yet the most vivid scenes are those that reflect the misery of a buttoned-up adolescent, under the tyrannical sway of his father, undertaking the voyage of&#xa0;a lifetime but forbidden to enjoy it: \u201cWhile nearly every man aboard the Resolution bathed in the blue water and gambolled with the island beauties, George had sat with his thick woollen stockings, buckled shoes, cotton shirt, worsted vest and coat, drawing the Tahitian flora.\u201d</p> <p>Condemned to a loveless marriage, Forster must have found it all the more&#xa0;galling that his descriptions of the Pacific islands had an entirely unintended effect. \u201cWhen he published his <em>Voyage</em> it was appreciated not only as a travel book but as a variety of erotica \u2026 Common sense, John Locke and empiricism met with physical passion, papayas and coconuts.\u201d A telling passage features an audience with Boswell, the&#xa0;great biographer\u2019s tongue practically on the floor as he implores Forster to expand on his observations of \u201cbrown boobies\u201d.</p> <p>Wilson is a great biographer and a fine novelist, andhis book is as much a factual account of Forster\u2019s life as a piece of historical fiction. He acknowledges that readers of Forster\u2019s <em>Voyage</em> \u201cwill know that I have not invented very much in this novel\u201d. Yet this is one of those astonishing lives that requires little in the way of embellishment. Wilson\u2019s achievement is to impart a&#xa0;restrained imaginative power that makes its extremes seem credible.</p> <p>\u2022To order Resolution for \u00a312.99 (RRP \u00a316.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/resolution-426854.html\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

If you hear the phrase \u201cIt was beyond words\u201d, you can bet it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>I\u2019m a morning person. After a shower (I should have meditated), I crunch breakfast, slurp tea, feel rested. I begin work with an attempt to write an original description of dawn in fewer than 140 characters. It takes between 15 minutes and three hours each day. This morning it took 90 minutes. I sat by the computer at 6.15am and by 7.30am I got it:</p> <blockquote> <p>A pause between end &amp; applause<br>To the Valkyries\u2019 delight<br>A graceful bow from darkness<br>A standing ovation of light</p> </blockquote> <p>I pressed send. This summer, in the Royal Albert Hall, I presented a Ten Pieces<em> </em>Prom with Naomi Wilkinson, Dion Dublin, Dan Starkey and Leah Boleto. Alpesh Chauhan conducted the BBC Philarmonic and one of the pieces was \u201cThe Ride of the Valkyries\u201d.</p> <p>I am fascinated by that moment, the magical one caught between the end of a performance and the beginning of the applause, where there is nothing but electricity in the air. It\u2019s like dawn, the pause suspended between the certainty of night and the unknowable day ahead. I sit after pressing send. My splayed hands hover above the keyboard. An artist doesn\u2019t need to suffer to create, but if he doesn\u2019t create he will suffer. The day begins.</p> <p>My description of dawn goes out as a Tweet and on Facebook. At 8.15am I arrive at my favourite cafe in Angel, North London. I continue a script for a BBC Radio 4 programme about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobmarley\">Bob Marley</a>. By 11.30 I am being interviewed for a documentary, and then it\u2019s back to Hackney for more filming.</p> <p>I go for lunch with my agent in Soho \u2013 a long lunch during which we talk projects, gossip and all the good stuff. By 5pm I am back in Angel at the cafe. I continue working on a different script until 7pm. I\u2019ll be recording it at the BBC next week, for a series called <em>Origin Stories</em>.</p> <p>In the evening I get my book face on and begin <em>De Profundis and Other Writings </em>by Oscar Wilde in preparation for my reading of <em>De Profundis</em> at Reading prison, where he was once an inmate.

Everybody is under pressure.</p> <p>At the weekend, I took a call about 20 people fighting in the street. The caller said they had seen someone run past with a gun. It\u2019s the sort of thing my team responds to. It could well have been them who went to the scene \u2013 an officer down without me.

  "<p>As a well-adjusted middle-aged man, I like to define myself by the things I don\u2019t have. I don\u2019t have a scarlet Lamborghini or a conspicuous tattoo or a 22-year-old girlfriend to jumpstart my libido. Nor do I possess a penchant for extreme sports or expensive psychotherapy. Midway through my fifth decade, I\u2019ve avoided the obvious pitfalls and reckon I\u2019m coping quite well, which is why I am on my way to discuss the male midlife crisis with the therapist <a href=\"http://andrewgmarshall.com/\">Andrew G Marshall</a>, who has written <a href=\"http://andrewgmarshall.com/book/its-not-a-midlife-crisis-its-an-opportunity-how-to-be-forty-or-fifty-something-without-going-off-the-rails/\">a book on the subject</a>. It\u2019s a task that requires a cool and dispassionate eye. We will be like two doctors, I decide, objectively diagnosing the problems of others.</p> <p>Inside his therapy room, Marshall directs me to an armchair and stoops to pour out some water. First impressions could hardly be more reassuring: Marshall is a soothing, sober man in colourful clothes. He asks about my background and my health, moving from my childhood to my present circumstances. I respond as honestly as I can, still confident I\u2019ll be given the all-clear. I tell him I sailed past my 40th birthday with no problem at all. After that, admittedly, there was a difficult spell, one that lasted perhaps four years. I list all the things that happened. I tell him that my relationship broke down and I moved out of my home. I tell him my best friend died suddenly, which threw me for a loop. I mention that my father fell ill. Oh, and that I also got married. I tell him that I then had a second child to set alongside my 11-year-old daughter from the previous relationship. I tell him I quit my job and quit London, and that we now live out west. I tell him I think that\u2019s about it, although there might be some stuff I\u2019ve forgotten. But by now I\u2019m out of breath, shaken. Recited as a list, those past four years sound positively existential.</p> <p>Marshall jots notes in his pad. He asks who I turned to for help during this difficult period. I tell him I didn\u2019t really turn to anybody: I went through the worst parts alone. Why would I want to have people seeing me as a mess?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cYou belonging to what we nowadays call the metropolitan elite. Most of my clients, by your age, have had at least three therapists. Whereas you went through this incredible period and not only did you not seek professional help, you actually detached yourself from your friends.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lots of people flunk the test. They anaesthetise themselves \u2013 with drink, generally. Or computer games, or porn. Or work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I nod dutifully, and yet something he said has already stuck in my craw. I don\u2019t consider myself part of the metropolitan elite, and I\u2019m annoyed that he would blithely stick me in that box. Nor, for that matter, am I convinced I\u2019ve had a midlife crisis, despite the bald evidence of those torrid four years. But that\u2019s the nature of cliche. We may see ourself as one thing, unique and specific; the world sees us as another \u2013 as a social demographic or a cluster of symptoms.</p> <p>Marshall\u2019s own interest is based on both personal and professional experience. His partner died when he was in his late 30s and this pitched him into what he describes as \u201cthe bleakest period of my life\u201d. Meanwhile, all around, his patients were navigating a similar set of hurdles. The Office for National Statistics reports that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/02/middle-aged-people-least-happy-most-anxious-ons-wellbeing-report\">40- to 59-year-olds are the most anxious age group</a>. Marshall believes this anxiety is sparked by a sudden awareness of mortality and a fear of failure; the nagging, nightmarish sense that we will never fulfil our true potential.</p> <p>No one wants to own up to a midlife crisis: the condition is redolent of too many bad jokes. On setting out to write his new book, Marshall even deliberated before putting the term in the title, concerned that the mere mention might scare readers away. Finally, he opted for a cunning disguise, referencing the condition while denying its existence. The book is called <a href=\"http://andrewgmarshall.com/book/its-not-a-midlife-crisis-its-an-opportunity-how-to-be-forty-or-fifty-something-without-going-off-the-rails/\">It\u2019s Not A Midlife Crisis, It\u2019s An Opportunity</a>, subhead: \u201cHow To Be Forty- Or Fifty-Something Without Going Off The Rails\u201d.</p> <p>Marshall has seen many casualties in his time \u2013 people who, when faced with the challenges of middle age, promptly crash and burn. \u201cA lot of people flunk the test,\u201d he says. \u201cThey anaesthetise themselves \u2013 with drink, generally. Or with computer games, or pornography. Or with work. And if you don\u2019t answer the questions, you become bitter, closed off and cynical.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fail and you suffer an L-shaped life, you plummet and flatline. Pass, and win the U-shaped life: a brilliant late bloom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I start to wonder whether I flunked the test. Marshall certainly seems to think I was guilty of closing myself off. He says, \u201cI\u2019m getting a very strong message that you\u2019re not allowed to be vulnerable. That you need to be loved, yet, when things get difficult, you withdraw from everybody. It\u2019s a strange dichotomy. Because on the one hand you\u2019re an open book in a rather controlled way, in that you\u2019re a journalist and therefore in charge of the words. But the rest of you is completely closed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I was completely closed,\u201d I say. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want people to see me in disarray.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cbut that\u2019s completely closed. You only wanted people to see the mask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cFine.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, actually, it\u2019s not fine: his whole premise is bullshit. Look at us here. Look at what we are doing. Almost shouting, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous thing, you saying I\u2019m closed. I\u2019m going to write this bloody session up for everybody to read.\u201d</p> <p>Marshall smiles, unperturbed. \u201cYes, well,\u201d he says. \u201cOften in the second half of our lives, we have to do all of the things we didn\u2019t do in the first.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The term \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d was coined in 1965 by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Jaques\">Canadian psychologist Elliott Jaques</a>. Marshall believes the label has now outlived its usefulness. He prefers to call it \u201cthe midlife passage\u201d. Approached in the right spirit, he says, this is a chance to engage with the big questions: who am I? What are my values? What gives my life meaning? You can meet your true self. You can become your own person.</p> <p>Marshall has devised exercises to smooth our progress. He describes a simple counting meditation to reduce anxiety, explains how to \u201crecord your feelings\u201d, and the events that trigger them. He also invites us to chart the highs and lows of our lives on a graph, moving from infancy through to middle age. I try this last one myself. The line leaps and dips with abandon. It makes my life look like a series of cardiac arrests.</p> <p>The way Marshall tells it, there are three obvious routes through the midlife passage. Fail the challenge, and you suffer what he describes as an L-shaped life, where you plummet to Earth and then essentially flatline until death. Pass the test, and you win the U-shaped life: a glorious upswing, a brilliant late bloom. Then there is the third option, the joker in the pack, the switchback ride of the W-shaped life. This occurs when you reach for the quick-fix solution (the thrilling affair, the scarlet Lamborghini), or what Marshall calls \u201cthe myth of the great other\u201d. The effect can be instant, galvanic. But it\u2019s an artificial high, a dead cat bounce that leads only to more heartache.</p> <p>Naturally, this makes me wonder about my own circumstances. The storm has passed; I have a new life in a new city. My days are a whirl of nappy changes and country rambles, augmented with odds and sods of semi-regular work. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not an L-shaped life. But is it a W or is it a U?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is the midlife crisis a first-world problem? Marshall disagrees: \u2018It\u2019s intrinsic in mankind. It hits you over the head\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Out of the blue, I find myself telling Marshall about a man named Miroslav Novotny. I think he\u2019s originally from the Czech Republic; he speaks rudimentary English. I picture Miroslav Novotny as something out of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hopper\">Edward Hopper</a> painting, a study in urban loneliness. He wears his trousers too high on his waist. He uses too much hair tonic, smokes discount cigarettes. I explain that my wife and I devised a game we would play when driving the outskirts of south London, in which we work out where Novotny would most like to live. So we place him in that impersonal block of flats out by the A20, or eating egg and chips inside some sad greasy spoon. Novotny, of course, does not exist \u2013 we made him up \u2013 yet the uncomfortable truth is that he\u2019s the alternative me. He asks nothing of anyone and gives nothing in return.</p> <p>All at once, I can see it clearly. \u201cIf I had taken a different route out of all this, I\u2019d be Miroslav Novotny,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not. But there\u2019s a certain comfort in being Miroslav Novotny.\u201d</p> <p>Marshall nods. He says, \u201cLife is small but it\u2019s safe.\u201d And I nod back in relief, because that\u2019s it exactly.</p> <p>Did I have a midlife crisis, I ask Marshall.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d He adds that it is not always advisable to throw absolutely everything in the air, as I seem to have done. But that\u2019s by the by. Stable door, horse bolted. \u201cYou have been through it and navigated it and have had a reasonably soft landing.\u201d</p> <p>He asks if I have any further questions. So I ask whether he sees the midlife crisis as a peculiarly first-world problem, a kind of luxury accessory afforded to those with too much time on their hands. I\u2019m not sure you have one if you\u2019re under siege in Aleppo.</p> <p>Marshall has his doubts. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of having too much time on your hands,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt comes with a great mallet and hits you over the head. So I think it\u2019s something intrinsic in mankind. The first world-third world distinction is the wrong idea.\u201d</p> <p>My second question is more personal: I ask if he believes it\u2019s possible to be both horribly anxious and basically happy, because that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been feeling for the past year or so.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I think you can,\u201d he answers. \u201cBut if we were to continue working together, the anxiety is something we would be looking at. I think that anxiety and anger could be the keynotes for you.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019ve done the work of the middle passage, then you\u2019re in a very good place, the sunny uplands of life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is keen to accentuate the positive, though. \u201cIt sounds to me like you have completely transformed your life. You\u2019ve gone from closed to open. From work focused to family focused. From self-sufficient to more connected. From the small world of\u2026</p> <p>\u201cMiroslav Novotny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom the small world of Miroslav Novotny to the larger world of family and children and a new city. But the anxiety is something I would be working on. Anxiety and depression are like brother and sister.\u201d</p> <p>I walk back to the tube in something of a daze. I feel as though I\u2019ve spent the past 90 minutes being dangled upside down by the ankles, watching all the detritus falling from my pockets. Some of this clutter was harmless ephemera, but other bits were jagged and rusted. Some were foul-smelling, some smeared with dried blood. With them gone, I feel lighter.</p> <p>***</p> <p>One month later, I meet Marshall again, this time in a bookshop above a cafe. It\u2019s late August, and the therapist is on holiday. He\u2019s bare-kneed in tan shorts, with a natty straw hat perched on his pink scalp, a copy of Graham Swift\u2019s Waterland parked in the crook of one arm. Seeing him here is slightly disconcerting, like bumping into a teacher away from school.</p> <p>He asks how I\u2019ve been and I assure him I\u2019m fine. I tell him, in fact, that I\u2019ve been suspiciously fine. I\u2019ve started to wonder whether the session itself was a kind of quick fix. I worry I painted myself in too positive a light; I worry he moved too quickly to endorse my depiction. This would normally be about a six-month process. We went through it in about 90 minutes flat.</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Marshall agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best way of doing it, so you have to be careful. I mean, if I had been aware of some really horrible stuff, I would have skated over it, because I don\u2019t want to open up that can of worms. If we saw there was a total car crash in the wings, I might well have acknowledged it \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t go up and peer through the window.</p> <p>\u201cBut, happily, there wasn\u2019t. And even if there was, I had the sense you\u2019d come through it relatively unscathed.\u201d</p> <p>I feel I\u2019ve made peace with my crisis, but what comes next? I want to know what other hurdles I\u2019m going to face in my 50s, to steer clear of more trouble, if I can.</p> <p>But the therapist grins. He\u2019s in holiday mode. \u201cWhat comes next? Well, wonderful times. If you\u2019ve done the work of the middle passage, then you\u2019re in a very good place, the sunny uplands of life. The next question is not what gives your life meaning, but what gives meaning to everyone\u2019s life. It\u2019s a more spiritual inquiry: the self versus the infinite.\u201d Another grin. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure whether therapy is the right place to answer those questions. You may need to roll up your sleeves and go and do it yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The house where I now live is perched high on a hill, a steep 15-minute climb from the nearest train station. I try to make this journey on foot as often as I can (if I\u2019m losing my hair, I figure I can at least shed some weight along with it). Sometimes I wonder how I must look to the motorists driving by. A sweaty, middle-aged man with a red face and bad posture, sometimes pushing hard at a buggy for added comedy value. The man is a wreck. Every step\u2019s an ordeal. But near the top of the hill, the road swings out from the shadows. The city drops away and the horizon is endless. And this, I decide, is my favourite part of the journey. One might almost be entering the sunny uplands of life, approaching a house that feels very nearly like home.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://andrewgmarshall.com/book/its-not-a-midlife-crisis-its-an-opportunity-how-to-be-forty-or-fifty-something-without-going-off-the-rails/\">It\u2019s Not A Midlife Crisis, It\u2019s An Opportunity</a> is published by Marshall Method Publishing at \u00a312.99.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>It\u2019s September, which means \u2013 exciting! \u2013 it\u2019s fashion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/07/groundhog-day-perfect-comedy-for-ever\">Groundhog Day</a> again. This consists of fashion weeks starting up, followed swiftly by the announcement of a political initiative to protect women against this evil on the catwalk. (Another feature of fashion Groundhog Day, incidentally, is a slew of articles by male columnists expressing bafflement at why the models are so thin, which can be summed up as: \u201cI don\u2019t find this sexy, so why?!\u201d However would we know how to look without men telling us what turns them on?)</p> <p>Anyway, the latest initiative comes courtesy of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/womens-equality-party\">Women\u2019s Equality party</a>, which has launched a campaign demanding, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/04/minimum-bmi-checks-uk-models-womens-equality-party\">that British designers and retailers stop using size zero clothes in shows and photoshoots</a>. This, the WEP claims, \u201cwill tackle negative body image issues and eating disorders\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to ignore the all-too-predictable connection between fashion models and eating disorders here, because I\u2019ve written enough for this lifetime about how absurdly reductive it is to suggest that a mental illness is caused by Vogue. Instead, I\u2019ll say this: the WEP is perfectly within its rights to address this issue, but \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 it will not make a blind bit of difference. There have been efforts to legislate against fashion\u2019s obsession with skinniness in the past; these laws, wherever they\u2019re passed, always get a lot of play, because the media love a story that allows them to run a&#xa0;photo of a skinny model at least as much&#xa0;as the fashion industry likes the skinny model herself.</p> <p>So it would be understandable if you were confused as to why things haven\u2019t changed. The problem is not only that the laws are rarely enforced, but also that they are the equivalent of rearranging the Titanic\u2019s deck chairs. For a start, fashion is too international for one country\u2019s legislation to make a difference \u2013 especially, I\u2019m sorry to say, when it\u2019s this country doing the legislating. With the exception of Burberry, British-based fashion companies simply do not spend enough on international advertising for any laws to have an effect; the rest of the world won\u2019t even see the photographs. Slapping legislation on a tiny British brand will not change the aesthetic if&#xa0;Chanel and Prada can carry on as before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/13/hillary-clinton-parks-and-recreation-hadley-freeman\">Don't like Hillary Clinton? You need to watch Parks And Recreation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While fashion represents the connection between skinniness and perfection in its purest form, it is also the end point. By the time a&#xa0;woman is looking at fashion photography, she\u2019ll have gone through years of indoctrination that the less of her there is, the better. It\u2019s there in all the children\u2019s books and films, in which the evil women are plump and the nice ones are slender (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl\">Roald Dahl</a> is especially bad on this). It\u2019s there in pretty much every film ever made (the only person I\u2019ve interviewed with an evident eating disorder was not a model but an actress). And it\u2019s&#xa0;there in the general atmosphere of being female today, the things you grow up hearing the adult women around you saying about their bodies, the way they decline dessert. According to <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/what-we-do/research/the-good-childhood-report\">a report just published by the Children\u2019s Society</a>, teenage girls are unhappier than ever, especially with their bodies, which they compare unfavourably with those of their friends and celebrities.</p> <p>This masochistic tendency towards self\u2011erasure is a complicated issue, something a&#xa0;well\u2011meaning but overly simplistic campaign against thinness in fashion can\u2019t fix. The WEP has also suggested including body-image lessons as part of the school curriculum, which is a better idea (and, tellingly, it has had less pick-up, what with it lacking the vital excuse for a photograph of a model). But instead of fussing about the meaningless phrase \u201csize zero\u201d, or conflating thinness with anorexia, the WEP would be more effective if it looked at the prevalence of eating disorders in the fashion industry and exposed this. Instead of pretending it can tell fashion editors what to put in their magazines, the WEP could talk to them to get a more realistic sense of&#xa0;the problem, and get them on side.</p> <p>If we really want to end the association between female skinniness and female aspiration, women need to be doing this on an individual, focused level, not leaving it to politicians to act on an amorphous, collective one. Look at the way you talk about your body and what you eat, especially in front of young girls. Call out publications that condescend to larger women and feature photographs only of slim ones. Remind your female friends and your daughters that their jeans size is not a measurement of their&#xa0;personal value.</p> <p>It is easy to damn the fashion industry for promoting skinny as the feminine ideal. It\u2019s harder to admit that it is only echoing back too many of our&#xa0;own darkest thoughts, our own self-loathing.</p>",
  "<p>Sam is eight years old: unhappy at school, held back by his limited vocabulary, and guided through the world by his two thirtysomething parents. As his father, Alex, sees it, \u201cthe world is a gigantic engine that needs to function in a certain way, with predictable actions, in order to ensure [Sam\u2019s] safety. Before he can relax, he needs to know the timings and movements of everything around him, and he must have his finger on&#xa0;the off button at all times.\u201d</p> <p>This is a crisp summary of one of the basic components of autism, which sits at the heart of <em>A Boy Made of Blocks</em>, and explains why this unassuming-looking work of commercial fiction carries not just an air of zeitgeisty significance, but the sense of a missionary author who needs to tell the world about things too often misunderstood.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keithstuart\" title=\"\">Keith Stuart</a> is the Guardian\u2019s games editor. As his debut novel\u2019s brief afterword explains, he is also the father of a&#xa0;boy who was diagnosed four years ago with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/autism\" title=\"\">autism</a> spectrum disorder, or ASD. He knows intimately a reality familiar to those of us with autistic children, or friends and relatives \u201con&#xa0;the spectrum\u201d \u2013 of a society still woefully ignorant of what ASD means, serial battles with officialdom, and \u201ca&#xa0;planet of concern and confusion\u201d around which lives and relationships inevitably orbit.</p> <p>But in his case, there has been a fortuitous blessing: his work with gaming and IT in general was at first a means to commune with his son, and eventually the spark for an unforeseen flowering of enthusiasm and language. More than anything else, this was true of Minecraft, the virtual world created by&#xa0;a Swedish developer called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2015/sep/01/markus-persson-the-minecraft-billionaire-sending-lonely-late-night-tweets-from-ibiza\" title=\"\">Markus Persson</a>, and first released to the world in 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s like Lego, but set in a vast landscape you can explore and alter,\u201d Stuart explains. Minecraft has fostered a whole subculture among autistic people, because it opens up the possibility of a kind of social interaction free of the mysterious nuances and distractions of the real world.</p> <p>Stuart tells his story in the voice of&#xa0;Alex, who is enduring an uncertain separation from Sam\u2019s mother, Jody, is&#xa0;about to lose his job as a mortgage adviser and is suffering the long aftermath of a grim childhood bereavement. He is also an awkward player in a social milieu of&#xa0;young(ish) professionals in&#xa0;Bristol. Sam\u2019s autism echoes his father\u2019s psychology \u2013 \u201cPlay doesn\u2019t come easily to me,\u201d Alex admits \u2013 and also works as a counterpoint to the thirtysomething condition explored in the book, where jobs never last long, and debt is rarely far away. \u201cThere is no such thing as stability any more,\u201d one character says. \u201cI mean, the pace of life, the uncertainty of everything. You\u2019ve got to hang on somehow, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Sam and his dad, by contrast, crave stability and certainty, and in this shared predicament lies a simple insight. \u201cAutism is a kind of intense, very centred version of how we all feel, of the anxieties we all have,\u201d says Alex. In Stuart\u2019s central adult trio of Alex and his friends Dan and Matt, there are also implied shades of the realisation set out by Hans Asperger in 1944: that \u201cthe&#xa0;autistic personality is an extreme variant of male intelligence \u2026 In the autistic individual the male pattern is&#xa0;exaggerated to the extreme\u201d.</p> <p>Minecraft becomes as much a part of the action as the Bristol streetscape, as Alex and Sam set off on repeated odysseys which take in zombies, \u201ccreepers\u201d and, most of all, the creation of ever more ambitious buildings, using the titular blocks. \u201cIn this universe, where the rules are unambiguous, where the logic is clear and unerring, Sam is in control,\u201d his father says, as he marvels at his son\u2019s sudden ingenuity. The comically blocky people and animals take on a deep fascination, and the game\u2019s omnipresent piano music becomes a&#xa0;signifier for something unexpectedly&#xa0;profound \u2013 as the two of them breach&#xa0;the parameters of the game, and apply some of its lessons to everyday life.</p> <p>All this rings true. That said, in keeping with the sometimes clunky methods of Stuart\u2019s chosen genre, there are less&#xa0;credible moments, such as when characters say things like: \u201cPlease figure things out \u2013 like you should have done years ago when we were happy\u201d. The odd detour, too, threatens to make the story too sappy for its own good. But keep faith, and it really doesn\u2019t matter. <em>A Boy Made of Blocks</em> is constructed around not just a great plot (the very moving denouement, at a Minecraft contest in London, is particularly inspired), but a rare sense of&#xa0;honesty and insight. Most of all it shows how autism need not be something discrete and fenced-off: it\u2019s a condition that shines light on the most fundamental parts of being human.</p> <p>\u2022 To order A Boy Made of Blocks for \u00a310.65 (Sphere, RRP \u00a312.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/boy-made-of-blocks.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Skepta started releasing music in the early 00s, a key figure in the grime scene that emerged when London\u2019s sink estates started producing a dark, low-res reflection of the shiny UK garage that was dominating pop. After starting Meridian Crew (named after his Tottenham estate), then the Boy Better Know crew with his brother and fellow MC, Jamie \u201cJME\u201d Adenuga, Skepta became a cult underground artist. He was feted for his merciless, witty abuse of other MCs and carrying an unshakable self-determination that owed nothing to traditional musical channels in order to get his music heard.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Radio 1 doesn\u2019t exist to me.

I don\u2019t judge my success by anything they say.\u201d</p> <p>This scorn for the mainstream was exacerbated by his bruising mid-career flirtations with chart pop. Like many grime artists in the 2010s, when the industry was giddy with the bouncy chart hits of Dizzee Rascal, Tinchy Stryder and Tinie Tempah, Skepta was signed to Universal. He put out a string of singles that, while moderately successful, crowbarred him on to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVSr0tLQr_4\">vapid pop-dance beats</a>. US artists such as Puff Daddy were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOYUOgmTjU4\">brought in for guest spots</a> in an attempt to make Skepta sound like every identikit chart rapper. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e137a8ba901a32e6951d5196aa4e8f6e614d32ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e137a8ba901a32e6951d5196aa4e8f6e614d32ef/0_460_6741_4045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skepta and members of his BBK crew in Hackney, east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boy knows better...

The talent realises they\u2019ve been fucked over and come out the other side. Some of them fall off and some people come out untouchable. And I\u2019m one of the people that came out untouchable.

Free from label constraints, he replaced euphoric pop riffs with his own defiant productions: ice-cold electronic rhythms spiked with reggae bass and techno futurism, resurrecting the grime sound that made his name and releasing them on his own BBK label. It was the right move. In 2014, he let loose That\u2019s Not Me, a shot of brutal energy that atoned for every misstep he\u2019d made in the last four years in three thrilling minutes. Its video was filmed on an \u00a380 budget and <a href=\"http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/13946393.Tottenham_rapper_Skepta_wins_big_at_the_MOBOs/\">won a Mobo award</a>. His absolution was complete. Following single Shutdown nailed his anti-mainstream stance in two blunt lines: \u201cThey try to steal my vision/ This ain\u2019t a culture, it\u2019s my religion.\u201d</p> <p>From there, grime went national, aided by direct-to-fan social media. In tandem with the genre\u2019s popularity and a wealth of new MCs breaking through, Skepta\u2019s notoriety expanded outside his core London fanbase to a new audience of suburban teenagers. His internet-enabled model, where releases would be pushed through his own channels, removed the distorting effect of major-label A&amp;R opinion; grime could flourish as it pleased with no commercial interference. By summer 2015, the Boy Better Know crew were drawing as big a crowd at the Reading and Leeds festivals as they were at Wiley\u2019s underground rave Eskimo Dance. Then it went global. By the time Skepta dropped Konnichiwa earlier this year, he was playing gigs from Tokyo to Lagos.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyONbqggasY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dyONbqggasY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Basking in the heat, Skepta contemplates the album that\u2019s gunning for a Mercury win. \u201cAs a younger man, I didn\u2019t think this was possible,\u201d he says. Its instant popularity still tickles him (all the more so as Konnichiwa was distributed direct from his home, his living room doubling up as a make-do CD warehouse). \u201cLike, my album came out in May, I was on a flight to Toronto the next day to play a show, and they knew all the words to the new songs. The next day! You think when I was a kid I ever thought that would happen? I mean, Pharrell Williams is on my album! If I was on a major label I might think, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s what happens isn\u2019t it, I\u2019m signed, I\u2019ve got loads of money.\u2019 You don\u2019t even appreciate it. \u2019Cause I\u2019m independent, I wake up every day, look in the mirror, and I\u2019m like: \u2018You! You scruffy little shit from Tottenham got Pharrell on your album! I\u2019m blessed, bro.\u2019 That independent existence is scary because I don\u2019t have no certainty in my life.

Whereas some grime artists like Novelist are taking to the stage, encouraging chants of \u201cFuck David Cameron\u201d and tweeting their allegiance to the Labour Party, all that is bottom of Skepta\u2019s agenda. Last month, Tory culture secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edvaizey/status/761257407179882496\">Ed Vaizey sent Skepta and fellow rapper Kano a congratulatory tweet</a> for being nominated for a Mercury award.

Zhukov split from his first wife, Elena, a molecular biologist, when their daughter, Dasha, was three. She grew up with her mother in Los Angeles. Colleagues quoted by Kommersant newspaper describe Zhukov as understated, saying he prefers to listen in meetings, rather than talk.</p> <p>Zhukov is wealthy, but precisely how wealthy is unclear. His fortune is smaller than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/sunday-times-rich-list-simon-david-reuben-lewis-hamilton-adele\">that of his son-in-law</a>, Roman Abramovich, who is valued by Forbes at $8.1bn (\u00a36.1bn).</p> <p>Zhukov has two sons, 21-year-old twins Boris and Misha, with his second wife, a model. They both live in London. Zhukov\u2019s third wife is the socialite Svetlana Meshyanina. Facebook posts suggest that the couple enjoy a glamorous lifestyle, taking regular holidays in the south of France and Ibiza, spending time on a yacht in Italy and going skiing in the Italian Alps. Zhukov has also attended art exhibitions with Dasha.</p> <p>As well as a penthouse in Kensington, west London, Zhukov has a home in Sardinia and a 400\u00ad-acre equestrian club in the Moscow region.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a> show that the oligarch is linked to a complex network of offshore firms dating back to the 1990s.</p> <p>They include the Sintez Corporation, which appears to be linked to Zhukov\u2019s Sintez (UK) Ltd and Odessa-based oil company Eureast International SA.</p> <p>In 2009, Zhukov asked Mossack Fonseca, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/08/mossack-fonseca-law-firm-hide-money-panama-papers\">law firm at the centre</a> of the Panama Papers, to act as agent for Kentwood Investments Ltd, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>The leaders of the BVI, a tax haven known for secrecy, refused to attend an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/david-cameron-corporate-money-laundering-offence-anti-corruption-summit\">anti-\u00adcorruption summit in London</a>, held following the Panama Papers revelations.<br></p> <p>Kentgrove is a holding company for a second firm, Odisseya LLC, which owns an \u201cauto \u00adtransshipment terminal\u201d near Odessa, according to Zhukov\u2019s spokesman, Alexander Ratskevich. It is not illegal to hold companies offshore.</p> <p>The Panama Papers include emails from Zhukov\u2019s lawyers in Cyprus and Comatrans SA, a financial services company based in Geneva.</p> <p>By 2009, Zhukov and the Ukrainian oligarchs Igor Kolomoisky and Gennady Bogolyubov were embroiled in a bitter battle for control of JKX, an oil and gas company listed on the London Stock Exchange. JKX is one of the biggest non-\u00adstate-owned oil producers in Ukraine.</p> <p>Zhukov bought an 11.5% stake in the company through his BVI\u00ad-registered investment vehicle Glengary Overseas Ltd. It was claimed that he had teamed up with Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov to seize control of JKX. In 2013, a dispute with the then board of JKX spilled over into the high court.</p> <p>JKX\u2019s British managers argued that the trio were <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/inquiry-into-oligarchs-alleged-collusion-to-take-control-of-british-firm-8925792.html?origin=internalSearch\">colluding to take over the business</a> without paying \u201ca proper premium for the shares\u201d.<br></p> <p>The high court judge Mr Justice Mann said Kolomoisky had a <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2013/2631.html\">reputation for being a \u201ccorporate raider\u201d</a> , but did not determine whether the reputation was deserved or not. Bogolyubov \u201cprobably\u201d did, too, the judge said, adding that Zhukov did not \u201cseem to have had the same reputation,\u201d but had previously done business with Kolomoisky, Ukraine\u2019s second-richest man.</p> <p>The board considered that it had reasonable cause to believe that the oligarchs were acting together, Mann found. However, he said the board\u2019s purpose in its actions was improper, meaning its decisions were invalid.</p> <p>The board appealed, but the supreme court unanimously upheld Mann\u2019s decision last year. One of the supreme court justices, Lord Sumption, had previously acted as QC for Abramovich in his 2012 legal battle against the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky, with Sumption <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/aug/06/jonathan-sumption-brain-of-britain\">reportedly earning a fee of more than \u00a35m</a>.</p> <p>It has been <a href=\"http://johnhelmer.net/?p=15085\">reported</a> that, in January, Zhukov and his fellow oligarchs ousted JKX\u2019s directors and replaced them with their own nominees. A spokesman for JKX has denied any connection between the three oligarchs and JKX\u2019s second-largest shareholder, Proxima Capital Group, which achieved the changes.</p> <p>Months later, Kolomoisky\u2019s global assets were frozen after a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-22/billionaire-kolomoisky-at-center-of-380-million-asset-freeze\">separate $380m legal dispute</a> with Russian oil company Tatneft.</p> <p>The order covered Kolomoisky\u2019s French villa and other assets, following claims that he had seized control of a Ukrainian oil refinery joint venture and siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore shell companies. Bogolyubov\u2019s assets, including a house in Belgrave Square, central London, were also frozen.</p> <p>Kolomoisky dismisses the Tatneft allegations as \u201cobviously false\u201d. He has denied \u201ccolluding with anyone\u201d over JKX and being a corporate raider and said Mann did not find on this point. Kolomoisky said there were \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d for using offshore structures, not least that Ukrainian presidents use state bodies to redistribute assets when they come to power.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that a significant part of the world operates under different conditions to those in the UK,\u201d Kolomoisky said.</p> <p>Kolomoisky appears in the Panama Papers in connection with five offshore companies and a family trust. His Israeli passport also surfaces, together with that of his daughter, Angelika. Swiss bank UBS wrote the oligarch a glowing reference, saying he was a Geneva-\u00adbased citizen with an \u201cirreproachable record\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2016 to add, in relation to changes on the JKX board in January 2016, a link to a report and the denial by a JKX spokesman.<br></p>",

A 2015 electricity bill gives his address as a \u00a313m penthouse flat in Kensington, west London.</p> <p>While his daughter, Dasha, is an art collector and gallery owner, Zhukov made his fortune in oil. </p> <p>Despite keeping a low public profile, the story of his rise to wealth has been reported because of a prosecution brought against him by Italian police. </p> <p>In 2001, Zhukov was accused of being involved with mafia gangs in Ukraine and held in prison for six months. He vehemently denied the allegations and successfully defended himself. Zhukov admits meeting and doing business with some of Odessa\u2019s criminal figures, but says this was before their illegal connections became apparent.</p> <p>However, the case gave a fascinating insight into his background and the company that he kept at the time. </p> <p>In the 1990s, Zhukov co-founded <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/customs/1846-operators-of-cargo-terminal-raise-questions\">Sintez UK</a>, a company involved in shipping Russian crude oil to the port of Odessa, in Ukraine, which was <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/customs/1846-operators-of-cargo-terminal-raise-questions\">allegedly run</a> by mafia gangs at the time.</p> <p>In 1998, Italian police launched a major investigation into the Ukrainian mafia, which concluded that the problem of organised crime in Odessa was very serious, with mobsters \u201cin possession of a great quantity of weapons such as guns, machine guns and explosives\u201d.</p> <p>A report by the special police unit servizio centralo operativo includes a reference to Zhukov in a graphic. It also mentions Alexander Angert, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/09/armstrade.iantraynor\">violent Odessa godfather </a>who lives in London and still <a href=\"http://crime-ua.com/node/12378\">plays a role</a> in the city\u2019s politics. Angert\u2019s company <a href=\"http://companyformationuk.co/Officers/TRANSCARGO-LIMITED/2910507\">Transcargo</a> shared a Mayfair address with Zhukov\u2019s Sintez UK. </p> <p>Italian police arrested Zhukov at Olbia airport in Sardinia in 2001 as he was heading to his villa in nearby Porto Cervo. Detectives accused him of being part of a ring that tried to smuggle weapons from Ukraine and Belarus to the former Yugoslavia in 1994. The alleged shipment, apparently destined for Venice and hidden aboard the Jadran Express container vessel, was said to have included grenades, anti-tank weapons and 30,0000 Kalashnikovs.</p> <p>While Zhukov spent six months in prison in Turin, he was interviewed by Belgian police and later acquitted. He <a href=\"http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/441351\">told Russian newspaper Kommersant</a>: \u201cI am completely innocent of arms dealing.\u201d The court held that the underlying facts \u201cdid not exist\u201d. His lawyers said the proceedings were \u201ctotally without merit\u201d.</p> <p>According to his spokesman, Zhukov knew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/09/armstrade.iantraynor\">Angert and Leonid Minin</a>, an international arms dealer, who was one of the inspirations for Yuri Orlov, the fictional character played by Nicolas Cage in the film Lord of War.</p> <p>Minin was arrested in 2000 when police found him in a Milan hotel with four prostitutes, cocaine, $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) in cash and African diamonds worth $500m. He was convicted of drug possession and sentenced to two years in prison. </p> <p>However, Zhukov\u2019s spokesman told the Guardian that his client\u2019s oil companies were only involved in lawful arms-length \u201ccommercial transactions\u201d with Minin\u2019s firms. </p> <p>These were \u201cfully legitimate\u201d, he said, adding that Minin did not have \u201cnasty reputational issues\u201d at the time.</p> <p>Separately, Italy\u2019s parliament named Zhukov in a 464-page report into Russian organised crime in 2005. It called Zhukov an \u201cimportant member\u201d of the Solntsevskaya gang, Russia\u2019s most powerful international crime syndicate, with a base in Rome.</p> <p>Zhukov strongly denies the allegation. He has never been arrested, charged or convicted of any related offences. </p> <p>Zhukov\u2019s UK citizenship will not endear him to Russia\u2019s hawkish president, Vladimir Putin. UK-Russian relations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/russia-and-iran-delighted-at-uks-rejection-of-eu\">have been strained</a> since the murder of the former Russian secret service officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\">Alexander Litvinenko</a> in London in 2006.

Putin has called for \u201cde-offshorisation\u201d and urged rich businesspeople to bring their fortunes home.</p> <p>Since 2014, Russians are obliged to declare foreign citizenship.

Zhukov says his UK citizenship has been properly declared \u201cin accordance with law\u201d. </p> <p>Zhukov says he \u201cknows well\u201d but is not close to Gennady Trukhanov, the mayor of Odessa, who was named by Italian police as an influential member of the city\u2019s oil mafia. Trukhanov worked in the 1990s for Sintez and has also admitted knowing Minin and Angert. According to Mikheil Saakashvili, Odessa\u2019s regional governor, Angert flew into the city in 2015 on a private jet to influence the mayoral election.</p> <p>Trukhanov\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Give these green stems of thought your passionate attention, otherwise they may be dead by Christmas. Water well and weed diligently. But here\u2019s my advice on how to proceed: treat these seedlings like job applicants. You don\u2019t know who they are yet. They may seem feisty, clever or captivatingly beautiful, but are they going to offer anything original? Most important, are they likely to be inspirational companions, who will lead you to create the best work that you\u2019re capable of? WB&#xa0;Yeats\u2019s advice to writers, \u201cDo not hurry, do not rest\u201d, is&#xa0;relevant here.</p> <p>As the autumn advances, keep a vigil on the applicants. Then, you\u2019ll gradually begin to know what they\u2019re leading you towards. Are you embarking on the long road to something truthful, or just moving towards a heaving skip of recycled bullshit? The landmass of the western world is slowly being submerged by bad books. You don\u2019t want to add to this tonnage, so go slowly into your analysis of what it is you\u2019ve got to say. Does it have real emotional and intellectual grip? If so, then start gathering all the knowledge you\u2019ll need to set forth on your great writing adventure.</p> <p>Only remember that the September applicants may not fulfil their promising CVs.

It\u2019s tempting, given the limitless power of the omniscient novelist, to plunge into a character\u2019s head and write, baldly, \u201cLaura felt painfully envious\u201d. But what has&#xa0;more energy is the analysis of how a character in the grip&#xa0;of painful envy carries herself, speaks, looks, and even dresses. We always know, if we are observant, how a person who is desperately, secretly in love with another behaves. The trick of fiction is to extract the ways in which other emotions affect the outer crust, too, and by observing the&#xa0;characteristic walk of a human being overcome with happiness, say, making the reader feel observant, and not just laboriously informed.</p> <p>How this carriage affects the characters around her, too: because fiction does not amount to much if it is just one character standing in a stairwell, pondering gravely about past events. If the first lesson of fiction is about the leakage of the abstract into the world of the physical, the second ought to be that fiction is about the way one character\u2019s desires will crash into another\u2019s, and a third, and a fourth, when all that seems to be happening is four friends meeting in a pub, or working together in an office, or finding themselves thrown together by chance. The episode that consists of one person alone leads to nothing much: the episode of four different characters with their own ways of life moves in multiple directions.</p> <p>To do this, the beginning writer is going to have to undertake some systematic observation, notebook in hand. No novelist worth reading ever sat at home, entranced with the words spooling out. They paid attention to the life of the streets, to the mannerisms of their friends, to the way a small child speaks when he is hoping not to get found out.

If you start writing (however striking your original idea) with no sense of how your story will end, then life becomes progressively harder. Flailing around. Writer\u2019s block. Draft after draft. This is how novels get abandoned; film scripts bottom-drawered. The thing to do is to stop and envisage your final pages, your final scene. Take your time. What note do you want to strike? What surprise do you want to spring? What denouement will justify this journey?</p> <p>It may sound mechanical, but story-telling is a very complicated business, full of moving parts and many cogs engaging.

A comprehensive in Exeter? Born with a silver spoon; or things started off comfortably, but his father\u2019s business failed when he was 11? Raised in the shadow of three older siblings?

It\u2019s very difficult; it makes your mind ache \u2013 not only when you first start trying, but always. Three minutes ago you were tussling down inside the sentences, trying to drag out of the air the perfectly right words to express a mood, or catch a person\u2019s physical presence or a place\u2019s, or trying to find the perfectly right thing for your character to say. Then you blink your eyes, pull back from the screen or the notebook, try to imagine you\u2019ve never seen this writing before.</p> <p>This is the exact equivalent of a painter pulling back from her canvas, squinting at her work, before she dives forward and changes it again. It\u2019s a revelation, really \u2013 how surprisingly visual reading is. Go back a few pages, start reading as if you\u2019ve never seen these words before. How does it seem? Suddenly you\u2019ll see what you couldn\u2019t see when you were down among the undergrowth. It\u2019s going on too long, it\u2019s sentimental, the tone\u2019s too heavy, there are too many sentences with same rhythm, there\u2019s an inadvertent repetition. Or, something\u2019s missing. You could print out your work, to try to see it freshly \u2013 or type it up, if you\u2019re writing longhand. Or you could look at it full screen on the computer, with a different background, more like the pages of a book. The trouble is you have to make this effort not once, but over and over. Your mind will be sore from the effort of reading the same old thing so many times as if it were new. But unless you do it you won\u2019t know what you\u2019ve written, or whether you\u2019ve got it alive and whole, faithfully, on to the page.</p> <p>\u2022 Tessa Hadley is professor of creative writing at Bath Spa University</p> <h2>Don\u2019t be afraid to start again <strong>\u2013 </strong>Jeanette Winterson</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b16d30419aa8e9070e4a6afdfafd682f5152cb56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b16d30419aa8e9070e4a6afdfafd682f5152cb56/2027_657_2409_3011/800.jpg\" alt=\"Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Creativity is inexhaustible.

Day and night, the compulsion to write never leaves him, he says. He can\u2019t rest; can\u2019t forget the unfinished novel he\u2019s meant to be working on; can\u2019t see a cloud in the sky without thinking of a comparison (with a grand piano, say) he might use somewhere; can\u2019t trust the praise of encouragement of friends; feels nervous, miserable, overwrought, half-mad, and when any new work of his appears in print realises that it\u2019s all wrong. Nina doesn\u2019t listen, to her cost. But aspiring writers would do well to heed the warning. To be forever \u201cconsuming your own life\u201d, as Trigorin puts it, is no picnic.</p> <p>But as he also admits, the act itself, when you\u2019re fully immersed, is enjoyable. And to write \u201cin a sort of haze\u201d, unsure what you\u2019re up to but simply compelled, may be no bad thing. Say you sit down to write a poem, or an episode, set on an autumn morning. You have the idea but feel stuck, hamstrung, overwhelmed by your literary forebears: mist and mellow fruitfulness have been done to death. So has woodsmoke but suddenly you\u2019ve the smell in your nostrils and are reminded of (or imagine) a particular fire, logs crackling in a grate, two wine-glasses, a bitter argument, a crimson stain on a sheepskin rug \u2013 perhaps the scene is a winter night rather an autumn morning and the logs are imitation logs in a modern gas fire, but that\u2019s fine, where you\u2019re being taken is more interesting than what you\u2019d planned. Just go with it \u2013 you can always change it later.</p> <p>In other words, if you only write what you\u2019re expecting to write, you\u2019ll be bored. Take a risk. Work against the grain. Don\u2019t be afraid to make a deathbed scene comic, or to show a murderer being kind to animals.

There\u2019s a couple of ways to get around this. Most obviously, you can let yourself off writing as well as you\u2019re possibly able. You can say: \u201cThis is draft zero, not even a first draft, so there\u2019s no need for it to be anything but an exciting mess.\u201d Lots of writing advice is about taking the pressure off by lowering the expectations you have of each draft. That\u2019s the very best part of your very best.</p> <p>A different approach, one I often suggest to writers who are struggling, is to dodge the issue entirely.</p> <p>Instead of writing your novel or story as you, and anticipating all that pressure of owning your work (having friends read it as yours, reading it out in public after being introduced as you), give yourself a pseudonym to work with. Make up the name of a writer you just might have been, if you hadn\u2019t been yourself. Type it in at the top of the manuscript. Print it out. Sign it. (I\u2019m serious.) This draft is no longer by you (at your very best). This draft is by them, whoever they turn out to be.</p> <p>Now, whenever you need to figure something out about your story, from the overall form to the punctuation of a sentence, you can shift responsibility. The question isn\u2019t \u201cHow do I, at my very best, write this?\u201d but \u201cHow does so-and-so write this?\u201d</p> <p>By writing under a secret pseudonym, you will gain a collaborator who has no hang-ups, no responsibilities, no history. They will, I promise, help you write better \u2013 perhaps even better than your very best.</p> <p>\u2022 Toby Litt is a senior lecturer in creative writing at Birkbeck, University of London <strong> </strong></p> <h2>Do your research <strong>\u2013 </strong>Kathryn Hughes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a30f72955421b1daa3283cee9f7b00bcd398e3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a30f72955421b1daa3283cee9f7b00bcd398e3bf/507_206_592_739/401.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Turner for the Guardian\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s this odd idea that, when it comes to writing non-fiction and biography, all you have to do is get the facts straight in your head and then spool them out in a listless monotone. The experience is rather like sitting next to a pub bore, who starts every sentence with \u201cThe interesting thing is \u2026\u201d without noticing that you\u2019ve already turned away and started to talk to someone else.</p> <p>So it\u2019s all about finding a way to tell your story about the past as if it is actually very present. And, no, that doesn\u2019t mean employing the historic present tense, which is used far too often, and mostly badly. Instead, you need to marinate yourself in your material, consuming everything that you can get your hands on about your subject (we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re writing a biography) and the period in which they lived. Read the books that they read, not just the ones that they actually wrote. Track down their great-great-granddaughter and ask if there any relics (snuffboxes, spectacles diaries, not actual bones) that you could sniff or finger. Saturate yourself in your subject\u2019s correspondence until you know the name of their neighbour\u2019s dog or the date on which their child\u2019s first tooth fell out.</p> <p>Only once you\u2019ve metabolised this material, taken it into your own body, let it settle and mulch inside you for weeks, months or years, will you have a hope of making it live again. The first time you sit down to write, after a period of research immersion, try it freestyle. Don\u2019t hug your notes, or pore over timelines. Write the narrative from memory, letting details float to the front of your imagination, while others recede into the background. With any luck, your narrative will feel fresh and juicy because that is how it lives in your imagination. Only at this point should you go back to your data and make sure that you haven\u2019t invented anything.

It is this seriousness of intent that gives you half a chance of writing something that will have a life beyond your desk. It might be easier to deny this aspect and pretend that you will never get there \u2013 how dare you presume that this folly of a story you are bashing out can be something real, a book for an actual audience, and more to the point, isn\u2019t it very likely you will write a bad ending? You made the whole thing up, after all, and this contraption that we call plot could easily come apart. So goes the insecure writerly mind in the dark hours. But once you believe that you will reach the end of your book, whatever shape that takes, then it can make it easier to write with the kind of conviction and purpose that makes a reader want to turn the page.</p> <p>In <em>Six Walks in the Fictional Woods</em>, the playful and profound series of essays on writing by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/12/umberto-eco-real-literature-is-about-losers\" title=\"\"> Umberto Eco</a>, he likens the act of reading to playing a game: \u201ca game by which we give sense to the immensity of things that have happened, are happening or will happen in the world\u201d. By saying to yourself that you will complete the story, you are acknowledging the nature of this transaction between yourself and a potential reader \u2013 you are in the game.</p> <p>Of course, your story may never have a reader, but I believe there are very few benefits to thinking in that way. Time and time again I have seen talented students ditch their manuscripts at the half-way point, and less talented students reach the end, rewrite the whole book enthusiastically, and get published. Something about ending your novel can elevate it beyond what you might feel is a shameful and insubstantial piece of drivel that you have written in your pyjamas and make it a contender in your own mind.

Pearls seemingly formed between tennis and cocktails, brilliantly deployed by the greats between six and nine every morning but Sunday. Suddenly our biggest hurdle isn\u2019t character, pace or plot, but that we can\u2019t even play tennis.</p> <p>I\u2019m talking about the otherness of our peers. If our toolkit&#xa0;belongs to Fitzgerald and Faulkner, our first issue will&#xa0;be getting over writing relative crap at the outset. But whoever said \u201cwriting is rewriting\u201d knew the science of crap, the practical lesson being: it\u2019s easier to improve it than to originate brilliance. To improve it we need to have it, which means writing it, and that requires a different ethos than the one we probably sat down with, glowing with hope&#xa0;and expectation.</p> <p>My suggestion is this: we stop ourselves from writing what we have to write by pausing to fret over details and risks, and by filtering ourselves through subconscious juries. Sparkles of gold can appear if we just get enough words written, which means write like the wind, don\u2019t look down. Make a pact never to show anyone, build a mound of dirt, skim it later for anything that excites you. Skimming is a different job, sober and honest, of an archaeologist crumbling dirt in her hands. Separate any glimmers into a new document and build on them, connect them, repeat the process. Those glimmers are also evidence that things can work out, making them power pills for the will; use them to press on. We might start by sifting crap but a couple of passes can lure out real pipe-puffing linen-wearing tennis-playing vigour.</p> <p>The key then is to not try playing tennis.</p> <p>\u2022 DBC Pierre is author of writing guide <em>Release the Bats</em></p> <h2>Ignore tips <strong>\u2013 </strong>Amit Chaudhuri</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"03713fb033b57a444610a7eca447cf8dd72312f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03713fb033b57a444610a7eca447cf8dd72312f5/2374_297_1676_2095/800.jpg\" alt=\"Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The one tip I give to students of writing is to disregard tips. These might have to do with arresting opening sentences, or they may simply concern the tools of the trade \u2013 character, setting, description, plot. The four words, chosen randomly, are vague descriptive categories once used in literary&#xa0;departments, where, with \u201ctone\u201d, they\u2019ve been abandoned, only to be repeatedly invoked in creative writing classes along with \u201ccraft\u201d, \u201csentence\u201d, and that nervous-making shibboleth, \u201cpoint of view\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what \u201ccharacter\u201d means. Is it an aggregate of physical features \u2013 nose, eyes, hair \u2013 which add up to a bodily presence into which, as if it were a vessel, you pour psychological life: thoughts, memories, political views? Can&#xa0;you \u201cfictionalise\u201d a real person by adding a moustache to his face, or a stammer to his speech?</p> <p>Why is it that, when we invent characters, the process of&#xa0;invention involves an excavation from the subconscious, as if we were trying to remember someone we knew decades&#xa0;ago; while when we write of people we know, we see them in our imagination as independent entities who are&#xa0;essentially strangers to us? To create a character is to unlearn what we know: tips will be unhelpful. Unhelpful, too, is the hierarchy in which these categories arrive, with character at the centre, and setting important inasmuch as&#xa0;it&#xa0;is where plot or story \u2013 or what happens to the protagonist \u2013 unfolds.</p> <p>For me, the protagonist is only one element in a story: evening, room, wall, smoke, car, are other possible ones. It\u2019s a prejudice inherited from the European Renaissance that the human must occupy centre stage, everything else being secondary. A work of the imagination gives us not a protagonist, but the intimation of a world. No one thing in a&#xa0;world \u2013 object or person \u2013 has centrality.</p> <p>If I have one more tip, it\u2019s this: give nothing centrality, because writing is about continually shifting weight from one thing and moment to the other.</p> <p>\u2022 Amit Chaudhuri is professor of contemporary literature at the University of East&#xa0;Anglia</p> <h2>Just do it <strong>\u2013 </strong>Naomi Alderman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"152354f00ac4a277124f19c8ce7f12d0e55f5e59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/152354f00ac4a277124f19c8ce7f12d0e55f5e59/91_89_271_338/271.png\" alt=\"Naomi Alderman\" width=\"271\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>You learn the most from sitting down and doing the work, regularly, patiently, sometimes in hope, sometimes despairingly.

My parents are huge Star Trek fans and I grew up watching TNG, DS9 and the unfairly maligned Voyager. At primary school in Ireland in the 90s, I would race home to finish my homework by 5pm so I could watch reruns of old seasons, and had special dispensation to stay up late when new episodes were airing.</p> <p>I loved reading books like the Star Trek Encyclopedia cover to cover, and would frequently inflict many facts about the show on kindly babysitters. I was delighted to be taken into Dublin to meet Andrew J Robinson (Garak) at Forbidden Planet, where he was signing copies of the excellent book he&#39;d written about his character, A Stitch in Time.</p> <p>My proudest childhood achievement was being a Star Letter in a 2001 edition of Star Trek Monthly, where I admonished the adult, and to my mind, excessively grumpy readers who seemed to only write in to criticise Enterprise every week. I reminded them that other Star Trek shows had also got off to a rocky start and they should have a little patience. In retrospect, my optimism didn&#39;t really pay off, but the show did always teach me to try and see the best in things.</p> <p>As I&#39;ve grown older, Star Trek has stayed with me. I&#39;ve gone back to discover the wonders of the original series, from Nichelle Nichols&#39; groundbreaking portrayal of Uhura to Kirk &amp; Spock and the beginning of slash fanfiction (even Gene Roddenberry shipped it!). I&#39;ve introduced it to others, having just watched the entirety of DS9 with my best friend, who missed out as a kid.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been lucky enough to meet some of the casts of the show, particularly the actresses who played my formative heroines, Terry Farrell (Dax), Kate Mulgrew (Janeway), and Nana Visitor (Kira, pictured). All of them have been wonderful, fascinating women, who seem to understand something of the impact they&#39;ve had.</p> <p>In spite of previous disappointments, I have very high hopes for Discovery. It&#39;s hard to think of a better choice for showrunner than Bryan Fuller, given his experience on and off the show, and I think we could be in for something really special.</p> <p>Star Trek was even there on my wedding day. As my parents walked me down the aisle to marry my wife (my dad wearing a very fetching tie featuring the first four Captains), my processional music was the opening of the TNG theme, with Patrick Stewart&#39;s beautiful voiceover: &#39;These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise..&#39;</p> </div>   </figcaption>  </div> <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">  By  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/amywoodworth\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">amywoodworth</a> </p> <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2016-09-08T16:11:31+01:00\">8 September 2016, 16:11</time> </p> </div> </footer>  </figure>  <h2>5) \u2018It\u2019s come to embody a positive version of what humanity could be\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-image\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-media-id=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57cfebabe4b0c1d95ae14329/5003321\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57cfebabe4b0c1d95ae14329/5003321\" itemprop=\"url\"><img src=\"https://gu-witness.s3.amazonaws.com/media/9497536e-5fd1-4818-8b30-899fc64ed507-mediumoriginalaspectdouble.jpg\" alt=\"2012 London Destination Star Trek\" itemprop=\"contentURL\"/></a>    <figcaption>  <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57cfebabe4b0c1d95ae14329/5003321\" itemprop=\"url\">2012 London Destination Star Trek</a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"description\"> <p>When I met my American husband (via a Private Eye blind date in 1987), one of the things we talked about was our shared love of Star Trek. Though I didn&#39;t analyse it at the time, looking back on that evening it was a clue that we also shared the Gene Roddenberry vision of humankind. That vision privileged science and rationality (tempered by justice and kindness), the drive to explore and discover but not harm other cultures (Prime Directive rules apply) and it provided an unusual TV forum in which to act out dramas about identity and society. The crew of the Enterprise was ethnically diverse and had an African-American woman in an important role - for viewers in the US and the UK this was something novel, even before we got to the first interracial kiss. The Next Generation would go on to develop and enrich the themes articulated in the original series.</p> <p>Reader, I married him. Jim (not Kirk, but still), and I married in 1990. Our daughter, now 20, is a talented Cosplayer in anime and Marvel related material, but she&#39;s also a Star Trek fan, having been exposed to the shows at a young age. We are currently working our way through Voyager once more. We will be at Destination Star Trek Europe in Birmingham next month, and my father-in-law will fly over from Connecticut to join us. Costumes have been purchased...</p> <p>My brief photo shoot with William Shatner meant a huge amount to me and I meant it when I told him it was a real honour to meet him. He kindly said the same to me. Everyone who has ever worked on Star Trek series or films but the actors especially, have come to embody a positive version of what humanity could be. The actors focus the enormous body of emotions that wash around the franchise. Yes, I know there&#39;s an enormous body of business/money involved too. Nonetheless, I can&#39;t think of a better antidote than the Star Trek universe vision to the post-truth, build-a-wall, repel the outsider, repress the vulnerable political landscape we are living in today.

  "<p><strong>I am organising a tailor-made trip to China in September 2017 for my wife and I, using a Chinese travel agent called Chinatours. It will be for about four weeks and the \u00a310,000 cost will cover a variety of hotel stays, local tours, entrance fees, internal travel, etc. The company is not Atol or Abta bonded. </strong></p> <p><strong>My concerns are about insurance and how we would get our money back should Chinatours cease trading before our holiday, although I have no reason to believe it is anything but sound.</strong></p> <p><strong>Both my bank and John Lewis provide holiday insurance, but the policies will not provide cover for companies that are not Abta or Atol bonded (so that they wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything because these industry schemes would step in). </strong></p> <p><strong>I tend to use a Mastercard credit card through John Lewis for big purchases. But when I rang it I was told that I should not assume I would have protection against Chinatours\u2019 failure if I paid using such a card. The person cited the collapse of the non-bonded LowCostHolidays earlier this summer, saying that it hadn\u2019t paid compensation to those who had used their credit card. </strong></p> <p><strong>This seems contrary to the advice previously offered in the Guardian and elsewhere. What would you advise I do?</strong></p> <p><em>JF, </em><em>Newark</em></p> <p>My immediate response to your letter was that you had been told a load of baloney by the person at John Lewis credit cards \u2013 and so it proved. You are quite right to check the situation, as it would be foolhardy when making such an expensive booking not to be covered in the event the travel operator ceased trading \u2013 an all too familiar situation in the travel sector. </p> <p>We asked John Lewis to explain why you had been told what you had, and it has now confirmed that you would in fact be covered if you paid by credit card.</p> <p>\u201cJF would be protected on any purchase made with his John Lewis partnership card between the value of \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, the credit card company holds equal responsibility with the trader or retailer providing the goods or services, enabling consumers to make a direct claim to their credit card company. We would like to apologise if the advice JF received wasn\u2019t clear. We will ensure that all customers are fully aware of the legalities surrounding this issue and the options available to them,\u201d a spokeswoman says.</p> <p>John Lewis went on to suggest you would be able to claim in full as long as you had paid a deposit of at least \u00a3100 on credit card, even if an alternative payment method was used to cover the remaining balance. This means you could pay the 3% credit card loading fee on just the first \u00a3100, and pay the rest later by debit card, which is cheaper. </p> <p>In general, when buying a major item from a firm that could be at risk of going bust between the payment and receipt of the goods or service, always use a credit card for at least \u00a3100 of the bill. A new or used car purchase is a good example, as long as the total purchase price is less than \u00a330,000. Payments made via PayPal do not enjoy the same protection. It has its own protection scheme, but claims can only be brought up to 180 days from the payment date. </p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<h2>Polignano a Mare, Italy<br></h2> <p><em><strong>\u2018Cannier tourists wait for late summer and autumn\u2019</strong></em><br></p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t come in August.\u201d That was the advice of a local when I discussed a return visit to Puglia, the heel of Italy. He has a point. In August \u2013 when Italians tend to take their summer holiday \u2013 the beaches and streets are heaving. Cannier tourists wait for late summer and autumn, when the sun still warms the skin, but there is far less skin about. However, there are enough visitors to ensure that everything\u2019s open. The seas are still toasty, too, for those who like a dip. (And if Puglia fails to tempt you, the same holds true of Basilicata and Calabria, the other regions that make up the foot of Italy.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d1f0bc81245e1839d5d0ca2dfbae4ab543e266da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1f0bc81245e1839d5d0ca2dfbae4ab543e266da/0_366_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Narrow beach at Polignano, Puglia, Southern Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volare \u2026 pretty Polignano is also the birthplace of singer-songwriter Domenico Modugno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Poike/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a city-based holiday, <a href=\"http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/apulia/lecce.html\">Lecce</a> is a good choice, with its baroque architecture and Roman ruins, as is <a href=\"http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/apulia/foggia.html\">Foggia</a>, if palaces and churches are your thing.

From Sotiris Megalos, perched on crags in the south-east, with an old winery and presses, to Agios Emilianos, on a rocky outcrop overlooking a limpid cove in the far west, their locations all inspire awe.</p> <p>Most of Symi\u2019s beaches are equally spectacular, and tantalisingly hard to reach, at least by car. Craggy footpaths and chugging water taxis take you to Nanou, a pebble beach with a tamarisk-shaded shack serving grilled just-caught fish, and Marathounta, where plucky goats will steal your leftovers at the excellent farm-to-table <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/taverna.marathounta\">Taverna Marathounta</a> (about \u20ac25 a head).

  "<p>One in every five card payments we make is now contactless, marking a major milestone in the \u201cwave and pay\u201d revolution, industry figures due out soon are expected to confirm.</p> <p>Contactless payment cards were introduced in the UK in 2007. Initially, the public was slow to embrace the technology.</p> <p>However, things are really taking off \u2013 it recently emerged that spending on contactless cards during the first six months of 2016 has <a href=\"http://www.theukcardsassociation.org.uk/news/JuneCES2016.asp\" title=\"\">outstripped the amount for the whole of 2015</a>.</p> <p>Contactless accounted for 18% of UK card spending in June, the most recent month for which industry data is available, and at the current rate of growth will almost certainly have passed 20% by now. As recently as October last year, the figure was 10%. And Brits are now more likely to make a payment using a contactless card than a cheque book.</p> <p>That said, some people are clearly still wedded to cash - witness Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/07/mike-ashley-pulls-out-wad-50-notes-during-sports-direct-security-check-video\" title=\"\">pulling out a thick wad of \u00a350 notes</a> when asked to empty his pockets on entering the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse this week.</p> <p>To start with, tap-and-go or touch-and-go \u2013 or whatever you want to call it \u2013 was largely confined to coffee shops and sandwich chains, but has now moved way beyond that.</p> <p>It is still a London-dominated payment revolution. It was two years ago next Friday (16 September) that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/16/london-tube-contactless-payments-underground-oyster\" title=\"\">the technology received a huge boost</a> when it became possible to gain access to the tube network, Docklands Light Railway (DLR), London Overground and most National Rail services in the capital, using only a bank card. It\u2019s estimated that since then, around a third of Oyster card holders have migrated to contactless.</p> <p>But many people still worry about falling victim to fraud. Research this month from Nationwide found that more than half of Brits are \u201cwary\u201d of the new-style cards \u2013 with some people going to fairly extreme lengths, such as wrapping their plastic in tinfoil in order to prevent a fraudster armed with a card-reading device from surreptitiously stealing their details.</p> <p>And on Thursday, MoneySavingExpert.com website warned that a \u201clittle-known technological weakness\u201d in the way contactless works means bank cards that have been cancelled after being stolen, can be used to make fraudulent purchases months later. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/19/contactless-payments-card-fraud-after-cancellation-bank-account\" title=\"\">A Guardian investigation in December 2015</a> had already identified this as a problem.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk\" title=\"\">Financial Fraud Action UK</a> says fraud on contactless cards and devices \u201cremains low\u201d, with \u00a32.8m of losses in 2015 \u2013 equivalent to 3.6p in every \u00a3100 spent in this way.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some experts reckon contactless cards might eventually go the way of Betamax and other obsolete technologies, as mobile phones and wearable technology take over.</p> <p><strong>The headline stats</strong></p> <p>Around \u00a39.27bn was spent on contactless cards between 1 January and 30 June this year, according to the UK Cards Association. That\u2019s more than the total 2015 spend of \u00a37.75bn.</p> <p>There are more than 92m contactless cards in the UK\u2019s wallets and purses, of which 65m are debit cards, and these can be used at more than 400,000 locations across the country.</p> <p>Earlier this month it emerged that the use of contactless payments has now overtaken cheques.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/financial-services/use-of-contactless-payments-overtakes-cheques-in-2016\" title=\"\">Research from Mintel</a> showed that cheques were used by less than one-third (31%) of Brits during the three months to April, putting them well behind contactless debit cards (39%) and contactless credit cards (34%). Some 97% of Britons used cash during the period - which does make you wonder how the other 3% managed to get through three months without paying for anything with notes or coins (presumably this 3% includes the Queen and others too posh to carry cash).</p> <p><strong>Hey big spender!</strong></p> <p>On 1 September last year, the maximum limit for a single contactless transaction rose from \u00a320 to \u00a330.</p> <p>This was seen as a hugely important move because the average debit and credit card transaction in a supermarket is worth just over \u00a325, and therefore lifting the maximum above this would make big retailers more interested in being involved.</p> <p>Some may be surprised to learn that the average amount spent in each transaction is still well under a tenner \u2013 it was \u00a37.72 in October last year, and \u00a38.60 in both May and June this year. The figures are probably skewed by the large number of morning coffees, lunchtime sandwiches and London tube and bus journeys that still make up a good chunk of the total, despite more retailers comning on board.</p> <p>There are no plans to hike the maximum above \u00a330 \u2013 though some other countries let people make bigger-value payments using contactless. The equivalent limit in Australia is $100 (\u00a357), and in Canada it\u2019s $100 (\u00a358).</p> <p><strong>The refuseniks and laggards</strong></p> <p>There are still many people who are locked out of contactless. HSBC has embraced the technology for its debit cards, but for some unknown reason it won\u2019t give its credit card holders access.</p> <p>Similarly, Nationwide has more than five million new-style debit cards in circulation, but its credit cards don\u2019t allow contactless payments. But this is about to change \u2013 a rollout of the new technology to these customers is due to begin later this year, possibly in November.</p> <p>In terms of retailers, Sainsbury\u2019s sticks out as a biggie that has still not installed contactless payment systems in any of its shops. Search on Twitter for \u201cSainsbury\u2019s\u201d and \u201ccontactless\u201d, and you will get a flavour of what customers feel about the retailer\u2019s seemingly Luddite stance. \u201cWhen the f are Sainsbury\u2019s going to get contactless?\u201d, \u201cSeriously @sainsburys, it\u2019s 2016. When are you getting contactless payments?\u201d and \u201cHey @sainsburys can you stop mucking around with the \u00a33 meal deal and get contactless in please\u201d are just a few of this week\u2019s tweets on the subject.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s told Guardian Money that the wait is about to end, and it will be introducing contactless \u201cbefore the end of the year\u201d. But don\u2019t hold your breath \u2013 in August 2015 it said it would launch contactless \u201cbefore the end of the year\u201d (yes, the exact same words).</p> <p>A big-name refusenik is John Lewis, which says it has no plans to go contactless at any of its 46 locations because the average transaction value at its department stores is above \u00a330. Its Waitrose division rolled out the new technology in 2012, and last month announced it had <a href=\"http://waitrose.pressarea.com/pressrelease/details/78/SHOPS%20&amp;%20EXPANSION_14/6573\" title=\"\">opened its first \u201ccashless\u201d store</a> at Sky\u2019s new head office building at its campus in Osterley, west London. Sky employees are only able to pay by card or with their mobile device at one of the five self-service checkouts.</p> <p><strong>Who and where?</strong></p> <p>According to data issued by Barclaycard last month, over-60s are adopting contactless \u201cin their droves\u201d, with this age group now outnumbering 18 to 25-year-olds in terms of take-up. Yet the new Nationwide research paints a different picture: it says over-55s are \u201cthe most wary\u201d when it comes to making contactless payments, with less than half (45%) adopting the technology, compared with 70% of those aged 25 to 34.</p> <p>London remains ahead of the rest of the country, with almost four in 10 of all card transactions of \u00a330 and under now paid for with contactless, says Barclaycard. The capital\u2019s dominance is largely down to more retailers accepting the technology, plus the popularity of contactless across the Transport for London network. The provider claims the rest of the country is \u201cquickly catching up,\u201d with Glasgow, Blackpool, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Hull seeing the biggest increases in usage. In each of these locations, contactless spending is up between 260% and 290% this year compared to last year, whereas the figure for London is 116%.</p> <p>Meanwhile, just over half of all Brits now use contactless, and the most common places for making payments are shops, supermarkets, restaurants and bars, says Nationwide. It adds: \u201cOnly 17% of people currently use contactless on public transport, as this option is only really available in London, but with more cities making the technology available later this year, this is expected to increase.\u201d</p> <p>The UK Cards Association says it is \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theukcardsassociation.org.uk/contactless_transport/index.asp\" title=\"\">working with transit operators</a> on bringing contactless payment to public transport in other parts of the country\u201d. It says it has already developed two models (one for using your card for single journeys, for example on a bus, and the other for multiple journeys) and is now working on a third, where you would buy a ticket in advance with a card and then use that card at the barrier without having to print out a ticket.</p> <p>Transport for Greater Manchester says it is \u201cnot there yet\u201d in terms of people being able to use contactless payment cards and mobile systems such as Apple Pay to pay for journeys on public transport. It is currently rolling out an Oyster-style smart card called <a href=\"https://www.getmethere.com/web/tfgm_customer/home\" title=\"\">Get Me There</a> for services such as Metrolink.</p>",
  "<p>A London couple who had their \u00a36,000 burglary claim turned down by their insurer LV= because they didn\u2019t have a burglar alarm are to have their claim paid, after the Financial Ombudsman Service ruled they were treated unfairly.</p> <p>In May, Guardian Money <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/14/burglar-alarm-home-insurance-policy-lv\" title=\"\">featured the case</a> of Gemma and Mark Hall* who had been LV= customers for more than a decade, but found their burglary claim refused because, unbeknown to them, LV= had five years earlier made an alarm a condition of cover \u2013 a fact they said was buried in the small print.</p> <p>The pair, both doctors living in Muswell Hill, had never had a working alarm at their home and said they had been clear about that when they first bought their home and contents cover from LV= in 2005 for about \u00a3350. Each year since they had happily renewed the policy by direct debit.</p> <p>But when they had to claim for computers and some jewellery, they were astonished to be told that it would not be paid. LV= argued that on the 2010 and 2011 renewal letters it sent them, it stated: \u201cPlease check your new quote carefully as the conditions quoted may differ from your existing insurance.\u201d Within the documents, several pages in, the need for the alarm was noted, but went unseen by the pair.</p> <p>In June 2015, LV= added a covering letter: \u201cCheck the documents enclosed \u2013 we\u2019ve added security clauses to your policy, please see your renewal quote.\u201d</p> <p>But the couple said that was hardly a clear message that an alarm had become necessary, and had LV= simply said they needed one they would have taken the appropriate action. Money thought they had a strong argument and that this was a case of an insurer using a technicality to avoid paying out. A few weeks ago the FOS agreed. It has told LV= to pay up.</p> <p>An LV= spokesperson said: \u201cTreating customers fairly is extremely important to us and we regularly review the way we work to ensure this. In this case, while we believe that we made the need for a working alarm clear in our annual renewal letters, we have taken into consideration that they may not have realised there had been this change to their policy. We are very sorry for any upset or inconvenience our initial decision may have caused and glad that we\u2019ve now been able to reach an agreement with them and the FOS to settle their claim.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Not their real names</em></p>",
  "<p>Co-operative Energy has increased the prices on some of its tariffs by up to 28%, with standard customers likely to be paying more than they would with one of the \u201cbig six\u201d providers, and as much as \u00a3300 more than the market\u2019s cheapest deal.</p> <p>Energy prices in general look set to be moving upwards after a two-year lull, experts have warned. And from 1 October customers on the Co-op\u2019s standard variable dual-fuel tariff \u2013 which customers are placed on at the end of a fixed-term contract and which is already one of the most expensive on the market \u2013 will see their annual bills rise 3%, which on average means an increase from \u00a31,152 to \u00a31,184.</p> <p>Joe Malinowski from energy price comparison website <a href=\"https://www.theenergyshop.com/HomeEnergy/\" title=\"\">TheEnergyShop</a>, says he is bemused as to why a firm that championed its role as one of the challenger suppliers has upped its prices in this way at a time, he says, when wholesale gas prices fell by 8% in August \u2013 the first fall in five months.</p> <p>Over the past two months the Co-op has increased the price of its cheapest tariff by \u00a3219, or 28%. So where the Co-op Fix for Longer September 2017 tariff was a very competitive \u00a3770, the Co-op Online October 2017 deal is a distinctly average \u00a3989 a year. Existing customers will also see prices rise.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unusual to find a mid-tier energy supplier offering worse deals than the standard tariffs of the big six,\u201d Malinowski says. \u201cBut the average user on the Co-op\u2019s standard tariff will be paying \u00a349 a year more.

Unfortunately, this is no longer sustainable and we have reluctantly taken the decision to pass on a small percentage of these costs to our customers by increasing our charges by an average of 3% from 1 October.\u201d</p> <p>Claire Osborne, energy expert at <a href=\"https://www.uswitch.com/\" title=\"\">uSwitch.com</a>, says it is not just the Co-op that has upped the cost of the cheapest deals this summer \u2013 21 energy suppliers have replaced their cheapest fixed-price deal with more expensive plans since June, increasing prices by an average of \u00a323. Meanwhile, EDF, Avro Energy, Flow, GnERGY, OVO Energy and So Energy have raised their prices twice over the summer. Octopus has increased the price of its cheapest fixed deal three times since the start of July.</p> <p>\u201cMany suppliers are increasing the price of their cheapest deals amid concerns about rising wholesale energy costs and uncertainty in the market following the EU referendum,\u201d Osborne says. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether this is just a blip, and wholesale prices still remain well below their high 2013 levels.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the rises, she says there are still bargains out there. \u201cThe market\u2019s most competitive plans are still hundreds of pounds less than the average big six standard tariff. Those who are concerned about their energy bills should look to see whether they can switch to a better tariff and consider fixed deals that can provide protection against further price rises.\u201d</p> <p>Figures from the energy regulator this week show that despite more UK households switching, 66% are overpaying because they are still on standard variable tariffs. Ofgem has published data which shows that in the six months to the end of June more than two million domestic customers switched electricity company, while 1.64 million moved gas supplier. Many will have moved both together. Ofgem says there were around a million more accounts switched than in the same period last year.</p> <p>The regulator says the average standard variable tariff of the larger energy suppliers as of 28 July 2016 was \u00a31,066.

  "<p>I love holidays but hate going on holiday. Every aspect of planning makes me tense and the hell-in-a-bucket of airports, insurance, hire cars etc causes huge angst even with another adult to carry the weight. Millie, Matt and I are heading to Italy to the villa Helen borrowed from a kind colleague, numbers boosted back to four by honorary uncle Kenny. Despite this, I expect it to be hard going, emotionally and practically, simply because he\u2019s not Helen with her smiling tour de force of planning and general jollying along of our trips.</p> <p>Italy may also pale by comparison with the last two years\u2019 fabulous family&#xa0;holidays. A road trip through Romania staying most notably in Viscri and then a full monty Florida trip \u2013 theme parks, alligator dodging, dolphin worrying and Anna Maria Island beach bathing.</p> <p>The Romanian adventure was right up Helen\u2019s street, fuelled by the fact that my brother Richard lives there&#xa0;and his wife, Ioana, worked so hard to make it special in our post-diagnosis world.</p> <p>Florida was less obvious, Helen concluding, \u201cWild horses wouldn\u2019t usually drag me there, Adam, but I want to give Millie and Matt a holiday to remember.\u201d In denial, I didn\u2019t see so clearly that mentally she had inserted the word \u201cme\u201d after \u201cremember\u201d, tragically aware this might be her last big trip.</p> <p>It was a very special two weeks in&#xa0;every way even if Disney\u2019s best was&#xa0;overshadowed for Millie and Matt&#xa0;by the excitement of my being caught speeding by slow-talking, gun-packing but smiley and forgiving \u201cTrooper Dan\u201d.</p> <p>Our final short break together was my birthday weekend, which Helen kept secret for months. She maintained the subterfuge even into the Friday night journey: \u201cYou\u2019ll need to drive without looking at road signs, Adam, or you\u2019ll spoil the surprise. I\u2019ll navigate.\u201d</p> <p>This is harder to do than you might think, and not recommended. After a somewhat adventurous trip, we arrived on a stormy waterfront facing what looked like a brick wall against a black sky. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re here!\u201d Helen shouted, full of infectious gaiety. It was the Landmark Trust\u2019s magnificent Martello tower that I\u2019d admired for so long.</p> <p>The weekend was extraordinary \u2013 wonderful like no other and will be a lifelong reminder for me how much Helen cared to make it special, including a surprise dinner in the tower cooked by her sister Sarah, brother-in-law Brian and waited on by our nephew Nathan. We walked, talked and generally loved one another; the 13ft-thick walls of the tower providing temporary respite from the stark fact of Helen\u2019s decline, as it had for so long against raging Suffolk seas.</p> <p>Indeed, so powerful was her life force during the Martello weekend, I\u2019m convinced she saved her remaining strength for this final hurrah and expression of her love. Just over a month later, I was at her bedside as she slipped away peacefully.</p> <p>So Italy without Helen was sure to be dreadful. But in this assumption, as in so much, I was so wrong. Italy was great. A total focus on the kids, a new dynamic in having funny, kind Kenny with us and I found myself relaxing for the first time since Helen\u2019s death.</p> <p>I know I was relaxed because while we were watching the Italian Job I experienced the same \u201cNooooooo!\u201d reaction I\u2019d had as an eight-year-old when the Mafia crush the E-Type Jaguars. On a scorching day in Turin we tracked down the route of the Mini Coopers\u2019 escape.</p> <p>If I\u2019m brutally honest, my ease is also because for the first time in ages I\u2019m holidaying without the worry of Helen\u2019s health and the emotional weight of knowing every second might make for precious memories.</p> <p>Any guilt I feel about this sense of relief is overwhelmed by the joy everyone takes in the trip and perhaps shows that I may be turning a corner in dealing with the omnipresent weight of loss. I love that it\u2019s happening on a holiday chosen and planned by Helen, so perhaps even now she\u2019s still navigating me to sanctuary.</p> <p><em>Adam Golightly is a pseudonym</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mradamgolightly\" title=\"\"><em>@MrAdamGolightly</em></a></p>",
  "<h2>Snapshot: Our first home after living in a caravan</h2> <p>Here we are, Mum and me, standing proudly on the would-be doorstep of our nearly finished house, sometime in 1965. The photograph (fuzzy in parts, like my memory of this landmark) was taken on the Box Brownie camera that Dad took to Egypt when he did National Service.</p> <p>These things I recall with clarity: the grimy plank bridge over the threshold, the gun-metal breeze-block entrance hall walls and, most worryingly, the hole in the ceiling where a staircase should have been but wasn\u2019t and the ladder up into the space beyond. It was still only the skeleton of a house, but this absence of stairs was shattering.</p> <p>We\u2019d lived in a largish caravan since I was six months old (the result of the brutal 1960s rental market \u2013 no pets, no children). However, Dad\u2019s office job with a construction firm meant that there was always space for us on their building sites.</p> <p>During those three caravan years we moved through a handful of construction sites around the Midlands while Dad\u2019s firm worked on the M1 and other roads. The caravan was slightly too long to be towed by car and was mysteriously moved to the next site by other means. We generally ended up just outside a small town, surrounded by fields and trees.</p> <p>This real house was the most thrilling possibility. But how would we get upstairs? Dad teased me, saying it would be like living in a tree house \u2013 I\u2019d have to be careful when I carried my teddy up that ladder at bedtime \u2026</p> <p>But I could tell it would be fine. Mum couldn\u2019t stop smiling. I twirled in the living room, aeroplane arms wide, till the floor lurched. Our house!</p> <p>When the time came, I was happy to wave farewell to the pull-down bath in the caravan\u2019s minuscule kitchen, to the chemical toilet lurking outside and to the nightly palaver of conjuring my bed from its daytime settee disguise.</p> <p>There were no gardens or proper pavements for ages, but who cared? I had my own bedroom.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what happened to the caravan, but I do know that our house still looks like the perfect house to me.</p> <p><em>Julie Burke</em></p> <h2>Playlist: My brother, chauffeur and chaperone</h2> <p><strong>Heartaches by the Number by Guy Mitchell</strong></p> <p>\u201c<em>Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score / Every day you love me less, each day I love you more\u201d</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmRjgWW8yn0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fmRjgWW8yn0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Recorded by Guy Mitchell in 1959, this song was very popular when I first started going to dances.

The dancehall was a long barn with a red corrugated-iron roof, a few feet away from the lake. En route to the dance, each person had to sing a verse of a song and everyone joined in the chorus. Heartaches by the Number and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BGMOSHZKEo\">The Blackboard of my Heart</a> were among the favourites. We travelled in my older brother\u2019s 1958 Ford Squire estate car with teenagers squeezed into every available inch.</p> <p>But my brother was no pushover as chauffeur and chaperone; there were reasonable rules and we complied. Seats were allocated as payment for washing and ironing shirts, etc. Points were gained also by polishing his uniform boots and gaiters and working with wadding until the brass buttons gleamed. All departure and return times were his domain; otherwise, he left us to our own devices.</p> <p>To begin the night, the band played waltzes and a Siege of Ennis to get warmed up for the quicksteps, sambas, rock\u2018n\u2019roll and jiving.

  "<p>Anniversaries should be happy times \u2013 times to celebrate the years that have gone before and those that will hopefully come after. And all of them have been. Yet ours have always been tinged with regret that I have not been fully with you all these years. An older man asked recently \u201cHow\u2019s married life \u2013 it\u2019s amazing they still love us, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His pithy statement said so much about marriage, about how much us men get wrong (such as how to clean the kitchen counter). But the truth is, I am scared that you would hate me if I were to confess how terrible a husband I have been.</p> <p>We knew about my depression before we were engaged. You gave me the courage to seek professional help, and you decided to stick by me, knowing that it was going to be a long haul.</p> <p>I also mentioned my cross-dressing. But I never opened up fully enough for us to address it properly. I was always embarrassed by it, but I know this is no excuse. It is true that I have never felt safe enough to admit this, but ultimately I am in control of what I say.</p> <p>Early on in married life you found women\u2019s clothing that I had bought. I did not admit to you the depth of my addiction: that I would drive miles to buy a secondhand dress advertised online or that I would specifically go to shops further out of town so I could browse women\u2019s clothes without being seen by anyone, or slept in dresses when you were on a night shift, or the time spent online trawling through clothes, wigs, makeup tutorials.</p> <p>I was not honest about my use of porn, either; you gave me opportunities to confess and I chose to lie. I lied about how much women\u2019s clothing I had bought in the same way an adulterer might claim he had seen his lover fewer times than he really had.</p> <p>And like the adulterer, I have sought other women, flirted online, and flirted with the idea of meeting them. I have met with none, but this does not matter. It has terrified me that I have gone far enough to respond to personals; even considering doing this tells me I am often unwilling to put our marriage first.</p> <p>I am disgusted that I have done all this, especially as I have no doubt of your love for me: as you wept by my side when we met with psychologists to discuss my overdose; when you collected me after I was picked up by the police before I could do myself harm; when you help me think through why I might be feeling low and what to do about it; of the laughter we have shared with each other and of downright silliness. In the midst of your faithfulness, I have been faithless.</p> <p>So this anniversary I am renewing my commitment to you, especially my vow to \u201cforsake all others\u201d. I have realised, too late perhaps, that this includes myself.

  "<h2>Last Night of the Proms </h2> <p><strong>7.15pm, BBC2<br></strong>Cross-channel coverage of the Proms\u2019 swansong from the Royal Albert Hall. Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo returns to conduct the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus\u2019s closing concert, sharing starring slots with Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez and Scottish composer Tom Harrold. A treat for aficionados, though the potential for post-Brexit patriotic posturing by flag-flourishing attendees may prove more than a little irksome.

Finally, there\u2019s a TV forum for such outre talents. Go For It sees members of the public given space to demonstrate their peculiar skills \u2013 and if they walk it like they talk it, there\u2019s a grand to be won. Former Butlin\u2019s Redcoat Stephen Mulhern is the ringmaster of this cheerfully end-of-the-pier affair. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>The Last Leg: Live From Rio </h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4<br></strong>Further Paralympics roundup fun from Adam Hills, Alex Brooker and Josh Widdicombe.

Commenting on all that and other news from the Games are powerlifter Ali Jawad, sprinter Jonnie Peacock and comic actor Stephen Mangan. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Beck: Gunvald </h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC4<br></strong>The latest feature-length drama based on Maj Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6\u2019s hit novels doesn\u2019t disappoint, delivering a gut-punch of doom, gloom and Scandi twists. Diligent Stockholm detective Martin Beck investigates the murder of a journalist who had been the target of threats due to his faith and support for gay rights. Could rightwing extremists be behind the death? As well as an obligatory fast-paced chase, there\u2019s also a personal tragedy for Beck and his officers. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Impractical Jokers UK </h2> <p><strong>11.30pm, Channel 5<br></strong>Hidden-camera show in which four friends compete in a series of toe-curling challenges and dares, each attempting to prank flabbergasted strangers while directed by the others via an earpiece.

  "<p>Voters in the City of Sydney, along with other parts of New South Wales, are voting to elect new local councils on Saturday. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the City of Sydney council election.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been going on in the City of Sydney for the last four years?</strong></p> <p>Independent lord mayor Clover Moore has been leading the council from Town Hall for the last 12 years, since 2004. Moore was a state MP covering the area from 1988 until 2012, and ran for the lord mayoralty in 2004 after the Labor state government expanded the council to cover some of her strongest areas.<br></p> <p>Moore was re-elected lord mayor in 2008 and 2012, with enough councillors elected on her ticket to give her a working majority on the council.</p> <p>In 2012, she comfortably won a third term, with more than 50% of the primary vote in the mayoral election. Another four candidates were elected from her team, alongside two Liberals, one Labor, one Green and one local business independent. Moore\u2019s vote is highest in the north-eastern corner of the City, in suburbs such as Kings Cross, Darlinghurst and Potts Point, and is also quite high in the Newtown and Glebe areas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Map 1\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\"src=\"https://benraue.carto.com/viz/88dc0edb-33b8-4c3e-bb9b-bbebeac16f4f/embed_map\" frameborder=\"0\"allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Clover Moore\u2019s primary vote for mayor by booth.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How have the voting rules changed?</strong><br></p> <p>A 2014 bill, sponsored by the Shooters and Fishers party, expanded the rights of businesses to vote in the City. While some businesses were already allowed to vote, most didn\u2019t. Only 1709 non-resident electors were enrolled to vote in the City in 2012. The new law made it compulsory to enrol, and gave each business two votes each.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/05/city-of-sydney-council-election-business-vote-the-latest-battleground-in-long-war\">City of Sydney council election: business vote the latest battleground in long war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were estimates that up to 140,000 business voters could have been eligible, but just shy of 23,000 enrolled after an $8 million enrolment effort from the City.

Sitting Liberal councillor Christine Forster is seen as the main threat, but there is also a strong campaign from independent councillor Angela Vithoulkas, who is running an independent \u2018Sydney Matters\u2019 team focused on winning votes from local businesses.

He went after Hillary Clinton, mocking her recent interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-clinton-foreign-policy-forum-key-quotes\">with television host Matt Lauer</a>. </p> <p>\u201cshe should have been facing a grand jury, not Matt Lauer!\u201d he said. </p> <p>To the crowd\u2019s delight he extolled Trump\u2019s pledge to build up the military. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s not afraid to talk to Putin, because he can negotiate from strength,\u201d Giuliani said. </p> <p>It appears to make little political sense for Trump to campaign in his most devoted quarter, at this point in the race. Most candidates, traditionally, would be drumming up votes in areas more likely swing blue or red \u2014 Iowa, or Ohio, or even other parts of Florida. </p> <p>But Trump\u2019s methods continue to defy political gravity. Since his foray last week into truly oppositional and voteless territory \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">across the border to Mexico</a> \u2013 his poll numbers have steadily risen, and they now show him nearly even with Clinton. </p> <p>One group of supporters did not make a return to Friday\u2019s rally: the singing, dancing girl group called Freedom Kids. Their song during his last visit to Pensacola became a hit on social media, with lyrics including:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Enemies of freedom</p> <p>Face the music \u2013 come on boys, take \u2019em down!</p> <p>President Donald Trump knows how </p> <p>to make America great</p> <p>Deal from strength or get crushed</p> <p>every time</p> </blockquote> <p>But now the group\u2019s manager and one girl\u2019s father, Jeff Popick, allege Trump \u201cplayed\u201d the girls and didn\u2019t pay them. Last week he filed suit against the campaign, seeking $5,000 to $15,000. </p> <p>The Trump camp has not responded publicly to the suit, but it has 20 days from the receiving it to respond, according to the girls\u2019 lawyer. </p>",
