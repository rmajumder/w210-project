Both parties allow a conscience vote on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s introduced into parliament, most certainly we will vote on it,\u201d Giles said.</p> <p>Gunner said Labor would introduce a bill and support it. He said Purick had done a good job with what she had, trying to put forward the bill.</p> <p>Giles disagreed and said he would have voted for the bill, but \u201cKezia did a terrible job\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf it was put to the vote it would have passed, the numbers were there,\u201d Giles said.</p> <p>He said Purick never called him to ask if he supported it. At the time it was brought forward there was some dissatisfaction across parliament at the level of communication by Purick.</p> <p>Purick told Guardian Australia she had spoken to the health minister and other MPs, but had no obligation to consult any member of government or opposition in bringing forward a private member\u2019s bill.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s forum also discussed the recent scandal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/03/an-operational-matter-dylan-voller-could-be-restrained-in-chair-again-says-adam-gilesw\">mistreatment inside juvenile detention</a>.</p> <p>Giles conceded there had been a cultural problem inside juvenile detention but much of that was due to inadequate training, which had since been increased.</p> <p>Olga Havnen, chief executive of the Danila Dilba Aboriginal health service, said the Don Dale juvenile detention centre was \u201cDickensian\u201d, and agreed training was an issue but \u201chousing children in an ex-adult prison \u2026 is certainly not conducive to changing cultural practices\u201d.</p> <p>Giles said a recent review of the system by Keith Hamburger had found the previous Labor government should have built a new juvenile centre instead of the $1.7bn adult facility outside Darwin.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/adam-giles-juvenile-detention-report-northern-territory-royal-commission\">Giles last week reneged on a repeatedly offered commitment</a> that he would release the Hamburger review.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate public policy to think we need to build more jails,\u201d Havnen said.</p> <p>The chief executive of Anglicare NT, David Pugh, said the federal government was involved in child protection nearly as much as the NT government, but \u201cthere is almost zero cooperation that I can see\u201d between the two in relation to early childhood planning.</p> <p>He said the NT Department of Children and Families was under-resourced and was \u201cbunkered down in a corner\u201d with no overarching plan, and the NT was struggling to work with its own geography.</p> <p>Gunner said there had to be \u201cgenerational transformational change\u201d. He said an elected Labor government would have a minister for children, which oversaw health, education and child protection to avoid \u201csilos\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",
  "<p>The divers had to plunge into a green pool; the windsurfers were advised to keep their mouths shut in dirty Guanabara Bay. Everyone was at least a tiddly bit worried about Zika. To the list of indignities facing Olympic athletes we can now add: falling ash.</p> <p>Shortly before Britain\u2019s ladies hockey team took to the pitch to thrash Spain 3-1 on Monday night, a huge forest fire began to rage&#xa0;on the hillside above the Olympic annex in Deodoro, a no-man\u2019s land of half\u2011finished favelas and pungent rivers 40km west of Rio. The sky darkened as smoke filled the air. A strong wind dumped a load of ash right on to the field, bringing back memories of that Icelandic volcano with all the consonants that ruined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/16/volcanic-ash-cloud-grounds-planes\" title=\"\">spring</a> in 2010.</p> <p>An hour before bully-off, the venue organisers dispatched volunteers to the pitch to pick up the falling ash, like a particularly sisyphean edition of The Crystal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/10/game-on-the-crystal-maze-is-back-and-this-time-youre-all-invited\" title=\"\">Maze</a> finale. They were always on to a loser, and before long the venue\u2019s water cannons were deployed to wash the pitch as an insanely enthusiastic man in a mint green headband made a gallant attempt to gee up the initially lukewarm crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/15/rio-2016-olympics-day-ten-athletics-omnium-dressage-sailing-live\">Rio Olympics 2016: boxing, hockey and Spain v Argentina basketball \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The result of the cannon deployment was a somewhat waterlogged pitch that brought to mind every Year 10 match your correspondent ever played in the swamps of Morecambe. As the women warmed up, each thwack of the luminous yellow balls produced a substantial amount of spray, perhaps unwelcome on what was a slightly nippy Olympic evening in what amounts to the Brazilian winter.</p> <p>If Britain\u2019s women were unhappy about the prospect of mid-match smoke inhalation, they didn\u2019t show it as they jogged cheerfully on to the pitch to perform a full-throated rendition of God Save the Queen. Hockey girls are like that: always willing to make the best of a bad situation. They were cheered along by a small but vocal gaggle of Brits, some dressed as knights, others with drums, who outsung the Spanish contingent with relish.</p> <p>The British women showed their intent within the first minute by winning a penalty corner. The Spanish defence wisely put on Hannibal Lecter <a href=\"http://gohockey.com/feature-player-safety-are-we-doing-enough-shockingly-face-masks-are-being-banned/\" title=\"\">masks</a> to protect themselves from the power of Hannah Macleod, who whacked the ball to Crista Cullen. Cullen, a hardnut who sleeps in a tent whenever she returns to her native Kenya, boshed the ball right on target, but it was saved by the Spanish goalkeeper, Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez de Eguilaz. Despite having had the honour of representing her country more than 130 times in international competition, L\u00f3pez de Eguilaz says it is her dream to win the lottery so she can become a writer instead of having 11 angry women pelt rock-hard balls in her face.</p> <p>As the time in the first of four 15-minute quarters ticked down, 25-year-old Georgie Twigg scored her first goal of the tournament. Twigg was part of Team GB\u2019s bronze-winning squad in London 2012 and has put her legal career on hold while she pursues her international sporting career.</p> <p>The captain, Helen Richardson-Walsh, soon followed her with another goal. She and her team-mate Kate Richardson-Walsh are the first married couple to play hockey together for Team GB ladies, having fallen in love on the pitch and tied the knot three years ago. Both are competing at their fourth Olympic Games. A third goal followed from the 24-year-old Giselle Ansley, an enthusiastic baker, with just over three minutes left of the second quarter.</p> <p>It took until the eighth minute of the final quarter before Spain got a goal past Maddie \u201cMad Dog\u201d Hinch, GB\u2019s fearless goalie. The scorer was Georgina Oliva.</p> <p>Shona McCallin and Ansley both received green cards, hockey\u2019s equivalent of being sent to the naughty step, but the Spaniards failed to take advantage of their automatic two-minute suspensions. Spain won three penalty corners in quick succession with less than four minutes left but failed to score.</p> <p>As they prepare for the semi-final against New Zealand on Wednesday, the British team will be hoping to improve on their London 2012 performance, when a 3-1 win over that nation secured them the bronze medal and ended a 20-year Olympic medal drought for the women\u2019s team. The performance in London matched Great Britain\u2019s best ever Olympic performance, as they also claimed bronze at the 1992 Games in Barcelona. In total, eight of the women\u2019s team who won bronze at London 2012 have returned to Rio.</p> <p>The competition has changed slightly in the intervening four years, with games now divided into four 15-minute quarters instead of two 35-minute halves. Between 1988 and 1996, Great Britain made the semi-finals at three consecutive Olympic Games, but failed to maintain that record at the 2000 Games in Sydney, where they finished eighth with just a single pool victory. Worse followed when they missed qualification for the 2004 Games in Athens. That failure triggered an administration change and a resurgence that eventually led to sixth place at the 2008 Games in Beijing.</p>",

I hesitate to call a satirical half-hour talk show a \u201cgrand experiment\u201d, but it was as close as one can get because the overriding topic of conversation was almost always race \u2013 a subject Americans aren\u2019t always excited to discuss frankly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/nightly-show-larry-wilmore-cancelled-comedy-central\">Comedy Central cancels The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if the network stressed that the show would have mass appeal, the very fact that black and brown faces dominated the program both in front of and behind the camera necessitated discussions of race, far more than on any other late-night talk show. As such, the format of The Nightly Show did not lend itself to the cocktail party vibe of the biggest late-night franchises: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jimmy-fallon\">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/james-corden\">The Late Late Show with James Corden</a>. A light-hearted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/21/michelle-obama-on-carpool-karaoke-with-james-corden-video\">carpool karaoke</a>-esque segment would jar viewers next to a conversation about the trials of the police officers involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/freddie-gray\">the death of Freddie Gray </a>or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/dallas-protest-shooting-hillary-clinton-email-case\"> the attacks on cops in Dallas</a>. A Hollywood Reporter piece on the cancellation <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/larry-wilmore-nightly-show-canceled-919407\">pointed to Wilmore\u2019s de-emphasizing of so-called \u201cviral hits\u201d</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to have the type of things that [Jimmy] Fallon and [James] Corden do, like the [carpool] karaoke type of thing or lip sync battle and those types of things because those are such pure comic things,\u201d Wilmore had told the Reporter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NysITFb_Wbs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NysITFb_Wbs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s peculiar that there would even be a question as to whether The Nightly Show would attempt to engage in that world. Its lead-in was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/18/jon-stewart-why-i-quit-the-daily-show\">The Daily Show</a>, the doyenne of modern televised American satire. The Daily Show directly birthed The Nightly Show (and before that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/18/colbert-report-10-best-moments\">The Colbert Report</a>); plus, the stars of HBO\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>, TBS\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tbs.com/shows/full-frontal-with-samantha-bee.html\">Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert\">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a> are all Daily Show alums. The viral success of those shows usually comes down to the timeliness and passion of the host\u2019s monologues or a clever remote piece.</p> <p>The Nightly Show shined the brightest with its panel \u2013 a healthy mix of media personalities, such as MTV News\u2019s <a href=\"http://anamariecox.typepad.com/\">Ana Marie Cox</a> and New York magazine\u2019s<a href=\"http://nymag.com/author/Rembert%20Browne/\"> Rembert Browne</a>, and minority comedians including <a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/05/mike-yard-nightly-show/\">Mike Yard</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=Grace+Parra&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch\">Grace Parra</a>. At times, it felt like the vital conversations on black and feminist Twitter finally had a safe home on TV. Those conversations could be funny, but they were also vital. In the aftermath of the cancellation, one must ask if there\u2019s still a home for satire from a minority perspective on television.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/michael-che-15486\">Michael Che </a>still holds his seat on Saturday Night Live\u2019s Weekend Update and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/02/trevor-noah-on-replacing-jon-stewart-and-changing-the-daily-show\">Trevor Noah\u2019s hosting of the Daily Show</a> is an important step in the right direction, which Comedy Central president Kent Alterman pointed out in his statement on the cancellation decision. But SNL can\u2019t go into the depth that The Nightly Show could, with a full half-hour devoted to racial issues, and Trevor Noah\u2019s experience as a South African is different from Wilmore\u2019s as an African American. This is not to say that Noah can\u2019t speak on American race issues, but the scars of our particular brand of racism are unique.</p> <p>There\u2019s hope in the form of shows like NBC\u2019s sitcom <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/the-carmichael-show\">The Carmichael Show</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adultswim.com/videos/the-eric-andre-show/\">Adult Swim\u2019s The Eric Andre Show</a>. Both programs look at race in different ways \u2013 Jerrod Carmichael\u2019s series uses the classic family comedy template inherited from 1970s Norman Lear shows like<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066626/\"> All in the Family</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072519/\">The Jeffersons</a> to tweak American race relations. Andre is far more surreal and casts a sideways glance at prejudice \u2013 smashing his way through his point rather than batting it around gently.</p> <p>The medium of the late-night talk show offers so much to the conversation on race, though. Having a Last Week Tonight or Full Frontal devoted to these issues is needed at a time when there\u2019s still so much resistance to even talking about racism from people like Donald Trump and his cronies. Even with the end of The Nightly Show and black comics such as W Kamau Bell and Hannibal Burress struggling to keep their shows on the air, there\u2019s ample talent waiting in the wings, both as hosts and writers. Minorities and allies need to support these shows when they deserve it. Seek out comics like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UlYe6tap6Q\">Solomon Georgio</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Travon\">Travon Free</a> and The Nightly Show alum <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chescaleigh\">Franchesca Ramsey</a>.

It\u2019s far too soon to be sure about anything. But there have been a couple of indications that normal service has been restored at the top, that Leicester City\u2019s insurrection may well have been a one-off. Yesterday Manchester United won a fixture they lost last season, beating Bournemouth in Jose Mourinho\u2019s first game in charge. Manchester City were promisingly peppy in the first half against Sunderland on Saturday evening and ground out a win. Arsenal ... well, y\u2019know. Moving on, then, Liverpool impressed during that blistering 20-minute spell either side of half-time at the Emirates. Overall it\u2019s been a strong start from the big boys \u2013 and a bad one from Leicester, who lost to a Hull City side that was supposed to be mired in crisis. </p> <p>But perhaps the clearest indication of whether there\u2019s going to be more of last season\u2019s unpredictability will come from this fixture. The Antonio Conte era starts here, with a home game against Slaven Bilic\u2019s refreshingly entertaining West Ham United side, and while the former Juventus manager arrives in London with a strong reputation after his star turn at Euro 2016, no one is quite sure what to expect from the new Chelsea boss. If everything goes to plan from a Chelsea perspective, expect to see invigorated performances from the likes of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard, whose pungent performances were some of the main causes for the need to fumigate Stamford Bridge this summer. Conte, after all, played a major role in the revival of Juventus, winning three consecutive Serie A titles, and he almost took an underwhelming Italy team to the last four in France. The signs are that Chelsea have found an astute tactician and a manic man manager who will inspire absolute devotion from his players. N\u2019Golo Kante should plug a few gaps in midfield and Michy Batshuayi offers speed and quality up front.</p> <p>Conte\u2019s record inspires optimism \u2013 and yet it is unwise to assume that all of Chelsea\u2019s weaknesses have been eradicated simply because of a managerial change. A dark cloud hovered over Mourinho\u2019s head last season and poured acid rain on anyone who dared stand near him. Yet Chelsea hardly exploded into life after his departure in December, defensive reinforcements are yet to arrive and a mooted move for Romelu Lukaku remains up in the air. West Ham challenged for Champions League qualification last season, finished seventh and were excellent against the top sides, securing several famous wins at home and on their travels. They\u2019ve made some good signings and if they play well against London rivals who have lorded it above them for the best part of 20 years, it will suggest that the Premier League has indeed become more equal. This fixture isn\u2019t the home banker it would have been a two or three seasons ago. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>8pm BST.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T17:35:43.625Z\">at 6.35pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>It didn\u2019t take long for Dougie Freedman\u2019s hunch about Yannick Bolasie to pay off. Less than 30 seconds into his first appearance for Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on 1 September 2012 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/01/crystal-palace-sheffield-wednesday-championship\" title=\"\">against Sheffield Wednesday</a>, the spindly 22-year-old born in Lyon to Congolese parents but raised in north-west London picked up the loose ball on the edge of the penalty box, bamboozled his marker and delivered a cross that Glenn Murray simply could not miss.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been after that kind of player for a long time,\u201d Freedman reflected a few weeks later. \u201cWe kept tabs on him for about six months and we were very fortunate to finally get him.

But, starting out at non-league Rushden &amp; Diamonds and Hillingdon Borough, a five-year contract at Goodison Park worth an estimated \u00a320m is rich reward for the grime-loving winger whose professional career began in the Maltese Premier League and has taken in stops at Plymouth, Barnet and Bristol City.</p> <p>Tony Finnigan, who played in midfield for Palace between 1984 and 1988 before becoming an agent, remembers watching Bolasie for the first time while he was on loan at Barnet.</p> <p>\u201cHe went up for a goalkick with the centre-half and both players missed the ball,\u201d Finnigan tells the Guardian. \u201cEveryone thought it was going to go out for a throw but he got up and sprinted to keep the ball in, did a trick and got to the byline to win a corner. Then he took the corner with his left foot.\u201d</p> <p>Suitably impressed, he sought out Bolasie after the match, arranged to meet his parents and told them he could make their son a Premier League player within three years. He wasn\u2019t far off.</p> <p>Things did not quite work out at Home Park at first but Bolasie forced his way into the Plymouth team before administration struck. With Finnigan\u2019s help, he was purchased for just \u00a310,000 by Palace\u2019s current assistant manager Keith Millen, then in charge of Bristol City, after failing a medical at Watford owing to a knee injury.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard he was available, I was really excited,\u201d said Millen at the time. \u201cPlayers like Bolasie don\u2019t become available at that price very often and it was simply too good an opportunity to turn down.\u201d</p> <p>Five years on, the Robins can expect a cheque of around \u00a34m after inserting a 15% sell-on clause when he was bought by Freedman a year later for \u00a3350,000. When Bolasie signed, the former Scotland striker remembered telling him if he could be half as good as emerging talent Wilfried Zaha \u201cthat would be fine. Yala said: \u2018I\u2019ll be better.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>With both wingers providing the bullets for Murray, Palace recovered from losing their first three games and had moved into the top four by the time Freedman controversially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/23/dougie-freedman-crystal-palace-bolton-wanderers\" title=\"\">defected to Bolton</a> at the end of October.</p> <p>Ian Holloway took over but ended up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/23/ian-holloway-crystal-palace-resigned\" title=\"\">just missing out on automatic promotion</a> from the Championship. After a 0-0 draw at home in the first leg, he left Bolasie on the bench for the second leg of the play-off semi-final against arch rivals Brighton before the winger\u2019s cross for Zaha that eventually broke the deadlock 21 minutes from time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/11/crystal-palace-yanick-bolassie-grime-winger\">The life and grime of Crystal Palace\u2019s rapping winger Yannick Bolasie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet Holloway again let him out of the starting lineup as a penalty from Kevin Phillips against Watford sealed Palace\u2019s return to the top flight. That summer, having fulfilled his father\u2019s dream of playing for Democratic Republic of Congo despite initially turning them down, Bolasie decided to get serious. Thanks to a new fitness programme which he attributed to his trainer Rayan Wilson in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/11/crystal-palace-yanick-bolassie-grime-winger\" title=\"\">interview with the Observer in October 2014</a>, his body changed from a beanpole to \u201ca beast\u201d.</p> <p>The results have been stunning. Despite failing to score a single goal \u2013 a regular bone of contention that was seized on by Bradley Wright-Phillips in their regular MC battles \u2013 Bolasie filled the creative gap left by Zaha\u2019s \u00a310m departure to Manchester United and his all-round performances were integral to Palace\u2019s 11th-placed finish as they survived a season in the Premier League for the first time. Already blessed with speed and unpredictable ball skills honed by hours spent dodging the Wendy house and slide at his local playground in Willesden, the 27-year-old\u2019s powerful physique now gives him an edge over most opponents in the strength department as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt can take time for some players to reach their potential, especially if you have come through the non-league,\u201d says Finnigan, who parted company with Bolasie after Palace\u2019s promotion but remains on good terms with him.</p> <p>\u201cManagers in England want wingers to work hard for the team and that sometimes sacrifices what they are best at. Dougie Freedman recognised he was a maverick who needs to be shown he is trusted and that\u2019s why he has improved so much in the last few years. His uniqueness makes him special.\u201d</p> <p>While the statistics do not exactly stand out \u2013 only nine goals in his last two seasons \u2013 Palace\u2019s continued over-reliance on Bolasie despite the return of Zaha was underlined during his two-month absence with a back injury last season when they failed to win any of the nine Premier League games he missed. A few months earlier, Pardew had insisted he would not sell his prized asset for \u00a340m \u2013 a suggestion that does not seem quite as ludicrous now given the fee being stumped up by Everton.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dougie Freedman recognised he was a maverick who needs to be shown he is trusted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while the club have always publicly insisted Bolasie was not on the market, a series of improved contracts signed each summer after switching agents has reflected a gradual move towards the exit door from both parties. The latest \u2013 worth around \u00a360,000-a-week and signed last summer \u2013 was designed to maintain his value in anticipation of sizeable offers being received in the future.</p> <p>Tottenham tried and failed to tempt Palace into selling Bolasie last summer, while Leicester also made enquiries in January after encouragement from former assistant Steve Walsh. His move to Goodison Park to become director of football prompted Everton to pick up the mantle and, with the help of the former Sunderland chief executive turned agent Margaret Byrne, who resigned over her handling of the Adam Johnson child sex abuse case, the mega-money transfer has now come to fruition.</p> <p>\u201cHe fully deserves all the success that is coming his way,\u201d Finnigan says. \u201cAt Everton he\u2019ll be under a different kind of pressure but Ronald Koeman is the kind of manager who can take him to the next level. I\u2019m glad Palace have got that much money because they deserve it for taking a chance on him. I feel very proud.\u201d</p> <p>Everton fans will be crossing their fingers he can maintain his upward trajectory.</p>",

However, these closures have not come about by changes made to the women\u2019s section.\u201d<br></p> <p>Despite the anger among regional volunteers, the national chair of the women\u2019s section and legion board trustee Marilyn Humphry insisted that the charity\u2019s leadership was united in its determination to find a consensual way forward.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Royal British Legion and The Royal British Legion women\u2019s section are currently working together on a plan that is amenable to both parties.</p> <p>\u201cThe women\u2019s section understands the need to integrate and the legion understands the need to take into account the wishes of the women\u2019s section, and values the contribution its members make to our work with the armed forces community.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe are in a position where the trustees are listening to our concerns and I would not wish to see this jeopardised in any way.\u201d</p> <p>However, Sandra Saban, the chairman of Essex women\u2019s section and a member of the women\u2019s section central committee, said it was too little, too late: \u201cWe have raised a lot of money over the years for our beneficiaries and it is our beneficiaries we are worried about.\u201d</p>",

He said: \u201cHe always had a smile on his face \u2013 and played football with a smile on his face. He was popular in the dressing room, had terrific ability and did it in the big games.

The death is the latest linked to Taser use by police.</p> <p>There were reports that he was agitated before he was Tasered, and neighbour Paula Quinn said that he appeared to be \u201calmost staggering\u201d in the street. He was said to have gone into cardiac arrest in an ambulance on his way to hospital and medics were unable to save him. </p> <p>His former friend and team-mate Carlton Palmer said he had struggled after his sporting career ended. \u201cIt can be difficult for players when they finish and I know Dalian found it difficult,\u201d Palmer told PA Sport. \u201cFootballers don\u2019t know anything else. Dalian would not have finished his career financially secure and he was scratching around doing stuff. \u201cWhen you finish as a footballer, all of a sudden at 34 or 35 you have no routine and no structure to your life, and that can be a major problem. It can be a very dangerous spiral and unfortunately that\u2019s what it was for Dalian.\u201d </p> <p>The IPCC said \u201ca Taser was used on the man before he became ill,\u201d indicating the initial focus of their investigation is whether the use of Taser directly contributed to the death of the former Aston Villa star. Central to its inquiry will be whether police were justified in firing the Taser and whether it was used correctly.<br></p> <p>The police watchdog investigation into the death will include whether Atkinson was intoxicated or not and whether officers believed he was. No other weapon was recovered from the scene and the two officers present when the Taser was fired, and two who later attended, are understood to be unharmed.</p> <p>Atkinson made his debut as a teenager at Ipswich in 1985, ultimately earning a transfer to Ron Atkinson\u2019s Sheffield Wednesday in 1989. Wednesday were relegated but Atkinson had burnished his reputation enough to earn a move to Real Sociedad where he became the first black player to play for the Spanish club. After scoring 12 league goals in his sole season in the Basque country, Atkinson returned to England to work again with his namesake, this time at Aston Villa.</p> <p>Built around the Irish stars of Ray Houghton, Andy Townsend and Paul McGrath, the team were an experienced side. Atkinson provided youthful flair and exuberant pace. These talents were displayed no more clearly than on the pitch at Plough Lane in October 1992, when Atkinson scored a goal that would come to be a symbol of the renascent national game and define his career.</p> <p>Picking up the ball in his own half, Atkinson accelerated away from three defenders, apparently gliding over the cut-up pitch. He then beat a fourth defender twice, before opting to swap power for grace and chipping the ball over a stranded Hans Segers. The ground went crazy and a fan came on to the rain-strewn pitch to cover Atkinson with an umbrella. His strike was later named goal of the season.</p> <p>Atkinson the manager has always said that, had Atkinson the player not been injured shortly after this game, Villa would have gone on to win the league that season (they eventually finished second). The pair won the League Cup together the following year, Dalian Atkinson scoring in the final. Soon he was on the move again, first to Turkish football and then further afield, to South Korea and Saudi Arabia. After retiring from the game, Atkinson ventured into becoming an agent for other players. But his company, Players Come First, was wound down in 2013. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Paulmcgrath5/status/765140137344917505\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Don&#39;t feel to gud at the moment , Dalian Atkinson was a huge part of the Villa family I played with lovely kid and friend R.I.P pal Xx.</p>&mdash; Paul McGrath (@Paulmcgrath5) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Paulmcgrath5/status/765140137344917505\">August 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JackGrealish1/status/765139362048794624\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">RIP Dalian Atkinson.

Official figures show that black people are more likely than white people to be Tasered. Tasers deliver a 50,000 volts shock to incapacitate people and critics say the weapon is too often lethal.</p> <p>Deborah Coles from Inquest, which supports families who have lost loved ones after contact with the state, said: \u201cThere is increased arming of the police around the country with Taser. The danger is they are being used as a first resort rather than a last resort. We know that black men are disproportionately represented in terms of people who are Tasered.\u2019</p> <p>Police officers believe Tasers help protect them and maintain the tradition of British officers not carrying firearms. In a recent knife rampage by a man in central London which left one person dead, and five injured, Taser meant the suspect was arrested and detained alive, whilst in other jurisdictions he may have been shot and killed.</p> <p>In a statement, the IPCC said: \u201cTwo police officers initially attended the address and whilst in contact with Mr Atkinson outside the property one of the officers discharged a Taser. Further police officers then arrived. Mr Atkinson became unwell and an ambulance was called. He was treated at the scene and taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead.\u201d</p> <p>The IPCC added: \u201cIPCC investigators have been conducting house-to-house enquiries in the immediate area and gathering available information. Police logs and radio transmissions are being obtained. The police officers involved and independent witnesses will be interviewed by IPCC investigators. Initial data from the Taser has been downloaded and it is being sent for further testing.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: Matthew Weaver</em></p>",

Four men have run quicker over the distance this year, with the American LaShawn Merritt leading the rankings at 19.74sec, a hundredth of a second faster than Justin Gatlin, the silver medallist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-surges-past-justin-gatlin-to-win-historic-olympic-100m-gold-in-rio\">in Sunday\u2019s 100m</a>.</p> <p>But, as always, Bolt turns up as the prohibitive favourite. He has not lost a major 200m championship final since his victory at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and it would be the most stunning upset of these Games if that pattern were to change.</p> <p>And long past the bewitching hour there was a twinkle in Bolt\u2019s eye as he indulged those asking about his chances of breaking his 200m world record of 19.19, set in Berlin in 2009. \u201cThis is one of the biggest things,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI really want that record \u2013 and I think if I can get a good night\u2019s rest after the semi-finals, it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-the-human-races-ultimate-speed-freak\">Usain Bolt: the human race's ultimate speed freak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the bald form of Sunday night\u2019s 100m final, such talk appears more foolhardy than bold. Bolt crossed the line in 9.81, his slowest championship winning time \u2013 a far cry from when he raced away from the field to set an Olympic record of 9.63 in London four years ago. Yet there were extenuating circumstances. Usually the gap between the semi-finals and final is at least two hours, allowing sprinters time to rest their bodies and minds. This time they were rushed out and back again in 80 minutes.</p> <p>Something else is worth bearing in mind. Last week Bolt told friends that he felt he was in sub-9.7 shape for the 100m. If true, an assault on the 200m world record perhaps isn\u2019t such a pipe dream, especially if the hot weather holds and ferments with the adrenaline of the crowd as it did on Sunday. The Jamaican knows from watching Wayde Van Niekerk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/wayde-van-niekerk-olympic-gold-400m-world-record\">shatter Michael Johnson\u2019s two-decade old 400m record</a> that the electric blue Mondo track in Rio deserves its reputation as the fastest of all time.</p> <p>Before the start of the 100m final, each athlete was introduced one by one to a thudding techno beat. This was the biggest moment in most of their careers. Understandably, most were pensive. Not Bolt, who waved and smiled at his adoring fans. He would probably be relaxed in front of a firing squad. No doubt he would back himself to outrun their bullets. Gatlin, predictably, was booed \u2013 his reputation for failed drugs tests preceding him. Afterwards even Bolt admitted that he found the booing \u201cshocking\u201d.</p> <p>The American heard the screeching catcalls and jeers, but tuned them out. \u201cThey don\u2019t know me, they don\u2019t know Justin,\u201d he pleaded afterwards. \u201cAnd I have the respect of my own competitors in the 100m. That\u2019s all I really care about.\u201d</p> <p>Gatlin quickly sent the boos to the back of his mind. And for a few brief moments after the gun sounded, it appeared as if he might just have the run on the field. Even at 34 the American\u2019s start remains a work of technical beauty: his body perfectly in tune with the starter\u2019s pistol. As usual he was out of his blocks quickest and led by a metre at halfway. Bolt, by contrast, did not so much explode from the blocks as rise stiffly from them: like a man with a slipped disc getting upright after sleeping on a hard mattress.</p> <p>But once he got into his stride it was over. From 60m to 70m Bolt caught up and then catapulted away. As he crossed the line he was slowing down, hand across his chest in salute: mission accomplished. Gatlin found himself in second again, in 9.89, while the Canadian Andre de Grasse took bronze in 9.91.</p> <p>Bolt said: \u201cIt was very hard to run fast because the turnaround time was so short it was ridiculous. I felt so good in the semi-finals but by the time I got back to the warm up area I had to start warming up again. For me it was really stupid. That\u2019s why the race was slow.\u201d</p> <p>Still, victory ensured he was back treading the familiar path of gold and Olympic glory \u2013 and thirsting for more of the same. \u201cSomebody said if I win these three gold medals I would be immortal and I kind of liked it,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here to prove myself as one of the greats, to set myself apart from everyone else, so I\u2019m going to run with that one.\u201d</p> <p>Few would bet against him. Even now, despite all track and field\u2019s scandals and suspicions, being the fastest man on the planet carries enormous bragging rights. And yet again Bolt has the swagger of a king.</p>",

  "<p>The main reason behind the leave vote on 23 June, <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/\" title=\"\">at least according to the polls</a>, was to take back control \u2013 to repatriate lawmaking powers from Brussels to Westminster. But if that was the emotional appeal, the most tangible prospect was of an immigration policy made in Britain. The challenge that now faces British politicians \u2013 in particular the government, which is committed, in the prime minister\u2019s words, to making Brexit mean Brexit \u2013 is to work out how to respond to voters\u2019 fears in a way that is clear and transparent and economically viable too. That means balancing freedom of movement with access to the single market. A result, in Brexit terms, must be fewer EU workers.</p> <p>That, however, raises another set of difficult questions: questions about who will do the jobs that EU workers were coming to the UK to do, and what they will be paid. Britain\u2019s infamous low-wage sectors \u2013 agriculture and food processing, clothing manufacture and retail, domestic services \u2013 are already facing two significant new pressures. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/no-10-resists-pressure-to-hold-off-launching-national-living-wage\" title=\"\">national living wage</a> is already in play and will increase hourly wages to approximately \u00a39 an hour by 2020. Then, from next May, for larger employers, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work\" title=\"\">the apprenticeship levy</a> will also be applied. If, in addition, there are fewer EU workers, that is likely to mean more upward pressure on pay. Some employers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/16/employers-claw-back-national-living-wage-cuts-pay-perks\" title=\"\">are already clawing back other benefits</a> in response to the living wage, and warning of existential threats.</p> <p>Contemplating the consequences of Brexit is clarifying the real impact of the movement of 21st-century labour. The latest research from the Resolution Foundation summarises the impact of high levels of migration from the new accession countries after 2004. It acknowledges that those who argued that migration was an unmitigated good, growing the economy to the benefit of all, overstated their case \u2013 almost as much as did those who argued that migration was invariably harmful. The latter were right that in low-paying sectors, wages were held down. But EU migrants also tended to contribute more in taxes than they received in benefits. Maybe the biggest impact is contradictory: it concealed the other marked development in the period, particularly after the 2008 crash \u2013 the wider stagnation of wages.</p> <p>Of course, pay was not the only reason that migrant workers came to be so resented. Queues for doctors\u2019 appointments and overcrowded classrooms were easier to see than differences in pay, and they played a bigger part in fuelling resentment. Yet in the same way that migration concealed structural change in wages, its impact on public services served as a distraction from the real cost of the austerity measures brought in by the coalition government in 2010.</p> <p>What is already becoming clear, and will only become clearer as EU membership is more fully examined, is that Britain\u2019s labour market does not function well. If EU migration has held pay down, it ought to follow that pay will go up in response to the labour shortages that are likely to be the consequence of a cut in migration. Not so much, according to the Resolution Foundation. The original impact of cheap labour was to cut at most a few pence off wages, and only from the pay of \u201cnative\u201d workers with no qualifications; on the foundation\u2019s projections, the likely effect of cutting EU economic migration will simply reverse that. And if, as projected, the economy shrinks, it is likely to mean a downward pressure on wages that could outweigh the impact of labour shortages.</p> <p>In theory, scarce labour should also be an incentive to invest and modernise in a way that the plentiful supply of low-paid workers has made unnecessary until now. The teams of car valets from Lithuania will be replaced by an upgraded version of the drive-through car wash that had almost disappeared, and supermarkets will at last introduce the kind of electronic pricing system that is commonplace in France. UK productivity may even show an improvement. But it would also upend the British labour market model where high levels of employment are set against hyper-flexible working and low pay. Post Brexit, there may be fewer jobs, but they will be better paid.</p> <p>So far, so good. But there are much wider consequences, not least for millions of local authority workers and the councils that pick up their wages bill. There is a crisis already in the care home sector, and the NHS is in the grip of its worst ever cash shortage. Faced with challenges like this, the government will have to take some hard decisions about how it meets its pledge to the Brexiteers.</p>",
  "<p>The former legal manager at the News of the World, who ordered the surveillance of two solicitors engaged in litigation against the newspaper for phone hacking, has been cleared of professional misconduct after a disciplinary tribunal unanimously rejected all charges against him.</p> <p>Tom Crone, who was responsible for the tabloid\u2019s legal affairs at the height of the phone-hacking scandal, was accused of six charges of attempting to uncover an alleged affair between the solicitors to provide the paper with \u201cgood leverage\u201d in legal proceedings. If proved, he could have been disbarred.</p> <p> After the disciplinary tribunal rejected all charges, Crone, who represented himself in the hearing, said: \u201cI\u2019m very relieved.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe way the evidence was presented against me \u2013 a very serious allegation of criminal conduct \u2013 was wholly unfair and utterly unwarranted by the evidence, which thankfully the tribunal acknowledges.\u201d</p> <p>The case brought by the Bar Standards Board was that Crone\u2019s purpose in organising surveillance of Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris in 2010 was to smear, embarrass and threaten them in order to gain an unfair advantage in legal proceedings. The surveillance found no evidence of any affair.</p> <p>On Monday, the judge, John Price, said that the five-person panel of the Bar Tribunals and Adjudication Service had been unanimous in their rejection of all charges against Crone. One of the key issues the panel considered in a tribunal where the standard of proof is the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d was Crone\u2019s intention in ordering surveillance of the lawyers.</p> <p>Price said: \u201cOur unanimous conclusion on counts one to four is we are not sure that Mr Crone\u2019s intention was to force Lewis and Harris to withdraw their claim or to settle more favourably.\u201d</p> <p>With regard to counts five and six, relating to the surveillance of the former wife and teenage daughter of Lewis, the question was whether by ordering the surveillance of Lewis, Crone had caused the surveillance of his family.</p> <p>Price said the panel was sure Crone had not authorised or caused the surveillance of Lewis\u2019s family.</p> <p>On that basis, the judge said: \u201cWe reject charges five and six as well.\u201d</p> <p>In earlier panel hearings, Crone admitted requesting that the solicitors Lewis and Harris, then both at the Manchester firm George Davies, which is now part of Mills and Reeve, be placed under surveillance in order to uncover an alleged affair, but he denied the charge that his purpose in doing so was to pressurise them to withdraw or settle advantageously.</p> <p>Crone told the panel that if Lewis and Harris were having an affair it would have provided circumstantial evidence that they were passing confidential information between between each other. The intention, he said, was to gather evidence to report them to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, alleging they had breached professional standards.</p> <p>Crone, who no longer practises law, joined Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK newspaper division in 1985 acting for both NoW and the Sun. He resigned in July 2011, the month in which the NoW closed.</p> <p>He was arrested in August 2012 in connection with the Metropolitan police\u2019s investigation into hacking but in October 2014 the Crown Prosecution Service announced he would not face charges.</p>",
  "<p>John Airs is in eminent company in asserting, wrongly, that Lord Justice Sales in the court of appeal \u201cnow decides that Labour shouldn\u2019t face the vote of some 130,000 new members\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/14/labour-trotsky-and-militants-blind-blunders\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 15 August). Jeremy Corbyn said much the same in his Observer interview on the previous day: \u201cPeople joined the Labour party \u2026 and were specifically told that they were able to vote in the leadership election and that was decided by the high court that they could. The appeal court has said they can\u2019t.\u201d According to the BBC, Mr Corbyn\u2019s campaign spokesperson went even further: \u201cA spokesman for leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign said Friday\u2019s verdict was legally and democratically \u2018wrong\u2019.\u201d In fact, Lord Justice Sales and the other judges of the court of appeal said only that the party\u2019s NEC had the power under the party\u2019s rules to decide the criteria for voting in the leadership election, and that its decision on the cut-off date for eligibility to vote was not illegal. The court made no comment either way on the wisdom, or lack of it, of the NEC\u2019s decision, only that the NEC was legally entitled to make it.</p> <p>This judicial upholding of the rights and powers of the party\u2019s highest elected body (between party conferences) ought to be welcome to all Labour party members, and especially to supporters of Mr Corbyn who will apparently have a majority on the NEC after next month\u2019s conference. The party\u2019s general secretary, Iain McNicol, and the relevant NEC committee were clearly right to defend those NEC rights by appealing against the high court\u2019s contrary judgment. Quite apart from Mr Corbyn and others\u2019 serious misinterpretation of the appeal court\u2019s decision, which was manifestly in favour of the Labour party, personal attacks on a senior judge whose judgment, along with that of his brother judges, may have appeared to be unwelcome ought to be completely out of order.

His pretended outrage at his \u201cdiscovery\u201d that the AWL wants Labour councils to \u201crefuse to implement cuts\u201d shows that his is not an honest democrat\u2019s concern with secretive infiltration (in which we are manifestly not engaged), but a political hostility to the advance of radical ideas.<br><strong>Daniel Randall</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I see that Tom Watson is continuing his campaign to keep Labour a Trot-free zone \u2013 but to guarantee success he should ally himself with disillusioned ex-Trotskyists in the party.

In light of the appalling practices at Sports Direct, it is only right that the Government imposes fines to send a clear signal to other rogue employers.\u201d</p> <p>In June, Sports Direct\u2019s billionaire founder Mike Ashley admitted his company had broken the law by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/sports-direct-agrees-back-pay-deal-with-hmrc-minimum-wage\">failing to pay staff the national minimum wage</a>.<br></p> <p>The concession, which was made when he appeared before MPs investigating his firm\u2019s treatment of its workers in June, confirmed the findings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">Guardian\u2019s investigation</a>, which revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">warehouse staff were required to go through searches at the end of each shift</a>, during which their time was unpaid. They also suffered deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift a minute late.</p> <p>The practices contributed to many staff being paid an effective rate of about \u00a36.50 an hour against the then statutory minimum wage rate of \u00a36.70, saving the firm millions of pounds a year at the expense of some of the poorest workers in the UK.</p> <p>Ashley told MPs that he had moved to address the queues of workers waiting, unpaid, to be searched at the end of each shift, but also admitted that docking workers 15 minutes\u2019 pay for being one minute late was unacceptable and unreasonable.</p> <p>Both practices had led to breaches of minimum wage legislation, the Guardian investigation found.</p> <p>HMRC said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about doing deals. While we don\u2019t discuss individual cases we won\u2019t accept anything less than what\u2019s owed. Our role is to investigate all cases where we believe an employer is not paying its workers the national minimum wage to ensure those workers receive what they are owed under the law.\u201d</p> <p>BEIS said: \u201cAll employers are automatically considered for naming where the investigation has been closed and the arrears owed are over \u00a3100. There are only very limited circumstances where an employer can avoid being named.\u201d</p> <p>Monday\u2019s announcement covers only those working in the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. Last month the Guardian revealed how the official investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s failure to pay workers the legal minimum is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/sports-direct-minimum-wage-probe-set-to-be-extended-to-shop-staff\">understood to have been widened to include the sportswear chain\u2019s 13,000 retail workers</a>. </p> <ul> <li>The changing world of work is an important area for the Guardian.

Many voters do want to support someone who most purely mirrors their ideals. They don\u2019t want to vote pragmatically or settle for the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>This is a real dilemma. But 2016 isn\u2019t the year for purity. Casting a vote for any of the alternative party or independent candidates in November could have truly disastrous effects.</p> <p>With Trump on the ballot, the risk of unintentionally helping elect an unstable man who is clearly not prepared for the job is too big. After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">past two weeks</a>, it\u2019s tempting to conclude that the pugnacious real estate tycoon has spontaneously combusted, like <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/60468/how-charles-dickens-fueled-world-spontaneous-combustion-truthers\">Old Krook</a> in Dickens\u2019 Bleak House. But by November, as has been true in most recent American elections, the gap between the two candidates will narrow. Even with all the self-inflicted wounds, Trump still starts out with a likely base of 170 electoral votes. Getting the next 100 needed for election will be extremely hard but not impossible. If Clinton is to win the swing states she needs to get to 270, she can\u2019t have too many votes siphoned away by fringe candidates like the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>When I combed through their platforms and records, I, too, found a lot to like about Stein and Johnson, especially after I listened to their one hour, <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/08/10/green-party-nominee-dr-jill-stein\">back</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/08/10/gary-johnson-on-what-it-means-to-be-a-libertarian\">back</a> interviews with Boston radio host Tom Ashbrook. Stein\u2019s sincerity and smarts were evident. Since she twice ran for governor of Massachusetts and once before for president in 2012 (she received 469,000 votes, more than separated JFK and Nixon in 1960), she was more seasoned as a politician than I expected. Her calls for free college tuition and a 15% federal minimum wage mirrored those of Bernie Sanders, some of whose followers are using the Twitter hashtag #jillnothill. As would be expected of a Green candidate, her top issue is protecting \u201cMother Earth\u201d, by dramatically reducing dependence on fossil fuels and banning nuclear power.</p> <p>Her central message is a direct play for disaffected Democrats: \u201cThe [Democratic party] boat is sinking and it\u2019s taking us down with it. This is the time to get off of that boat. We [progressives] have a lifeboat. It\u2019s called the Green party, so let\u2019s not sink together, let\u2019s sail together!\u201d</p> <p>Johnson, the genial former Republican governor of a Democratic state, New Mexico, was popular in office, lowering state taxes, expanding jobs and attracting more businesses. Although he says he\u2019s personally against abortion, he believes it\u2019s the woman\u2019s right to decide. His antipathy to stricter gun laws isn\u2019t surprising for a libertarian, but will turn off liberal voters in urban areas. He\u2019s for legalizing marijuana. His low-tax mantra will appeal to Republicans who think Trump\u2019s economic plan is voodoo, to use an old Geroge HW Bush word. Johnson does seem a viable alternative to Trump for Republicans who just can\u2019t stomach Clinton and perhaps for Sanders Democrats. Maine senator Susan Collins <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/susan-collins-no-clinton-226822\">suggested recently</a> that she\u2019s considering voting Libertarian.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that people will see that we don\u2019t have to sit by the sidelines and watch as the two major parties limit their choices to slightly different flavors of the status quo. It is, in fact, possible to join the fray, stand up for principles and offer a real alternative,\u201d Johnson has said.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also watched some television appearances by Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old factotum of the Republican party, who is running as an independent candidate. Virtually unknown, he is hardly the GOP\u2019s answer to finding a viable Trump alternative. I do give him credit for having the guts to try to drain Republicans away from Trump, but he just won\u2019t be a factor in November.</p> <p>None of this occasional likability translates into anything meaningful, however. None of these candidates could possibly win. So a casting a protest vote for any one of them is akin to throwing your vote away.</p> <p>The most influence they would hope to wield is if any of them reach 15% in national polls. That way, they could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/third-party-candidates-johnson-stein-mcmullin-debate-polling-percentage\">included in the presidential debates</a>, gaining much wider national exposure. Johnson probably has the best chance to make it in, but Trump opposes anything but a direct one-on-one with Clinton. Some suspect this is a ruse to withdraw from the debates altogether, rather than get creamed by Clinton.</p> <p>This extraordinary election is definitely a two-horse race. But the questions raised by the candidacies of both Sanders and Trump point to an uncertain future.</p> <p>A politically savvy friend of mine, who works for one of the American TV television networks, told me he thinks Trump may be the last GOP presidential nominee. This friend, a Republican, believes the party will never recover from the Trump disaster. It will splinter into various other entities, some of them to sit it out on the fringe.</p> <p>And what of those Democrats alienated by Hillary\u2019s pivot away from the left as she moves into territory vacated by Trump, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/hillary-clintons-embrace-of-kissinger-is-inexcusable/\">courting</a> Republican establishment figures such as Henry Kissinger?</p> <p>If there is no realignment, no recalibration, then the risk is that the angry voices on both left and right find no meaningful outlet. Third parties will never be a significant feature American politics, but after this election, the future shape of the two main ones is a question that cannot be neglected.</p>",

  "<p>It is half past midnight and I am at the Edinburgh festival fringe, pretending to masturbate a cucumber in a variety of elaborate ways. Under ordinary circumstances, this would seem like a fairly remarkable state of affairs, but then you don\u2019t know the day I\u2019ve had. I\u2019m into my 12th hour of an audience participation marathon. I\u2019ve spent the afternoon and evening literally running from venue to venue at the world\u2019s largest arts festival, taking part in as many shows as I can that require not just the presence of paying punters, but their active involvement. I have sung a Frank Sinatra song with a woman covered in blue paint. I have sat in a garden shed just off Lothian Street and read the Chilcot report aloud. I have played guitar for the first time in about 25 years, on stage, alongside a rock musician I once interviewed. </p> <p>I have had genuinely life-affirming experiences and I have felt mortified embarrassment on such a scale that, by comparison, pretending to elaborately masturbate a cucumber in a room full of people seems a mere bagatelle. This state of affairs is compounded by the fact that everybody else in the room is pretending to elaborately masturbate a cucumber as well, this being the climax \u2013 forgive me \u2013 of the Wank Bank Masterclass show, in which a charming and very funny gay Australian guy called Adam imparts the knowledge he accumulated while working, as he puts it, \u201cgiving on-call massages with happy endings to homos and business daddies\u201d in New York City. Some of his techniques are apparently derived from ancient Taoist Tantric techniques. Others, I suspect, are of his own devising: \u201cI call this one Rock Around the Cock.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6c972bbb703ea7b33f40b1677565545e6feb189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6c972bbb703ea7b33f40b1677565545e6feb189/0_214_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Petridis at the Wank Bank Masterclass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wanker of the day\u2019 \u2026 Alexis Petridis at the Wank Bank Masterclass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am doing all this because audience participation is a big thing at Edinburgh: not just in what you might call its traditional form \u2013 in which a luckless soul is hauled out of the crowd by a comedian who proceeds to make fun of them, to widespread hilarity \u2013 but in more complex and intriguing ways. There is an increasing reliance on members of the audience not just to be the butt of a joke, but to use their characters or skills or personal history to actively contribute to the richness of the show. \u201cA lot of the big fringe successes in recent years have had a certain degree of audience participation to them,\u201d says Tom Searle of production company Show and Tell. \u201cThere has been a real buzz around immersive theatre. Big shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/18/mime-trygve-wakenshaw-interview-mr-bean-nautilus-london-international-festival\">Trygve Wakenshaw</a>, The Boy With Tape on His Face, Dr Brown, Adam Riches, they all used people from the audience in a certain manner, often leaving them with quite a lot of stuff to do, never making them the joke, making them the star for five minutes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/01/nina-conti-review-criterion-theatre\">Nina Conti, who is now smashing it in the West End</a>, her show is very heavy on audience participation. Part of her ventriloquism act is getting people out of the crowd; she puts masks on them and talks for them, but the joke is never on them.\u201d</p> <p>One explanation for the rise might be to do with wider trends in popular culture. We live in a world where we expect virtually everything to be interactive to some degree, from the plethora of audience-voted talent and reality shows on TV to commenting on news stories online. Why should theatre and live comedy be any different? But Searle thinks there might be other reasons. \u201cIf someone can do it well and control an audience well, deal with the level of unpredictability involved, it garners a lot of credit and praise. If you are an audience member, you\u2019re really rooting for that person on stage; it creates an enormous amount of goodwill for that person, which then reflects on the performer and the rest of the show. It has a very positive effect on a show for an audience. It is absolutely a way of winning an audience over.\u201d</p> <p>But my first appointment is with an artist who\u2019s using audience participation not out of choice but necessity. Bron Batten has been performing <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on#q=%22Sweet%20Child%20Of%20Mine%22\">Sweet Child of Mine</a>, which <a href=\"https://bronbatten.com/sweet-child-of-mine/\">her website</a> describes as \u201ca mixture of theatre, dance standup and an awkward family function\u201d for five years; it has won rave reviews and awards at the Melbourne and Adelaide fringe festivals. The point of Sweet Child of Mine is that Batten performs it with her elderly father: it explores their relationship, not least his incomprehension at her choice of career and some of her more outre performances. But just before she was due to leave for Edinburgh, her father fell ill. Instead of cancelling the show\u2019s run at the Gilded Balloon, she is instead performing it with what she describes as \u201cstand-in Edinburgh dads\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1354adfa80faf3726a7a3bc2c3394c3e1fd0a2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1354adfa80faf3726a7a3bc2c3394c3e1fd0a2a/0_238_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playing Bron Batten\u2019s father in Sweet Child of Mine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The stuff of nightmares\u2019 \u2026 Playing Bron Batten\u2019s father in Sweet Child of Mine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Backstage, she talks about this turn of events positively, describing how each stand-in dad can bring their own experiences of life and fatherhood to the piece. She is in an ebullient mood \u2013 yesterday\u2019s show apparently went very well \u2013 but I confess I\u2019m not listening properly. Batten sent me the script a couple of days ago, but I only gave it a cursory glance. Now I\u2019m reading it closely with a sense of mounting horror. It is not that there are a lot of lines, and she is happy for me to read them off the page anyway. The monologues I have to deliver \u2013 one of them while Bron writhes around on stage in a puddle of blue paint \u2013 are fine, I can cope with them. It\u2019s the other stuff I\u2019m required to do. Possessed of a singing voice that can ruin everyone in earshot\u2019s day, I discover that one section involves me and Batten singing Frank and Nancy Sinatra\u2019s Somethin\u2019 Stupid. Another requires me to stand on stage, alone, at a microphone and tell jokes. The jokes are scripted and they\u2019re meant to be bad \u2013 dad jokes \u2013 but the microphone, the stage, the spotlight: it feels uncomfortably close to performing standup comedy, something I have no more desire to do than to repeatedly slam my head in a car door.</p> <p>It turns out to be even worse than I thought. I get through the singing OK, but the dad jokes standup section could only be more like the stuff of nightmares if at the end of it I had been frogmarched off stage and back to my old school, naked from the waist down. The jokes are greeted with deathly silence by a small audience that, as it turns out, has the capacity to get even smaller: midway through, two people get up and leave. It\u2019s not just that I\u2019m completely mortified; I feel guilty. Batten, who is clearly a lovely, very talented woman, has come all the way from Melbourne to do this and I\u2019m causing it to fail. I think about something Tom Searle said, about the unpredictability inherent in audience participation, how performers need to have a kind of selection process to ensure that they get the right audience members on stage: \u201cIf they get stage fright and can\u2019t do it, they can completely ruin the show.\u201d You can say that again.</p> <p>Still, if nothing else, it gives me an insight into life at the sharp end of the Edinburgh festival \u2013 \u201cYou certainly got the full-on fringe experience there,\u201d muses Batten \u2013 and a kind of boggling admiration for the resilience of the performers. Afterwards, I feel like spending the rest of the day locked in a darkened room, weeping softly to myself, but Bron seems remarkably unfazed: \u201cYou see? That wasn\u2019t too traumatic, was it?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07497ea5ef78f1544a7dc51539756d24a9a6453d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07497ea5ef78f1544a7dc51539756d24a9a6453d/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playing guitar in Putting the Band Back Together.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m not nervous at all\u2019 \u2026 Playing guitar in Putting the Band Back Together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t have time to fill her in on exactly how traumatic it was. I\u2019m required at a venue called Summerhall, where a show called <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/putting-the-band-back-together\">Putting the Band Back Together</a> is playing. Based on the true story of Mark Lloyd \u2013 a friend of director Annie Rigby and lead actor Alex Elliott, who on learning he had inoperable cancer elected to reform the band he\u2019d once played in \u2013 it comes with a twist: at each performance, the house band is made up of volunteers from the audience, who turn up an hour early and get a quick rehearsal before taking the stage. </p> <p>\u201cWe had the idea that people might, if you gave them a bit of advance notice, turn up to the show with an instrument that has been in the loft for a bit, get on stage and do something that might be quite difficult for them to do by any other means. You know, it takes a real concerted effort to put a group together, or even say, \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to get a set together and play at an open mic event,\u2019\u201d says Ross Millard, the former guitarist of the Futureheads. Millard wrote and performs the songs in the show, and is charged with getting the daily intake of musicians up to speed. \u201cI think it\u2019s a device that shows the audience that we\u2019re all a bit more than the sum of our parts,\u201d he adds. \u201cBands are less about individuals, they\u2019re about a collective sound, a collective chemistry.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/15/edinburgh-festival-2016-tickets-shows-tank-maestro-mortal\">Edinburgh festival 2016: six shows you shouldn't miss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike singing or telling jokes at a microphone, I can play guitar \u2013 a bit \u2013 but I still have a degree of trepidation about appearing in the show. I was never any good at it and, furthermore, I haven\u2019t actually touched the thing for more than 20 years. When I realised I was infinitely better at writing about music than playing it, I stopped playing it altogether, there being few things in life more pathetic than a rock critic who clearly has musical aspirations of their own, their every word somehow flavoured with the bitter tang of thwarted ambition. But the rehearsal goes well: the songs are great, but rooted in chord structures basic enough for even my rudimentary abilities; Millard is endlessly patient and encouraging. The performance goes even better. The play is fantastic \u2013 funny, big-hearted, moving and truthful \u2013 and the shambolic band of rusty amateur musicians fits perfectly with its central theme, about returning to something you love that adult life has distracted you from. Midway through, I realise that I\u2019m not nervous at all. As we play, the musicians occasionally smilingly catch each other\u2019s eyes: we\u2019re all clearly really enjoying ourselves.</p> <p>Backstage afterwards, there is a really lovely, warm atmosphere, but <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on#q=%22Closer%20by%20Circa%22\">Closer by Circa</a> calls. The Australian circus company is one of this year\u2019s big fringe hits; they are packing them in at the Udderbelly. It is an astonishing show that I watch rigid with terror. That is partly because some of it is genuinely terrifying \u2013 the Circa performers seem to specialise in the kind of routine that looks so dangerous you can only watch it safely through your fingers \u2013 and it is partly because I know I\u2019m going to have to take part in it. There are few things that can make you more keenly aware of your own advanced, paunchy decrepitude than being in close proximity to people who are clearly as fit as a human being can be, and who can perform scarcely believable feats of strength and agility. There are performers up there taking the full weight of other human beings on their heads and shinbones; after years of sitting hunched over a computer, I can\u2019t even stand straight.</p> <p>As it turns out, it doesn\u2019t matter. Or, at least, I think it doesn\u2019t. When I\u2019m called on stage along with several other audience members, everything happens so fast that I have no idea what is going on. Mostly, I just sit there while Circa do their incredible stuff around me. At one point, I have to dance with one of the female performers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to twirl me round,\u201d she says. \u201cNow you\u2019re going to dip me.\u201d I realise she means the ballroom dancing move where one dancer reclines, draped over their partner\u2019s arm. For a split second, I have a terrible premonition I\u2019m going to drop her \u2013 her promising career was cut tragically short when a cack-handed journalist caused her to crack her skull etc \u2013 but then I realise that she can probably dip herself, without my support. I stagger back to my seat, to a round of applause.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8362f33d02540a7f9fa7515aec5b190a6a850b2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8362f33d02540a7f9fa7515aec5b190a6a850b2d/0_133_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reading the Chilcot report in a shed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Unexpectedly compelling\u2019 \u2026 Reading the Chilcot report in a shed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer is pure entertainment. My next appointment is something else. The man behind <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on#q=%22Iraq%20Out%20%26%20Loud%3A%20Reading%20the%20Chilcot%20Report%20in%20Full%22\">Iraq Out &amp; Loud</a>, Bob Slayer, describes it as \u201ca ridiculous thing about a very serious subject\u201d. In a shed he has erected in the centre of town, people are encouraged to read the Chilcot report of the Iraq inquiry aloud. Everyone does 15 minutes each, and it goes on 24 hours a day until all 12 volumes are done. Hence the shed: it is hard to find a 24-hour venue in Edinburgh. The readings are being filmed. Slayer, who cooked up the idea with comedian Boothby Graffoe, thought it might not work \u2013 there was a point, about six hours in, when they feared they were running out of potential readers \u2013 but it seems to have captured people\u2019s imaginations. Plenty of famous comedians have turned up to read. People keep coming back and asking to read again. </p> <p>I can see why. While it is clearly not designed to read out loud \u2013 the endless footnotes are a bit of a slog to get through \u2013 there is something unexpectedly compelling about the Chilcot report. The section I read is about the sexing-up of the dodgy dossier: arguments between officials about whether it should be journalistic and sensational, or technical, perhaps in order to blind people with science. When I come out, I tell Slayer that I think I got quite a juicy bit. \u201cThe amount of people who are coming out of the shed saying that,\u201d he nods. \u201cI thought the actual reading might be a bit of a drudge, but it all seems to be interesting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4883604a2c2036a0b1e9bf5c18ced972a39d7818\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4883604a2c2036a0b1e9bf5c18ced972a39d7818/0_231_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I think I\u2019ve learned things\u2019 \u2026 Walking to the next show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think I\u2019ve learned things\u2019 \u2026 Walking to the next show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, I head over to Adam and his cucumbers at the <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on#q=wank\">Wank Bank Masterclass</a>: my day has been nothing if not varied.

  "<p>The incendiary first track from Green Day\u2019s 12th album, Revolution Radio, places Billie Joe Armstrong inside the head of a teenaged mass shooter, a \u201csemiautomatic lonely boy\u201d who wants to be a \u201ccelebrity martyr\u201d; for now, in his mind, he is \u201cDaddy\u2019s little psycho and Mommy\u2019s little soldier\u201d. It is a very good track and a return to form for a band who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/28/green-day-billie-joe-armstrong-addiction\">appeared to be on the brink not so long ago</a>.</p> <p>Pop music isn\u2019t averse to tackling real-world issues, and Bang Bang is nothing if not topical. As Armstrong told <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/billie-joe-armstrong-on-green-days-topical-new-lp-w433483\">Rolling Stone</a> this week: \u201cIt\u2019s about the culture of mass shooting that happens in America mixed with narcissistic social media. I don\u2019t know why someone would ever do something that horrific because I know I never would.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg5Bp_Gzs0s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mg5Bp_Gzs0s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A 44-year-old man going there is not as portentous as it might sound. The pop punk genre of which Green Day became champions is based entirely on teenage alienation and small-town ennui. It\u2019s widely traced back to SoCal trailblazers Descendents, whose 1982 debut full-length, Milo Goes to College, deals entirely with, if not mass shootings, that disconnected mind that so often leads up to such tragedy. And while taken as a set text by any number of heavyweights who know a lot better, its homophobia has gone some way to discrediting the genre in more polite musical circles. (I\u2019m Not A Loser putting things most bluntly: \u201cGo away, you fucking homos.\u201d) The band\u2019s Bill Stevenson said in a recent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2jtq2k/we_are_milo_aukerman_bill_stevenson_karl_alvarez/\">Reddit AMA</a>, \u201cWe would have done things differently if we had known better, but we did not. We were 15.\u201d Singer Milo Aukerman said there had been \u201csome updating of the lyrics in that regard\u201d.</p> <p>Which is sensible enough as wisdom after the fact. But it set a trail that would leave this musical genre defined by a dorkish, snotty and, at times, misogynistic tag it would never really escape. Blink-182 have never been allowed to be considered more than the band who released the (really rather excellent) Enema Of The State, made a million dick jokes and whose spirit animal is Stifler from American Pie. Yet you\u2019ll be hard-pushed to find a band who take themselves more seriously than Blink-182: Travis Barker has a legitimate claim to being one of the best technical drummers around.</p> <p>It\u2019s actually a wonder Green Day even made it to another record after the drama that followed them last time. In itself, their 2012 trilogy Uno!, Dos! and Tres! was a flawed confection, even if you put aside Billie Joe\u2019s meltdown on the stage of iHeartRadio, which set up a trip to rehab and the subsequent jacking of most of the promotional schedule.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYPe29teM10\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lYPe29teM10?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The ambitious gesture failed on almost every level. An attempt to get back to scratchy basics while showing all colours of style, the trilogy ended up projecting the band\u2019s rainbow too wide. Inevitably, it made the classic mistake of hiding a great little 11-track album inside a sprawling statement. It all spoke to a wider contradiction within pop punk, whose purveyors are the cerebral champions of deliberately shooting for dumb-ass \u2013 something which no longer worked when they reached age 40. Blink have soldiered on but Green Day, of course, had long since graduated to something bigger. </p> <p>2000\u2019s semi-acoustic Warning was a wholesomely emotional delight, and the concept opera American Idiot went against the odds to prove an enduring masterpiece. Revolution Radio, it seems, wants to go back to that smarter ground while ditching some of Green Day\u2019s stadium excess. Green Day sound as though they are again becoming a force to be reckoned with, even if they\u2019ll never quite be called \u201ccredible\u201d. Bang Bang makes, if not a statement, then a powerful observation of a country going wrong (the title track was inspired by Armstrong joining a Manhattan protest over the killing of black teenager Michael Brown). </p> <p>Blink-182 and Green Day\u2019s return ultimately proves pop punk can still shine an uncomfortable torch on society, while not forgetting the power of a well-placed dick joke.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/15/can-you-solve-it-are-you-a-puzzle-olympian\">I set you the following puzzles</a>:</p> <p><strong>1) The 100m final</strong></p> <p>Early this morning Usain Bolt won gold in the 100m.</p> <p>Let\u2019s assume that Bolt won the race by 10m from the second placed runner, Justin Gatlin. And now let\u2019s run the final again, but this time Bolt will start 10m behind the start line. If both Bolt and Gatlin run at the same constant speed in the second race as they did in the first, who wins?</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>Bolt wins the second race. </p> <p>When Bolt has run 100m, Gatlin has run 90m, so the men are in level positions 10m from the finish line. Since Bolt has a higher speed, he will run that final 10m quicker than his rival.</p> <p><strong>2) The mystery games</strong></p> <p>(For the purposes of this puzzle, any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, and Olympic sports, actual or obsolete, is purely coincidental.) </p> <p>Nafissatou, Jessica, and Brianne are taking part in an athletics competition that involves at least two events. In each event the winner gets G points, second placed gets S points and third place gets B points, where G, S and B are whole numbers, nonzero, and G&gt; S&gt;B. No event is tied. Nafissatou scores 22 points in total. Jessica and Brianne score 9 points each in total. Jessica wins the 100m hurdles. Who is second in the javelin? How many events are there?</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>To solve this puzzle we need to write down clearly what we know and then gradually deduce the answer. </p> <p>We know that the number of points awarded at each event is G + S + B, and we know the total number of points given out is 22 + 9 + 9 = 40. We also know that the smallest possible number of points awarded at each event is when G = 3, S = 2 and B = 1, in which case G + S + B = 6. </p> <p>G + S + B cannot be exactly 6, since 6 does not divide into 40, the total number of points. So G + S + B must be either 8, 10, 20 or 40, since these are the only numbers greater than 6 that do divide 40. Which means that there are either 5, 4, 2 or 1 events, since 40/8 = 5, 40/10 = 4, 40/20 = 2 and 40/40 = 1.</p> <p>Jessica wins the hurdles, and has a total score of 9, so G is at most 9. Nafissatou scores 22 points, so there must be more than two events since otherwise how could she possibly reach that number? So, we know that either there are 5 events and G + S + B = 8, or there are are 4 events and G + S + B = 10.</p> <p>Let\u2019s suppose that there are 4 events. G must be 6 or more, since if it was 5 or below Nafissatou would never reach 22. The only way Jessica, who wins the hurdles, and has a total score of 9, could reach that number is if G = 6, B = 1, and she is third in each of the other three events. So, S = 3. However, even if Nafissatou is second in the hurdles but wins all the other events, her total is 6 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 21. Which contradicts the statement of the question.</p> <p>So, <strong>there must be 5 events</strong>, and G + S + B = 8. G must be 5 or more, since if it was 4 or below Nafissatou would never reach 22. If G = 5, then the only way Jessica, who wins the hurdles, and has a total score of 9, could reach that number is if G = 5, B = 1, and she is third in each of the other four events. So, S = 2. The only way for Nafissatou to make up 22 is for her to win every event but place second in the hurdles, since 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 22.

  "<p>There is much cause to be anxious in today\u2019s world \u2013 so much so that you\u2019ve probably been uneasily wondering what happened to \u201cHannelore K\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/jul/18/crossword-blog-when-solving-a-crossword-is-a-criminal-act\">nonagenarian former dentist</a> who recently visited a Nuremberg art gallery. In the gallery was Reading-work-piece by Arthur K\u00f6pcke, a \u00a367,000 avant-garde collage that incorporates (a) a crossword and (b) the English-language instruction: \u201cInsert words!\u201d</p> <p>She <em>did</em> insert words. Hannelore K filled in the crossword. The curators have filed a criminal complaint, though Hannelore K can relax: one theory is that the insurance on a museum\u2019s collection remains valid only if future vandals know there\u2019s threat of prosecution. It may all be a show.</p> <p>Now, apparently in the same spirit of law-as-theatre, Hannelore K\u2019s lawyer has gone hardcore. A <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/nuernberg-seniorin-beansprucht-urheberrecht-an-zerstoertem-kunstwerk-1.3104463\">seven-page rebuttal</a> insists she was collaborating with the original artist; that she created a new work when she got out her ballpoint pen, and that the new work is more valuable than the old because of the international press surrounding the incident. The restoration the museum has carried out was itself an act of vandalism, which infringes Hannelore K\u2019s copyright \u2013 one for which they should perhaps be prosecuted.</p> <p>Very nicely done.

  "<p>WhatsApp, Skype and other online messaging services face an EU crackdown aimed at safeguarding users\u2019 privacy, in a move that highlights the gulf between Europe and the US in regulating the internet.<br></p> <p>The European commission will publish a draft law on data privacy that aims to ensure instant message and internet-voice-call services face similar security and privacy rules to those governing SMS text messages, mobile calls and landline calls. </p> <p>Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German Green MEP and prominent campaigner on data privacy, said: \u201cIt was obvious that there needs to be an adjustment to the reality of today.

The draft law will then have to go through the EU legislative machine, agreement by the 28 EU member states, including the UK, and the European parliament. </p> <p>Albrecht said one of his priorities was tough new rules on encryption. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">Edward Snowden</a> revelations had made it clear that \u201cevery communication needs to be end-to-end encrypted\u201d, he said. </p> <p>Snowden, a former US contractor, handed a trove of documents to the Guardian and other newspapers that revealed how US and British intelligence had cracked the online encryption used by millions of people to secure their personal data.</p> <p>The latest regulatory drive has rung alarm bells in the tech industry, as the new privacy proposals come hot on the heels of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/eu-privacy-laws-data-regulations\">a significant new data privacy law agreed in June</a>.</p> <p>TechUK, an industry group that represents 900 internet companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, urged the commission to \u201cthink carefully about the evidence of harm and the powers it already has at its disposal\u201d.</p> <p>Charlotte Holloway, the director of policy at TechUK, said new regulations could have unintended effects far beyond OTT services and could spill into other areas, such as connecting devices to the internet. \u201cIt\u2019s not just OTT messaging apps that could be affected in such a move, but new and emerging areas such as the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/06/what-is-the-internet-of-things-google\">\u201cinternet of things\u201d</a> and smart city technologies,\u201d she said. \u201cCommission officials must be vigilant to the unintended consequences of proposals which could undermine Europe\u2019s future economic potential.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The UK, a critic of EU tech industry regulation, will have a say, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/14/britains-meps-ushered-quietly-off-stage-as-the-eu-show-goes-on\">its voice will count for less</a> following the Brexit vote. </p> <p>Louise Bennett, the chair of security at the British Chartered Institute for IT, accused the EU of coming up with too many conflicting regulations and pointed to inconsistent loopholes under the latest plans, such as an exemption for Skype-to-Skype calls. </p> <p>\u201cTrying to replicate regulations that were done for a completely different media in a completely different age is well-nigh impossible,\u201d she said, adding that the plans showed the gulf in views on internet regulation between the US and Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThere will never be total reconciliation between American views, where freedom of speech matters most, and European views, where privacy matters most.\u201d<br></p> <p>The regulatory issues highlight the stark division between the technology sectors of Europe and the US. While the largest US technology firms, led by Apple and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, provide OTT services as part of their business, the largest European technology firms, such as Telef\u00f3nica and Vodafone, are undercut by them.</p> <p>Messaging is also seen as a saturated market, with little chance of a European entrant disrupting any of the big players. Of the 10 biggest messaging services by number of users, just one, Skype, was founded in Europe, but it is now owned by Microsoft.</p> <p>The success or failure of OTT messaging services also has a strong bearing on national security issues worldwide. SMS messaging is almost entirely unencrypted and easily readable by law enforcement, but other messaging services vary in terms of their vulnerability to government agencies. WhatsApp and iMessage, for instance, enable end-to-end encryption by default on all messages, ensuring that even Facebook and Apple cannot access their content. </p> <p>By contrast, Facebook Messenger only encrypts messages end-to-end if the user actively opts in to a \u201cprivate chat\u201d mode. As such, law enforcement bodies with an appropriate court order can easily access most messages sent through the service.</p> <p></p> <p>A European commission spokesperson said it was looking into the extent that people can consider OTT services \u201cto be functional substitutes for services provided by traditional telecoms operators\u201d and whether EU rules need to be adapted to better protect consumers.</p>",
  "<p>On a recent trip to my hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I rode the bus from Martin Luther King Drive at Burleigh Avenue to meet an interviewee near Sherman Park. I counted how many foreclosure sale signs there were compared with occupied (often dilapidated) homes along the route, as well as storefronts, businesses and supermarkets. It\u2019s a skill I picked up in the days when I worked in affordable housing development and planning in New York. But if I\u2019m honest, I probably learned it earlier, as a teenager in growing up in Milwaukee. I learned then to look at communities as a whole. </p> <p>What do we know about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/violence-milwaukee-police-shoot-dead-armed-suspect\">shooting that sparked protests</a> over the past two nights? Twenty-three-year-old Sylville Smith had an arrest record, had recently secured a permit to carry a firearm, ran from the police after a stop and was shot. He died on the scene. The local police chief said that an officer\u2019s body-camera video showed Sylville Smith with a gun in his hand and turning towards the police. While more details will emerge in the coming days about Smith and the officer who shot him, our attention has been captured by the clashes between police and residents of the Sherman Park neighborhood, where Smith was killed, who gathered shortly after his death. The shooting may have been the catalyst for the protest and property damage, but as any native black Milwaukeean can tell you, what\u2019s happened here is bigger than any one incident.</p> <p>Milwaukee is one of the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/03/29/most_segregated_cities/slide_show/10\">most segregated cities in the country</a>. It\u2019s one of the first things you learn as a black child there. I don\u2019t think you can understand rust belt communities without looking at the lack of funding for services, such as transportation infrastructure and housing, that undergirds the concentrated poverty in place like Sherman Park, and the entire north side, where I grew up. Milwaukee has the largest black population in the state, and the poverty rate for blacks living in Milwaukee is 32.9% (in 2014, it was 14.5% nationwide). What local, striving black folks often talk about is the fact that jobs exist in places they can\u2019t reach and that rent and house prices often prevent them from moving closer. </p> <p>Governor Scott Walker\u2019s contribution to these circumstances has been considerable. According <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/01/25/back-in-time-60-years-americas-most-segregated-city.html\">to one report</a>, \u201cfor more than 20 years, he has fought proposals that would make it easier for city residents\u201d to get to suburban job centers. He opposed proposals from city mayors for \u201can urban-suburban light rail line\u201d and shortened or eliminated regional bus routes that cut off access to tens of thousands of jobs. It was only because of a lawsuit that Walker agreed to set aside a meager $14m of a $1.7bn highway project to fund bus routes to the suburbs.</p> <p>These economic pressures coexist with tensions between police and black citizens, which have been ever present since large numbers of southern black families migrated to the city nearly 60 years ago. In 2014, the police shooting of Dontre Hamilton served as a reminder to black Milwaukee that a kind of reckoning and repair was urgently needed. Months after Hamilton\u2019s death, jurors <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/milwaukee-police-strip-search-lawsuit-set-to-go-to-federal-jury-b99326446z1-270330811.html\">determined</a> that two Milwaukee police officers had to pay $506,000 to Leo Hardy for an illegal strip search.</p> <p>I think there\u2019s an oversimplified narrative about what makes it right or wrong for a community that believes itself under siege to resist, act out, protest, riot. Some will undoubtedly dwell on Smith\u2019s arrest record. Americans will get behind victims of police violence if they appear to be blameless. There\u2019s a comfort in embracing a binary of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d. One does not have to think too deeply about history, patterns, or injustices. One doesn\u2019t have to consider the policies that actually created the conditions for his pain. Smith\u2019s death was a spark to a powder keg built up decades before he was killed Saturday night.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/764853066684207104\">interview,</a> the brother of Sylville Smith expressed his pain and frustration in the most direct terms: \u201cif you don\u2019t have anyone to protect us, then this is what you get. You get a lot people that\u2019s hurt and they can\u2019t vent the right way.\u201d My hometown has been in crisis for decades and perhaps now, finally, the nation is listening. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 August 2016 to remove a line stating that Sylville Smith was shot in the back. He was shot in the chest and arm, and it has not yet been confirmed whether he was also shot in the back. Added on 17 August 2016 was the local police chief\u2019s statement that an officer\u2019s body-camera video showed Sylville Smith with a gun in his hand and turning towards police.<br></p>",
  "<h2>NEXT TIME?</h2> <p><em>\u201cThis time, more than any other time, this time, we\u2019re going to find a way, find a way \u2026 to win them all. It\u2019s what we\u2019ll set out to do. We have a dream, we know you\u2019re sharing it too. This time \u2026 we\u2019ll get it right.\u201d</em></p> <p>Nearly 35 years later, there\u2019s something utterly depressing about This Time, England\u2019s 1982 World Cup song. It\u2019s the hollow optimism, more than anything. England hadn\u2019t won the big prize for a while, hadn\u2019t really looked like winning it for most of that time, hadn\u2019t even won their qualifying group, but still \u2013 they were <em>England</em>, and England should be taken seriously. They should be contenders. This time, they\u2019d get it right. They didn\u2019t get it right.</p> <p>And so to Arsenal, who over the last decade have finished fourth, third, fourth, third, fourth, third, fourth, fourth, third and second, and started the season talking once again of titles. \u201cI think he really feels he can win something and do something special with this team,\u201d Jack Wilshere said of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger last week. \u201cAt the moment on the pitch we can compete. That is the most important thing,\u201d Wenger said, as he looked ahead to the visit of Liverpool in the first game of the season. \u201cWe are a big club and have a great team, so we always have a chance of winning the league,\u201d the former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg trilled. \u201cWe need to have a good start to the season, keep playing as a team and believe in Ars\u00e8ne and each other.\u201d This time, more than any other time, etc.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/14/arsene-wenger-arsenal-injuries-liverpool\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger says Arsenal were not ready on a physical level for Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Little over an hour into the new season they were 4-1 down at home to a rampant Liverpool. They were being outplayed. The fans booed. Some of them thought Wenger didn\u2019t know what he was doing, and told him so. Wenger decided he\u2019d show them, and prepared his first substitution. Three minutes later \u2013 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain having reduced the arrears in the meantime \u2013 he brought on his one significant summer signing, \u00a325m-plus Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka. With one decision, in one moment, Wenger would be able to prove his tactical and acquisitional mastery.</p> <p>When Arsenal signed Xhaka in May they treated supporters to an <a href=\"http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20160531/granit-xhaka-stats-infographic\">\u201cinteractive graphic\u201d</a> on their website featuring \u201chis key career stats\u201d (covering only his time in the Bundesliga, so far as we can work out). The 23-year-old had, they revealed, previously played 108 games, in which he had made 244 tackles \u2013 and 236 fouls. In other words, if The Fiver was reading these numbers correctly \u2013 and The Fiver <em>always</em> reads numbers correctly, even when we have been given them by gorgeous potential future Mrs Fivers in less than salubrious nightspots, when for some reason they often don\u2019t seem to work. Which phone number has a letter in it? \u2013 he had made eight clean tackles in his entire career. Even if fouls didn\u2019t count as tackles but \u2013 rather like Wenger \u2013 live in a worrying category all of their own, this meant that every time he attempts to win the ball there is a 49.17% chance he\u2019s going to give away a free-kick. Surely they\u2019d made a mistake? After all, who\u2019d pay \u00a330m for a free-kick-conceding machine? If his debut performance was anything to go by they had indeed made a mistake, on any number of levels: Xhaka came on in the 67th minute, attempted five tackles, conceded four fouls, was booked and Arsenal lost. Still, there\u2019s always next time. Next time, they\u2019ll get it right.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Jacob Steinberg from 8pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-2 West Ham</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p><strong>December 2015:</strong> \u201cMy Club is a great initiative.

That is unlikely to be the case, and it certainly should not be.</p> <p>For a start, the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has to decide whether it is going to name, shame and fine Sports Direct for failing to ensure its warehouse employees were paid the minimum wage. There appears to be no reason for clemency. The government seems quite happy to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/largest-ever-list-of-national-minimum-wage-offenders-published\">name and shame little known companies for relatively modest sums</a>, and this was no minor infraction. Sports Direct\u2019s flouting of minimum wage legislation had been going on for four years.</p> <p>BEIS has the power to fine the company \u00a32m, double the amount it has agreed to pay its workers, and it should impose the maximum. In part, that\u2019s because despite the \u00a31m total the company could have been required to pay more. In part, it\u2019s because the government needs to make an example of Sports Direct in order to show that it is unacceptable to dock pay for staff clocking in a minute late and force them to undergo unpaid 15-minute searches at the end of their shifts.</p> <p>Sports Direct is a prime example of how companies can use employment agencies to avoid giving what are effectively full-time staff members the rights which they are legally due. Employees are too frightened to make a fuss for fear that they will not get any more work.</p> <p>Ashley, it appears, is concerned enough about the reputational damage being caused to Sports Direct, and upset enough about being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/mike-ashley-admits-sports-direct-staff-were-not-paid-minimum-wage\">hauled up before MPs</a> to explain himself, to make an offer of recompense.

  "<p>The former Aston Villa footballer Dalian Atkinson has died after police Tasered him near his father\u2019s home in Telford.</p> <p>West Mercia police said a 48-year-old man had died.

He always got on with the kids because they absolutely loved his car.\u201d</p> <p>Another resident, Paula Quinn, said Atkinson appeared to be \u201calmost staggering\u201d in the street before he was Tasered.

Black Lives Matter is about raising awareness of this.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, we do not know the full circumstances of what took place, but the deaths of black people in custody are a matter of concern.</p> <p>\u201cPolicing generally in Britain is disproportionate towards black people [who are] twice as likely to die in police custody than white people and 37 times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people.\u201d </p> <p>Michael Naughton, reader in sociology and law at Bristol University, said: \u201cThe evidence is clear. Whether stop and search, deaths in police custody or deaths by the police during arrest.

  "<p><strong>I\u2019ve recently seen a lot about cargo shorts in the news. What\u2019s going on?<br></strong><em>Ben, by email</em></p> <p>Ding dong merrily on high, it\u2019s because they have finally been banned by international law! At long last, the European court of human rights has decreed that these hideous, multi-pocketed monstrosities contravene my human rights by appearing in my line of vision on every third man in the street in the summer months. From today, there will be a cargo shorts amnesty. Everyone must hand in their disgusting shorts at a designated safe space; failure to do so will result in offenders having to walk around town wearing a scarlet sign that says: \u201cHi! I\u2019m a straight guy who can\u2019t accept the 90s are over. I shop at Old Navy, you know.\u201d Personally, I think this is a rather odd punishment, given that wearers of these shorts essentially wear that sign every day, ba boom boom tish.</p> <p>Anyway, sadly, I jest; this has not happened. Rather, a journalist named <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/graphic/heterosexual-mens-fashion-10288\">Nicole Hong wrote an article about the perfectly obvious awfulness of these shorts</a> and men rose up as one and gave a collective howl of fury. The male employees at the Wall Street Journal all came in wearing their beloved cargo shorts to protest against Hong\u2019s piece. Film director Judd Apatow tweeted that women\u2019s dislike of men\u2019s cargo shorts proves \u201cyou don\u2019t understand us\u201d. In fact, it\u2019s because women understand men all too well. A man who wears cargos is a man who is refusing to embrace maturity, as proved by the collective temper tantrum these chaps had when one woman questioned the merits of their stupid shorts.</p> <p>There are two conclusions to draw here. First, it\u2019s adorable how outraged men (#yesliterallyallmen) get when someone criticises one piece of their clothing, given that women are told every single goddamn day how they are supposed to dress. Heck, fashion magazines tell women to throw out their entire wardrobes every six months. Do women cry about it? No, because they\u2019re adults, and they know \u2013 and I realise this is ironic coming from me, given that the whole point of this column is ostensibly to tell people what to wear \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter. Someone doesn\u2019t like your clothes? Oh well, walk it off! Seeing these men willing to die on the hill of their cargo shorts is like watching people spend all day quarreling on the internet, unable to accept that someone has a different point of view to them. It reflects a deeply narcissistic belief that not only should everyone think the same way as them, but that they can make them do so.</p> <p>So, here is the definitive ruling on cargo shorts, chaps. They are \u2013 clearly, objectively, obviously \u2013 fugly.

Seriously?<br></strong><em>Tara, by email</em></p> <p>Yes, the seminal Knocked Up civil war is still raging, eight years after it began, meaning it has now lasted twice as long as the first world war.</p> <p>To recap, in 2008 \u2013 yes, 2008 \u2013 Heigl said in an interview that the Judd Apatow film, in which she co-starred with Rogen, was \u201ca little sexist\u201d. \u201cThe movie paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,\u201d she said, absolutely correctly.</p> <p>Obviously, Apatow and Rogen considered this point of view seriously and calmly, accepting that maybe a woman would have a different \u2013 more valid, even \u2013 perspective on sexism to them. Kidding! Nope, they reacted like men whose cargo shorts had just been criticised.</p> <p>\u201c[You\u2019d think] at some point I\u2019ll get a call saying: \u2018Sorry, I was tired.\u2019 But that call never came,\u201d Apatow said, all more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re the only people she said some batshit crazy things about. That\u2019s kind of her bag,\u201d added Rogen. Because only fatigue and being \u201cbatshit crazy\u201d would make someone accuse an Apatow film of being sexist.</p> <p>This whole farrago essentially destroyed Heigl\u2019s career. Yes, she is supposedly a little difficult on set, but that trait doesn\u2019t seem to have harmed, say, <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/news/a39710/jared-leto-joker-method-acting/\">Jared Leto</a>. Anyway, earlier this year, Heigl <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/08/katherine-heigl-should-not-apologize-to-rogen.html\">made some kind of groveling apology</a> for daring to voice her opinion. Rogen added last week: \u201cI respect that maybe she realises it has hurt her career,\u201d he said, like a teacher solemnly pleased a naughty toddler has learned her lesson.</p> <p>The real takeaway from this is that, despite the fears of a million manboys who thought an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/26/kristen-wiig-bummed-out-by-ghostbusters-backlash\">all-female Ghostbusters meant Hollywood was being taken over by the feminazis</a>, the movie business remains a place where a woman\u2019s career will be destroyed if she complains that a sexist film is sexist. As writer Sady Doyle tweeted: \u201cI mean, Seth Rogen made a comedy so terrible that it almost caused a war with North Korea, but God forbid HE apologise for anything.\u201d Yeah, but war is cool. Telling men they\u2019re a bit sexist? That hurts their feelings! Not as much as telling them their shorts are bad, but it\u2019s up there.</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of her two-year stint on the Australian soap Neighbours as the local busybody Mrs Mangel, the British actor Vivean Gray, who has died aged 92, was presented with the script for an incredible new storyline. In it, she was to be knocked from a ladder by a Labrador called Bouncer and as a result would lose her memory of the past two years.</p> <p>Her granddaughter Jane, trying to be kind, decides not to tell Mrs Mangel the truth that in the interim her husband Len (John Lee) has run off with another woman, but instead that he has died and his ashes have been scattered under the rosebushes in the front garden. In one later episode, Mrs Mangel is seen saying goodbye to the rosebushes, prompting her Ramsay Street neighbours to think she has lost her mind.</p> <p>In any other TV soap, such a storyline might have produced a wave of sympathy for the character, but it did not for Nell Mangel. Between 1986 and 1988, millions around the world, particularly in Australia and Britain, would tune in every weekday afternoon to watch the cantankerous, interfering busybody at No 32 drive her neighbours to distraction. In one typical storyline, Mrs Mangel tries to destroy the relationship between her lodger Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) and her neighbour and nemesis Madge Ramsay (Anne Charleston). When she fails in that, she attempts to ruin their wedding by playing the church organ badly. In another storyline, many of her neighbours suspect her of murdering Len \u2013 until he turns up unexpectedly in a later episode announcing he plans to file for divorce.</p> <p>In some respects, Mrs Mangel was a prototype for EastEnders\u2019 Dot Cotton: piously Christian, difficult and burdened with a disappointing son (Joe, played by Mark Little), who leaves the Mangel home after being accused of robbing a service station. But unlike Dot Cotton, Mrs Mangel proved unlikeable though captivating, becoming, as Neighbours\u2019 executive producer Jason Herbison \u201cthe ultimate busybody \u2026 a true soap legend\u201d.</p> <p>These were the glory days of Neighbours in terms of ratings. A 1988 episode featuring the wedding between Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue) was watched by 20 million in the UK alone. As a result, Gray\u2019s character became globally known, if not beloved.</p> <p>Indeed, if Mrs Mangel made Gray famous, she was scarcely able to enjoy the celebrity. In 1988, she quit the show after nearly 300 episodes. The following year she explained why: \u201cI loved Neighbours and the rest of the cast were marvellous. But because it was so successful, I could barely set foot outside my own door without someone screaming abuse at horrid old Mrs Mangel. People didn\u2019t seem to appreciate it was acting. So I decided to take a break.\u201d</p> <p>The break from acting lasted for the rest of Gray\u2019s life \u2013 she never took another role. She left Australia in the mid-1990s and settled in Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex, refusing requests for interviews or autographs from fans.</p> <p>In 2005 Neighbours\u2019 producers tried to persuade her to return for its 20th anniversary episode, but she declined.</p> <p>She was born Jean Vivra Gray in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, the eldest of four children of Allan, a fish merchant, and his wife, Doris, and attended Thrunscoe girls\u2019 school. The family moved to Kingston upon Thames, in south-west London, in the 30s but was evacuated back to Cleethorpes in 1941 and finally resettled in New Malden, Surrey, after the second world war. As a young woman, Gray worked as a sales assistant, reporter, photographer and nurse, and during the war served in the <a href=\"http://www.womenslandarmy.co.uk/\">Women\u2019s Land Army</a>, but always dreamed of becoming an actor.</p> <p>In 1952, finding opportunities in Britain limited, she decided to emigrate to Australia to pursue her acting ambitions. She adopted the professional name Vivean Gray and appeared in Australian theatre and radio, as well as establishing herself on TV with small roles in cop shows such as Homicide (1964-77), Division Four (1969-75), Matlock Police (1971-76), Solo One (1976) and Bluey (1976), as well as the legal drama Carson\u2019s Law (1982-84) and the miniseries Anzacs (1985) and All the Rivers Run (1983).</p> <p>She also appeared in two films directed by Peter Weir. In Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), she played the maths teacher Miss McCraw, who, along with several of her students from a girls\u2019 boarding school, disappears during a Valentine\u2019s Day picnic, never to be seen again. In Weir\u2019s 1977 film The Last Wave she played Dr Whitburn, an expert on aboriginal history, which starred Richard Chamberlain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1490fede5a4bb25398775830e0eb5ad081afb727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1490fede5a4bb25398775830e0eb5ad081afb727/0_84_5049_3030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vivean Gray as Miss McCraw in Peter Weir\u2019s film Picnic at Hanging Rock, 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivean Gray as Miss McCraw in Peter Weir\u2019s film Picnic at Hanging Rock, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1976, she starred as Ida Jessup in The Sullivans, a long-running drama about a Melbourne family and the effect that the war had on their lives. Playing Mrs Jessup, the Sullivans\u2019 gossipy English-born neighbour, during the show\u2019s 16-season run from 1976 to 1983 proved not only good preparation for her later role as Nell Mangel on Neighbours, but also led to her receiving two Logie awards honouring achievements on Australian TV.</p> <p>In 1984, she was cast to play a genteel poisoner, Edna Pearson, in the long-running drama Prisoner Cell Block H (known simply as Prisoner in Australia). But after a woman who had been accused of poisoning her husband threatened to sue the show\u2019s producers Grundy Television, on the grounds that the character was based on her, material involving Gray\u2019s character was cut from subsequent episodes, and from DVD releases of already broadcast shows. In 2010, a DVD telling the dramatic story of Edna Pearson was released, but only in Britain.</p> <p>After Gray quit Neighbours in 1988, she may have effectively retired, but her fame lived on. In 1995 she was honoured with her image on an Australian postage stamp. As for Mrs Mangel, after finding out the truth about Len and divorcing him, the producers had her fall for a retired dentist John Worthington (Brian James) and move back to the old country, to St Albans, Hertfordshire. She continued to be mentioned in the show as recently as last year.</p> <p>\u2022 Vivean Gray (Jean Vivra Gray), actor, born 20 July 1924; died 29 July 2016</p>",

  "<p>A few weeks ago, as I prepared for my honeymoon in Turkey, the usual concerns of a Muslim traveller went through my mind. Will I be the one singled out? Will I get checked more than someone else just for being who I am?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/woman-reading-book-about-syria\">What to do when the book police arrive: read on | AL Kennedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although I wasn\u2019t aware of this at the time, a cabin crew member on my outbound flight reported to the authorities that I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/04/british-woman-held-after-being-seen-reading-book-about-syria-on-plane\" title=\"\">reading a book</a> called Syria Speaks: Art and Culture from the Frontline, a collection of <a href=\"http://www.saqibooks.co.uk/book/syria-speaks/\" title=\"\">literature, poems, photos, songs and cartoons</a> from Syrian artists and writers. The first clue I had that something was wrong was when I landed in Turkey and was stopped while leaving the plane. I was told this was a \u201crandom check\u201d but I was the only passenger to be stopped. Our trip was off to a horrible start. Further tensions occurred as our stay was disrupted due to the military coup and as a result, we had to cancel our flight to Istanbul and were stranded in Marmaris, our resort. We salvaged the remainder of our honeymoon as best we could.</p> <p>On our return to the UK, two police officers were waiting for me as soon as I arrived through passport control. My husband and I were taken to a room for questioning under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act for approximately 30 minutes. Among questions about my reasons for travelling to Turkey, my work and the number of languages I speak, they asked me to show them the book I had been reading and explain what it was about. The whole experience left me feeling disappointed and angry.</p> <p>Incidents like this seem to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/the-guardian-view-on-anti-muslim-discrimination-a-terrible-social-injustice\" title=\"\">happening to Muslims</a> frequently. We are all well aware that radicalisation of the most vulnerable is growing and is of great concern. We recognise that there is some good work being carried out by organisations, tackling issues around radicalisation. However, my experience raises several questions. Is the Terrorism Act being misused? And why are a growing number of Muslims being victimised?</p> <p>It is important that we have policies and procedures in place to tackle radicalisation. It is equally important that the Terrorism Act is not misused and we keep a sense of proportion. There is a gap, perhaps, between the implementation of the act and the levels of training of different agencies. And so the way forward would be to re-evaluate the act and reassess the implementation to determine where the legislation has been used appropriately and where it has not.</p> <p>I have always felt cautious making judgments on cases around radicalisation, but this experience has made me more aware of the regrettable scar it can leave on people when a misjudgment is made. Singling out people in this way could cause, for certain individuals, quite a detrimental effect to their overall wellbeing.</p> <p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that a high number of those who become radicalised suffer from mental health problems. I work as a mental health practitioner for the NHS, and have worked with a variety of client groups including vulnerable young people from all backgrounds who are at potential risk of radicalisation. Within mental health services we provide interventions around challenging ideologies, and we monitor risk. Early identification, intervention and prevention can tackle potential radicalisation.</p> <p>In my field of work, I recognise that some individuals have been made vulnerable due to factors such as a sense of injustice, peer pressure, negative media and a lack of a sense of belonging.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a multicultural society, we must be proactive in finding solutions to tackle radicalisation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being victimised due to a mistake can have such a negative impact that it could lead to higher potential risk of radicalisation. Such events may lead to someone feeling a lack of social acceptance and to experiencing increased vulnerabilities.</p> <p>My experience has stopped me from reminiscing about our honeymoon positively. It has also introduced a new element of paranoia into my life, which sadly joins a back catalogue of turbulent feelings I already possess as a western Muslim woman. The book that prompted all this, Syria Speaks, was an inspiring read, and it is good to hear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/11/sales-of-syrian-culture-anthology-soar-after-woman-held-for-reading-it-on-plane\" title=\"\">sales have soared</a> since my story was reported by the press. This means that the Syrian authors in the collection will be more widely read and I truly hope more people get a chance to discover its nuance and depth. I <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/FaizahShaheen?  utm_medium=\" email&amp;utm_source=\"ExactTarget&amp;utm_campaign=20160812_57019&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">stand in solidarity</a> with the innocent citizens of Syria and will continue to strive for and anticipate an end to the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.</p> <p>Even though it has been an overwhelming few weeks for me, I\u2019m pleased that sharing my story has raised a number of issues that need to be urgently addressed. I feel I can help to give a voice to victims who have experienced something similar but face various barriers to speaking out.</p> <p>Now, more than ever, as a multicultural society, we must stop simply talking about tackling radicalism and instead be proactive in finding solutions to manage it.</p>",

  "<p>Sadiq Khan\u2019s first 100 days in office - officially marked today - have given an indication of the character of his mayoralty. There has been none of the drama of Ken Livingstone\u2019s 2000 triumph against the Labour party machine, and his subsequent battle against partial privatisation of the tube. Nor has there been the chaos of Boris Johnson\u2019s 2008 election, with deputy mayors arriving and departing with a regularity that would be the envy of many London commuters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/what-do-you-think-about-sadiq-khans-first-100-days-in-office\">What do you think about Sadiq Khan's first 100 days in office?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, Khan\u2019s arrival in office has been marked by a careful approach to appointments (taking care over these was Johnson\u2019s parting advice to his successor) and astute leverage of the mayor\u2019s public profile while the City Hall policy machine begins to grind through its rusty gears. </p> <p>Launching a mayoral programme takes time, especially if you haven\u2019t inherited much from your predecessor. Ken Livingstone, for whom I worked as private secretary for his first year in office, didn\u2019t implement congestion charging until 2003 - three years after he was elected - with the Olympic Bid and London Plan following the next year. </p> <p>In 2008, Livingstone wanted to return to office to implement free bike hire and collect the Olympic Flag from Beijing, but Boris\u2019 election victory meant that these became his projects. By contrast, Boris knew he wasn\u2019t coming back in 2016 - some would say he mentally checked out some time earlier - and left the cupboard pretty bare. </p> <p>Khan has more than 200 manifesto commitments, and it has taken him time to appoint a team to focus on implementation, wrestling with the complex and only marginally coherent selection of agencies, strategies and duties that the mayor has accreted since 2000.<br></p> <h2>Key appointments</h2> <p>His appointments include a core group drawn from the campaign, including his chief of staff, David Bellamy, and policy directors Nick Bowes, Jack Stenner, Leah Kreitzmann and Patrick Hennessey. Observers describe them as a tight team who have worked together for a long time. There\u2019s virtue in the familiarity and trust this engenders, but the experience of previous mayors suggests that not every campaigner can easily make the transition to administration.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jun/20/britain-mayors-real-power-sadiq-khan\">Why Britain's new mayors will finally be wielding real power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside them, Khan has appointed deputy mayors like Justine Simmons, James Murray, Val Shawcross, Sophie Linden and Jules Pipe. These are hardly household names, but are well known and generally well respected in London government circles. The mayor has also brought in outside experts, such as Rajesh Agrawal, tech entrepreneur and deputy mayor for business. The last few appointments are due to follow imminently, and the Centre for London has argued that they should include a chief digital officer to lead digital transformation across London government.</p> <h2>New priorities</h2> <p>The mayor has made early announcements on air quality, which will be a priority area for action alongside housing, economic development, culture and social cohesion. The next big policy milestone will probably be in the autumn, when Khan sets out his vision for the new London Plan (which is unlikely to make it through its tortuous formal process, including public consultation and an \u2018examination in public\u2019, until 2019), and the other strategies that sit underneath it.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">New rules on housing will be a big focus, and there are already background murmurings that Sadiq risks being boxed in by commitments on affordability. Some of these murmurings come from housebuilders and developers - and they would say that wouldn\u2019t they? - but there clearly is some nervousness as the market feels the chilling effects of the post-referendum slowdown. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the mayor\u2019s team are focusing strongly on land held by Transport for London, which has the double challenge of needing to generate income to compensate for reduced government grant during a fares freeze, as well as meeting the mayor\u2019s affordability policies.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Brexit backdrop </h2> <p>But it is Brexit that has dominated the mayor\u2019s first months. Khan moved straight from the mayoral campaign to the remain campaign, and since the referendum result has become the voice for London\u2019s pro-EU majority, arguing for London to have a seat at the negotiating table, reforming the London Finance Commission to seek more local control of taxes, and broadcasting the message that #LondonIsOpen to the world.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/may/17/mayor-sadiq-khan-some-thoughts-on-what-would-make-him-a-success\">Mayor Sadiq Khan: some thoughts on what would make him a success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This campaigning has been underpinned by a focus on London\u2019s cohesion.

And he has been active in pushing a message of inclusivity, from the multi-faith theatrics of his acceptance of office in Southwark Cathedral, to his visible celebration of Gay Pride.</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss campaigning and public appearances as froth on the serious business of governance, but in the fraught days of summer 2016, the mayor of London\u2019s role in leading his nine million citizens is perhaps as important as providing them with services, initiatives and strategies. These will need to follow in time, and there are huge challenges ahead for London, but the mayor has made a sure-footed start.<br></p> <p><em>Richard Brown is research director at the thinktank Centre for London and was private secretary to the first mayor of London, Ken Livingstone.</em><br></p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong><br></p>",

  "<p>The myriad different bodies that make up the NHS in England and their opaqueness, especially in terms of contracts to provide services, makes mapping the true extent of the privatisation of public healthcare difficult. <br></p> <p>The available evidence bears out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/owen-smith-tories-nhs-privatisation-labour-leadership\">Owen Smith\u2019s claim that NHS privatisation is increasing</a>, but it is less of the \u201cexplosion\u201d that the Labour leadership hopeful warns about and more of a gradual but inexorable, rise in the proportion of the NHS budget going to firms such as Virgin Care, Care UK and Bupa. It is also noteworthy that the private sector has been making ever bigger inroads into several key areas of NHS care, notably general practice, community services and mental health care. </p> <p>Department of Health (DH) figures show that the amount of its funding that has gone to \u201cindependent sector providers\u201d more than doubled from \u00a34.1bn in 2009-10, Labour\u2019s last year in power, to \u00a38.7bn in 2015-16. <br></p> <p>Slow-release privatisation has also seen the percentage of the DH budget finding its way into private hands rising from 4% in 2009-10 to 8% in the last financial year. </p> <p>A few privatisation contracts involve huge sums. Several GP-led NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in Staffordshire caused controversy in 2014-15 when they sought to hand 10-year contracts for cancer and end-of-life care worth \u00a31.2bn to a private provider, though those plans have been held up after NHS England became involved. Most contracts are smaller, sometimes for a few million pounds. </p> <p>In January,however, Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Care group \u2013 which has won a growing number of NHS contracts \u2013 was awarded a \u00a3126m contract to provide a range of health services at hospitals in north Kent, including home visits and community hospital care. It is unclear what the impact of that tendering decision will be on the failed NHS bidder, Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust, which has lost a key source of income. </p> <p>Similarly, there are serious concerns about the effect on Southport and Ormskirk NHS Trust now that West Lancashire CCG has opted to outsource a range of urgent care services, such as GP out-of-hours services and walk-in centres. Having rejected its local acute trust\u2019s bid, the CCG remains in talks with United Healthcare and Virgin Care about the contract. </p> <p>\u201cThis group of people [the CCG] are taking decisions which are destabilising the future of our local hospital and could lead to NHS services being privatised,\u201d the local Labour MP Rosie Cooper said recently. Local residents were disgusted, she added. In its response, the CCG said: \u201cThis re-procurement of local community health services is standard practice for CCGs. This process is subject to national procurement legislation which requires the CCGs to enable both NGS and independent [private] providers to compete.\u201d </p> <p>Will this creeping privatisation continue? Almost certainly. The NHS\u2019s financial squeeze, coupled with private firms\u2019 ability to undercut NHS providers, plus the obligation imposed on CCGs by the coalition\u2019s shakeup of the NHS in 2012, together mean that more and more CCGs are likely to feel obliged to outsource more and more contracts, despite concerns about the quality of service that may ensue. <br></p> <p>Concern about the quality of NHS-funded inpatient care for mental health problems in Priory hospitals is merely the latest reminder that private providers do not always meet the highest standards. </p> <p>Concern about NHS privatisation has grown since the Conservatives won last year\u2019s general election. Some in the healthcare profession, such as Dr Kailash Chand, who until recently was the vice-chair of the British Medical Association, see growing outsourcing as part of an unacknowledged Tory plan to deliberately run down the NHS and pave the way for the replacement of its unique funding model with a new setup in which private health insurers and private medical care are central. </p> <p>Last month the then health minister George Freeman called for an end to the \u201capartheid\u201d between the NHS and private sector. \u201cIn my party, we have to end the apartheid that suggests the private sector does all the innovation and entrepreneurship and the public sector just treats people \u2026 The NHS is the great engine of innovation that can drive that partnership,\u201d he said in a speech to the Reform thinktank. There also needed to be \u201ca debate about how we fund health and care in the 21st century\u201d, he added. </p> <p>Freeman has since acquired a position of much greater significance under Theresa May, as chair of her policy board. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 August 2016 to clarify details of the contract won by Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Care group to provide health services in north Kent; it did not include walk-in centres.</p>",

Thompson&#39;s widow, Anita (second to left), returned a pair of stolen elk antlers to the home of Ernest Hemingway in Ketchum, Idaho last week. The late writer stole the antlers from Hemingway\u2019s home while on assignment for the National Observer in 1964. The antlers have hung at the Thompson&#39;s Owl Farm home in Woody Creek for the last 52 years. \u201cHunter later regretted this,\u201d Anita wrote in an e-mail Sunday. \u201cHunter and I planned to take a road trip back to Ketchum and quietly return them.

They were grateful to have them back. They had heard rumours. Sean Hemingway, the grandson, was the first family member that I\u2019d heard from. He spoke with other Hemingway family members and he said that everyone agreed that he should have them. He lives in New York, where he curates a museum.

  "<p>Should the rightwing MP Philip Davies be suspended from the Conservative party for making <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/pressure-mounts-on-may-to-respond-to-philip-davies-feminist-zealots-comment\">idiotic remarks about women at a knuckle-draggers conference</a> in London? Some say so, but I\u2019m not convinced he should.</p> <p>The self-styled \u201clibertarian\u201d backwoodsman from Shipley didn\u2019t break the law and routinely makes comments and speeches that are offensive or stupid. Rarely is a Daily Mail outrage story not rendered slightly more ridiculous by the presence of a rent-a-quote from Phil. He\u2019s one of those MPs \u2013 they exist in all parties \u2013 whose quoted support reliably undermines a case.</p> <p>Davies\u2019s freedom of speech is worth defending both in abstract terms \u2013 of course \u2013 but also in practical terms. The Brexit majority should remind us all that a lot of voters out there feel disenfranchised by the language in which Westminster politics is conducted and the reality-based policy parameters that constrain it. </p> <p>In the age of Donald Trump and his kind \u2013 a model that exists in most advanced countries \u2013 Davies is a \u201cpost-fact\u201d MP, the kind who will soon get cross when Theresa May\u2019s magic wand doesn\u2019t get us out of Europe or open a grammar school in every village by Christmas.</p> <p>But people like that deserve representation in parliament, not least because, like Ukip MEPs, they serve to remind the majority just how useless they usually are at actually <em>doing</em> anything rather than moaning about it all being unfair and the fault of Johnny Foreigner \u2013 or Johnny Brit in the case of leftwing moaners.</p> <p>Nigel Farage <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/687060/Ukip-Nigel-Farage-Big-Brother-Brexit-special\">swanning off to appear on Big Brother</a> and become a radio shock jock \u2013 doesn\u2019t he realise radio audiences won\u2019t be able to admire his new moustache? \u2013 perfectly exemplifies the posturing tendency. These are the ones never around to help with the washing up. In fairness to Nigel, the weekend leak of Liam Fox\u2019s moan about beastly Boris Johnson \u2013 Liam has form in the Telegraph leaking department \u2013 hints at a higher level of showboating irresponsibility to come.</p> <p>When he stepped into hot water, Davies was speaking at a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_for_Men_and_Boys\">Justice for Men and Boys</a> (J4MB) conference at the ExCel Centre in London. It sounds like a feeling-sorry-for-ourselves sort of outfit, opposed to sex discrimination legislation, authors of \u201clying feminist of the month\u201d awards, opponents of more women in the boardroom. Its founder, the former Tory Mike Buchanan, has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/18/justice-for-men-and-boys-feminists-backlash\">form outraging consensus with comments attacking feminism</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if society is dominated by women, even if a second Tory woman is now prime minister. Terrible things still happen to women because they\u2019re women, in the workplace, on social media, in the street and in the home. In the courts too, Phil, where too many women go to jail for pitiful offences. Family courts may be a different matter, but not as lethal as family  \u201chonour\u201d killing.</p> <p>But the overall direction of travel is clear, unless President Trump means more than 5% of what he says. Women are on the up in very large numbers and the world is changing as a result. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/19/dolly-parton-my-family-values\">the great Dolly Parton said in a weekend interview</a>: \u201cWomen are so much smarter than men in high places, we work extra hard to prove it. We have to.\u201d She won\u2019t get into trouble for that or face a boycott in Nashville, will she? </p> <p>There are more women in the cabinet and boardroom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/women-in-uk-boardrooms-still-low-equalities-nicky-morgan-female-ftse100-davies\">but not yet enough</a>, and women\u2019s dominance of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/gender-gap-women-men-university-tuition-fees\">university entrance levels grows every year</a>. Only the other day a female judge, whom a loutish J4MB type called \u201ca bit of a cunt\u201d, replied: \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/judge-defendant-john-hennigan-exchange-insults-chelmsford-court\">You are a bit of a cunt yourself</a>\u201d before sending him down. </p> <p> Quite deplorable in a judge, but I hugely enjoyed it. In mitigation, the incident did happen in Essex. Whether or not Patricia Lynch QC is professionally ticked off for her retaliatory lapse, the Tory papers \u2013 the ones which always print c*** \u2013 got excited.</p> <p>It is yet another reminder that we live in culturally confusing times, when university students, routinely exposed to more sex and violence via the internet than previous generations could imagine, demand \u201csafe spaces\u201d from things they deem threatening. When the pioneering feminist, Germaine Greer, of all people, almost gets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/transgender-activists-protest-germaine-greer-lecture-cardiff-university\">banned from a campus</a> for her unacceptable views on transgender, surely something unhealthy is happening.</p> <p> Having been forced to think harder about transgender issues by incidents such as this one, I unexpectedly came to the conclusion that Greer, whom I greatly admire, was wrong, and that gender identity is much more variable than we once accepted in a binary world. The Olympics provide a topical setting where these issues can\u2019t be ducked, as we will see in the South African runner Caster Semenya\u2019s formidable presence in the 800m heats on Wednesday. Semenya has male levels of testosterone, but they\u2019re natural. There\u2019s more of it about than most of us realised.</p> <p>All of which must add to the confusion for many boys and young men, even for old fartonians of a nostalgic frame of mind like Davies, whom I remember passionately defending smokers\u2019 rights against the ban in public places. Stale cigarette smoke now seems like antiquity, doesn\u2019t it? Yet we put up with it most of my life. Nowadays teenage girls and women smoke and drink almost as much as boys and men, and pay the accompanying health price. That\u2019s one gap closing in men\u2019s favour. </p> <p>It must be especially hard for young men from poor backgrounds, without educational opportunities or the traditional options of secure industrial jobs that were commonplace among older men. Now the modern apprentice schemes can be dominated by motivated young women, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/mar/17/jobs-for-the-girls-female-apprentices-needed-to-fill-uk-skills-gap\">though not yet in engineering</a>.</p> <p> No wonder they go out and vote for glib, often nasty politicians or for idiots like J4MB, if they vote at all. Condemnation of Davies\u2019s silliness is fine, but understanding why people say such things is surely an important part of the response, more than a suspension \u2013 which Davies would probably relish as martyrdom. </p> <p>So the middle-aged lawyer whose <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/charlotte-proudman-feminazi-barrister-linkedin-sexism-row\">misplaced compliment</a> angered his fellow barrister Charlotte Proudman, 27, on social media was symptomatic of a problem, but so was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/16/charlotte-proudman-women-sexist-misogyny\">Proudman\u2019s both-barrels response</a>. It was all far, far worse in granny\u2019s day, as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/joan-bakewell-women-such-as-charlotte-proudman-complain-too-much/\">the doughty Joan Bakewell remarked at the time</a>.

  "<p>My first morning at the Labour party conference of 1980 had been as dire as my Marxist brain imagined. Then, after lunch, <a href=\"http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0017200001010\">Tony Benn stood up</a>. He promised to abolish the House of Lords, enact an industry bill \u201cwithin days\u201d of coming to power to take ownership of key private industries \u2013 and to return all powers ceded to Brussels. Even from high up in the balcony of the Blackpool Winter Gardens, I could see Benn\u2019s eyes were on fire.</p> <p>Three years later, Labour bombed in the 1983 general election. Its manifesto, though only a pale reflection of Benn\u2019s leftwing programme, was dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/10/labour.margaretthatcher\">\u201cthe longest suicide note in history\u201d</a>. Today, with a mass influx of left-leaning members and a slump in the polls, parallels with the early 1980s are being drawn. They are almost all false.</p> <p>First, because we are at the other end of the neoliberal era, and as an economic model it is broken. Labour lost in 1979, and saw its membership almost halve because it had clung to a failing system \u2013 Keynesian economics \u2013 long after it ceased to work. All the momentum, in ideas, in broader society and among the elite, was towards the free-market, authoritarian project we now call Thatcherism. In that situation, to make traditional-left Keynesianism work, as Benn suggested, would have meant an all-out clash with both the market and the state. Labour\u2019s poll ratings \u2013 which collapsed in Foot\u2019s first year \u2013 were a signal that its electoral base was not up for that.</p> <p>By contrast, today neoliberal capitalism is busted, discredited and on life support. The whey-faced remnants of \u201cold Toryism\u201d may have crowded around the cabinet table, but their free-market philosophy has come apart. The fact that people are flooding into a left-led Labour party, not out of it, is evidence of a search for answers among broad sections of the population.</p> <p>The next most obvious difference is the absence of what we used to call the \u201cindustrial struggle\u201d. It has been invigorating to see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-couriers-demonstrate-against-new-contract\">Deliveroo drivers on wildcat strike</a>, together with migrant hotel cleaners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-dispute-thursday-and-friday-strikes-called-off\">train guards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/80-percent-junior-doctors-took-part-in-all-out-strike\">junior doctors</a> all in a single summer. But the leftism we carried with us into the Winter Gardens in 1980 had its origins in the syndicalism of ordinary workers in the 1970s. To the shop stewards I met in the years between Benn\u2019s 1980 speech and the miners\u2019 strike, Labour politics were a sideshow.</p> <p>The unions had achieved control of many workplaces and \u2013 it seemed \u2013 could go on calling the shots. In the year Benn made his electrifying speech, the steelworkers\u2019 union had just won a double-digit pay rise in an all-out strike. To the wider left, of shop stewards, feminists, black community activists, a group such as Militant \u2013 which had moulded its entire practice, and even its clothing to conform with the dreariness of internal Labour life \u2013 seemed irrelevant. Its claimed membership of 2,300 in 1981 \u2013 out of 348,000 - sounds about right.</p> <p>Today, work is much less central to the left project, and for a variety of reasons. It is precarious, hard to organise. Also, the things the left wants to achieve have become more social, less industrial. There is, on the left, an implicit understanding of political philosopher Toni Negri\u2019s claim: that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workerism\">the \u201cfactory\u201d is now the whole of society,</a> and the subject of change is everybody \u2013 especially the networked youth.</p> <p>I do not recall many of the miners and engineers who fought for Tony Benn as deputy leader in 1981 being existentially devastated when he narrowly lost. They knew this was just a warm-up for the decisive battle, which would happen in barricaded pit villages four years later. This generation, by contrast, understands that the most revolutionary thing you can do to neoliberalism is to put a party in government that dismantles it.</p> <p>And that, in turn, reflects another big difference: the rule of law is stronger now. Everybody involved in the Bennite movement sensed that Britain\u2019s legal institutions were so weak, its police, security services and judiciary so politicised, its constitution so malleable, that the scenario in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/07/past.comment\">Chris Mullin\u2019s novel A Very British Coup</a> was not paranoia. Today, though the secret state is large, it is under much stronger legislative control. Should a leftwing Labour party come to power \u2013 either on its own or in coalition with left nationalists \u2013 it is likely to be able to govern relatively free of politicised sabotage from the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/europe-owen-smith-beats-jeremy-corbyn-labour\">When it comes to Europe, Owen Smith beats Jeremy Corbyn hands down | Neil Kinnock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are clear parallels, though. As with the SDP, there is a prospect that a few entitled Labour MPs will split, and that the media will get behind the narrative that they are the \u201ctrue\u201d Labour party. Disunity has already damaged Labour in the polls, just as it did with Michael Foot.</p> <p>But the differences are what should make these, for the British left, days of hope.</p> <p>Michael Foot was a dire leader not because he was too old or too leftwing (or wore a duffel coat), but because he was a compromise candidate, constantly torn between the interests of the unions \u2013 who were largely on the right \u2013 and the membership, which had moved left. His 1983 manifesto was actually well crafted, but they were the right ideas at the wrong time.</p> <p>Whatever you think of Corbyn (I support him and will campaign to keep him as leader), today is the right time for the idea that neoliberalism is over; that the state should shape, control and sometimes suppress the market; that austerity is self-defeating; that more expeditionary warfare cannot put right the chaos and injustice Blair and Bush injected into the Middle East.</p> <p>Once we had revived our local Labour ward in Sheffield in 1980, its monthly attendance rose from the 12 pensioners and councillors that had kept it alive under Callaghan to maybe 30, one-third of whom were Trotskyists or sympathisers of the Communist party. And that was it. We achieved stuff \u2013 above all in supporting Sheffield city council when it resisted cuts. But ultimately the social forces that were driving Thatcherism were stronger. Thatcherism was the main event.</p> <p>The main event of 2016 \u2013 in England and Wales at least \u2013 is that 300,000 people have joined the Labour party. Sure, some of the same people are still around, including me, but it feels like a much bigger moment than the Benn insurgency. Anybody who thinks it is being driven, or \u201ctwisted\u201d, by re-enactment groups from 20th-century Marxism is going to the wrong meetings.</p>",
  "<p>A month has passed since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-coup-attempt\">the failed military coup in Turkey</a>. The nightly demonstrations against the attempted coup culminated in pro-government rally in Istanbul a week last Sunday, where hundreds of thousands of flag-waving supporters were addressed by the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. </p> <p>Following the coup, the government launched a sweeping crackdown with Erdo\u011fan accusing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-who-is-the-man-blamed-by-turkeys-president-for-coup-attempt\">Fethullah G\u00fclen, the US-based cleric,</a> of masterminding it. Nearly 18,000 people have been detained or arrested across Turkey, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/turkey-issues-arrest-warrants-42-journalists-attempted-coup\">42 arrest warrants for journalists</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/turkey-sacks-15000-education-workers-in-purge\">sacking of 15,000 education workers</a>.<br></p> <p>Fethullah G\u00fclen, blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan for the failed coup in Turkey, has said the uprising by members of the country\u2019s military<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-turkey-coup-erdogan\"> could have been \u201cstaged\u201d by the government</a>.</p> <p>We heard from our readers across the country on the mood in the country one month after the abortive coup.</p> <h2>\u2018My fear is that this turns into blood-shed\u2019</h2> <p>We are living a post-coup era. The number of purges, arrests and restrictions are probably unseen. My fear is that this turns into blood-shed! God forbid. Which Erdo\u011fan openly said \u201cpeople want it, and I want it.\u201d<br></p> <p>I\u2019m from a secular Turkish family, orginating in Istanbul. I feared G\u00fclen people when I was at high school probably because of a video clip where I saw someone shaking hands with a rabbi and a pastor. Now I began to believe, he is a good believer. Maybe the best one I know living today.</p> <p>My dad put two Turkish flags on my car so I am less likely to be get harassed like his friend who was beaten up by democracy guards for not joining their car convoy by honking. Where is the right to choose? Where is democracy?</p> <p>I have not seen a single news agency that does not repeat what government says about the coup. If in you are in Turkey and a Turkish citizen, you have to blame G\u00fclen movement for everything. Just yesterday, Melih G\u00f6k\u00e7ek the mayor of Ankara, said \u201cFetullah Terrorist Organisation \u2013 referred to widely as FETO \u2013 is planning an earthquake on 14 August.\u201d </p> <p>If you have a public disagreement the AKP police unquestionably arrest you. There are countless examples over the twitter, including an example recently where a blind boy was arrested.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a man of vengeance. Looking back at his history, he always fought against someone and made himself essential to his supporters for their survival. It\u2019s very clear that his supporters fear an artificial enemy in Turkey; which makes them fanatically connected to Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p><strong>Mustafa, Istanbul </strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s a witch hunt\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The mood is terrible in my community. The coup attempt created devastating effects for me and my family. After Erdo\u011fan accused Fethullah G\u00fclen movement as the mastermind of the coup attempt with no evidence, we suffered greatly since my father was leading a G\u00fclen institution. </p> <p>Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people are in similar situation. I was lucky enough to leave Turkey since I have a US visa. My brother was a government official and he got suspended with no reason. He\u2019s literally waiting to be imprisoned with his bag prepared, even though he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. My sister\u2019s passport has been revoked with no reason. My uncle is in prison and we can\u2019t track him. No information is provided on his whereabouts. And no lawyer wants to defend him since they\u2019re afraid to defend someone who is a brother-in-law of a person who works for a G\u00fclen institution. </p> <p>We had nothing to do with the coup and we condemn it. But we are being oppressed with no evidence whatsoever. This is how people who have some connection to G\u00fclenist network suffers in Turkey right now. It\u2019s a witch hunt. </p> <p><strong>Mulat, currently living in New York</strong></p> <h2>Europeans have a lack of sympathy for the Turkish people</h2> <p>Turkish people resisted and blocked the attempted coup at a risk of losing their lives. This is the fact which should be applauded and praised by the West, Europe in particular, who are consistently claiming democracy as a European value.</p> <p>Yet, there hasn\u2019t been one high-level visit from Europe. Even worse, instead of strongly condemning the coup attempt, and expressing condolences for those who lost their lives, some chose to condemn the purge that occurred after that.</p> <p>This behaviour proves the Europeans have a lack of sympathy for the Turkish people. Turkish people are angry which is, I believe, one hundred percent right. <br>Although there are stories of unjust dismissals, I see these as minor given the depth of the investigation, they can be tolerated.</p> <p><strong>Emre, Ankara</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"089612baf7db1ef0deb3a8e91b707784cfc034c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/089612baf7db1ef0deb3a8e91b707784cfc034c6/0_0_1954_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Government poster on a train in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Government poster on a train in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anonymous/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The despair of the pre-coup times is replaced with tentative hopes\u2019</h2> <p>There was an air of alarm among the Turkish opposition during the immediate aftermath of the coup, but it waned to some extent as the government started to carry out a normalisation process with the opposition. It is sad that this process excludes the pro-Kurdish HDP, which is a sign that the government will not return to the peace process and the Turkey-PKK conflict will continue. <br></p> <p>However, in general, the despair of the pre-coup times is replaced with tentative hopes, as Erdo\u011fan seems less aggressive and has been making concessions to some of the opposition. It is also perceived as a positive development that the G\u00fclenist infiltrationist network in the state is getting dismantled, which has been seen as a threat by most of the society, given that diverse socio-political groups, from secularist soldiers to Kurdish activists, have been the target of operations by G\u00fclenist policemen, prosecutors and media in the past decade. </p> <p> The reports of torture are horrible and prison conditions are worsening in general due to State of Emergency measures. The possibility that the death penalty might be re-instantiated is worrying. The purges should be carried out more carefully, making a clear distinction between members of the G\u00fclenist network and people who are mere sympathizers of G\u00fclen. <br></p> <p><strong>Anonymous, Ankara</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I am happy normality has returned so quickly\u2019<br></h2> <p>There is some tension because of the ongoing arrests but generally people are bored of the whole subject and want to get on with their lives and enjoy the summer.</p> <p>I am happy that normality returned so quickly. I am not happy that Erdo\u011fan has increased his power base. I am saddened that those who were murdered by the lynch mobs have not been permitted proper funerals and burial, I feel for their families. I fear the reintroduction of the death penalty.</p> <p>I am surprised that everyone seems to have accepted that G\u00fclen was the organiser of the coup, even those who are poles apart from Erdo\u011fan and the AKP seem to hate and fear G\u00fclen even more. I cannot decide if this is mass brainwashing or if there is some clear evidence that has passed me by.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df6086d4645805a4dc9d37da8a30b4663986f229\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6086d4645805a4dc9d37da8a30b4663986f229/0_0_3870_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the nightly rallies in solidarity with the Turkish government, Bal\u0131kesir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the nightly rallies in solidarity with the Turkish government, Bal\u0131kesir.<strong><br></strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deniz/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The rallies every night to celebrate the overthrow of the coup were generally festive occasions involving all types and ages of people but they prevented any other sort of gathering in what is usually a very busy public space.

  "<p>After being detained for 50 days, World Vision\u2019s operations manager in the Gaza Strip, Mohammad Halabi, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/04/israel-world-visions-gaza-director-diverting-cash-hamas-mohammed-el-halabi\">charged by the Israeli authorities</a> with channelling millions of dollars of charitable funds to Hamas. Some will argue that this as an example of civil society organisations (CSOs) being vulnerable to corruption and political capture. But I see it as yet another example of states cracking down on civic space.</p> <p>In this case, World Vision says they <a href=\"http://www.wvi.org/jerusalem-west-bank-gaza/pressrelease/statement-world-vision-staff-arrest\">are yet to see any evidence</a> of Halabi\u2019s alleged wrongdoing and <a href=\"https://stream.org/world-vision-huge-gap-israeli-charges-actual-budget/\">have pointed out discrepancies</a> between the amount of funds he is accused of channeling to Hamas and the charity\u2019s actual budget year on year. More generally, I have seen first-hand through initiatives like the <a href=\"http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/\">INGO Accountability Charter</a> the effort that organisations like World Vision take to demonstrate their accountability. The <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-efficiency-trap-of-global\">evidence suggests</a> that INGOs spend nearly 80% more to track their finances and employ nearly twice as many finance staff as comparable for-profit multinationals. One could argue that the accountability burden is too high. </p> <p> Even more troubling are the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/christian-charity-top-israel-target-list-160809083841824.html\">systematic efforts</a> by Israeli authorities to intimidate and undermine civil society. Halabi\u2019s arrest \u2013 and another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/israel-second-palestinian-undp-aid-official-gaza-charged-assisting-hamas\">arrest of a UN development programme staff member</a> on similar charges \u2013 comes against a backdrop of ongoing intimidation by the Israeli state of international NGOs and UN agencies working in Palestine. In July this year, the Israeli parliament (the Knesset) passed a so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/11/israel-some-ngos-are-seen-as-the-enemy-from-the-inside\">transparency law</a> restricting the activities of all CSOs that receive more than 50% of their funding from international sources. Many see the law, which largely affects organisations most likely to be vocal critics of the Israeli government, as a blatant attempt to target CSOs uncovering human rights violations committed by the authorities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/11/israel-some-ngos-are-seen-as-the-enemy-from-the-inside\">Israel: 'Some NGOs are seen as the enemy from the inside'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, along with other wide-ranging strategies employed by the Israeli state to de-legitimise and discredit NGOs as the enemy within, forms part of a much wider global pattern.

Those organisations and activists working to question the power of political and economic elites, to expose poor governance or to advocate for the rights of excluded groups, are facing the most severe restrictions. Whether under the guise of combatting terrorism, protecting state secrets, or tackling suspicious foreign interference in their country, governments are employing a range of dubious measures to limit free speech, association and assembly. </p> <p>The result is that even those NGOs claiming to offer impartial humanitarian aid, like World Vision, that work in highly politicised environments \u2013 and there can be few more highly-charged than Israel \u2013 now find themselves treading the finest of lines. </p> <p>I have no idea whether Mohammad Halabi is innocent or guilty as charged, and of course, the Israeli government has the right to hold to account any individual or organisation found guilty of corruption. What I do know is that this is about more than one person. His story forms part of a much more complex ongoing narrative, in which civil society activists are routinely being cast as terrorists, traitors, foreign puppets or members of a disconnected elite. Until we begin to sit up and take notice of this narrative, until we start to fight back in defence of our rights, the increasingly forceful suppression of civil society around the world is only going to get worse. </p> <ul> <li><em>Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah is the secretary general and CEO of CIVICUS</em></li> </ul> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

It saw the city demarcate some 60 blocks of Manhattan\u2019s oldest neighbourhood as part of an urban geographical experiment meant to alter the often-fractious dynamic between motorists and pedestrians that is the unwritten law of the concrete jungle. </p> <p>Police officers stood with signs announcing <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/sharedstreets/shared-streets.shtml\">Shared Streets</a> at various checkpoints along the border of the Financial District, east to west from Broadway to Water Street, and north to south from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Battery.</p> <p>Within that area, pedestrians were encouraged to treat the roads like pavements, and cars were told to keep their speeds at 5mph or below.

He said restricting car usage for bikers was a worthy goal, but suggested it made more sense to go \u201call or nothing\u201d in terms of whether cars should be allowed or restricted. </p> <p>Several police officers suggested that the area was to be mostly car-free, except people who lived or worked in the area, yet cars regularly drove in the area without much pushback and, though sparse, car traffic routinely violated the suggested 5mph speed limit.

It\u2019s as if concepts from organic chemistry were compressed into a Dutch genre painting depicting a scuzzy backyard in industrial New Jersey. Feinman\u2019s awareness of the systems underlying observable phenomena is striking: he selects and deploys his images brilliantly, but the poem is often more structuralist than imagist.<br></p> <p> It\u2019s one of a batch of 39 previously unpublished poems written during the 1950s and now included in <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10686.html\">Corrupted into Song: The Complete Poems of Alvin Feinman</a>. It\u2019s a riveting collection by a poet who deserves to be better known. The problem is that Feinman published very little during his life: there was Preambles and Other Poems (OUP, 1964), which was then published with revisions as Poems by Princeton in 1990. The rest was a pointed silence.</p> <p> All the newly published poems are those of a young man, but they are in no way beginner\u2019s pieces. Usefully for the new reader, they clarify some of Feinman\u2019s preoccupations and affinities. He was never a Beat or a confessional poet: his early mentors were Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens. James Geary, editor of the previously unseen section of the book, and one-time student of Feinman, recalls that the Brooklyn-born college lecturer came from a long line of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Jews\">Litvak</a> Talmudic scholars. When he taught Milton, he approached the work as sacred text. </p> <p> Regarding his own poetry, Feinman was deeply humble, and even distrustful. The world might have been the problem, rather than the unreliable ways of words. The poem preceding Backyard, Hoboken, Summer is called Lament for the Coming of Spring, and coins the grimly memorable phrase, \u201chelic hate\u201d. Feinman\u2019s \u201csongs\u201d are unconsoling and some seem inconsolable.</p> <p> This week\u2019s poem begins: \u201cThe sun beating on his brain.\u201d This \u201cbeating\u201d may be creatively enriching; it\u2019s certainly more benign than helic hate. \u201cBrain\u201d occurs three times in the poem, almost like a form of linguistic punctuation (there\u2019s no conventional punctuation). Sun, cat, woodpile and flies surround this unnervingly exposed brain, the life cycles resembling a <a href=\"http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html\">Yeatsian gyre</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/aug/09/poem-of-the-week-wb-yeats\">Poem of the week: The Sorrow of Love by WB Yeats</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Yeats was important to Feinman. He\u2019s present not only in the copper-fastened craft but in the way Feinman turns a beggared space into a repository of the more-than-temporal. It\u2019s also possible that Feinman is following up a strand of Yeatsian mysticism with the puzzling assertion, \u201cHe holds three eternal parameters\u201d. Could this be a reference to the Hindu concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%E1%B9%87a\">the Three Gunas</a>? </p> <p>The same phrase is <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMhwx6BTwQcC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=what+are+the+three+eternal+parameters?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XIjKw2a7PB&amp;sig=i0TeyhJb1LkT5FW4oNSeO6i51UA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW-5ya-rjOAhUsDsAKHcNGAqsQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20are%20the%20three%20eternal%20parameters%3F&amp;f=false\">used by Dr S S Bhatti</a>, referring to the three architectural principles of the cosmos, Brahma (creation), Vishnu (sustenance) and Mahesh (destruction).</p> <p>Alvin\u2019s sun, cat, man, woodpile and flies may represent these qualities, or partake of their symbolism to some degree: the human brain embodies (\u201cholds\u201d) them all. </p> <p> But Feinman moves quickly on from his parameters to matters of perception: \u201cThe habit of his eye repeats / The shapes he reifies.\u201d The possessive pronoun here could refer to the cat but more probably refers to the protagonist summoned at the poem\u2019s start. We know that the images we see enter the retina in two dimensions, but are \u201ctranslated\u201d into three by the brain. If this is what \u201cthe habit of his eye\u201d and the \u201cshapes he reifies\u201d allude to, perhaps the \u201ceternal parameters\u201d triplicate foreshadows the three dimensions. </p> <p> The thought may be structuralist but the sounds are sensuous: we can hear the flies buzzing in the word \u201cnauseous\u201d, though it seems a transferred epithet: flies vomit as part of their digestive process and it\u2019s not very likely that hot weather makes them feel sick. These lines have a dense murmur and dazzle like that of the hot backyard. </p> <p> The next two lines are isolated and fill the space around them with sombre, or at least fatalistic, portent. There\u2019s a striking contrast between \u201csilence\u201d (a kind of negative image, a whiteness, with the power of salving \u201cits own ache\u201d) and \u201cthe plenum of a small red brain\u201d. The blood-suffused brain-colour is significant, connecting intelligence to what is \u201cred in tooth and claw\u201d. Perhaps, too, because the brain is seen as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plenum\">a plenum</a>, the poem is telling us that there\u2019s no way out of our own perception. The brain fits flush to the skull. Consciousness is basically organic structure and scarily inescapable.</p> <p> Decay is inherent in all this sun-bred life. The woodpile declines to \u201csticks\u201d, the flies, since they \u201cfall suppurant\u201d, must have succumbed to swat or insecticide or natural death. Meanwhile the cat, stirred from its \u201cslouching\u201d doze, is ready for some action. The sensed distinction between cosmic, perhaps God-like creation using space and time, and the small mammalian attempt, which is the product of illusory mental freedom, and merely reproductive, seems to drag the poem back as it heaves itself towards a positive conclusion. The penultimate stanza (the most difficult two lines in a difficult poem) imagine, I think, free will and limitless action, almost conceive them as possibilities. But the optimism is scarred, and will be deeply qualified by that repeated \u201cas though\u201d. The glittering fact remains: the poem\u2019s sonnet-size contains all the space and sun required for Feinman to shape and \u201cmake a world\u201d.</p> <ul> <li>Backyard, Hoboken, Summer is excerpted from Corrupted Into Song: The Complete Poems of Alvin Feinman by Alvin Feinman. \u00a9 2016 Princeton University Press.

  "<p>Women\u2019s rights groups, lawyers and doctors have condemned Turkey\u2019s decision to introduce a mandatory chemical castration programme for convicted sex offenders, arguing the treatment does not address the underlying reasons for widespread violence against women, and that bodily punishment will instead lead to increased abuse.</p> <p>\u00d6zg\u00fcl Kaptan, director of the <a href=\"https://www.kadindayanismavakfi.org.tr/english\">Women\u2019s Solidarity Foundation</a> (Kadav), has condemned the law \u2013 which came into effect on 26 July, at a time of extended legislative powers \u2013 as misguided.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very bad and dangerous decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThe law reduces crimes related to sexual abuse and rape to the one offending individual and to that individual\u2019s body, which disregards the systemic problem of why so many men in Turkey commit these crimes or are violent against women.</p> <p>\u201cMen are taught to think that they have a right over women. We need to change ideas about gender equality and masculinity. What we really need is a change of attitude, of education. That cannot be done by passing such a law, or overnight.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/08/gazientep-turkey-tamkeen-quest-to-rebuild-syria\">Gaziantep: home to Isis killers, sex traders\u2026 and a quest to rebuild Syria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reliable data on violence against women in Turkey is hard to come by, and many cases go entirely unreported. According to the independent Turkish press organisation Bianet, <a href=\"http://bianet.org/english/women/172165-men-kill-over-284-women-in-2015\">284 women were killed in Turkey</a> in 2015. In 77% of cases, the murderer was the victim\u2019s husband or partner, or a male relative. At least 133 women were raped, and 42% of the victims were under the age of 18.</p> <p>\u201cCrimes related to sex offending have much more to do with power and domination than with sex and the sexual drive of the offender. And there are many different ways of physical and psychological abuse,\u201d Kaptan said.</p> <p>Chemical castration involves the administration of libido-reducing drugs and, unlike physical castration, the effects are reversible. However, health experts have pointed out that the long-term use of some drugs used in chemical castration may lead to serious and permanent side-effects, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. </p> <p>Turkey joins a small group of countries that have legalised the punishment, including most recently Indonesia, as well as Poland, Russia and some states in the US. Germany, France, Sweden and Denmark have introduced voluntary use of the measure. According to research from Scandinavia, reoffending rates have dropped from 40% to between zero and 5%. </p> <p>However, the new Turkish law does not seek the consent of the offender. Instead, the decision to administer treatment will be made by a court. An offender risks greater punishment should he fail to continue the treatment.</p> <p>Kaptan argued that mandatory chemical castration was an inhumane punishment comparable to the death penalty.</p> <p>\u201cViolence will create only more violence. In that sense it should be talked about in the same way as we talk about the death penalty,\u201d she said. \u201cWe oppose all corporal punishment, because it violates the bodily integrity and the human rights of a person.\u201d</p> <p>The controversial move came during Turkey\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/erdogan-bans-academics-from-travel-holds-first-post-coup-security-meeting-ankara-turkey\"> three-month state of emergency</a>, which allows the government to bypass parliament and pass laws and regulations virtually unopposed. Regulations introduced during the state of emergency, imposed after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-attempted-coup-what-we-know-so-far\">attempted coup </a>of 15 July, cannot be appealed. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sexuality and male-female relationships in Turkey are not healthy</p> <footer> <cite>Canan Ar\u0131n</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe AKP [the ruling Justice and Development party] profited from the current chaos in the country following the coup attempt,\u201d Kaptan said. \u201cThey seized the opportunity to introduce this law, which under normal circumstances would have been opposed very strongly.\u201d</p> <p>Mandatory drug treatment for sex offenders has been discussed before in Turkey. In 2011, female AKP deputies suggested chemical castration after a 17-year-old girl was murdered by her boyfriend. The discussion regained momentum in 2015 following the killing and attempted rape of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/04/three-men-life-sentence-murder-student-turkey-ozgecan-aslan\">\u00d6zgecan Aslan</a>, a 20-year-old university student. Each time, the idea was harshly criticised and subsequently dropped.</p> <p>\u201cChemical castration is a punishment that will merely assuage the victim\u2019s immediate wish for revenge,\u201d warned lawyer Canan Ar\u0131n. \u201cIt will not address the underlying problems. Sexual abuse is not only committed because of a man\u2019s genitals. Sexuality and male-female relationships in Turkey are not healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s 2014 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/24/turkeys-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-women-not-equal-men\">comments that men and women could not be equal</a> because such a notion would \u201cgo against the laws of nature\u201d, Ar\u0131n asked: \u201cIf the government propagates such views, how are things supposed to change for the better?\u201d</p> <p>Both Kaptan and Ar\u0131n underlined that Turkey\u2019s existing laws were sufficient to deal with violence against women. In 2012, after the government enacted <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/turkey-parliament-adopts-law-on-prevention-of-domestic-violence/\">new legislation to prevent domestic violence</a>, Turkey became the first country <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://europa.eu/epic/news/2012/20121010_convention_on_preventing_and_combating_violence_against_women_and_domestic_violence_en.htm\">to ratify a Council of Europe treaty on violence against women</a>, and the AKP government has promised to intensify its fight against rape and sexual assault.</p> <p>But so far, little has changed. Women\u2019s rights groups point out that legal measures have repeatedly fallen short, and that convicted sex offenders and those guilty of abuse and violence against women still benefit from courts reducing sentences for \u201cgood behaviour\u201d, encouraging the public to see their offences as trivial.

  "<p>The Guardian carried <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/13/my-activist-father-was-hanged\">a very interesting interview on Saturday with David Wolfe</a> about his father, who was executed in South Africa for bombing a railway station during the struggle against apartheid.</p> <p>Although the fact wasn\u2019t necessarily relevant, the piece didn\u2019t mention that Wolfe is chair of the <a href=\"http://pressrecognitionpanel.org.uk/\">Press Recognition Panel</a> (PRP), the body established by royal charter to decide on the suitability of press regulators.</p> <p>But I would guess that a reference to Wolfe\u2019s PRP role might well have drawn yet more readers to the fascinating, and tragic, story of his background.</p> <p>It transpires that it wasn\u2019t until Wolfe was 16 that he discovered the truth about his father, John Harris, who was a member of the anti-apartheid group, African Resistance Movement.</p> <p>In July 1964, he left a suitcase containing a bomb in the whites-only section of Johannesburg railway station. It exploded 13 minutes later, killing one woman and causing extensive \u201clife-changing\u201d injuries to another.</p> <p>Harris was convicted of murder, sentenced to death and hanged in April 1965, becoming the only white person to be executed in South Africa for a crime against apartheid. He was 27.</p> <p>David, now 52 and <a href=\"https://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/member/david-wolfe/\">a barrister with London\u2019s Matrix Chambers</a>, has revisted his past for a Channel 4 documentary, which will be screened on 27 August.*</p> <p>In it, he talks to his mother (who has died since the programme was made) and other people who were there at the time, including the badly injured victim.</p> <p>As the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Moorhead noted, the film raises several questions. What should Wolfe feel about his father\u2019s crime? Are the sins of a father visited on his son? Does David feel - and should he feel - guilt for his father\u2019s actions? </p> <p>Wolfe\u2019s mother, Ann, returned to Britain after her husband\u2019s execution. She later met and married an environmentalist, Martin Wolfe, providing David with an \u201cextremely happy\u201d childhood.</p> <p>Does Wolfe think he was affected by his father\u2019s actions and his reasoning for them? Wolfe told Moorhead: \u201cI think what my father\u2019s story gave me was what I would call a healthy scepticism about the way government and society works, and about the need to be independent-minded.\u201d</p> <p>That sounds like a good basis for a man with the uncomfortable task of making decisions about press regulators under the gaze of considerable hostility from newspaper publishers and editors. </p> <p>*The Good Terrorist on Channel 4, 8pm, 27 August</p>",
  "<p>In Jane Anderson\u2019s travels with Aequitas, a group that helps law enforcement officials investigate and prosecute difficult cases of sexual assault, it is often the most popular question posed to her: how do we charge someone who didn\u2019t commit the rape, but filmed it for all to see?</p> <p>Several months ago, it was a prosecutor in Louisiana, where Anderson was on the road hosting a training session. Six weeks ago, it was a new member of Miami\u2019s cybercrimes unit. There had been an assault, captured on video, and the cybercrimes prosecutor wanted to know how severely she could charge the person suspected of recording.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hearing from prosecutors all over the country that they\u2019re handling cases where a sexual assault was recorded by a \u2018bystander\u2019 and they\u2019re struggling to find ways to hold that person criminally liable for something,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThey\u2019re really eager to hear some strategies.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Witnessing or videotaping a rape is not just being bystander. It\u2019s much more like buying a ticket to an event</p> <footer> <cite>Jane Anderson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their inquiries speak to a new trend noticed by law enforcement officials and victims advocates alike. These days, it is staggeringly routine for a rape, especially if it occurs in a social setting, to be accompanied by some form of digital trophy-taking. That could mean anything from a photo of a passed-out victim to a video chronicling the entire attack. Not evidence, but a memento.</p> <p>As the culture has grown less tolerant of sexual assault, however, the appetite has increased to punish not only the rapists, but anyone who facilitated the crime.</p> <p>So why not those who magnify the trauma with their phones?</p> <p>It is a new question for the law, and a challenging one. There\u2019s the hazard of charging a good Samaritan who was trying to videotape evidence. In Miami, the cybercrimes expert risks sabotaging her own case. On the one hand, the video was a heinous souvenir of the assault. On the other, the suspected cameraperson could potentially testify against the suspected assailant. \u201cShe really felt her hands were tied,\u201d Anderson said.</p> <p>In Steubenville, Ohio, two students who filmed and photographed the notorious gang rape there ultimately escaped prosecution for this very reason. Anthony Craig admitted he took two photos of the victim and Mark Cole copped to recording a video. But prosecutors gave both immunity deals in exchange for their testimony against the girl\u2019s rapists. Despite a subsequent effort to revoke their immunity, Cole and Craig were never charged.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is a budding consensus that prosecutors should work around those obstacles. Anyone whose camerawork turns a private humiliation into a public one, they argue, should face serious criminal liability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/campus-sexual-assault-university-colorado-austin-wilkerson\">'Inspired by other survivors\u2019: campus rape victim demands to be heard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s another form of victimization,\u201d said Brian Pinero, the vice-president of victim services for the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network. The problem \u201cis not simply that they did not do anything to stop it. They gave a window into your suffering to the world. And it exists forever, replaying the worst thing that ever happened to you.\u201d<br></p> <p>How someone who records a sexual assault could be charged varies widely by jurisdiction. Most states impose a misdemeanor penalty for possessing photos or videos of someone engaged in a sexual act without that person\u2019s knowledge. Aequitas has attempted to help several prosecutors go further, and charge video-takers as accomplices or co-conspirators. In a recent publication, Aequitas even argued that the state can charge someone who recorded an assault with the assault itself.<br></p> <p>Prosecutors in Franklin County, Ohio, are daring to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/us/periscope-rape-case-columbus-ohio-video-livestreaming.html\">test this theory</a>, leveling charges of rape, kidnapping and sexual battery against a teenager who broadcast her friend\u2019s rape using the live-streaming app Periscope.</p> <p>But unless the suspect can be seen cheering on the assailant or physically restraining the victim, the bar for co-conspirator charges is high. It might be ambivalent whether the person who filmed the assault did so out of voyeurism or to deliberately create evidence (as the Ohio teenager argues). </p> <p>\u201cWithout a perfect set of facts,\u201d said Anderson, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a very low level of accountably.\u201d </p> <p>Still, prosecutors\u2019 willingness to even consider serious charges is a shift from just a few years ago. For a 2011 survey in the Georgetown Law Journal, Kimberly K Allen made an exhaustive search for instances in which the witnesses of a rape were thought to be criminally liable. She came up with just one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/stanford-sexual-assault-judge-aaron-persky-de-anza-college\">Stanford judge allowed revealing photos of alleged gang-rape victim in prior case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In that <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-court-of-appeals/1321299.html\">example</a>, from 2009, two men at a party raped a passed-out 15-year-old girl while other teenagers watched, laughed, and cheered them on. (They did not take photos.) When the two rapists challenged their conviction, the Texas court of appeals said there \u201cmay be sufficient evidence to establish that the people who encouraged [the rapists] committed some criminal activity.\u201d Only the onlookers had never been charged to begin with.</p> <p>Allen was making the case for prosecutors to hold spectators criminally liable in cases of gang rape. \u201cGang rapists are uniquely motivated by the presence of \u2026 the \u2018audience\u2019,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFar from being mere passive witnesses to the rape, spectators [are] facilitating the commission of the crime.\u201d Intentionally watching a gang rape, Allen argued, could be criminalized the same way dozens of states make it a crime to knowingly attend an illegal street race or dogfight. </p> <p>Aequitas argues the same theory could apply when a person not only watches a rape but films it. Unless a person walks away or calls for help, Anderson said, \u201cWitnessing or videotaping a rape is not just being bystander. It\u2019s much more like buying a ticket to an event.\u201d</p> <p>Current law makes it tough to translate that theory into criminal charges. So Aequitas and its allies are making subtle efforts to persuade state lawmakers to criminalize the filming of a rape outright.</p> <p>Victims\u2019 advocates have also called for closing the gaps in existing laws. Many states only criminalize the surreptitious recording of a sex act, which wouldn\u2019t apply if the victim knows he or she is being filmed, but did not consent. Other states only criminalize recording in spaces where there is an expectation of privacy \u2013 a bathroom or a bedroom. Places such as a beach or a fraternity party might be exempted. </p> <p>But some are cautioning against expanding the law to capture people who didn\u2019t actually commit an assault.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They gave a window into your suffering.

But he saw problems with likening the act of taking photographs to the actual assault. \u201cWhat if it looks like consensual sex? Do I have to know the person is being sexually assaulted? Are we really going to criminalize being a bystander as opposed to actively assisting in the commission of a crime? It\u2019s a slippery slope.\u201d</p> <p>A 2013 incident in Athens, Ohio, brought those very problems into focus. In October of that year, a freshman posted a video on Instagram of a sexual encounter on the street. He assumed the woman had consented. Later, she told police it was assault. </p> <p>Citing a lack of evidence, law enforcement officers in that case never pursued charges. </p> <p>But even when a video seems to contain a straightforward depiction of a crime, prosecutors have found they have limited avenues for conviction. That was the case earlier this year, after footage surfaced of an alleged gang rape in Panama City Beach during spring break.

  "<p>It took hundreds of skilled negotiators, dozens of videoconferences and seemingly endless days in Brussels to produce the 1,600-page text. Some seven years after Canada and the EU began negotiating a trade deal, the future of the agreement remains shrouded in doubt.<br></p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t stopped the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta, as Canada\u2019s deal with the EU is known, from being held up as the preferred model for Britain to follow in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>David Davis, the new minister for Brexit, has called it the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/global-bilateral-trade-deals-bigger-eu-single-market-david-davis\">\u201cperfect starting point for our discussions with the commission\u201d</a>.

They point to the years of complex negotiations demanded by the deal and the persistent uncertainty that continues to dog its implementation \u2013 and they question whether the agreement\u2019s framework is far-reaching enough to allow the UK to replicate its current level of access to the single market. </p> <p>\u201cHow they think Ceta is the panacea, I\u2019m confused,\u201d said one senior Canadian government official who was deeply involved with the negotiations. \u201cWe still don\u2019t get complete access to the EU market the way the Brits currently have as a member state. So I don\u2019t understand this looking towards Ceta as the answer to Brexit when they will be taking a 43-year step backwards in terms of the current access they have to the European Union.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/index.aspx?lang=eng\">The agreement</a> \u2013 which has yet to be ratified \u2013 promises that around 98.6% of goods traded between Canada and the EU will be free of duty, paves the way for access to public procurement between the two markets and empowers regulatory bodies to accept the standards and tests carried out in each other\u2019s jurisdictions. The trade deal doesn\u2019t heighten access to sensitive agricultural products such as eggs or poultry and keeps quotas \u2013 albeit boosting them \u2013 in place for tariff-free imports of products such as beef and cheese. While the trade deal aims to liberalise services, hundreds of exceptions are listed. </p> <p>Under Ceta, Canada will have no hand in setting EU regulations or formulating product standards and no access to the banking passport system that would have allowed its banks and financial services to trade freely. The freedom of movement clauses are primarily focused on businesspeople. </p> <p>Negotiations between Canada and the EU dragged on for years, despite early expectations that they would be completed by 2012. The extended timeline was a reflection of the sheer complexity of the issues being addressed and helped produce a document described by Canada\u2019s trade minister as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/uk-canada-advice-post-brexit-trade-deals-eu-ceta\">a \u201cgold standard\u201d deal with the EU.</a> </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised we pulled it off,\u201d said the government source, crediting the political will that came from both sides.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the same spirit of collaboration will colour negotiations between the UK and the EU. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how it can be exactly replicated,\u201d said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. \u201cGains are going to be different, stakes are going to be different. And therefore the deal has to be different.\u201d </p> <p>Some of this lies in the scale of Canada\u2019s trade with the EU. Canada\u2019s largest trading partner is the United States, accounting for more than 60% of its total global trade in 2014. The EU is Canada\u2019s second trading partner, representing around 10% of its external trade. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6a53103e820631699af2f0422dc38273bc9fc52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6a53103e820631699af2f0422dc38273bc9fc52/0_68_3894_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Hannover at a march against the TTIP and CETA free trade agreements on the eve of a visit by Barack Obama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters at a march against the TTIP and CETA free trade agreements on the eve of a visit by Barack Obama in Hannover</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast, the EU is the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner, <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/international-transactions/outward-foreign-affiliates-statistics/how-important-is-the-european-union-to-uk-trade-and-investment-/sty-eu.html\">accounting for 45% of UK exports of goods and services</a> in 2014 and 53% of imports. As Pierre Pettigrew, a former trade minister for Canada, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/thunderer/article4719293.ece\">wrote in March in the Times</a>: \u201cIt is fatuous to think there is a real comparison between Canada\u2019s relationship with the EU and the UK\u2019s with the bloc. Indeed, were Canada to trade as much with the EU as we do with the US we would want a much deeper relationship than Ceta.\u201d</p> <p>Pettigrew pointed to the seven years of negotiation that went into Canada\u2019s deal. \u201cWhen you can rely on trade with the world\u2019s largest economy, as is the case for Canada, you can afford the luxury of time. That will not be the UK\u2019s position.\u201d He estimated it could take up to 10 years for the UK and EU to reach agreements on various arrangements. </p> <p>The time would likely be spent attempting to reach compromises on the many areas not covered or minimised by Ceta. Canadian exports to the UK and EU are dominated by gold, precious stones and other metals \u2013 all products that aren\u2019t produced in large quantities in Europe, Fredrik Erixon of the European Centre for International Political Economy <a href=\"http://capx.co/the-canada-eu-trade-deal-is-no-model-for-brexit/\">noted in a recent article on Ceta</a>. \u201cFor the UK, whose trade with the EU are in sectors highly exposed to regulatory protection (finance, nuclear power equipment, pharmaceuticals, et cetera) it would lead to a serious loss of market access and commercial integration,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>The task of reaching a compromise within these sectors would fall to the UK\u2019s team of negotiators \u2013 many of whom have yet to be hired. The UK government has said it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/business-minister-sajid-javid-opens-preliminary-trade-talks-with-india\">plans to hire up to 300 people</a> after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/uk-lacks-expertise-for-trade-talks-with-europe-says-top-civil-servant\">an initial government review</a> turned up just 20 \u201cactive hands-on\u201d trade negotiators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I honestly don\u2019t know how it can be exactly replicated</p> <footer> <cite>Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These negotiators will also have to decide whether to push forward with some of Ceta\u2019s more thorny clauses, such as that which allows corporations to launch legal challenges against governments perceived to block them. \u201cThat\u2019s a real threat,\u201d said Andreas Schotter, a professor at Western University\u2019s Ivey School of Business in southern Ontario. \u201cThat\u2019s what the person in the street doesn\u2019t understand, that with the legislation that is behind these trade deals, corporations become powerful enough to sue governments.\u201d</p> <p>The clause could leave the UK fending off the same sort of challenge to its sovereignty that many in the Leave camp had hoped to avoid by leaving the EU, he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have German corporations start suing the UK government for not giving access to certain areas in the market or not giving certain incentives or certain aids.\u201d </p> <p>Ironically, the same voices which laud Ceta as a model to be followed have helped cast doubt on when \u2013 and whether \u2013 the trade deal between Canada and the EU will come into force. Recently, the European Commission backed away from a plan that would have sped up the adoption of the deal, saying it would instead send the text to the EU\u2019s 28 national parliaments, as well as some regional parliaments, to be ratified. </p> <p>The Canadian government hopes to have the agreement in force by early 2017, said Greg Tereposky of Borden Ladner Gervais, a law firm that represented various private sector companies during the negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible \u2026 We don\u2019t know how the UK will fit into this puzzle, ultimately.\u201d </p> <p>He pointed to the annual quota set for tariff-free cheese laid out in the trade deal, rising to 18,000 tonnes over a period of six years. \u201cClearly some of that should be allocated to British blue cheese. The question is, how do you divide that?\u201d </p> <p>Discussions such as these will probably force officials to push back the date of Canada\u2019s trade deal with the EU to the second half of 2017 at the earliest, he said. \u201cThese are very complex and potentially contentious negotiations.\u201d </p>",

Discretion is very important and I have never taken advantage of the trust placed in me.</p> <p>Surprisingly I\u2019ve had very few clients I didn\u2019t warm to, but the rude ones stand out. One in particular springs to mind because she didn\u2019t want to get her hands dirty and sadly you can\u2019t make decisions about the many things in someone\u2019s domain without their input. At times like these I try not to judge. I didn\u2019t know her full story and what caused her discomfort with me trying to help her.</p> <p>On the flipside, a good number of clients have become close friends. I am lucky that I\u2019m able to separate the people I enjoy working for from their sometimes unsettling behaviour. A family I adored had cats and dogs that they allowed to go to the toilet inside \u2013 and no one would attend to it promptly. Urine would soak into the floorboards and faeces got mushed into whatever was left on the floor. When you are constantly in an environment that is chaotic and smells, you become desensitised. So while it may seem extreme to you or I, the owner of the clutter barely notices it.</p> <p>Of course you see all sorts of things and luckily it doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest. I thought it was funny when a client saw me spot lube in her bathroom and she said: \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry you had to see that.\u201d Do they think I don\u2019t have lube at my house?</p> <p>Being at the coalface of unwanted belongings has changed my relationship with stuff. I rarely shop, I encourage friends and family not to give me gifts and I easily discard unwanted items. I\u2019m a sucker, however, for saving things from clients \u2013 like plastic bags they put in the bin, which I find wasteful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/secret-life-trade-union-employee-work-benefits-workers-rights\">The secret life of a trade union employee: I do little but the benefits are incredible | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I often come home from work and feel that my small apartment is like a five-star hotel: clean lines, most of the washing put away, and I know exactly what is in the fridge.

  "<p><strong>Hometown: </strong>Mossley. </p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Lee Broadbent (lead vocals), Joe Martin (vocals, guitar), Eoghan Clifford (guitar), Stephen Evans (bass), Asa Morley (drums).</p> <p><strong>The background: </strong>Cabbage have been described as \u201cManchester\u2019s most exciting new band\u201d, a phrase still guaranteed to tantalise, even if you happen to believe the last musical aggregate of note the city produced was a quarter-century ago. It wouldn\u2019t be hard, on the 40th anniversary of the Sex Pistols laying siege at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/14/sex-pistols-lesser-free-hall\">the Lesser Free Trade Hall</a>, to argue that Manchester has produced more great music than anywhere else in Britain these last four decades. So the idea that Cabbage \u2013 from Mossley, an insignificant dead zone eight miles east of Manchester \u2013 might be the next in line after Buzzcocks, Magazine, the Fall, Joy Division, New Order, A Certain Ratio, the Smiths, Happy Mondays, 808 State and A Guy Called Gerald makes them at least worthy of investigation. </p> <p>Actually, turns out they\u2019re more like a northern version of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/14/fat-white-family\"> Fat White Family\u2019s</a> southern uproar, with a dash of the Fall\u2019s garage rumble and Shaun Ryder\u2019s dingy surrealism. The name Cabbage suggests they\u2019re steeped in the banal minutiae of British life and so it proves, with their songs about dinner ladies and austerity, but there is a political inflection that gives them an angry charge. They call it an \u201cidiosyncratic, satirical attack in the form of discordant neo post-punk\u201d, and there is a similar sense of literate but degenerate transgression to FWF, with a penchant for juvenilia, if not outright scatology and coprophilia. In one song the protagonist, a male food operative at a public school, does end up having a \u201cwank in the quiche\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hah4_gj-Bs\">in the video to another</a> they liquidise a bunch of food detritus and pour the resulting brown goo all over themselves, with shades of Earl Sweatshirt\u2019s gob-smacking video to <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/12056212\">Earl</a>.

He\u2019s a true heart-on-sleeve original, who died for his cause. It may not have been a very focused cause, but he was artistically great.\u201d Martin considers the other Cabbagers \u201ca bunch of scruffy bastards\u201d, adding, \u201cI was instantly at home when I found them \u2013 I realised I wasn\u2019t the only one who hadn\u2019t had a wash.\u201d He likes \u201cthe thought that anything can happen\u201d at a Cabbage gig, and indeed concerts have seen all the members disrobing, although in his defence this is largely because \u201cit gets really hot\u201d. It\u2019s not, he argues, premeditated, merely the corollary of their going-for-it attitude that is itself the result of them getting wound up by matters both trivial and titanic. </p> <p>\u201cUnless you\u2019ve had your head in a washing machine for your entire adult life, how are you not writing about something political?\u201d wonders Martin of his disengaged indie peers. \u201cIt\u2019s baffling. No bands are saying anything whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>Cabbage have mixed feelings about their home turf, aware that the city\u2019s future cannot merely be based on its admittedly impressive history. \u201cIt\u2019s dying from resting on its laurels,\u201d moans Martin, who prefers the doomy, dark Manchester of Joy Division to the acid-house happy iteration of the Roses et al. \u201cWe\u2019re not claiming to be bastions of originality, but it doesn\u2019t seem to take much effort to step away from the past. Manchester got that big, exploded, and the ashes are everywhere. Someone needs to blow the cobwebs off. You only have to walk down the street and see all the Liam Gallagher-alikes with their sideburns flapping in the wind to see it.

To put it crudely \u2013 it was a bunch of white men up against Australia\u2019s multi-ethnic communities. </p> <p>While attorney general George Brandis, and the new IPA-trained Liberal parliamentarians, Senator James Paterson and Tim Wilson, are undoubtedly well-versed in theories of liberalism and free speech; and despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/23/morrison-and-bernardis-claims-of-victimhood-are-clever-but-theyre-dishonest\">Scott Morrison\u2019s claims</a> that he\u2019s suffered from <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/06/21/scott-morrison-straight-white-man-says-he-has-experienced-bigo/\">\u201chatred and bigotry\u201d</a> for his views on marriage equality; they\u2019re hardly a cast of characters aware of the deep pains of racism.</p> <p>What better way to demonstrate that than Liberal Democrat Senator David <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/david-leyonhjelm-racial-discrimination-complaint-angry-white-male-fairfax-18c\">Leyonhjelm making a complaint to the RDA</a> against Fairfax for a satirical depiction of him by Mark Kenny as a \u201cboorish, supercilious know-all with the empathy of a besser block\u201d and an \u201cangry white male\u201d. Leyonhjelm, claiming it is likely to be offensive to white men, in a seemingly confused attempt to highlight either the double standards of the law and of race theory, or the breadth of the law, will likely fail on both accounts, but it demonstrates how out of touch he and the free speech brigade are with the genuine harms of racism and bigotry, and the contempt they have for real victims of it.</p> <p> The overhaul of 18C wasn\u2019t abandoned for lack of ideological will.

It is not up to any one person to say, \u201cI am offended\u201d. Nor should we dismiss or sneer at the kind of concerns that have led to the rise of Hansonist populism in July\u2019s election. But let\u2019s get real \u2013 there is scant evidence to suggest 18C is censoring or constraining public debate on anything. Kruger and Hanson\u2019s antics surely show we have plenty of space for racist inanity free of any legal recourse.</p> <p>We needn\u2019t have to endure howls of free speech every time someone who exercises a bigoted opinion faces pressure for their views.

It feeds the worst kind of movements capable of growing into hate that can do more than just offend \u2013 it can put racial and ethnic minorities in physical and mental harm\u2019s way.</p> <p>As minorities of all backgrounds justifiably fear what the revival of Pauline Hanson and One Nation will mean for racism in this country, 18C\u2019s repeal would send all the wrong signals that the rivers of hate are starting to break through.

But sometimes, the loudest and angriest voices penetrate far beyond their mandate, and cause the deepest kind of personal and societal damage. </p> <p>People don\u2019t need to have the right to be bigots \u2013 we can be better than that. We can have serious, mature debates about issues of significance without racial discrimination and vilification. 18C won\u2019t prevent us from doing so \u2013 only small-mindedness and arrogance will. What 18C does \u2013 providing respite to victims of racism and bigotry \u2013 is too important for that. Now is exactly the worst time to repeal it.</p>",

His ability to cut himself off from everything around him is one of his greatest strengths, although it also meant that he was the last person to see his gold medal coming during the floor final.</p> <p>The firm favourite was Kenzo Shirai \u2013 known as the Twist Prince by his team\u2011mates because he packs nearly two dozen of them into his routine. In fact, if the men were allowed to perform their floor routines to music as the women do, the soundtrack this year would certainly have been Chubby Checker, because everyone here was doing the twist, including Whitlock.</p> <p>However, it was his fast-moving flares \u2013 a skill he also uses to such devastating effect on the pommel \u2013 that really caught the eye. His signature \u2018air flare\u2019 \u2013 where he jumped from one hand to another mid\u2011move \u2013 could only have looked cooler if he had been shooting bad guys at the same time.</p> <p>Whitlock\u2019s performance had immediately followed that of the local hero, Diego Hyp\u00f3lito, whose routine had earned him a competition-best 15.533. The 30\u2011year\u2011old, who took Brazil\u2019s first ever world title in the sport 11 years ago, fell competing this piece at both his past two Olympics, and he had postponed his retirement to compete at his home Games. When Whitlock\u2019s score was revealed on screen \u2013 and was 0.1 points higher \u2013 the announcer had to beg the crowd to stop booing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/simon-biles-vault-olympic-gold-hong-un-jong-rio-2016\">Simone Biles wins vault Olympic gold after Hong Un-jong gamble backfires</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then came Shirai, who begins with a start value a massive 0.7 points higher than his nearest rival, which is like giving Usain Bolt a 20-metre head start. But the 19-year-old\u2019s knees crumbled beneath him midway through his routine. First a small stumble, and then a major topple, ruled him dramatically out of the running.</p> <p>Only the American Samuel Mikulak, who had qualified with a massive 15.800, was left to deny Whitlock gold and a deep landing on his first pass and a step out on his second handed second and third places on the podium to Hyp\u00f3lito and his compatriot Arthur Mariano. </p> <p>The crowd, who have been vocal all week about what they perceive to be underscoring for the home nation, cut loose.</p> <p>\u201cIt reminded me of London,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cI remember then, I couldn\u2019t believe how loud it was, it was at this level where it felt like it couldn\u2019t go any higher, and it was like that for the Brazilians today.\u201d</p> <p>Phlegmatic as ever, he will not be giving himself too much time off to celebrate. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in the gym, there\u2019s always stuff for me to learn.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The head coach of Great Britain\u2019s Olympic swimming team, Bill Furniss, has claimed that the British were robbed of four medals at the Rio Games and demanded tougher action against dopers in his sport. Seven British swimmers came fourth in their events and Furniss alleges the majority were unfairly denied a podium position.</p> <p>British swimmers, spearheaded by the brilliant Adam Peaty, enjoyed their most successful Games in the pool in the modern era, securing a total of six medals and doubling their meagre haul in London four years ago. Furniss, though, firmly believes that tally could have been higher and fears clean athletes are still being discriminated against.</p> <p>\u201cIt sticks in my throat that we have had seven fourths and in at least three of those finals an individual [has previously] failed a drug test,\u201d said Furniss, who guided Rebecca Adlington to her four Olympic medals. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about it in the build-up because it was a distraction but I think we have been penalised more than any other nation here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/olympic-swimming-credibility-doubt-questions-entry-times\">Olympic swimming\u2019s credibility in doubt after questions over entry times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLook at the races and look at the statistics. You know it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s in the public domain. I\u2019m not going to mention names. But as a nation, we fell foul of it. It\u2019s hard to take. My message to the people who govern our sport is that we want a clean sport. My message is that I have got certain individuals to whom I have got to explain [this]. They have done everything right and are not being looked after. Everything seems to be focused around how fair we can be to people who have not passed drugs tests. It is just not right. It sticks in my throat.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood the GB swimmers whom Furniss believes were particularly unlucky are James Guy, Chloe Tutton, Fran Halsall and Andrew Willis. Guy finished fourth in the 200m freestyle by 0.26sec in a race won by China\u2019s Sun Yang, who served a doping ban in 2014. Tutton also narrowly missed out on the podium in the 200m breaststroke with Russia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/olympic-swimming-yulia-efimova-fina-fallout\">Yulia Efimova</a>, previously banned for 16 months after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system, claiming silver.</p> <p>Both Halsall and Willis also finished agonisingly out of the medals, with the former finishing just two one-hundredths of a second behind bronze medallist Aliaksandra Herasimenia of Belarus, banned for two years in 2003 following a positive test for norandrosterone. Willis lost out by 0.09sec to Russia\u2019s Anton Chupkov, who has never tested positive for a banned substance but would not have competed at the Games had the IOC taken a firmer stance on Russia\u2019s collective participation following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/18/wada-report-russia-sochi-winter-olympics\">systematic state-sponsored doping</a> at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014.</p> <p>There is no suggestion any of the aforementioned medallists used illegal performance-enhancing substances in Rio but Furniss insists anyone found guilty of cheating should be barred from all future Games. \u201cI think if you fail a drugs test you should not be at the Olympic Games. I can\u2019t say it any more clear than that. It\u2019s hard to take; it\u2019s shambolic.\u201d</p> <p>There is similar mood of simmering frustration among GB\u2019s swimmers, with Peaty also calling for a zero tolerance attitude to doping. \u201cIn my opinion convicted drug cheats should be out, it doesn\u2019t matter how many times you\u2019ve done it or been caught,\u201d said the 21-year-old. \u201cI try not to get too caught up in the politics of it and just focus on my performance but hopefully the sport will be stronger from this [controversy] and move on. You feel for any athlete who has been around dopers and has missed out on a medal. It doesn\u2019t matter what country you\u2019re from, as a sport you have to stay united.\u201d</p> <p>Such was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/adam-peaty-breaks-world-record-again-on-memorable-eveningfor-britain\">Peaty\u2019s total dominance in his own event</a>, however, that there have been dark mutterings from eastern Europe about possible double standards. Furniss, however, dismisses such unfounded whispers out of hand. \u201cI know what Adam Peaty does. What he does is unbelievable in terms of the work he puts in. And he\u2019s had a very measured improvement, you can see where he\u2019s come from. That guy is 100% the model of what a swimmer should be.\u201d</p> <p>The issue of who can and cannot be trusted in the pool became a recurring topic throughout the first week of the Games, not least when Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/mack-horton-speaks-out-gold-medal-rio-2016\">Mack Horton referred to his rival Sun</a> as a drug cheat and Efimova, who won two individual silver medals, was forced to defend herself in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/efimova-and-sun-on-podium-as-king-delivers-victory-for-clean-sport\">excruciating press conference</a> with American gold medallist Lilly King.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/george-bovell--olympics-swimming-reality-tv-show\">George Bovell blames Fina for making Olympics \u2018a glorified reality TV show\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/yuilia-efimova-olympics-critics-cold-war-swimming-lilly-king-rio\">Efimova argued last week</a> she should not be discriminated against having served her time. Earlier this year she was also given a provisional ban after testing positive for meldonium but the suspension was lifted following advice from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). The court of arbitration for sport has also ruled that athletes cannot be banned from Rio because they have been previously sanctioned. \u201cCas considered my appeal and I won,\u201d said Efimova. \u201cEveryone should have a second chance. When you drive and you are just issued a ticket, no one puts you in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Horton, however, remains unrepentant and has no regrets about highlighting the issue of doping, despite copping a torrent of abuse from Chinese social media users. \u201cI do not think I need to apologise \u2026 I just said what is true,\u201d the 20-year-old told Reuters on Sunday. \u201cI think people need to be more comfortable talking about doping in sport.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is what you put in your body is your responsibility. If you are taking stuff and you do not know what it is then really it is your fault.\u201d</p> <p>He did concede, though, that he was not planning a holiday in China any time soon. \u201cIt all get pretty out of control; I had 450,000 hate comments on one of my Instagram photos. Yeah, I\u2019m probably not in a hurry to go to China.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>You know what happens when women live together. They start to menstruate together. Suddenly everyone craves chocolate and runs out of tampons at the same time. Not only that, but the chosen cycle often seems to belong to the most assertive woman. Well that\u2019s biology for you \u2013 it must be pheromones or the lunar cycle or something. Evolutionary anthropologists have suggested that synchrony would prevent any one woman being monopolised by a single dominant male.</p> <p>Ever since Martha McClintock, a psychologist from Harvard University, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v229/n5282/abs/229244a0.html\">published her 1971 study of 135 female undergraduates living in a college dormitory together</a>, it has been an accepted truth that menstrual cycles synchronise when women live together. Her study, based on an analysis of about eight cycles per woman, found that roommates and close friends saw the average number of days between the starts of their periods fall from eight or nine to five days.</p> <p>A control group of randomly chosen women had cycles that remained 10 days apart from each. <a href=\"https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/access/content/group/05df5a0c-16e3-4d15-8626-76c7c012163b/Readings/Yang-Schank2006.pdf\">A study in 1999 found that 80% of women believed in the synchronising phenomenon</a> with 70% saying that it was a pleasant experience. It\u2019s a powerful concept after all \u2013 that the empathy of women can make their periods fall in line. But is it really true?</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>Well if you are one of the 80% of women who believes in synchronicity \u2013 brace yourself. It isn\u2019t a thing. Since McClintock\u2019s study there has been enough research with negative results to move menstrual synchronicity into urban mythology. Many studies have tried to replicate McClintock\u2019s findings \u2013 some have succeeded, but more have not.</p> <p><a href=\"http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/3/579.long\">Criticisms of McClintock\u2019s work include statistical errors</a> \u2013 not controlling for chance in the results and inflating the initial differences in the onset of menstrual cycles that led to synchronicity being over stated.</p> <p>A study of Dogon women in west Africa, who were segregated into menstrual huts, found no synchronicity over 763 days and no effect of the moon on periods (and these were ideal test conditions, as there was no electricity).</p> <p><a href=\"https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/access/content/group/05df5a0c-16e3-4d15-8626-76c7c012163b/Readings/Yang-Schank2006.pdf\">A study of 186 women in China</a> who lived together for a year also found no synchronicity. But the researchers pointed out that the start of periods varied for women, and cycles were often variable, which could give the false impression of synchronicity. Menstrual cycles can vary from between 21 to 35 days. Stress, weight loss or illness will all disrupt periods. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8416051\">A study of 26 lesbian couples</a> found no synchronicity but did find individual menstrual cycles varied by up to 10 days. So <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/stevenlim/do-womens-periods-really-synchronize?utm_term=.wrL9y6lQ5#.fnbM9jZY4\">despite the internet refusing to let this myth die</a> \u2013 you are the owner of your menstrual cycle and no friend, however close, can control it.</p>",

  "<p>Did you ever doubt it? He didn\u2019t.

The big worry, Bolt explained, was not that this plan might make him vulnerable to his fellow competitors, but rather that it might upset his public. \u201cShould I run the 100m just to win and save my energy for the 200m?\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I shut it down in the 100, will people be happy?

But it was as close to capacity as it is going to get. By six o\u2019clock, when the hills surrounding Engenho de Dentro were backlit brilliant red by the sunset, the queue already wound round two sides of the stadium. More fans were pouring off every train and bus out from downtown. Once they were in, they roared their appreciation for each little thing he did, giving ovations to every wink and wag of his finger.</p> <p>Before the final Bolt even spent a little time playing them, pointing to different stands to make them cheer for him in turn, like a conductor with an orchestra. The bass note was provided by the boos for Justin Gatlin, who was again cast as the pantomime villain and heckled each time he came out on to the track. Gatlin was banned in 2001 for taking amphetamines, which he said were for his attention deficit disorder, and then again in 2006 after a vengeful masseur \u2013 so the story goes \u2013 rubbed testosterone cream into his buttocks without telling him about it. These days he seems almost like a professional stooge. It is a job that leaves him two things to do: get booed and lose. He accomplished both.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-wins-olympic-gold-again-andy-murray-del-potro-rio-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qq8m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2656714\"            data-video-name=\"Usain Bolt wins Olympic gold again, Andy Murray retains title \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b15687e4b0178756b5cc55\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/15/160815olympics_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/15/160815olympics.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11790094&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-wins-olympic-gold-again-andy-murray-del-potro-rio-video-highlights\">Usain Bolt wins Olympic gold again, Andy Murray retains title</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Bolt said that he had Gatlin\u2019s measure by the time he was 50m into the race. Truth was, you could see it coming sooner than that, after Bolt coasted through the semi-finals in 9.86sec, his fastest time of the year before the final. In the semis, Bolt found the going so easy that as soon as he\u2019d flicked his head to the right and left to check he had nothing to fret about, he broke into a grin and slowed right down again. Gatlin tried a similar trick, but he did not look nearly so easy doing it, and, in 9.94, was a lot slower too. In the final, Gatlin flew from the blocks and into the lead. But Bolt reeled him back in easily enough, and had time and space enough to beat his chest as he crossed the line.</p> <p>Bolt believes he would have run quicker if he\u2019d been given more time to recover from the semi-final. They only had an hour between races. Two is typical. \u201cIt did affect me a little bit, my legs felt dead at the start but I knew I would be OK when I started running,\u201d he said. \u201cAn hour and 20 minutes, that\u2019s the time I need, especially me because I\u2019m a little bit older.\u201d Whether it was age, or weariness, or all part of that grand plan to break his own world record in the 200m next week, it was the first time since his breakthrough in 2007 that Bolt\u2019s run in a major final felt anything less than breathtakingly brilliant. He ran 9.79 to beat Gatlin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/23/usain-bolt-beats-justin-gatlin-100m-world-athletics-championship\">at the world championships</a> in Beijing last year. But the race was closer than this one and, because of his own injuries and Gatlin\u2019s fine form, the circumstances more trying. Maybe it\u2019s just that he spoiled us by winning in such style in 2008 and 2012.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-fans-jamaica-celebrate-olympic-gold-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qqdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2656843\"            data-video-name=\"Fans in Jamaica celebrate another Usain Bolt Olympic gold \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b16b37e4b0c23bfed8995d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/15/160815bolt_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/15/160815bolt.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/15/160815bolt_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-fans-jamaica-celebrate-olympic-gold-video\">Fans in Jamaica celebrate another Usain Bolt Olympic gold</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A world record did fall, but it was not Bolt who broke it. In a truly strange piece of scheduling, the organisers had jammed the men\u2019s 400m final right up against the men\u2019s 100m final. Which meant that he and his fellow competitors walked out in front of a crowd still reeling from seeing Wayde van Niekerk, a 24-year-old from South Africa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/wayde-van-niekerk-olympic-gold-400m-world-record\">knock 15 hundredths of a second off Michael Johnson\u2019s 1999 world record</a>. When Bolt made his name at those Beijing Games he did it, in part, by beating another of Johnson\u2019s marks, his Atlanta 1996 200m record. Eight years on from Beijing it felt like Van Niekerk\u2019s timing was just right, that he was taking centre stage just as Bolt was getting ready to step off it. Perhaps the organisers knew what they were doing after all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-criticises-rio-organisers-for-short-turnaround-as-he-plots-treble\">Usain Bolt criticises Rio organisers for short turnaround as he plots treble</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bolt knows Van Niekerk well and broke off from one of his interviews to hug him as he passed. The two of them trained together in Jamaica earlier in the summer, after Bolt\u2019s coach Glen Mills invited the South African into his camp. He said Mills had seen this 400m performance coming. Few other people did, because even though the South African won the world championships in 43.48 last year, he ran this race from lane eight. \u201cI told him my coach had said that he was the only guy right now, other than me, who could break the 400m record,\u201d Bolt said, \u201cbecause he has got speed and he has got strength.\u201d Intriguingly, Bolt said that he would \u201clove to race\u201d Van Niekerk over 300m, and that maybe they could make it happen next year.</p> <p>Bolt had been around the back on the warm-up track when Van Niekerk was running. \u201cWhen I saw he got the world record,\u201d Bolt said, \u201cI was like \u2018wow\u2019.\u201d For once he knew how it feels for the rest of us.</p>",

  "<p>Failure is a big part of everyone\u2019s life. The problem many of us face, however, is that we automatically equate experiencing failure with being a failure. We view it as something to be ashamed of, or embarrassed about, something to be avoided or concealed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Failure should be expected on the way to achieving life goals</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact, failure gives us an opportunity to learn, adapt and grow. It should be expected on the way to achieving life goals, and used as a feedback mechanism to get it right next time, or the time after.<br></p> <p>I see many people in my clinical practice who, for various reasons, struggle to see failure in a developmental light, or as a necessary step on the road to achievement or recovery. If we then experience depression or anxiety, these feelings can alter our thoughts dramatically and we can need help reframing those thoughts. </p> <p>I recently saw a woman who had to give up studying for her university degree. She had bipolar disorder, and was not coping with the pressure of studying while on a zero hours\u2019 contract, which was fuelling her financial insecurity. She was studying to be a teacher and had hoped the work she was doing, helping in a school, would lead to future employment opportunities. She failed her exams, she failed to get shortlisted for any interviews for more permanent work, and overall felt like she was failing to achieve anything. </p> <p>When I saw her in the depths of depression, she couldn\u2019t see how she would ever get where she wanted to be, or be able to have a life doing what she wanted. With some treatment and support as well as a break from the huge pressures she was putting herself under, she started to feel better. </p> <p>One of the things she enjoyed doing was singing in a band. In order to earn a bit of money, she began giving singing lessons to the odd friend and acquaintance. Fast forward 18 months and she now has her own growing, financially viable business teaching singing full-time. She is finally doing what she loves. She hasn\u2019t achieved this goal in the way she imagined, and she wouldn\u2019t have embarked on this without the setbacks she encountered leading her down this path.</p> <p>What was it about this woman that made her succeed? Yes, failure had a big part to play, but the ability to bounce back, and be resilient, was an important factor. </p> <p>An important part of developing resilience is having a supportive network. Having relationships with people who are able to provide support helps us to keep going through tough times. </p> <p>Our attitudes towards ourselves are also crucially important \u2013 including a sense that we are in control of our actions, have confidence in what we do, realise our strengths and set ourselves achievable and realistic goals. This is all integral to resilience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/02/cv-of-failures-rejections-success-not-guaranteed\">A CV of failure shows not every venture has a happy ending \u2013 and that\u2019s OK | Julian Baggini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The good news is that these are not innate abilities but things that can be learned and developed. Reflecting on events that have been difficult, stressful or negative and how we have dealt with them can lead us to identify previously unrecognised strengths and build positive regard for ourselves, as well as a confidence that we have more \u201ctools in our toolbox\u201d to cope with than we had previously thought. We may not necessarily be able to change events that happen to us, or avoid future failures or crises, but we can take charge of the way we conceptualise and respond to them. </p> <p>It helps to remember that the thoughts and feelings that we experience are just those \u2013 we do not need to let them take charge. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/2015/apr/21/mindfulness-meditation-can-boost-your-career-and-help-you-get-a-job\">Mindfulness</a> meditation, which involves focusing concentration on a particular word or sound, can help us achieve a relaxed, non-judgmental awareness of our thoughts, feelings and sensations. </p> <p>Therapies like <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Cognitive-behavioural-therapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">cognitive behavioural therapy</a> (CBT) can also help us to build our resilience. This is a talking therapy that can help us to manage problems by changing the way we think and behave. It is widely used to treat all kinds of mental health problems from anxiety and depression to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and psychosis. It is based on the concept that our thoughts, feelings and actions are interconnected and that we can get trapped into vicious cycles of negative thinking. By breaking these down and challenging them, we can learn to change these cycles, which leads us to feel better. </p> <p>So building resilience is a skill we can all develop and we can begin with some simple strategies:</p> <ul> <li>Look after our physical health \u2013 eat well, sleep well, be active.</li> <li>Take mental breaks \u2013 whether through regular meditation or losing ourselves in doing something we enjoy that consumes our thoughts.</li> <li>Be connected to others \u2013 ensure we have a network of support and be kind to people (doing nice things for others can <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terri-cole/volunteering-health_b_2189477.html\">boost our serotonin levels</a>).</li> <li>Think about our emotional repertoire \u2013 examine the way we respond to events and practise looking for the silver linings in negative situations. This can be hard, but being aware of how we work emotionally and starting to think about ways to think differently about situations can lead to long-term benefits.</li> </ul> <p>The secret to resilience lies in accepting that there are things in life we cannot change. Rather than thinking of ourselves as victims, we need to realise we have control over ourselves and an ability to change the way we think, behave and, ultimately, feel. Life may throw manure at us, but we can grow roses with it.</p> <p><em>Dr Stroma Macfarlane is a consultant psychiatrist at the <a href=\"http://www.priorygroup.com/location-results/item/priory-wellbeing-centre-southampton\">Priory Wellbeing Centre Southampton</a></em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

The Athlete challenged the decision rendered by the IAAF Doping Review Board (IAAF DRB) on 12 August 2016, which revoked its previous decision declaring her exceptionally eligible to compete in international competitions, including the athletics competition at the Olympic Games 2016.</p> <p>Such decision, declaring her ineligible to compete, was based on new factual elements concerning the Athlete presented by Prof. Richard McLaren in addition to his report delivered on 18 July 2016.</p> <p>On that basis, the IAAF DRB determined that the Athlete was directly affected and tainted by State-organized doping scheme described in the McLaren Report. Furthermore, the IAAF DRB noted that the results management in respect of certain of the Athlete\u2019s samples has been subject to tampering and manipulation during the \u201crelevant period\u201d (i.e. starting on 1 January 2014).</p> <p>The CAS Panel in charge of this matter heard the parties and their representatives today between 11am and 3pm. At 1:00am today, the parties were informed that the application was upheld and that the Athlete remained eligible to compete in the Olympic Games in Rio.

The people in blue blazers are mithering about fiddling with the fixings, photographers are bustling about, the stage being set. The idea of a lightning quick track in Rio De Janeiro seems something of a stretch given the rest of these Games, which have involved for most on the periphery an endless stream of delays and interminable journeys. Who knows, perhaps Bolt will win in 24 seconds tonight having got lost three times long the way. Either way this really is the ultimate test of how well Brazil has managed to stage and sell and fluff the Olympics. Empty seats here and they might as well give the Games back.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b0e9bee4b0c23bfed89796\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T21:59:51.964Z\">10.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Coming soon \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tomdaviesE17/status/764944460509765632\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Has anyone written the obligatory &quot;these brave Olympians should make every single English professional footballer ashamed&quot; thing yet?</p>&mdash; Tom Davies (@tomdaviesE17) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomdaviesE17/status/764944460509765632\">August 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b0e90de4b062ce4d223594\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T21:58:14.106Z\">10.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lasse Hansen has set a new Olympic record of 4min 14.982 sec in the omnium individual pursuit to take control two events in.

Apparently there are one or two things happening in Rio today, as you\u2019ll have gleaned. Most notably, perhaps, Usain Bolt\u2019s bid for a triple-treble of Olympic golds, which starts in earnest with the men\u2019s 100m sprint semi-finals and \u2013 should he make it (it couldn\u2019t happen, could it?) \u2013 final. Still, as a grey dawn breaks over London, that seems a very long way off right now. And you know what? It is. It\u2019s just coming up to 4am in Rio, and Usain will no doubt be tucked up in bed dreaming of Justin Gatlin and rear-view mirrors. With the Games\u2019 blue riband event not taking place until late evening, it falls to the golfers to get us underway.

Ennis-Hill couldn\u2019t beat Thiam by the 9.47 second margin she needed at the end, missing out by a couple of seconds.</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/justin-rose-henrik-stenson-rio-2016-olympics-golf-third-round\">Great Britain also might be looking at a medal in the golf</a>, where <strong>Justin Rose</strong> has moved ahead of Australian <strong>Marcus Fraser</strong> and Swede <strong>Henrik Stenson</strong> for the overall lead with a single round left. The 36-year-old began the day four shots off Fraser\u2019s lead but stormed back to take a one stroke lead by the end of the day. <strong>Andy Murray </strong>will also be playing for gold in the men\u2019s tennis singles when he takes on Argentina\u2019s <strong>Jua</strong><strong>n Martin Del Potro</strong>. The swimming is now done and dusted, but with silver in the men\u2019s 4x100 medley relay, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/britishswimming/status/764649621377388544\">Team GB has had its best Olympics in the pool since 1908</a> with one gold and five silvers.</p> <p> The unhappiest medalist of the day was Team GB\u2019s reigning long jump champion <strong>Greg Rutherford</strong>, who scraped into the final with his last attempt of the heats and was then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/greg-rutherford-olympic-long-jump-rio-2016\">beaten into third place by American <strong>Jeff Henderson</strong> and South African <strong>Luvo Manyonga</strong> in a dramatic final.</a> But at least he put the disappointment in perspective: \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard bronze medal to take. If you\u2019d told me 10 years ago I would be gutted with an Olympic bronze, I\u2019d have told you not to be so stupid,\u201d Rutherford said afterwards.</p> <h2> Team USA roundup</h2> <p> What you are reading now is not template text, it\u2019s just that <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> keep winning gold medals. There\u2019s only so many ways you can say it, especially once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/michael-phelps-200m-individual-medley-gold-rio-2016-swimming\">our own Andy Bull had pointed out a few days back that Phelps has now even usurped the greatest ancient Olympians</a>. You might not have heard of Leonidas of Rhodes, who dominated the Games between 164 and 152 BC (I think NBC might be showing his events on a tape delay sometime in the next few days) but we assure you, Phelps is now better than him. His team-mates who took gold in the men\u2019s 4x100 medley relay don\u2019t go too badly either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/764655964628852737\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So many emotions! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rio2016?src=hash\">#Rio2016</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/N5NYojqWHk\">pic.twitter.com/N5NYojqWHk</a></p>&mdash; TODAY (@TODAYshow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/764655964628852737\">August 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p> Elsewhere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/jeff-henderson-usa-long-jump-gold\"><strong>Jeff Henderson</strong> jumped to gold in the that men\u2019s long jump</a> final, though his winning leap of 8.38 metres really does remind you of how insane Mike Powell\u2019s 1991 world record of 8.95 metres really is.

Yet for all of the excitement at the end of the race, the 31-year-old was more concerned by the whereabouts of her dog Ernie, who was waiting with Brennan\u2019s husband Scott. \u201cScott was very proud of me,\u201d Brennan said after collecting her medal, \u201cbut I wanted to see how Ernie was doing, but he wasn\u2019t too interested in watching my race.

Yet aside from the failure of <strong>Mack Horton</strong> to win a medal in the men\u2019s 1500m, the story of the night was<strong> Cate Campbell</strong>\u2019s atonement for individual event misfires with a mighty final leg of that medley relay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AUSOlympicTeam/status/764658262289575936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A wonderful silver for our women&#39;s 4x100m medley to cap off the Rio campaign.<a href=\"https://t.co/7QGBfMJumE\">https://t.co/7QGBfMJumE</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OneTeam?src=hash\">#OneTeam</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Qw7jgdnjRt\">pic.twitter.com/Qw7jgdnjRt</a></p>&mdash; AUS Olympic Team (@AUSOlympicTeam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AUSOlympicTeam/status/764658262289575936\">August 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p> \u201cThe world got to witness possibly the biggest choke in Olympic history a couple of nights ago, Campbell had said after she and sister Bronte again bombed out in the final of the women\u2019s 50m freestyle.

Fascinatingly, Campbell\u2019s time was 1.07 seconds faster than that she posted in the individual final of that event \u2013 and would have won her gold.

  "<p>Judges and lawyers overseeing domestic violence cases sometimes minimise perpetrator accountability and use victim-blaming terms, highlighting the need to educate court staff about the importance of language, the annual report of the NSW Domestic Violence Death Review Team states.</p> <p>The team was established in 2010 to review domestic-violence-related deaths and to make recommendations about how to prevent or reduce the likelihood of such deaths by improving the way they are examined in the judicial system. </p> <p>Their <a href=\"http://www.coroners.justice.nsw.gov.au/Documents/DVDRT_2015_Final_30102015.pdf\">report</a> found in some of the cases reviewed judicial staff \u201cused mutualising language such as \u2018volatile relationship\u2019 or \u2018stormy relationship\u2019 to describe cases where a domestic violence abuser had a long history of using violence against the victim\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/14/reports-of-sexual-assault-rise-to-highest-level-in-six-years-as-awareness-grows\">Reports of sexual assault rise to highest level in six years as awareness grows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cVariations of this terminology were evident in a number of cases, and served to minimise perpetrator accountability for violent behaviours,\u201d the report found.</p> <p>In one example, a stalker was described as simply \u201cmaking a nuisance of himself\u201d, while the actions of a man who set his girlfriend on fire was put down to his being in a state of \u201cjealous anger\u201d.</p> <p>In another case, a victim was described as having a \u201cyummy mummy complex\u201d because of the way she reacted to her abuser\u2019s psychological control. In another case, a judge suggested that an abuser would be less of a risk to future partners when he was older. </p> <p>\u201cThis reinforces stereotypes around domestic violence as an issue affecting younger women and men, and reinforces perceptions that domestic violence may be synonymous with physically abusive behaviours, as opposed to coercion and control,\u201d the report found.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the perspective of the team that in order to better appreciate the dynamics of domestic violence it is necessary to recognise the impact the abuser\u2019s behaviour had on the domestic violence victim. The team also believes it is important to recognise the loss and value of their life.\u201d</p> <p>The review team recommended victims\u2019 and families\u2019 impact statements be used to demonstrate to judges the effect a crime has had on a victim or a dead victim\u2019s family.

But we still see horrific victim blaming and lack of understanding around the dynamics of domestic violence and abusive relationships.</p> <p>\u201cThankfully now, discussions are occurring and action is being taken to force the judiciary to change.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>What can be done to redress the horrible mistreatment of people held in offshore detention? Can Peter Dutton or any of his servants or agents be dragged into court and punished? Can\u2019t international law come to the rescue of tortured asylum seekers and refugees? Are other civil or criminal remedies and responses available? </p> <p>Big questions with interesting possibilities but much as many would like to see a punitive response dished out to those who implement this abuse, the pathway is relatively untrod and uncertain. </p> <p>Australia is a party to the Rome statute that established the international criminal court, which can prosecute crimes against humanity \u2013 and that includes \u201cinhumane acts ... intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health\u201d. The first trials for crimes against humanity took place at Nuremberg after the second world war. </p> <p>Some years ago the federal MP <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/will-the-international-criminal-court-prosecute-australia-for-crimes-against-humanity-33363\">Andrew Wilkie wrote to the ICC prosecutor in The Hague</a> requesting an investigation and prosecution of the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, and 19 of his cabinet ministers in relation to the mistreatment of asylum seekers. </p> <p>Not much more was heard about this submission other than outrage from Andrew Nikolic, now an ex-MP, who said the accusations were \u201cvague and embarrassing\u201d, and the then immigration minister, Scott Morrision, who said he would keep on doing what he was doing and would not be intimidated. </p> <p>As a condition to becoming a party to Rome statute and agreeing to the jurisdiction of the ICC, Australia introduced to the <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cca1995115/sch1.html\">commonwealth criminal code</a> provisions relating to crimes against humanity, providing for a penalty of imprisonment of 25 years (see: 268.12 and 268.13). This adds a frisson of excitement to the prospect of getting some really nasty types charged up and in court. </p> <p>The provision in the code mirrors the relevant part of the <a href=\"http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm\">statute of Rome</a>, so our domestic law provides for such a crime with elements, such as: infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering which are not incidental to lawful sanctions; and the conduct is committed knowingly as part of a systemic attack on civilians. There are also provisions dealing with \u201cimprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty\u201d. </p> <p>Domestically, the commonwealth director of public prosecutions would be the prosecutor but only if the attorney general agreed and any offences would have to be prosecuted in the name of the AG. On the face of it there is plenty of evidence of conduct that fits the ingredients prescribed in the criminal code. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/nauru-inquiry-should-look-at-whether-abuse-reports-were-investigated-labor\">Nauru inquiry should look at whether abuse reports were investigated \u2013 Labor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But can you see the attorney general, George Brandis, going completely off-piste and prosecuting Peter Dutton, a man who displays such a lack of human empathy? </p> <p>Because the relevant bit of the Rome statute is part of Australian domestic law, the ICC itself has stronger and more plausible arguments should it be inspired to look into what\u2019s going on down here. </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine Malcolm Turnbull, Dutton and other ministers in the same Hague dock as Congolese warlords who conscript child soldiers. Yet, it is quite plausible that the ICC could mount a preliminary examination into Australia\u2019s shocking treatment of offshore detainees who sought our protection under the Refugee convention. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=160704-otp-stat\">ICC is undertaking the same process in relation to the Iraq war</a> and in doing so will consider the findings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/iraq-war-inquiry\">Chilcot report</a>. After a preliminary examination the next step would be an investigation and if all the dots lines up, a prosecution. <br>Even a preliminary examination by the ICC would be a major embarrassment for Australia which, so far, has been beyond embarrassment in the ruthless implementation of \u201cborder protection\u201d. It would flag internationally a pariah status for a country that wantonly abuses human rights, particularly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/there-are-policy-alternatives-to-locking-up-refugees-in-pacific-gulags\">there are policy options</a> far more humane than the one preferred by successive governments. </p> <p>Comparisons have been made with mistreatment of <a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/comparing-nauru-to-guantanamo-bay-is-ridiculous-says-australian-immigration-minister\">detainees at Abu Ghraib</a>, where <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2006/03/14/prosecutions_convictions/\">US military personnel have been tried and convicted</a> by courts martial. Dutton dismissed as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/comparing-nauru-to-guantanamo-bay-is-ridiculous-says-australian-immigration-minister\">\u201cridiculous\u201d</a> other comparisons with Nauru and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The barrister and refugee advocate Julian Burnside QC told Guardian Australia that Dutton is right, but not in the way he imagines.</p> <p>\u201cGuant\u00e1namo Bay holds people who are thought to be dangerous terrorists, whereas Nauru holds people who have been assessed as refugees, people fleeing terrorism, people who are not thought to be a risk to anyone at all.\u201d </p> <p>Dutton also said the mistreatment was out of Australian hands and was a problem for Nauru. He may not have caught up with the <a href=\"http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2016/hca-1-2016-02-03.pdf\">findings of the high court in February this year</a>, in the M68 case, where even though, by a majority, the judges found that detaining people on Nauru was not unlawful, nonetheless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/the-high-court-despite-the-law-at-its-disposal-has-let-them-get-away-with-it\">Australia\u2019s involvement in the regional \u201cprocessing\u201d centre was found to be \u201cindisputable\u201d</a>. You might think that would put an end to the fiction that it has nothing to do with us.</p> <p>There\u2019s another aspect to the high court\u2019s Nauru decision that puts the government on notice. The offshore regime is only lawful if it is \u201cproportionate\u201d to the requirement of processing refugees and not a system of permanent detention. The fact that there has been precious little resettlement puts the commonwealth on shaky ground. The longer refugees are held, the more unlawful the Nauru regional processing centre becomes.</p> <p>There have also been calls by the Australian Lawyers Alliance to have <a href=\"https://www.lawyersalliance.com.au/news/comcare-must-prosecute-for-nauru-abuses\">Comcare prosecute relevant offenders under the Work Health and Safety Act</a>. The alliance says the act applies to Australian activities on Nauru and makes liable people who are responsible in a workplace for the health and safety of others. An offence is committed where those with a duty to protect the health and safety of people in their care fail to do so, thereby exposing \u201can individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness\u201d. </p> <p>Liability also arises for breaches of a civil duty of care and a couple of high-profile class actions have been launched on behalf of detainees. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mauriceblackburn.com.au/current-class-actions/people-detained-on-christmas-island/\">Maurice Blackburn has a case under way</a> in relation to Christmas Island \u201cfor people who sought asylum and were injured or pregnant while in detention and suffered physical or psychological injury or the exacerbation of an injury due to the failure of the commonwealth to provide adequate medical care\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/05/want-to-know-about-immigration-detention-then-sue-for-negligence\">Slater &amp; Gordon is also running a class action in Victoria</a> on behalf of people detained on Manus Island. The defendants are the commonwealth, Transfield (now Broadspectrum and part of the Spanish Ferrovial group) and the former contractor G4S. The claim relates to the provision of substandard food, water, shelter and medical care. </p> <p>Civil actions are slow, arduous and expensive. The remedy is in damages which is not much of a sanction to large global corporations or the commonwealth. History shows that, if the evidence looks like it might be too embarrassing for the defendants, they settle and the unsightly conduct stays buried. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/australia-fails-the-same-lesson-every-time-the-nauru-files-show-how-secrecy-hides-abuse\">Australia fails the same lesson every time.

  "<p>Bill Leak\u2019s racist cartoon has added nothing constructive to the \u201ccrucial debate\u201d about the ongoing discrimination and disadvantage faced by First Nations people in Australia\u2019s criminal justice system. Its publication was instead merely a crude provocation devised to foreground the latest assault on the racial discrimination act.</p> <p>In the days following publication, Leak described his cartoon, which depicts an Aboriginal policeman returning an Aboriginal boy to his Aboriginal father, who \u2013 with beer can in hand \u2013 has forgotten his son\u2019s name, as \u201cclearly not\u201d racist. According to Leak, the cartoon instead <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2016/s4515481.htm\">serves the public interest</a> by way of provoking an \u201cimportant discussion\u201d about the real issues from which stemmed the reprehensible treatment of Indigenous children imprisoned in the Northern Territory\u2019s now infamous Don Dale juvenile detention facility.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/im-an-aboriginal-father-i-dont-want-my-kids-to-see-racist-garbage-in-the-media\">I'm an Aboriginal father. I don't want my kids to see racist garbage in the media | Luke Pearson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The assertion that Bill Leak and his editors make is already widely understood. There\u2019s nothing exceptionally astute or extraordinarily perceptive about it. By now the Australian public is broadly aware that Aboriginal communities are severely impacted by issues that contribute to high incarceration rates, and more specifically the high incarceration rates of Indigenous children, particularly in the Northern Territory. </p> <p>The problem with Leak\u2019s cartoon is that it stalls, either wittingly or otherwise, well before the important conversation begins. It fails to broach in any meaningful or even clever way, the systematic, root causes of the <a href=\"http://www.aic.gov.au/crime_types/in_focus/indigenousjustice.html\">over-representation of First Nations</a> people in the criminal justice system. With Leak and his supporters, as is the case with successive federal and state governments, it is as though the 339 recommendations of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody simply do not exist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bill Leak's cartoon\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Bill Leak&amp;#39;s cartoon is certainly a talking point today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/s46MirH9oC&quot;&gt;https://t.co/s46MirH9oC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ui07M7EwSO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ui07M7EwSO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Australian Opinion (@AusOpinion) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AusOpinion/status/761006684626038784&quot;&gt;August 4, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Instead of alluding to inherently discriminatory policies such as paperless arrests or \u201cone size fits all\u201d mandatory sentencing laws which disproportionately affect Indigenous communities, Leak\u2019s cartoon simply and inappropriately places \u201cgratuitous emphasis on race\u201d in his representation of the complex issues at hand. In contrast, the #IndigenousDads social media response to the cartoon was imbued not only with compassion, but deeper, constructive consideration of such issues.</p> <p>Far from <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/chris-kenny/outrage-over-bill-leak-cartoon-misses-the-point/news-story/db1a205b2d78ff61a309ced66df226ae\">being a diversion</a> from the \u201ccrucial debate\u201d, as suggested by the Australian\u2019s Chris Kenny, the #IndigenousDads response correctly realigned the conversation. In the first instance, Aboriginal dads simply don\u2019t deserve the kind of <a href=\"http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/images/history/toons/toon68.html\">historical stereotyping</a> that Leak reproduced. By virtue of that clarification, the spotlight was rightfully shifted onto discriminatory policies and laws that continue to disadvantage vulnerable communities and individuals.</p> <p>Instead of derision, these sudden social movements \u2013 regardless of where or how they originate \u2013 should be celebrated as genuine acts of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-indigenous citizens. Not only did #IndigenousDads mitigate the offence caused by Leak\u2019s racist cartoon, the action demonstrated a willingness to constructively engage in the conversation Kenny refers to. </p> <p>As the Australian\u2019s editor-in-chief Paul Whittaker wrote in his statement following publication of Leak\u2019s cartoon: \u201cToo often, too many people skirt around the root causes and tough issues.\u201d Ironically, that\u2019s exactly what Leak\u2019s racist cartoon perpetuates, and it should be censured for doing so.</p> <p>The Australian Press Council has <a href=\"http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/adj-1634/\">an obvious precedent</a> in its adjudication of the Glen Le Lievre\u2019s cartoon published in the Sydney Morning Herald in July 2014. Le Lievre\u2019s cartoon depicted \u201can elderly man with a large nose, wearing \u2026 a yarmulke sitting in an armchair emblazoned with the Star of David \u2026 pointing a TV remote control device at an exploding cityscape, implied to be Gaza\u201d.</p> <p>In that case, after questioning by the council, the SMH agreed that the cartoon placed \u201cgratuitous emphasis\u201d on \u201creligious persuasion rather than Israeli nationality, thereby causing offence\u201d. </p> <p>The Leak cartoon does something similar, basing its unnecessary and gratuitous provocation on race alone. <br></p>",

So he might as well go hell for leather on the first point. He wheels into that forehand and grinds Murray down to lead 15-0. Murray wins the next point, doing just about enough with an overhead, but then he swipes a forehand return wide for 30-15. But then it\u2019s Del Potro\u2019s turn to fail with a forehand, the game going to 30-all. Murray looks like he\u2019s about to win the next point when Del Potro drops a ball short. Yet he seems put off when some clown shouts out from the crowd and he totally messes up his drop shot. He stares at the crowd. If looks could kill. It\u2019s 40-30. But not for long. Del Potro is dragged to deuce when he misses a backhand. The volume\u2019s increasing and, just to add to the drama, an Argentinian fan is being ejected. Appropriately enough, he\u2019s wearing a jester hat. Eventually he\u2019s sent on his way, boos ringing around the arena as he leaves, and play can continue. When it does, Del Potro wallops a forehand wide. It would have been a winner. But wide it went and Murray has his first gold medal point! Can he take it? No! He nets a tight forehand return for deuce! But he has another chance when Del Potro, unnerved by a fine return, nets a backhand slice. Is this the moment? It is! Del Potro puts everything into a series of huge forehands. But he\u2019s looking so tired. And this time he\u2019s not kidding around. He\u2019s dropping them short and Murray\u2019s in the rally. He seizes control with a forehand into the left corner and Del Potro, on his last legs, can only slice into the net! That\u2019s it! It\u2019s all over! Andy Murray is the Olympic champion again! He\u2019s in tears! Of course he is. He loves a good cry. And why not? No one\u2019s ever won back to back Olympic titles in the tennis before!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31ee9860a8d6def0232550715e7b8933b3124b34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31ee9860a8d6def0232550715e7b8933b3124b34/0_0_2080_1267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray reacts after winning gold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"609\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Murray reacts after winning gold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T00:20:01.908Z\">at 1.20am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b102f9e4b0c23bfed897f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T23:55:29.466Z\">12.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray* 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 6-5 Del Potro (*denotes server):</strong> Simple analysis about what Murray needs to do here: STOP DOING DOUBLE FAULTS. He heeds my advice. Yet it doesn\u2019t matter when Del Potro pops a forehand down the line to lead 0-15. It\u2019s happening again, isn\u2019t it. Yep. It\u2019s 0-30 when Del Potro swings at a forehand off a second serve, forcing Murray to miss a backhand. Murray looks exasperated. Then it\u2019s Del Potro\u2019s turn to hold his head in his hands. A forehand\u2019s called long. The umpire overrules it. Murray challenges. It was in! They\u2019ll have to replay the point and Murray, who\u2019s out of challenges, has a first serve. He wins the point at the net to make it 15-30. But he\u2019s not out of the woods yet, far from it, especially when Del Potro sees a fine Murray approach and punches a wondrous backhand down the line out of nowhere to bring up two break points. I doubt Murray wants to see his serving stats from this set. They must make for grim reading. Yet just when you think it\u2019s done, you forget that this is Andy Murray\u2019s world and nothing ever makes sense. Del Potro squanders the first break point with a netted backhand. Murray saves the second with an ace. But of course. Barely able to make a serve throughout the set, then he does that. Another ace brings up game point and Murray holds when Del Potro nets a backhand. He\u2019s a game away from the gold medal. Mind you, I quite want to see how ridiculous a tie-break between these two would be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BTBReviews/status/764972901523156992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobSteinberg\">@JacobSteinberg</a> Tennis?

But it\u2019s superb defence from Murray, who wins the point when Del Potro gets jittery with a forehand for 0-15. Murray\u2019s got another 0-30 lead when Del Potro nets a backhand slice. He looks tired. Then again, he always looks tired. He could sleep for a year and emerge looking tired. Part of the charm. He looks even more knackered after winning the next point with an overhead for 15-30. Yet Murray earns two break points, hurting Del Potro with a splendid backhand down the line. Del Potro\u2019s response? He saves the first with a preposterous forehand drop shot. Even Murray\u2019s not making that one. He can live with that. He can\u2019t abide what he does with the second break point, though, needlessly netting a backhand. He\u2019s happier after the next point, a stunning, seesawing rally that ends with Del Potro blocking a forehand wide after Murray goes for a backhand down the line. Here comes a third break point. Here comes a huge serve. Here\u2019s deuce. But Murray carves out a fourth opportunity. He drop shots and although Del Potro gets there, he rams a forehand past him. And the pressure tells. Murray\u2019s pumping his fist after Del Potro nets a backhand!

Del Potro edges ahead again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c89a7ac723188639b663a131f637b5acb21768cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c89a7ac723188639b663a131f637b5acb21768cd/0_0_3500_2262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray loses momentum in the fourth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Murray loses momentum in the fourth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T23:14:38.272Z\">at 12.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b0f7a8e4b0178756b5cb07\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T23:05:40.586Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 1-1 Del Potro* (*denotes server): </strong>Gifted that break by Murray, Del Potro begins this game with an ace down the middle. Murray\u2019s promptly given a warning for an audible obscenity. It\u2019s no surprise he\u2019s infuriated after that stinker of a service game. That spot of swearing seems to rouse him, though. Del Potro sticks a volley into the net to make it 15-all and Murray makes it 15-30 with a well judged backhand that draws an error from his opponent. A good, deep second serve from Del Potro gets him back to 30-all but Murray has a break point after returning well with a forehand. He chucks it away, though, putting too much into an attempted forehand winner, the ball dropping just wide. Then comes a discussion between Del Potro and the umpire. It\u2019s not clear what\u2019s going on but they\u2019re friends in the end. On they go. And Murray earns a second break point, a backhand down the line too much for Del Potro, who can\u2019t do anything with a volley. What now? Murray genius, that\u2019s what. An absurd, teasing backhand drop shot, beautifully weighted, taunting Del Potro, slapping him in the face. What a shot. Murray breaks back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stu_fraser/status/764958521301557252\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Andy Murray a set away from the gold medal.

There\u2019s a chance he\u2019s going to aim his next forehand at the chair. He thinks better of it, though, and this time manages to outlast Murray, who nets a forehand for 15-all. Soon it\u2019s 30-15, Del Potro finding enough power and width to force Murray to hoick one long. He\u2019s two points from levelling this now. Make that one point. Murray charges the net but Del Potro picks him off with a backhand down the line to earn two set points. He can\u2019t take the first, though, peeling back and netting a forehand to make it 40-30. Murray\u2019s still alive here, just about. And he\u2019s properly in this game when he gives Del Potro some of his own medicine, upping the pace of his forehands, making it deuce when the Argentinian sends a rather desperate forehand long. Work to do here for Del Potro ... who promptly bangs an ace down the middle to earn a fourth break point. Or has he? Murray challenges ... and it was out by 0.0000001mm. Del Potro maintains his composure, however, and he does earn that fourth set point in the end, rasping a forehand out of reach. This is a truly special match. And we\u2019re going to have at least two more sets: Del Potro\u2019s had enough of Murray\u2019s demented resistance, tearing a forehand down the line to take the second set!

Frustration for Murray, joy for Del Potro.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a6e4f4f7a5fddcba23a9ab82ff9f59e4f5ca05b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a6e4f4f7a5fddcba23a9ab82ff9f59e4f5ca05b/0_0_5309_3539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene at the Olympic tennis centre as Andy Murray takes on Juan Martin del Potro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scene at the Olympic tennis centre as Andy Murray takes on Juan Martin del Potro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felipe Dana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T21:56:30.494Z\">at 10.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b0e05fe4b062ce4d223571\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T21:27:51.518Z\">10.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Second set: Murray* 7-5, 0-1 Del Potro (*denotes server):</strong> That is so tough for Del Potro to take. Given his exertions against Nadal yesterday, the nightmare scenario for him was to lose a long first set tonight, especially after hinting that he was going to snatch it. But that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. A couple of questions come to mind now. One, how much has that taken out of Del Potro? Two, will Murray put his foot on the accelerator now? Let\u2019s see. At 30-all, Murray lazily swipes a forehand down the line wide to give up a break point. He saves it with a piercing forehand for deuce. But Del Potro earns another chance, carving out a second break point by forcing the error from Murray with a big forehand. Yet Murray shows amazing chutzpah by constantly going to the Del Potro forehand throughout the next rally, before winning the point with a drop shot. Del Potro applauds. Then he sets about earning a third break point, challenging correctly when a Murray backhand slice drifts long. Third time lucky? You bet! Murray targets the Del Potro backhand and races to the net, not counting on the big Argentinian walloping a stonking pass down the line! A poor start to the second set from Murray and not for the first time this week.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b0de83e4b0178756b5caa4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T21:18:48.397Z\">10.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Andy Murray wins the first set 7-5!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So Juan Martin del Potro is serving to stay in the first set again. He\u2019ll fancy his chances in the tie-break if he can hold here. But Murray looks determined to make life difficult for him, pumping his fist when Del Potro nets a forehand at 15-0. Soon it\u2019s 15-30, Del Potro failing to do enough with a volley, leaving it in the air long enough for Murray to whip a forehand pass beyond him. Suddenly the mood\u2019s changed. Murray returns expertly and he\u2019s got two set points when Del Potro totally mishits his forehand riposte. This is gutsy stuff from Del Potro, though, a heavy second serve that is too much for Murray, who nets a forehand. That\u2019s one set point gone. Can Murray take the second? They trade boulders from the back of the court. Del Potro looks flustered, as though he\u2019s running out of ideas. Murray\u2019s defending superbly. Del Potro changes his approach and decides to come forward. Mistake. The ball\u2019s on Murray\u2019s backhand and he doesn\u2019t miss these, sending a searing pass down the line to claim an epic first set! Murray roars! He\u2019s two sets away from retaining his Olympic title. </p> <p>\u201cAndy keeping his emotions in check here, in a Masters event at this stage Andy would be in the middle of what I call the MMMM(Murray\u2019sMidMatchMeltdown) when he starts screaming like a demented highland banshee after losing a few games on the trot,\u201d says John McEnerney.

A slider of an ace out wide makes it 30-15 and it\u2019s 40-15 when Del Potro misses a forehand by a whisker. But Murray\u2019s work isn\u2019t done yet. He nets a backhand to make it 40-30 and Del Potro senses an opportunity, romping forward to put a volley away for deuce. The Argentinian is looking dejected after missing a backhand slice, though. He can hardly believe he\u2019s sent that one long. He\u2019s let Murray off the hook there and the Scot holds when Del Potro balloons a forehand. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/McWrites/status/764931019988426760\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobSteinberg\">@JacobSteinberg</a> Has anyone called DelPo tennis&#39; fifth Beatle yet?

Someone\u2019s flicked the switch. He begins this game with a double-fault to fall to 0-15. The next point is a minor classic, both men giving it everything ... but it ends with a stunning winner from Del Potro, a crashing forehand down the line for 0-30. Murray\u2019s in big trouble. His first serve has disappeared. He\u2019s slightly lucky to win the next point. Del Potro challenges a Murray forehand, thinking it\u2019s wide, but the umpire fails to spot the raised arm from the Argentinian. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s possible, he\u2019s only 6ft 6in. Told that he didn\u2019t challenge quickly enough, Del Potro has to suck it up and 15-30 becomes 30-all when Murray puts a smash away. That non-challenge had the feel of a Big Moment. Murray can\u2019t kill the game off at 40-30, an errant forehand taking it to deuce, but he holds after belatedly recovering his serve. Del Potro will serve to stay in the first set. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b0d8b0e4b0c23bfed89758\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T20:51:09.519Z\">9.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: Murray 4-4 Del Potro* (*denotes server): </strong>Del Potro dominates the first point with that forehand. <em>That</em> forehand.

Murray nets a backhand to concede a sloppy game and Del Potro is back in this!</p> <p>\u201cShhh, don\u2019t tell anyone, but I am 100% with McMahon,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cMurray doesn\u2019t really have much to prove, but back-to-back Olympic titles really would be something special. It\u2019s hard to believe that, outside people who follow tennis, he <em>still</em> appears to be underrated. My mum, for one, is still convinced he\u2019s just another plucky loser who gets lucky from time to time. He\u2019ll no doubt go down in history as a great player. And another gold for britain\u2019s ever-increasing tally would be welcome. And yet, Del Potro has quietly become one of the most popular athletes at the games, and for good reason. This is just about as much of a \u2018win/win\u2019 situation as I can imagine.

Yet Murray earns a break point, the first of the match, bludgeoning a backhand from left to right and charging forward to put an overhead away. Del Potro saves it with a monstrous forehand for deuce, though. Deuce. That\u2019s the cue for the floodlights to come on. This game is taking a while, Del Potro unable to finish it off, missing a couple of forehand, and he\u2019s facing another break point after netting a low backhand slice. Again, however, Del Potro saves it, crunching a forehand down the line to force the error from Murray. Anything short is going to be gobbled up by the big Argentinian, but he\u2019s facing a third break point after plonking a forehand wide. And there\u2019s no escape this time. Murray is positive and attacking here, in charge thanks to a backhand from left to right, and he breaks thanks to a punchy volley. </p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Evening Jacob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cContrasting semi final wins should give Murray the edge tonight over five sets, though of course you write Del Potro off at your peril, and it would take a heart of stone not to develop a warm glow if the Argentinian prevails.

But that\u2019s a reductive way of looking at things, isn\u2019t it. Because the world No141 these days is the mighty Juan Martin del Potro and isn\u2019t it agonising to think wistfully of all the classic matches and rivalries that could have been, but for the debilitating left wrist injury that threatened to end the big Argentinian\u2019s career. Surgery in 2014 didn\u2019t work, leaving him in pain, and there were times when Del Potro thought about giving up during the long, thankless slog back to fitness, a depressing thought for the numerous fans of a man whose thunderous forehand could topple the Great Wall of China. </p> <p>As he became in danger of becoming the forgotten man of the tennis world, it was worth keeping in mind that Del Potro became the first player to beat Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer when he won the US Open at the age of 20 in 2009, beating the latter thanks to a brutal show of force in a five-set final, and also how he pushed Novak Djokovic to the limit in their Wimbledon semi-final in 2013. Have no doubt, he had the game to take it to the toughest guys on the men\u2019s tour. He surely would have won more than one slam.<br></p> <p>But the good news is that after returning to the tour earlier this summer, it appears that Del Potro still has the weapons to trouble and beat the best. He beat Stan Wawrinka at Wimbledon, stunned Djokovic in the first round here and, after an Olympian effort against Nadal in last night\u2019s semi-final, he stands on the verge of winning gold for Argentina, four years after winning bronze in London. You did not need to be a mind reader to understand why Del Potro was so emotional after winning a third-set tie-break against Nadal and no one would begrudge him victory today. </p> <p>No one, that is, apart from Andy Murray, who is bidding to become the first person in in the 15 Olympic Games at which tennis has had full recognition to win back to back titles. The defending champion, who crushed Federer in the final four years ago, says that he is in the form of his life. It is a month since he claimed his second Wimbledon title, Djokovic and Federer are out of the picture for the time being and Murray is on a run of 17 consecutive wins, the longest of his career. After scares against Fabio Fognini and Steve Johnson earlier in the week, Murray was dominant in his semi against Kei Nishikori, winning in straight sets, and he might prove too strong for Del Potro in this one-off five-setter. One thought persists in all of this, though: what a shame it is that this is their first meeting since an Indian Wells quarter-final back in 2013. Del Potro won that day.</p> <p><strong>Play begins at:</strong> 3pm in Rio, 7pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T10:35:19.756Z\">at 11.35am BST</time></p>  </div>"
