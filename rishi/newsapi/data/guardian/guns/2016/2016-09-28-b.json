  "<p>Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, the Queens Park Rangers manager, has denied any wrongdoing after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-manager-role-fa\">named in the Daily Telegraph investigation</a> into corruption in football. The Telegraph alleged the Dutchman requested a fee of \u00a355,000 to work for a fake Far Eastern firm seeking to sell players to the club.</p> <p>In video footage collected by the newspaper, Hasselbaink is seen asking his suitors to \u201ccome up with a nice figure\u201d for a role, which the newspaper says he is told would involve a number of trips to meet with the firm in Singapore.</p> <p>Hasselbaink says: \u201cYou said the word business. That\u2019s all, it\u2019s business, so it depends what you put down, you know \u2026 At the end of the day, it has to be worthwhile to go all that way.\u201d</p> <p>The Championship club have not suspended Hasselbaink, saying they have confidence in him, but added that the 44-year-old will be investigated. In a statement, QPR said: \u201cThe club is aware of the allegations made against QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the Telegraph.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-manager-role-fa\">Sam Allardyce leaves 'dream' England manager job after one game in charge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFirst and foremost, the club takes very seriously any alleged breach of the rules. With this in mind, the club can confirm that there will be a thorough internal investigation regarding this matter. However, we have every confidence in our manager and the robust systems and processes the club has in place.\u201d</p> <p>Hasselbaink, who took over at QPR in December, issued a statement in which he denied any impropriety and said he saw nothing unusual in the prospective deal. Hasselbaink said: \u201cI have today, through my lawyers, responded in full to the accusations levelled against me by the Telegraph.</p> <p>\u201cI was approached by Mr McGarvey and Ms Newell of the Telegraph purporting to be players\u2019 agents. They offered me a fee to make a speech in Singapore. I do not see anything unusual in being offered to be paid to make a speech. I did not make any promises in return. I did not ask QPR to purchase any of the players who were said to be managed by Mr McGarvey and Ms Newell and did not and would not recommend the purchase of a player for my personal gain. I deny any accusations of wrongdoing on my part.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-history-suspicion-dream-job-ended-67-days\">Sam Allardyce: a history of suspicion and a dream job that ended after 67 days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a separate development, Barnsley have suspended their assistant head coach Tommy Wright following allegations that he took a \u00a35,000 bung to help place players at his club. The Daily Telegraph said that Wright accepted the money during a series of meetings during which he agreed to help sign players part-owned by the firm.</p> <p>The Championship club said in a statement: \u201cBarnsley FC is aware of allegations made by the Telegraph against Tommy Wright. The club has today suspended Tommy pending an internal investigation into these allegations.\u201d A spokesman for Wright is quoted as saying: \u201cAny suggested acts contrary to criminal law or those of the FA and Fifa are categorically denied.\u201d</p> <p>The Telegraph further alleges the Leeds owner, Massimo Cellino, explained ways to circumvent FA and Fifa rules on transfers. In video footage obtained by the Telegraph of a meeting between the 60-year-old and a fictitious investment firm, the Italian appears to suggest to the firm it could become a club shareholder in order to receive a portion of players\u2019 sell-on fees. FA and Fifa rules ban third-party ownership of players, and third parties receiving any percentage of a player\u2019s transfer fees. Cellino said in the video: \u201cI tell you, I spend eight million this year \u2026 on new players. You want to finance that? You want to come 20% in that? You got 20% of the player \u2013 it\u2019s the only way. As a shareholder you can finance the club, asking everything you want \u2013 percentage \u2013 you are allowed to do it in England.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement issued late on Wednesday night, Leeds described the allegations relating to Cellino as a \u201cnon-story\u201d. The statement read: \u201cThe club has reviewed the supposed \u2018evidence\u2019 that the Daily Telegraph have published tonight. At no time in this video clip has Mr Cellino suggested getting around the FA\u2019s rules on third-party ownership of players.</p> <p>\u201cIn complete contrast to what has been suggested, Mr Cellino has made a perfectly proper suggestion which is entirely consistent with the FA\u2019s regulations, as the only parties entitled to take benefit from ownership of a player is the club itself.</p> <p>\u201cIf a company commits money to a club by way of investment, taking on the potential for profit but also the risk for loss, then that is a normal, every-day corporate process. This is plainly not a suggestion as to how to circumvent the rules, but rather, an accurate albeit concise explanation of how to operate within the confines of the rules and effectively become \u2018the club\u2019. The club intends to make no further comment on this non-story.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A Google-funded lending startup will have to pay $6.3m in fines and refunds for a number of \u201cdeceptive\u201d practices, signaling the US government\u2019s interest in regulating the growing industry of online alternatives to traditional payday loans.</p> <p>LendUp \u2013 a San Francisco firm that claims to offer a \u201csecure, convenient way to get the money you need, fast\u201d \u2013 misled customers, hid its true credit costs, and reversed pricing without disclosing it to consumers, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).</p> <p>\u201cLendUp pitched itself as a consumer-friendly, tech-savvy alternative to traditional payday loans, but it did not pay enough attention to the consumer financial laws,\u201d bureau director Richard Cordray said in a <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/lendup-enforcement-action/\">statement</a> Tuesday, announcing the settlement.</p> <p>The company, which has funding from high-profile <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lendup-cfpb-20160926-snap-story.html\">Silicon Valley venture capital firms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lendup#/entity\">GV</a>, Google\u2019s venture capital branch, began marketing its services in 2012. </p> <p>The startup claimed it would help consumers \u201cmove up the LendUp Ladder\u201d by building credit and improving their scores. The firm promised customers the opportunity to eventually progress to loans with more favorable terms, such as longer repayment periods and lower rates.</p> <p>But regulators allege that the startup\u2019s offerings did not match its advertising and that the firm failed to properly provide information to credit reporting companies, which denied consumers the opportunity to enhance their credit.</p> <p>The federal agency has ordered LendUp to pay a $1.8m penalty and provide more than 50,000 consumers with roughly $1.8m in refunds.</p> <p>The California department of business oversight also <a href=\"http://www.dbo.ca.gov/Press/press_releases/2016/LendUp%20Settlement%20Release%2009-26-16.pdf\">investigated the firm</a> and announced a settlement this week requiring LendUp to pay $2.7m to \u201cresolve allegations it charged illegal fees and committed other widespread violations of payday and installment lending laws\u201d.</p> <p>The state agency said the startup had paid $1m in refunds but still owes $537,000 to borrowers.</p> <p>Experts say the case is significant for firms in the emerging online \u201cfintech\u201d sector that have claimed to offer better services than traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/03/poor-people-arent-making-ends-meet-inside-payday-lending\">payday loan industry</a> businesses, known for trapping low-income Americans in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/09/us-payday-loans-crisis-borrow-100-to-make-ends-meet-owe-36-times-that-sum\">cycles of debt</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element

href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/12/lendup-raises-14m-from-google-ventures-data-collective-to-disrupt-payday-lending/\">TechCrunch</a> said the startup would make the \u201cloan experience for the millions of unbanked Americans more fair and transparent\u201d. <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2012/11/16/can-a-payday-lending-start-up-use-facebook-to-create-a-modern-community-bank/\">Time Magazine</a> said it offered an \u201cinnovative new payday loan banking model that\u2019s more Silicon Valley than Wall Street\u201d.</p> <p>The violations raise questions about that kind of praise and suggest that regulators must do a better job scrutinizing online startups, said Liana Molina, director of community engagement for the California Reinvestment Coalition, a group that advocates for fair banking access for low-income communities.</p> <p>\u201cThe main takeaway here is that online payday loans ... are just as dangerous if not more so than those products available in the storefronts,\u201d she said, adding that restrictions across the board need to be strengthened to better shield vulnerable people from harmful loans.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more work to be done \u2026 [but] it sends a strong message to quote-unquote \u2018innovators\u2019 in this space that they need to adhere to existing protections.\u201d</p> <p>In June, the CFPB pushed forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/02/payday-loan-industry-cfpb-rules-borrower-debt\">new rules</a> aimed at regulating the $38.5bn payday loan industry, requiring lenders to verify the income of borrowers to ensure they can afford to repay the loans.</p> <p>As a result, digital lending services are rapidly expanding, said Paige Marta Skiba, Vanderbilt University economist and law professor. \u201cWe\u2019re about to see the kind of wild wild west of online lending.\u201d</p> <p>This week\u2019s enforcement actions could impede funding efforts for LendUp and its competitors, which could have hurt companies trying to offer fairer alternatives, Skiba added.</p> <p>\u201cPeople willing to invest in this kind of startup are going to be all the more scared \u2026 It\u2019s going to be difficult, if not impossible.\u201d</p> <p>LendUp downplayed the penalties in a statement, saying the penalties \u201caddress legacy issues that mostly date back to our early days as a company, when we were a seed-stage startup with limited resources and as few as five employees\u201d.</p> <p>The firm now has dedicated compliance and legal teams and has \u201cfully addressed the issues cited by our regulators, including discontinuing some services\u201d, the statement said. </p> <p>The LendUp penalties are also noteworthy given that Google, a key funder, announced this year that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/11/google-ban-payday-loan-ad\">no longer sell ads</a> for payday loan companies, saying they were \u201cdangerous products\u201d classified in the same category as guns and tobacco.</p> <p>At the time, LendUp <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-invests-in-payday-lender-but-could-have-to-ban-its-ads-1463650204\">criticized the ban</a>, saying it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/19/alphabet-venture-capital-google-investment-payday-lenders-lendup-dangerous-products\">too broad</a> and would negatively affect them.</p>",

  "<p>The Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has promised to learn the lessons of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-return-football-management-england-exit-fa\">Sam Allardyce\u2019s 67</a> days in charge of England and is likely to introduce \u201ca lot more scrutiny\u201d of commercial arrangements for staff. Clarke also revealed the FA is conducting a review of its disciplinary processes that include looking at the rules around agents and transfers.</p> <p>Clarke, who along with the chief executive Martin Glenn mutually agreed to part company with Allardyce over an embarrassing newspaper sting, said he felt sympathy after they parted ways following a \u201cgrown up\u201d discussion.</p> <p>\u201cI sat down with him yesterday and said: \u2018Sam this is so foolish\u2019. He said: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re right\u2019. He created a lose-lose scenario where he lost the job of a lifetime and we lost an England manager who may have been pretty successful \u2013 he was doing a good job,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/28/england-manager-sam-allardyce-greed-fa\">Big Sam\u2019s big fall the product of a polluted atmosphere of greed | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI did feel sorry for him. I don\u2019t get any pleasure from seeing a human being in pain. And Sam was hurting. He was the cause of his own demise but I don\u2019t get any pleasure from that.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke, only appointed to the FA role in August, indicated it would clamp down on the rules surrounding commercial arrangements for all staff. \u201cWe are going through a lessons learned process. The lessons learned will be very important. Things like: should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/28/england-manager-sam-allardyce-greed-fa\">any business development opportunity,</a> even if it is in the opinion of the person involved non-conflicting, then should it be registered and reported to the FA?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have a shirt or a watch or a shoe sponsor there is no conflict there but it is a commercial transaction leveraging off your role as a senior official at the FA. I think we\u2019ll move towards a lot more scrutiny of the commercial arrangements.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce, speaking for the first time since he lost his job over his comments to undercover reporters, said \u201centrapment had won\u201d but Clarke said he did not have a problem with the way the story came out.</p> <p>\u201cMy view of these things is that if you think there is actually something going on, go after it. If you hear something and you want to run it down, then run it down,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause transparency and a strong media is vital to our society.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was unable to comment on Allardyce\u2019s payoff, citing confidentiality clauses, but said the terms were reached following a \u201csensible discussion\u201d.</p> <p>Clarke reiterated the view of Glenn that it was important for FA staff, including the England manager, to be held to high standards. \u201cAppearances do matter. The image of the FA is important. If we have to dispense discipline and justice, we have to be credible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continually look at whether we\u2019re living up to our own standards. You can\u2019t tell people to do better if you have poor standards yourself. Organisational hypocrisy doesn\u2019t get you far.\u201d</p> <p>The disciplinary review, set in train by Glenn before Clarke\u2019s appointment, will involve discussions with the Premier League and the Football League as well as Fifa, Uefa, the government and the police over the best way to regulate issues surrounding transfers, money and agents. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about policing alleged transactions, it\u2019s about how we dispense justice around on and off the field disciplinary matters.\u201d</p> <p>He said the review would make proposals for various options that may lead to extra resources and extra powers. However, he said it had to be proportional. \u201cEveryone in football wants to deal with this issue but at the same time we don\u2019t want to be the Stasi.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f119b3dff9498c3cc6912aeef5870c8e14ed4f80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f119b3dff9498c3cc6912aeef5870c8e14ed4f80/627_89_1529_1911/800.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Clarke\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Clarke has promised to learn the lessons of Sam Allardyce\u2019s short reign as the England manager, including introducing greater scrutiny of commercial matters involving FA staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clarke conceded that the issues around transfers were increasingly global in nature but said it was important to focus initially on what it could do in the short term in the England game.</p> <p>\u201cAll the problems of pan-geography legislation are insurmountable in the short to medium term. It\u2019s all long term. Getting the EU to do something or getting Fifa to do something is a long process because you have different statutory controls in different countries,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re trying to see what we in England can do better on our own without having to put together a global agreement. With the support of the government, the professional game, the national game, the police, what can we do that could make things better. It needs thought and it needs to be very clear about the problems we\u2019re trying to solve and what processes and powers we need to solve them.\u201d</p> <p>Questions have been asked over whether the FA should have appointed Allardycegiven the outstanding questions from the Quest review in 2006, which failed to clear three transfers in which he was involved while at Bolton. Allardyce strenuously denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing I don\u2019t try to do is to second guess decisions made in good faith when I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf I had been part of the decision and understood the facts, I would take accountability. I have never run away from accountability. The guys did their best.\u201d</p> <p>In a joint statement with the Premier League and the EFL, the FA also responded to the allegations in the Telegraph that alleged eight current and former managers had been said to take bungs.</p> <p>\u201cAny substantive allegations will be investigated with the full force of the rules at our disposal, which are wide-ranging and well-developed. In addition, should we find any evidence of criminality we would inform and seek the support of the appropriate statutory authorities,\u201d it said.</p> <p>On the appointment of a new England manager, Clarke said he would not rule out waiting until the end of the season for the right candidate. The England Under-21 coach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/gareth-southgate-england-caretaker-manager-sam-allardyce\">Gareth Southgate, will take charge of the next four matches</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe will look at what have we learned from the Sam hiring process and how do we apply that to the next hiring process. The most important thing is we\u2019ve got Gareth focused on the next four games. That buys us time to really give some thought to how we do it this time round,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy view is that you need someone who really understands English football. That could be an English person or someone who has worked in England and managed at a senior level. But to parachute someone in who has never managed in this country would be a big ask.\u201d</p>",

I\u2019m really pleased we got our good luck back at the end. This kind of result can be very important for team spirit. It can be very important for our future.\u201d</p> <p>Neil needed several gulps of water before speaking. \u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated, disappointed, there\u2019s so many emotions.\u201d</p> <p>Who could have imagined that?

Suitably galvanised, Dorrans began reminding everyone that Shelvey was not the only player on the pitch capable of hitting devastating long passes and, almost imperceptibly, Newcastle were on the back foot. When they failed to clear Jacob Murphy\u2019s cross, Cameron Jerome was allowed to come inside, switch feet and direct a fabulous curling shot into the top corner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9af070e75842de6294ff1ca8f5318fdfc99a836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9af070e75842de6294ff1ca8f5318fdfc99a836/0_0_3232_1939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dwight Gayle fires home the winning goal for Newcastle United during stoppage time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dwight Gayle fires home the winning goal for Newcastle United during stoppage time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ben\u00edtez\u2019s discomfort grew as Murphy\u2019s long-range shot took a hefty deflection off Jamaal Lascelles and flew beyond a wrong-footed Darlow.</p> <p>Neil\u2019s turn to swear came as Gayle controlled Shelvey\u2019s through ball adroitly before his shot beat Michael McGovern.

DeepMind has regularly declined to comment on it, although it has formed <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/independent-reviewers/\">a second ethics board</a> focused purely on overseeing the company\u2019s research on healthcare AI.</p> <p>DeepMind\u2019s Suleyman said this latest group \u201cdoesn\u2019t replace\u201d the internal ethics board butit complements it. \u201cThat board is a Google Deep Mind effort that we\u2019ve been working very hard on, we\u2019ve been making a lot of progress toward.\u201d </p> <p>Suleyman also promised that the partnership would meet \u201cfrequently\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fe2b7197dfaadcd393f9f6c2676ed561b4474c7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe2b7197dfaadcd393f9f6c2676ed561b4474c7f/126_233_3942_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis at the AlphaGo challenge match between human champion Lee Sedol, and Deepmind\u2019s computer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis at the AlphaGo challenge match between human champion Lee Sedol, and Deepmind\u2019s computer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Jin-man/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Murray Shanahan is a professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/27/data-efficiency-deep-learning\">research into deep symbolic reinforcement learning</a> could solve AL\u2019s reliance on vast quantities of data. He welcomed the creation of the partnership. </p> <h2>Research will \u2018maximise societal benefits and tackle ethical concerns\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cA small number of large corporations are today the powerhouses behind the development of sophisticated artificial intelligence. The inauguration of the partnership on AI is a very welcome step towards ensuring this technology is used wisely,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ralf Herbrich, the director of machine learning science and core machine learning at Amazon, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a golden age of machine learning and AI. This partnership will ensure we\u2019re including the best and the brightest in this space in the conversation to improve customer trust and benefit society.\u201d</p> <p>In a joint statement from Suleyman and Google\u2019s Greg Corrado, the pair said they \u201cstrongly support an open, collaborative process for developing AI. </p> <p>\u201cThis group is a huge step forward, breaking down barriers for AI teams to share best practices, research ways to maximise societal benefits and tackle ethical concerns, and make it easier for those in other fields to engage with everyone\u2019s work. We\u2019re really proud of how this has come together, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with everyone inside and outside the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to make sure AI has the broad and transformative impact we all want to see.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s director of AI research, Yann LeCun, said: \u201cBy openly collaborating with our peers and sharing findings, we aim to push new boundaries every day, not only within Facebook, but across the entire research community.\u201d </p> <p>IBM\u2019s Francesca Rossi added: \u201cThis partnership will provide consumer and industrial users of cognitive systems a vital voice in the advancement of the defining technology of this century \u2013 one that will foster collaboration between people and machines to solve some of the world\u2019s most enduring problems \u2013 in a way that is both trustworthy and beneficial.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>It is probably a measure of Manchester City\u2019s increased expectations that this is the kind of result that now provokes feelings of disappointment for the new regime. It is the first time Pep Guardiola\u2019s team have failed to win under his control. They have missed the chance to equal an English record, set by Tottenham Hotspur in 1960, with 11 successive wins at the start of the season, and they should know enough about Guardiola by now to realise it will not satisfy him merely to have contributed to a night of exhilarating drama.</p> <p>City certainly showed powers of endurance given they were behind three times and, on each occasion, conjured up an equaliser within nine minutes. On that front, City demonstrated the kind of durability that will be useful in the months ahead. Yet there was also no doubt Celtic could be far more encouraged as the first team this season to cause City prolonged anxiety.</p> <p>Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 created all sorts of problems for the side with an immaculate record in England\u2019s top division. The former Fulham player scored twice, either side of an own-goal from the otherwise outstanding Raheem Sterling. Fernandinho, Sterling and Nolito provided the equalising goals and, though it was difficult for City, there was always the possibility their extra sheen of class might eventually come through.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers clearly has work to do defensively, with 10 goals conceded in Celtic\u2019s first two Champions League matches, but they survived a late flurry of pressure and can be greatly encouraged to have halted City\u2019s long sequence of wins. It was a remarkable ovation at the final whistle and a din that made your bones vibrate. \u201cA noise I\u2019ve never heard before,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The disappointment for Rodgers was that his team could not exert more control on the occasions they were ahead. Overall, though, this was the kind of retro performance the club craved. Celtic were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and maybe sensed, certainly at the start, that their opponents might not fully comprehend what it was like to play beneath the floodlights in Glasgow, with the volume turned up high.</p> <p>City looked disorientated at the back and the team in tangerine and purple \u2013 an away kit that should be packed away and never seen again \u2013 cannot expect to achieve their ambitions defending this generously. If they try it in their next two assignments, both against Barcelona, their position in Group C could be substantially weakened.</p> <p>Guardiola must have been startled by their vulnerability at times and it was not just Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s second goal, stemming from a miskick by Aleksander Kolarov, when hard evidence was supplied that a player whose reputation was built at left-back can be susceptible in the centre of defence.</p> <p>Celtic were determined not to let their opponents have time to settle. Every time the ball was at Claudio Bravo\u2019s feet, at least two players advanced. Rodgers called it educated pressure. It was a lung\u2011splitting effort and, after such a handsome run of victories, perhaps there was also a touch of complacency about the way City started.</p> <p>It certainly seemed that way during those fraught moments when the intensity of Celtic\u2019s play appeared to catch them by surprise. Celtic were ahead after barely 90 seconds from a neatly worked free-kick, culminating in Erik Sviatchenko\u2019s header flicking off Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, possibly offside, inside the six-yard box. It was the first time City had been behind this season.</p> <p>Fernandinho\u2019s equaliser came at a good time for City, intercepting Kolarov\u2019s wayward strike with a skilful piece of control before turning a left-footed shot past Craig Gordon, the Celtic goalkeeper. Yet there was never a prolonged period of the first half when City were obviously superior and after 20 minutes of near\u2011unremitting drama Celtic went ahead for a second time when Sterling tried to intercept Kieran Tierney\u2019s cross, diving in only to divert the ball into his own net.</p> <p>Sterling made amends eight minutes later with a stylish goal, running through the middle to control David Silva\u2019s pass and showing the composure to feint a left-footed shot before cutting back on to his right foot. There was a time when Sterling might have rushed his shot but the change of direction deceived Tierney and gave him a better angle to turn the ball past Gordon.</p> <p>The goal originated from Silva dispossessing Scott Brown in midfield and with both teams making life difficult for themselves it made for a thrilling spectacle.</p> <p>Celtic took the lead for a third time in their first attack of the second half. Kolarov made a hash of trying to clear a left-wing cross and it was a wonderful piece of improvisational skill from Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, flicking the ball off his knee, then hooking in an acrobatic volley. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, in the words of Rodgers, \u201cbullied their back four\u201d.</p> <p>Again, Celtic\u2019s jubilation was short-lived. Nine minutes later, Sterling and Silva exchanged passes just outside the penalty area. Silva nudged the ball into Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s path and when Gordon saved the striker\u2019s diagonal shot the rebound came back to Nolito to slot in the sixth goal of the evening.</p> <p>How cruel it would have been on Celtic if they had succumbed during that late spell of pressure. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan had City\u2019s best opportunity but Gordon saved his team and an epic contest reached its noisy climax.</p>",

With the best will in the world, they are unlikely to win the Premier League again. Not this season, not next season, perhaps not ever. Even if Ranieri and his players could keep up the dashing hit-and-run tactics of last season, even if they could somehow retain the element of surprise and stealth, the other teams in the race have all improved and strengthened.</p> <p>Many of them have new managers and massively increased budgets, Manchester City have not just won six league games in a row they have won all 10 of their fixtures under Pep Guardiola. Things have moved on. If Leicester\u2019s success last season was possible only because they were consistently brilliant while the other contenders were dozing or rebuilding, the last part of that equation has altered. City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham, to name four, do not look as if they intend to be caught napping again.</p> <p>Maybe the first part of the equation has changed too. If Leicester are not quite the same force it is perhaps because they know they will not be playing for the same prize. Ranieri will continue to talk a good game, his players will continue to run themselves into the ground on his behalf but lightning will not strike twice.</p> <p>Fairytales are ephemeral things, difficult to repeat on demand. Ranieri appears to understand this.

  "<p>The aftermath of the 2013 AFL grand final was something like a wake for travelling Fremantle supporters as they trudged away from the MCG and down Wurundjeri Way towards their hotels \u2013 but the enduring image most of them took home was a nightmare montage of all those first-half misses in front of goal. </p> <p>Put simply, it was not just Hawthorn\u2019s excellence that won the day but also the Dockers\u2019 inability to convert their chances.</p> <p>The Hawks were by then September veterans, not yet swept up in their own dynasty but a side that clearly knew how to navigate its way around the MCG when 100,000 fans were whooping and hollering and the tackles were coming from every angle. By half-time they were 5.5 (35) to Fremantle\u2019s 1.6 (10), with key Dockers having sprayed shots on goal in every direction except straight over the goal umpire\u2019s hat. </p> <p>That scoreline didn\u2019t even factor in other missed chances that sailed out on the full. The Dockers bounced back admirably in the second half but they\u2019d effectively kicked themselves out of it by the main break. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/28/like-a-cork-in-the-ocean-dennis-cometti-bobs-up-to-call-his-final-afl-game\">Like a cork in the ocean: Dennis Cometti bobs up to call his final AFL game | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For this season\u2019s old hands Sydney, it\u2019s the kind of recurring grand final phenomena that might provide encouragement as they face the Western Bulldogs in this weekend\u2019s decider. Excluding the Swans themselves, here\u2019s some half-time scores posted by losing grand finalists in the last 15 years: 3.8, 1.6, 4.6, 1.8, 7.7, 6.12, 4.3, 4.6, 2.7, 6.7 and 4.7. </p> <p>Only Collingwood \u2013 with 9.3 in the first half of their 2011 loss to Geelong \u2013 can claim to have bucked the trend towards the losing team faltering in front of goal when the heat has been on. The rest lost in large part because they failed to capitalise on early periods of momentum and apply scoreboard pressure. So often this is the case for sides unused to grand final pressure on the MCG.</p> <p>But why can Sydney take heart from this and not the Dogs? Let\u2019s grant the fact that regular season goal-kicking form is not an entirely reliable indicator of how things will pan out at the pointy end and look across both the home and away season and finals, starting with the Bulldogs.</p> <p>Luke Beveridge\u2019s side has put in the following first halves in September: 6.5 against GWS, 6.10 against Hawthorn and 7.6 against West Coast. Their yips in the Hawthorn game \u2013 on the MCG, where they\u2019ve rarely played in the last five years \u2013 was what got some of us wondering about the potential they might kick themselves out of premiership contention, should the opportunity arise.</p> <p>You could argue that this theory quite simply applies to any losing side, of course, but something might be drawn from accuracy rates in home and away games the Bulldogs lost: 4.5 against Hawthorn, 3.4 against North Melbourne, 6.6 against GWS, 1.9 against Geelong, and 4.9 against Fremantle. Two other losses featured better efforts (6.4 and 8.2). </p> <p>The Dogs\u2019 four-point win over their grand final adversaries in round 15 was of course full of positives, because it showed they could hang tough against top opposition. But it was instructive in another way, and perhaps showed us their small margin for error in beating the Swans on Saturday: the Dogs kicked 5.3 to Sydney\u2019s 6.7 in the first half and ended up winning 13.5 to 11.13. </p> <p>So Sydney had eight more scoring shots than the winners and kicked poorly. It\u2019s a small sample size but suggests that the Dogs will probably need to nail their first-half chances. Sydney, on the other hand, proved the cliche that bad kicking is bad football.</p> <p>In a goal-kicking sense, the Swans have generally stepped up when it\u2019s mattered this season, overcoming their shocker against GWS in the qualifying final to beat Adelaide (a game in which they kicked 7.3 in the first quarter and 10.5 by the main break) and Geelong (the Swans were 7.2 at the first break and 11.3 at the half). Both victories were as much about clinical finishing as anything else. The Geelong result was particularly startling; Sydney seemed to capitalise on nearly every chance they had.</p> <p>And what are grand finals about if not taking chance when they\u2019re up for grabs? Sydney has on its side plenty of calm-headed forwards and sharp-shooting midfielders. Lance Franklin has had one of his better seasons in this regard, kicking 80.53, while Tom Papley (29.14) , Luke Parker (24.18), Gary Rohan (24.16), Ben McGlynn (24.10) and resting ruckman Kurt Tippet (17.7) all get the job done when they find themselves inside 50.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/28/matter-of-stats-assessing-the-six-different-types-of-afl-grand-finals\">Matter of stats: assessing the six different 'types' of AFL grand finals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s obviously a bit to like for the Bulldogs, too. They\u2019re not grand finalists for nothing. Tory Dickson is superb in front of goal, having kicked 37.17 this year after his remarkable 50.12 season in 2015, though he was uncharacteristically wasteful in both of the Dogs\u2019 first two finals this season and will be one to watch with interest early in the grand final.</p> <p>Jake Stringer\u2019s (41.22) fortunes will be more reliant on <em>getting</em> the ball than what he does with it, while Marcus Bontempelli (26.17) takes plenty of his chances and Clay Smith (17.11) is proving a big-occasion player, but there would surely be concerns about third forward forward target Tom Boyd (10.10 this year when he\u2019s been comfortable enough to take a shot) and some of the other bit-part players who\u2019ll bob up in front of goal and have to take shots.</p> <p>In the 2013 decider, Dockers stars Nat Fyfe, Hayden Ballantyne, Stephen Hill, Michael Barlow and Ryan Crowley had at least eights shots between them, and none could manage a single goal as their team went down. Last year it was the normally-sharp Mark LeCras, Jamie Cripps and Jack Darling who missed the kinds of chances that put the Eagles out of contention. </p> <p>Could it be the Bulldogs are undone by a similar breakdown in one of football\u2019s fundamental skills when the stakes are highest? The Swans will certainly hope so and history tells us that it\u2019s generally the fate of one of the side\u2019s out there.</p> <p>All season Sydney have battled against a perception that they are \u201ctoo slow\u201d, but among many fascinating sub-plots in Saturday\u2019s game we might be shown yet again that ice-cold nerves are sometimes a better weapon on grand final day than a pair of spring heels.</p>",

As a result, the bank fired more than 5,300 employees. The bank denies that the creation of these accounts was part of an orchestrated effort. </p> <p>According to bank\u2019s critics, the bank\u2019s staff opened such unauthorized accounts in order to meet their sales quotas. The bank announced yesterday that it is terminating all of its sales quotas starting 1 October.</p> <p>In light of this scandal, Chiang\u2019s office has effective immediately suspended its investment in all Wells Fargo securities, use of Wells Fargo as a broker-dealer for investment purchases and use of Wells Fargo as managing underwriter on negotiated sales of California state bonds. </p> <p>These sanctions are in effect for 12 months during which Chiang asked that Wells Fargo quarterly report back its compliance with the terms of its $185m settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Los Angeles city attorney, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p> <p>Chiang has also called for separation of the chief executive and chair positions at Wells Fargo \u2013 both of which are currently held by John Stumpf, a review of Wells Fargo\u2019s compensation practices and clawbacks of pay for those executives who are linked to the predatory sales practices.</p> <p>\u201cWells Fargo has diligently and professionally worked with the state for the past 17 years to support the government and people of California.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s revival of the migrant impact fund to mitigate the effects of uncontrolled immigration is an insult to the very workers he claims to represent and whose support he seeks (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\" title=\"\">Corbyn rules out cutting immigration</a>, 28 September). Not everything can be solved by throwing money at it. It may come as a surprise to him that ordinary working people aspire to more than just a job, a home, the NHS and social services. They can think beyond the day-to-day struggle to survive. The Brexit vote proved that they are active participants in their own destiny, wishing to have control over their lives, their future and that of their communities, and the direction of their country.</p> <p>The \u201cfreedom\u201d of movement of labour is a misnomer. A more accurate description would be the \u201cenforced\u201d movement of labour. Does anyone think that when the young Polish lad who cleans windows in north London was asked by his teacher of his future ambition, he said cleaning windows in a foreign land some thousands of miles away from his home?</p> <p>The free movement of labour is double-edged: not only does it put pressure on wages, working conditions and social services of the countries receiving the immigrant labour, it also hollows out the countries the immigrant labour left, draining them of their major asset \u2013 the working population.<br><strong>Fawzi Ibrahim</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 At last, a politician with principles who sticks by them. And those Labour MPs who accept the nasty immigration attitudes which the rightwing press has been fomenting for a decade or more should look to their consciences \u2013 and the facts on immigration \u2013 before jumping on the immigration-bashing platform.</p> <p>Of course immigration on a large scale causes problems, but it is not the main cause of poverty in the UK or the anger of working people; that is down to a decade of wage stagnation and austerity, with no end in sight as Theresa May has already forgotten about the \u201cleft-behind\u201d. This is the biggest crisis facing Europe, with millions of refugees fleeing wars and devastation which we have helped create in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, so is Britain going to play a part in solving the problem, or are we going to turn our back on the world?</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn is just following in Angela Merkel\u2019s footprints when, earlier this year, she told the German people: \u201cWe can manage it \u2026 Germany is a strong country.\u201d So, we should be asking: is Britain strong enough to play our role in dealing with the problem? Are we going to stand up and deal with the difficulties? Or are we going to run away and hide?<br><strong>David Reed</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 A month before the 23 June Brexit referendum you published a letter from me (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/labour-losing-ground-to-ukip-over-eu-migrants\" title=\"\">Labour losing ground to Ukip over migrants</a>, 24 May) warning that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy of \u201caccommodate but don\u2019t control\u201d immigration went against the views of the majority, who realised that the present level of immigration made tackling the social concerns of the \u201cleft behind\u201d much more difficult. Having learned nothing from Brexit, Corbyn is sticking to his more-immigration guns in what looks like an electoral death wish.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: continuing with our present immigration policies is undemocratic, as more than three-quarters of us want immigration reduced, <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/r4762fpv66/YG-Archive-Pol-Sunday-Times-results-060315.pdf\" title=\"\">while less than 5% want it increased</a>. It is also the opposite of internationalism, since it implies that we will continue to steal doctors, nurses, IT experts etc from poorer countries, rather than train enough of our own. Yet there is a way out of this. Many of us are very supportive of the rest of Corbyn\u2019s social, environmental and equality programme, but unless Labour debates how to makes controlling immigration a central plank of its manifesto, we are surely doomed to a Conservative/Ukip majority after the next election.<br><strong>Colin Hines</strong><br><em>East Twickenham, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 The \u201cschism at the heart of Corbynism\u201d is visible not only in the debate on Trident (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/corbyn-leader-progress-schism--trident\" title=\"\">Rafael Behr</a>, 28 September) but also on immigration and refugee policy. Corbynism rightly supports free movement of labour, better conditions for migrants, and a more open door for refugees. It is wrongly ambivalent about Brexit, with some parts of the camp actively supporting it. It ignores or denies the fact that Brexit was <em>in nuce</em> a vote to curb free movement, worsen conditions for migrants and close the door further for refugees. It tries to square the circle either by redefining what Brexit is (\u201ctaking back control\u201d) or by speaking as little as possible about it.</p> <p>The schism within the opposition to Corbyn is equally pronounced. It rightly supports staying in the EU, which entails free movement, but declares that we must listen to the \u201clegitimate concerns of the white working class\u201d, which is code for embracing anti-immigration at best and covert racism at worst.</p> <p>These schisms bode ill for the future coherence of the Labour party. What is needed to resolve them is not complex: a vigorous campaign to stay in the EU even at this late stage; endorsement of free movement of labour; measures to stop employers using migrants as a reserve army of cheap labour; open wider doors to refugees. This means confronting both the left\u2019s traditional flirtation with anti-European nationalism, which often hides under the mask of \u201cinternationalism\u201d and \u201canti-imperialism\u201d, and the right\u2019s endorsement of a prejudice and xenophobia that hides under the mask of \u201clistening to the voice of the common folk\u201d. At present there is no significant constituency behind this cosmopolitan stance, but we can try to hold the fort until one is able to take shape.<br><strong>Robert Fine</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor of sociology, University of Warwick</em></p> <p>\u2022 Lynsey Hanley is right that core working-class disadvantage is clearly systemic and will not be substantially improved by attempts to promote individual social mobility through educational success (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/27/why-class-wont-go-away\" title=\"\">Out of it</a>, 27 September). Even in the much more favourable conditions of the 60s and 70s such achievement was limited. But where is the evidence that a pervasive working-class rejectionist culture led to Brexit votes? Extrapolation from <a href=\"http://www.dannydorling.org/?p=5568\" title=\"\">Danny Dorling\u2019s analysis of the polling evidence shows that no more than a quarter of the core D-E working classes voted leave</a>. For whatever reason, most did not vote. Isn\u2019t it also a bit condescending to assume that working-class Brexiteers voted emotively, rather than simply sharing the highly specific views of the more numerous conservative middle-class leave voters: that, in their eyes, the EU meant unwanted immigration and unwelcome continental interference in UK affairs?<br><strong>Bryn Jones</strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/10/labour.margaretthatcher\" title=\"\">\u201cthe longest suicide note in history\u201d</a> was Gerald Kaufman\u2019s epithet for Labour\u2019s 1983 manifesto, yesterday\u2019s policy announcement may turn out to be the shortest.

The consequent pressure on local health, housing, education and other services is hitting specific areas of the country very hard indeed \u2013 it is not racist or anti-immigrant to be \u201cconcerned about numbers\u201d.

  "<p>Polly Toynbee (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-2016\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 27 September) continues her assault on Jeremy Corbyn. She has binned Corbyn\u2019s olive branch, his assurance that the vast majority of sitting Labour MPs will not face deselection, and demands that Corbyn should stop all talk of deselecting MPs.</p> <p>But it is not in Corbyn\u2019s gift \u2013 if the party is a democratic one \u2013 to prevent all deselections. What he has done is give a clear steer that no widespread purge should take place. That surely implies that a good constituency MP who opposes Corbyn\u2019s policies should not face any undue threat.</p> <p>In the normal course of events it would be entirely reasonable for a lazy MP who does not adequately represent his or her constituents to be deselected. And if the Tory proposals for boundary redrawing go ahead, it is inevitable that there will be contests between sitting MPs and others to secure candidacies in a reduced number of seats. But in present circumstances there will be another category of MP who will be at risk \u2013 not those who engage in reasoned criticism of Corbyn and his supporters, but rather those who persist in angry denunciations in every possible public arena and who insist that Labour is unelectable, a stance that is in danger of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. It may well be that the leader\u2019s olive branch will not protect them from the ire of their own party members.<br><strong>John Gray</strong><br><em>Belfast</em></p> <p>\u2022 I cannot understand why Polly Toynbee is so opposed to what she calls deselection and the rest of us think of as normal democratic procedure. In the real world, outside the confines of politics and journalism, holding an election means the existing post-holder steps down and all contenders are on an equal footing. Holding public office should not be seen as a career move, but as a civic duty, like jury service. And yes, there should be a maximum tenure: three terms ought to be more than enough.<br><strong>Jim Grozier</strong><br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022 The \u201cpeople power\u201d backing Corbyn and Momentum needs to be reminded that legislation for change does not take place at rallies or community meetings: it is voted for in parliament. People did not get maternity or paternity leave, workers\u2019 rights, climate change legislation etc through protest alone; it was debated and passed into law by elected MPs grouped behind an effective parliamentary leader. That\u2019s why the Labour party has clause 1 in its constitution, stating that its purpose is to \u201corganise and maintain in parliament and in the country a political Labour party\u201d. The people-powered politics of the unions and the cooperative movement proved ineffective in the 19th century at securing radical change and it was realised that only members of parliament could enact the necessary laws. Protest has to translate into constructive constituency Labour party activism leading to actual government \u2013 otherwise it is just hot air, which I fear is the case with much of the leftwing protest taking place away from parliament at the moment.<br><strong>Jeanne Caesar</strong><br><em>Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/30/architecture.artsfeatures\">Mies van der Rohe</a> was born first, in 1886, in Aachen, Germany. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/11/le-corbusier-india-architecture-1965\">Le Corbusier </a>arrived the following year, and 250 miles to the south, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Mies went on to become the godfather of the steel-and-glass <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/International-Style-architecture\">international style</a>; Corbu, enamored with the possibilities of concrete, essentially created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/18/raw-concrete-beauty-of-barbarism-barnabas-calder-review\">brutalism</a>. Which means that not only were the two architects great builders in their own right; they were also responsible for creating the greatest sibling rivalry in the history of architecture.</p> <p>Le Corbusier\u2019s brutalism took an early lead, not least because of concrete\u2019s cost advantage: it is cheap and abundant, the second most consumed material in the world, after water. Brutalism also had the art-historical advantage of fitting easily into a centuries-long narrative. The monumental brutalist vaulting of the Washington Metro, for instance, is uncannily similar to that found in largest concrete dome in the world \u2013 the 2,000-year-old Pantheon, in Rome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e613bcf786b96a23c390b91d7b8f00432ceff672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e613bcf786b96a23c390b91d7b8f00432ceff672/0_262_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mass Donna Summer roller disco tribute takes palce outside Boston City Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mass Donna Summer roller disco tribute takes palce outside Boston City Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet by the 1960s, when both movements really hit their stride, it was the international style that was in the ascendant. Mies had given New York City the Seagram Building, \u201cthe millennium\u2019s most important building\u201d, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/18/magazine/best-building-opposites-attract.html\">according to Herbert Muschamp</a> of the New York Times. Citizens of modern cities on every continent started looking up and seeing shimmering sheets of glass, as their formerly parochial towns were transformed into something resembling the Emerald City from The Wizard of Oz. A new international phenomenon emerged: the modern skyline, comprising buildings that aspired to float \u2013 effortlessly, impossibly \u2013 upwards, in a reverie of light and transparency. This, surely, was the golden future. The lucky few were part of it already, and everybody else wanted in. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the 99% (although they didn\u2019t call themselves that at the time) found themselves raising families in suburban concrete housing estates that were direct descendants of <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/85971/ad-classics-unite-d-habitation-le-corbusier\">Corbusier\u2019s Unit\u00e9 d\u2019habitation</a>, or housing unit, in Marseille. The impetus behind such buildings was just as idealistic as any Miesian tower, but concrete architecture is unforgiving, and budgets were tight, and no one ever bothered to consult the people whose lives were ostensibly being improved. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee630e93064fb19dfe0f703ee4aa49f3cd40659f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee630e93064fb19dfe0f703ee4aa49f3cd40659f/0_0_1368_2000/684.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians cross New York\u2019s Park Avenue in front of the landmark Seagram Building.\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedestrians cross New York\u2019s Park Avenue in front of the landmark Seagram Building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result was that brutalism, in the public mind, became the architecture of a forgotten underclass: windswept plazas, crumbling concrete, ugly dystopian soullessness. Far from being something to aspire to, it was something to escape from. The name didn\u2019t help: even though it derives from the French <em>b\u00e9ton brut</em>, for raw concrete, it still connotes brutality. The architecture could be pretty brutal too: hulking, massive, monumental. Certainly by 1981, when Tom Wolfe published <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/08/specials/wolfe-bauhaus.html\">From Bauhaus to Our House</a>, brutalism had become something to hate, a symbol of everything that was wrong with modern architecture.</p> <p>The story, however, does not end there. The international style evolved, and not well. What used to be aspirational started becoming an in-your-face statement of conspicuous consumption. The gauche gaudiness of was embraced not only where you might expect it (the Wynn towers of Las Vegas, say), but also in places with real history, such as New York City. Go to Columbus Circle today, for instance, and you\u2019ll see Christian de Portzamparc\u2019s billionaire condos at One57 face off against \u201ca 1950s international style glass skyscraper in a 1980s gold lame party dress,\u201d as Muschamp <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/21/nyregion/trump-tries-convert-50-s-style-into-90-s-gold-makeover-starts-columbus-circle.html\">described</a> the Trump International Hotel. Such erections generate almost as much hatred today as the worst mistakes of brutalism did in the 1960s, and understandably so: they represent a world in which the more obtrusive and ostentatious you are, the more profit you make.</p> <p>The international style, deservedly or not, is bearing the brunt of the global backlash against rising inequality at all levels of society. Gentrification has become a dirty word, and nothing exemplifies gentrification more than some new steel-and-glass tower going up in the middle of a tight-knit middle-income community. The openness and transparency ostensibly espoused by the architectural vernacular fool no one: these \u201cresidences\u201d are sealed off from their neighborhoods, shiny bubbles of wealth and privilege invariably protected from their less salubrious neighbors by multiple layers of security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec2532e19c625715e698e81a12f2e79dfec092d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec2532e19c625715e698e81a12f2e79dfec092d/0_0_4168_3173/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An exterior view of the Met Breuer, named after Marcel Breuer, who designed it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An exterior view of the Met Breuer, named after Marcel Breuer, who designed it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thus was the stage set for the resurgence of brutalism. You can\u2019t put a brutalist building in a gold lame party dress: raw concrete is raw concrete. It\u2019s down-to-earth, honest, unpretentious, egalitarian, and creates buildings rooted in place: <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/117442/ad-classics-boston-city-hall-kallmann-mckinnell-knowles\">Boston City Hall</a>, New York\u2019s Whitney Museum (now the Met Breuer), the city of Bras\u00edlia. </p> <p>Unlike steel and glass, concrete has terroir: the reddish concrete of Boston, for instance, looks and feels very different from the fine-grained concrete of Japan. You take the local rock, bind it with cement and water, and there you have your concrete. Its very nature is local rather than blandly international.</p> <p>When they\u2019re treated with care and respect, brutalist buildings can become treasured by a city in a way that glass-and-steel towers very rarely are. In London, for instance, locals and tourists alike swarm to the concrete cultural buildings on the south bank of the Thames at Waterloo Bridge. These masterpieces \u2013 the Royal Festival Hall, the Hayward Gallery, <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2014/10/06/brutalist-buildings-national-theatre-london-denys-lasdun/\">Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre</a> \u2013 are a beloved part of the capital, a destination even for people with no particular reason to go there.</p> <p>A similar possessiveness can be found in residential architecture. Consider Rupert Murdoch, a man who seemingly buys and sells New York homes as a hobby, never staying in one too long, and sometimes never moving in at all. In London, by contrast, he has lived in a Lasdun-designed brutalist apartment block overlooking Green Park for decades, which I very much doubt he will ever sell. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e02941a1e5d53c96e05513a92978d6dd8604f39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e02941a1e5d53c96e05513a92978d6dd8604f39/0_763_4690_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre, built in 1975 on London\u2019s South Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre, built in 1975 on London\u2019s South Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Great brutalist buildings, it turns out, have soul, in a way that antiseptic glass curtain walls never will. And they have undeniable power, too. Consider<a href=\"http://architecture.about.com/od/greatbuildings/ss/holocaust.htm\"> Peter Eisenman\u2019s haunting holocaust memorial</a> in Berlin: it would be unthinkable in anything but concrete. </p> <p>Brutalism is protean, as well. With concrete, anything is possible, and astonishing new ideas can emerge at any time: consider <a href=\"http://www.studiootherspaces.net/\">Olafur Eliasson\u2019s Studio Other Spaces</a>, which has developed a technique to cast huge chunks of glacial ice in concrete. When the ice melts, it leaves a series of gorgeously textured irregular spaces. The raw-concrete interiors formed using this technique are like nothing the world has ever seen.</p> <p>Most subversively, brutalism is old. If you move into a brutalist building today, there\u2019s a very good chance that it was built 50 years ago. Certainly contemporary architects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/jun/19/architecture-serpentine-pavilion\">Peter Zumthor </a>continue to do wonderful work in the same vein, alongside greats like <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/tag/tadao-ando/\">Tadao Ando</a>. But venture to the heart of brutalism and you won\u2019t find brand names and <em>starchitects</em> and buildings of preternatural beauty. Instead you\u2019ll find thousands of much humbler structures, characterized by simplicity, functionality and what-you-see-is-what-you-get directness.</p> <p>Brutalism today has developed a unique ability to cut across class divides. Blue-collar workers and billionaires alike appreciate its charms even if they are sometimes frustrated by its inflexibility; are attracted to its plainness while being inspired by its palpable integrity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a70928c2094acf911b7279a1d16c2c6329af2817\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a70928c2094acf911b7279a1d16c2c6329af2817/0_0_2717_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hiddleston in High Rise: the organic and the concrete.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"416\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hiddleston in High Rise: the organic and the concrete.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: StudioCanal/Planet Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to see, then, how brutalism is flourishing in the age of Occupy. But there\u2019s another force driving the brutalist resurgence, which is maybe less austere and selfless: photography, in general, and Instagram, in particular.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/17/high-rise-review-tom-hiddleston-ben-wheatley-jb-ballard\">High-Rise</a>, the 2015 Ben Wheatley adaptation of JG Ballard\u2019s novel, you will surely remember the vision of Tom Hiddleston\u2019s smooth yet chiseled naked body as seen from above, framed by a raw-concrete balcony. The intersection of the organic with concrete makes for striking visuals, and even concrete on its own has stunning visual power. Something as simple as a shadow packs a much harder punch when it falls across a beautifully textured grey background.</p> <p>Say what you like about brutalist buildings, you have to admit they look gorgeous in photographs and in coffee-table books such as <a href=\"http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/this-brutal-world-architecture-book-phaidon\">This Brutal World</a>, recently published by Phaidon. Brutalism might still be a bit austere for many people\u2019s taste. But when you live in something that good looking, you can\u2019t help but feel a little bit of glamor by association.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour party is not split, it is splattered. The \u201cdivorcing couple arguing over the children\u201d metaphor doesn\u2019t work unless we accept there are countless children who don\u2019t want to live with either parent. The battle cry of \u201cWhich side are you on, boys?\u201d doesn\u2019t work because we are not all boys and there are not simply two sides.

Words such as \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201copportunity\u201d are used by every party. The language of anti-austerity is further sloganeering.

It\u2019s a strange mix of the past and the future. They are keen on networks and automation, which is a world away from the mutterings of some union bosses. The attitude to work is different; as is the attitude to Trident and fracking. The Momentum crew are less good at explaining who will do the work of caring in the future because they have zilch in the way of gender politics beyond loving sex workers. They have energy but the beatification of Jeremy Corbyn is not enough to generate a coherent philosophy. For he is simply a cipher, too often a regurgitator of policy-lite platitudes. His limitations are sold as his USP. Actually, he reminds me increasingly of Blair, a man who believed above all in his own self-righteousness. Like Blair, he surrounds himself with the \u201cLive Tory-Vote Labour\u201d types who live in big houses and send their kids to selective schools.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/andy-burnham-to-quit-shadow-cabinet-to-focus-on-manchester-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/552me\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2757686\"            data-video-name=\"Andy Burnham to quit shadow cabinet to focus on Manchester \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Labour Party\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ebc212e4b01b56deffc3d7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928BurnhamCnference2_KP-29413591_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928BurnhamCnference2_KP-29413591.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928BurnhamCnference2_KP-29413591_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/andy-burnham-to-quit-shadow-cabinet-to-focus-on-manchester-video\">Andy Burnham to quit shadow cabinet to focus on Manchester</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He is merely a symptom of a problem, not the problem itself. Is Labour simply the Retro party? Parts of it look back to the glory days of when we lost the miners\u2019 strike; others to that time Labour won elections. What it cannot do is offer an account of where we are now. God knows, that is difficult \u2026 but we do not yet live in this world of robots. We live in a scary, insecure world. The challenges to neoliberalism have come from the right \u2013 Nigel Farage or Donald Trump \u2013 and this means two things for a party of the left. It has to present a competent economic plan and it has to make the case for social liberalism in conjunction with other parties. Now is not the time for a politics of purity or paranoid purges. This is a terrible narrowing-down.<br></p> <p>What is opening up are the divides between the places where it remains in control \u2013 the cities with Labour mayors and the Welsh Assembly \u2013 and what are referred to as the old Labour heartlands, full of small towns. It is in many of these northern English constituencies that some Corbynites plan to deselect, mostly women, MPs. The fracturing of class solidarity means that the leadership of the party wants to hold on to what it considers to be socially conservative voters but has no way to address them. The disdain of the Remainers for the Brexiteers made that clear. The left regards its own people as gullible, stupid and largely suffering from false consciousness. At least Corbyn addressed this in his speech. But he needs to reach out beyond his base.</p> <p>There is potential in local politics, a new kind of devolution that is evolving organically. There is still a reluctance to talk about Englishness, but national identity is up for re-imagining. It is happening. Labour can join that conversation or cede it to the right. If Labour cannot find a way of talking about a nation that embodies modernity as well as making the case for spending on a state that makes us feel more secure, whether that\u2019s defence or the NHS; if it cannot speak of a civic morality, then what is it for? The problem is not faith in Corbyn but faith in this common purpose.</p>",
  "<p>Farewell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-job-latest-news-and-reaction-live\" title=\"\">then, Big Sam</a>. We\u2019ll always have the good times. Like that Adam Lallana goal. Or being 1-0 up for the last 40 seconds of an away qualifying win in Slovakia. Which was basically the same as that Adam Lallana goal. Plus of course there was that moment just after the Adam Lallana goal when you said \u201cit\u2019s not for me to say where Wayne Rooney plays\u201d. Which was absolutely correct, as it turns out.</p> <p>There have been failed England managers before. There have been funny England managers. There have been depressing ones too. Incompetent: check. Greedy: roger that. As Sam Allardyce leaves his post after 67 days one thing is clear. Never before has an England manager succeeded in being all these things simultaneously in such a thrillingly short space of time. Appointed in July, gone in September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-arrogant-clot-england-manager\" title=\"\">Allardyce has been the Willy Wonka</a> three-course dinner-gum of England managers, the whole sad endlessly moreish story in a single microdot of folly and greed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-arrogant-clot-england-manager\">Arrogant clot, for sure, but did this really merit England ditching Allardyce? | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of which nothing at all has changed. Nothing has been learnt. Despite the many revelations of the Daily Telegraph sting operation \u2013 a phrase that still feels slightly odd: perhaps next the Telegraph will be reviving Page 3 \u2013 we are where we always start out.</p> <p>We always knew Allardyce was friendly, thirsty, entrepreneurial, entirely football-ish in his sensitivities. We always knew top-level football, the Premier League world in which Allardyce is so thoroughly steeped, is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, not to mention a vast barfing geyser of greed. We always knew the England manager\u2019s job \u2013 what it could or should be \u2013 is the real issue here. The rest is simply people being themselves, an industry that is what it is.</p> <p>To understand the essentially doomed nature of Allardyce for England it is worth tracing the lineage of those who have been Big before him. Before Sam the Big Men had always tended to miss out. Big Mal, Big Ron, Old Big \u2019Ead: populists and charisma-merchants who never quite fitted the chair. Big is football code. It means wide, dangerous, fun, popular, utterly of the modern game. No one ever called Alf Ramsey Big Alf or Roy Hodgson Big Roy.</p> <p>Big Sam was the first Big England manager and this is a serious point. The first appointed solely on the basis of his populism and availability, and despite reservations \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-history-suspicion-dream-job-ended-67-days\" title=\"\">that open post-Panorama file for one</a> \u2013 that would have stymied him otherwise.</p> <p>Just as Big Sam has often been ushered in at clubs in need of an injection of energising self-confidence, so it was with England. The Football Association felt it was going for a manager who could relax the players, relate to them, exist in their world: Big Sam, of the Premier League, who knows the ropes, cuts the deals, talks the talk, has business interests in common with Joe Hart and Wayne Rooney.</p> <p>Except it turns out that world is also brash, morally sketchy and above all laughably avaricious. Big Sam\u2019s big day out on the make may have been \u201centrapment\u201d but clearly it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable or startling or discomfiting in any way. Similarly the Premier League will welcome him back without qualms. Big Sam will remain Big. It\u2019s just the England manager\u2019s job that got small.</p> <p>And this is the basic issue. The England manager\u2019s job remains oddly undefined, unworldly, wrapped up in a moth-eaten brocade of expectation and tradition, trapped energy, unfulfilled desires. There is a pointlessness to it but an urgent kind of pointless, ceremonial prominence without power. Being the England manager is a bit like being Prince Andrew or some other high-profile but meaningless royal: kept and managed and wheeled out to face the public but always essentially in the hands of others. No wonder in both cases you end up talking to some funny people.</p> <p>This is not to say it\u2019s a doomed role. Quite the opposite. It is simply worth remembering who the England manager is actually for. Hard as it might be for the marketing wonks populating the FA\u2019s executive ranks to gasp, the England manager still speaks not to the players but above all to people beyond those elite levels, to every supporter, to every coach working at the <em>mille-feuille</em> of layers below, every grassroots amateur with a badge and a set of players to whip into shape.</p> <p>This is in part how the role was conceived when Walter Winterbottom became the first of the line. Winterbottom was as much a head of participation and engagement as simply a man to pick a team to beat the foreigners. He consulted on school curricular matters. He tried to formulate a national coaching style to be taught in schools and parks. He was a jovial, teacherly paterfamilias to his players (he cooked their meals and did the washing up at the 1950 World Cup).</p> <p>England won\u2019t be appointing another Big Walt. This is after all a business that needs to sell itself, a rampant commercial concern, but there is no reason why this benevolent, educational role should not be right at the front of every decision the FA makes. There are in the end only two things of any worth in football: playing the game and watching the game. Everything else is parasitic. The entire ludicrous overblown leisure industry, with its rag-bag of broadcast rights billions, \u00a3400,000 speaking gigs, agents, uber-greed, all of this is simply the monetising of human need and human pleasure.</p> <p>Never mind reputation and propriety, the FA should be concerned above all with points one and two. This is not entirely separate from winning matches. Until very recently the Icelandic FA had only 15 employees and now has a national manager who is still a part-time dentist. The Fifa and Uefa millions have been ploughed into building all-weather pitches in every school.</p> <p>It is a choice the FA has made to transform itself into the opposite of this, an organisation driven by commerce, just as English football as a whole has turned itself inside out in pursuit of the ever-gushing revenue stream. You get the England managers you deserve. Welcome, Big Sam. And farewell.</p> <p>The fact is the England manager isn\u2019t the second most important man in the country any more. It isn\u2019t an impossible job. It\u2019s not even a very hard job these days, given no one really expects England to win tournaments.</p> <p>But it does come with a duty to be discharged, an opportunity to do good, or at least not to propagate the bad. Allardyce will stand now as a pub quiz question, an oddity and above all a risible failure. The FA is right to have accepted his resignation but the real mistake wasn\u2019t so much appointing him in the first place as the culture that made him the only real option, a managerial chalice poisoned simply by the air that surrounds it.</p>",

Have you spoken to Chancellor Merkel about Deutsche Bank and the needs of the German banking sector?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Well, we completed back in June, actually, a financial sector assessment of the German banking system.

And I would hope that the right measure are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened. It has recovered a bit today, by the way.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Yes, it has. But do you see it as a global systemic risk?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Deutsche Bank is a systemic player. Let\u2019s face it. Because it has a lot of relationship with many other banks around the world. And it is an international player as well. So it\u2019s important that it be consolidated and, you know, it has a solid base. Let\u2019s also be realistic.

While some banks\u2019 business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation. Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency. In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions.

Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank by assets have dropped almost a fifth since it confirmed that the United States Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Final bills paid by other banks suggest Deutsche will hand over a fraction of that amount.</p> <p>Calculating penalties is an inexact science. But one way to assess how much Deutsche might pay is to look at the fine as a proportion of the mortgage-backed securities it issued. Bank of America, for example, settled on a sum worth just over 2 percent of the instruments it underwrote, says KBW. Citigroup was the hardest hit so far, with fines totaling 11 percent of its issuance, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.</p> <p>Apply that range to the estimated $67 billion of securities that Deutsche underwrote \u2013 and deduct the $1.9 billion it has already forked out to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u2013 and the remaining fine could be anything from $200 million to $5.5 billion.

And it has plenty of assets it can sell quickly to raise the ratio if required. Selling the asset management arm might be required, although this would be negative for earnings growth going forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also argues that we\u2019re not facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/28/deutsche-bank-ceo-help-opec-oil-draghi-germany-live?page=with:block-57eb77c6e4b08ca277ca0ee5#block-57eb77c6e4b08ca277ca0ee5\"><em>as UBS chairman Axel Weber said this morning</em></a>).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not a Lehmans moment in the offing. Banks are generally better capitalised and able to cope with adverse shocks. And Deutsche\u2019s derivatives exposure can be overstated. These exposures are netted out and hedged so it\u2019s not like Deutsche could lose the trillions of dollars as is sometimes hinted at. Nevertheless, these derivatives are hard to value, particularly post-Brexit, and therefore pose a risk, while there is a worry is that a lower credit rating will make it harder to deal in these derivatives, hitting earnings.</p> </blockquote> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t in a fix:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deutsche\u2019s problem is not capitalisation \u2013 it\u2019s just that its costs have soared (mainly through litigation and fines) and it\u2019s not that profitable any more. That is a much longer-term question about its future than whether it\u2019s in need of a bailout to boost some arbitrary capital requirement. Deutsche has to face down the short hedgies first and then look to raise capital. In that sense a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 kind of nod from Berlin may help.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc182e4b0757c5291926c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:12:04.092Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>How things change...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/781073088947621888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From February:<br>JP Morgan named Deutsche its top global investment bank pick;

According to Die Zeit\u2019s research, shared with The Guardian ahead of publication, the German government is \u201cdebating a state takeover of as much as 25 per cent\u201d of the bank.</p> <p>One advantage of such a solution is that such an intervention would allow the German government to push Deutsche Bank towards a fusion with Commerzbank, of which around 15% are already state-owned.</p> <p>However, a state-sponsored bailout for Deutsche Bank would provide much embarrassment for a lender whose former boss Josef Ackerman said in 2008 that he would be \u201cashamed\u201d to take money from the state \u2013 as well as a German government which has been insisting on limiting state aid for ailing banks in southern Europe.</p> <p>The bailout would also come with considerable economic risk. Under a new rule put into force across the EU at the start of the year, no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 per cent of the lender\u2019s liabilities have contributed towards footing the bill. Deutsche Bank would thus potentially have to become a high-profile test case for this new \u201cbail-in\u201d regime.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb9337e4b01b56deffc2b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T10:15:59.209Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Read the Die Zeit story on Deutsche Bank here</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Die Zeit\u2019s story about a secret rescue plan for Deutsche Bank is now online, here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2016-09/deutsche-bank-rettungsplan-finanzaufsichtsbehoerde?utm_campaign=Zeit.de-Wirtschaft&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">Bundesregierung bereitet Notfallplan f\u00fcr Deutsche Bank vor</a></h2> <p>I\u2019ve skimmed through it, and....</p> <p><strong>It says that German Federal Government and the supervisory authorities are preparing an emergency plan for Germany\u2019s largest lender, according to officials in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt.</strong></p> <p>It would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed to raise additional capital to resolve its disputes with the US justice department, and can\u2019t raise it from the markets.</p> <p>Under the plan, Deutsche could sell some assets to other banks -- possibly with some form of government guarantee attached.</p> <p>And there has also been talk of the government taking a 25% stake in Deutche.

  "<p>Moscow faces the prospect of an acrimonious legal standoff with the west after an international investigation concluded that a Buk missile brought across the border from Russia had shot down flight MH17.</p> <p>The Dutch-led <a href=\"https://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/mh17-vliegramp/presentaties/presentation-joint/\">joint investigation team (JIT)</a> said the missile had been fired from a village under the control of pro-Russia rebels.

Witnesses, photographs and video show it escorted by several other vehicles and by \u201carmed men in uniform\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Around 100 people have been identified who can be linked to the downing of MH17 or the transport of the Buk.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Witnesses at the launch site near the village of Pervomaiskyi reported hearing \u201ca very loud noise\u201d and \u201ca high whistling sound\u201d. They also saw a plume of smoke.<br></li> </ul> <p>Investigators are now examining who gave the order to smuggle the Buk system into Ukraine, and who gave the order to shoot down MH17.<br></p> <p>Wilbert Paulissen, the head of the Dutch national detective force, told the press conference: \u201cMH17 was shot down by a 9M38 series missile, launched from a Buk-Telar. This Buk-Telar was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation, and after launch was subsequently returned to Russian Federation territory.\u201d</p> <p>Satellite data from the US and the European Space Agency identified the launch site, along with testimony from numerous witnesses, he said. </p> <p>Paulissen said the JIT had examined and ultimately rejected other scenarios. They included the possibility that there was a terrorist attack on board the flight, or that it was shot down by a military aircraft. Radar data from Russia and Ukraine proved there were no other planes in the vicinity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/mh-17_buk_missile/giv-1406o20CtwQOt1vn/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/mh-17_buk_missile/giv-1406o20CtwQOt1vn/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The investigators said they had demonstrated that a ground-based air defence system downed the Boeing 777. They compared pieces of the Buk retrieved from the crash site with various types of missile from the 9M38 series. They also exploded a missile in a controlled test in Finland.</p> <p>Forensic examinations gave further clues. Fragments of the Buk missile were found in the bodies of MH17\u2019s pilot and crew during autopsies. There were traces of cockpit glass, showing the fragments pierced the plane \u201cfrom the outside\u201d. A twisted piece of metal from the missile shot \u201cwith great force\u201d was recovered from the cockpit window.</p> <p>The JIT said it had identified a large part of the route taken by the Buk after it arrived from Russia and was deployed inside rebel-held eastern Ukraine. </p> <p>The evidence includes damning intercepted telephone calls between rebel leaders. There are also photos, analysed and authenticated, plus a previously unknown video obtained from a witness. Several anonymous witnesses had come forward following an appeal for information on the JIT\u2019s website, Paulissen said.</p> <p>A video reconstruction shown at the press conference revealed the Buk\u2019s journey. It was seen leaving rebel-held Donetsk on a low-loader, heading east. After arriving in Snizhne on the afternoon of 17 July, the Buk was offloaded and drove to a field south of town. Early the next day it was taken back across the Russian border via the rebel-held city of Luhansk.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6gJ8NDhYA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Sf6gJ8NDhYA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The JIT\u2019s video reconstruction of the Buk\u2019s journey</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Wednesday\u2019s press conference raises the prospect of a long and bitter standoff with the Kremlin, which vehemently denies all involvement. </p> <p>\u201cThe conclusions by the working group on the crash of the Malaysian Boeing are extremely politicised. I don\u2019t believe any of their conclusions,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, the newly appointed head of the foreign affairs committee in Russia\u2019s parliament, told the RBC newspaper.<br></p> <p>Eduard Basurin, a representative of the Russia-backed separatist forces in Donetsk, said the rebels \u201ccouldn\u2019t have shot down the Boeing\u201d because they did not have Buk anti-aircraft missiles.</p> <p>Basurin also said no one had seen the US satellite imagery that allegedly recorded the missile launch. He accused Ukraine of not presenting information on \u201cwhat aircraft were in the air at the time\u201d, even though the Russian military has backtracked on its claims that a Ukrainian jet could have shot down MH17.</p> <p>The JIT has so far not identified the 100 suspects it now has under investigation. Nor did it say which country they were from, but they are widely believed to be serving Russian soldiers and officers.<br></p> <p>It seems highly unlikely Moscow would allow suspects to be extradited from Russia to stand trial. It is also unclear where a possible trial would take place, though the international criminal court in The Hague is the obvious choice. Two-thirds of the victims were Dutch. The others came from nine countries and included ten Britons.</p> <p>Will Mayne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/13/flight-mh17-two-years-on-putin-killed-my-son-richard-mayne-ukraine\">whose 20-year-old brother Richard was killed on board MH17</a>, said he and other relatives were satisfied with the investigation. \u201cThey went into a lot of depth. The Buk came from Russia and went back after a day. This highlights once again how Russia has been lying and manipulating.\u201d </p> <p>Mayne said he was cautiously optimistic that the suspects would eventually be extradited from Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a struggle, but you always have to be hopeful,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Investigators were unable to say how long their inquiry would now take, adding on Wednesday that it would be a \u201clong haul\u201d. \u201cI told the grieving relatives that I can\u2019t make any promises,\u201d the chief Dutch prosecutor Fred Westebeke said. \u201cThe work is going on with all countries, and our best people,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>The JIT\u2019s interim report is a vindication for the British-led online investigation team Bellingcat. It correctly identified the field from which the missile was fired. On the basis of social media posts it traced the Buk to Russia\u2019s 53rd anti-aircraft unit, based in the city of Kursk. As a result Bellingcat has come under withering attack from Russian state media. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/route_map-zip/giv-31114V5VbTdRuyHCX/\" data-alt=\"Flight path of MH17\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/10/route_map-zip/giv-31114V5VbTdRuyHCX/\">Flight path of MH17</a> </figure>",
  "<p>Humans are predisposed to murder each other, new research suggests, although it remains unclear if it\u2019s down to genetics or other factors.</p> <p>Researchers from Spain have found that a tendency to bump off members of the same species is particularly common among primates, and have estimated that around 2% of human deaths at the origin of our species were down to such lethal spats. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhat it is saying, in the broadest terms, is that humans have evolved strategies for solving problems with violence,\u201d said Mark Pagel, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the research.</p> <p>But, the authors add, the impact of society can greatly modify how aggressive humans are, with the proportion of human deaths due to people fighting between themselves fluctuating over mankind\u2019s history.</p> <p>\u201cLethal violence is part of our evolutionary history but not carved in stone in \u2018our genes\u2019,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda G\u00f3mez, first author of the study from the <a href=\"http://www.eeza.csic.es/en/personal.aspx\">Estaci\u00f3n Experimental de Zonas \u00c1ridas </a>(EEZA) in Spain. \u201cAt least to some extent, the way humans organise in societies influences our levels of lethal violence.\u201d</p> <p>The question of human violence has puzzled thinkers for centuries, from Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century, to contemporary psychologists such as Jared Diamond and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/20/wars-john-gray-conflict-peace\">Steven Pinker, </a>the Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard University and author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/better-angels-of-our-nature.html\">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a>.</p> <p>Pinker has previously argued that humans engage in lethal violence as a \u201cnatural condition,\u201d but that deaths from such violence have decreased with the rise of modern societies with sophisticated institutions and laws. But the idea has proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/13/john-gray-steven-pinker-wrong-violence-war-declining\">controversial</a>. <br></p> <p>The new research is likely to add further fuel to the debate.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature19758\">Nature</a>, the team of researchers from four Spanish institutions sought to unpick the evolutionary contribution to lethal human violence by looking at how commonly a range of different mammals kill members of the same species. </p> <p>To do so, they examined the evolutionary family tree of mammals, looking at data from more than 1,020 species, as well as 600 human populations stretching as far back in time as the Stone Age, drawing on evidence from human remains found in archaeological excavations. </p> <p>For each species of mammal, the team looked at the proportion of deaths that were down to violence between members of the same species. The findings showed that such lethal violence is more common in some mammals, such as primates, than in others, such as bats or whales, and is more common among mammals that exhibit social and territorial behaviour that those that go it alone. </p> <p>Using statistical models, the researchers then estimated the likely levels of such lethal violence for evolutionary ancestors at various points in the family tree of mammals.</p> <p>The results revealed that for the ancestor of all mammals, around 1 in every 300 deaths was down to lethal violence between members of the same species. But, the authors note, for evolutionary ancestors of the primates and apes, the figures were higher. </p> <p>Around 1.8% of deaths are thought to have been down to lethal violence for the ancestor of the great apes, and around 2% for the first humans - a figure more than six times higher than at the origin of mammals. </p> <p>\u201cWe cannot tell that 2% of violence is due to genetic factors,\u201d said G\u00f3mez. \u201cNot only genes are inherited from ancestors, also environmental conditions and ecological constraints. Those are also probably influencing the human lethal violence in our evolutionary past.\u201d</p> <p>But Pagel believes it is important to emphasise that genetic adaptations could be at play. \u201cHumans emerged from a very long lineage of species - great apes and before them the primates - that all expressed relatively high levels of lethal violence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you immerse an animal in a particular environment, it evolves genetic-based strategies for dealing with that environment. There is good reason to believe this reflects a real genetic or innate tendency to solve problems with violence.\u201d</p> <p>The research also shows that, according to observed evidence, levels of lethal violence among humans have fluctuated over time. While the figure was around 2% for prehistoric man, matching the expected level from the calculations, the proportion of deaths down to such violence rose during other eras such as the iron age and the post-classic period (around 800-500 years ago), falling in contemporary times to below 2%.</p> <p> \u201cFrom the empirical figure of 2% of deaths by lethal violence in primitive hunter-gatherers, different historical times have had different levels of lethal violence,\u201d said G\u00f3mez.</p> <p>Pinker told the Guardian the new research is impressive and supports his views that humans have a natural tendency to engage in lethal violence, that rates of such violence were high in prehistoric societies and are higher in tribes and chiefdoms than hunter-gatherer bands, and that such impulses are dampened in modern societies. \u201cThough I made all these points in The Better Angels of Our Nature in 2011, [the authors] have demonstrated them with much greater precision, rigour, and depth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Douglas Fry of the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the US, disagreed, saying that: \u201cG\u00f3mez and colleagues demonstrate that recent assertions by Steven Pinker and others that violent death in the Paleolithic was shockingly high are greatly exaggerated. To the contrary, the findings show that social organization is critically important in affecting human violence.\u201d</p> <p>G\u00f3mez says the research highlights the control humans have over their situation in life and death. \u201cThe main message of our study is that no matter how violent or pacific we were in the origin, we can modulate the level of interpersonal violence by changing our social environment,\u201dhe said. \u201cWe can build a more pacific society if we wish.\u201d</p>",

Our writers\u2019 verdict | The panel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here\u2019s an extract, from Aditya\u2019s article.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the heart of today\u2019s speech Corbyn was making a big new argument, one I haven\u2019t heard from a Labour leader\u2019s speech in my entire working life. In just over a year, the Labour party has gone from a being desiccated husk of worn-down old leftists and elbows-out young Blairites to being a mass movement. At half a million members, it is the biggest party in Europe \u2013 at a time when other political parties are dying. To use business terminology, we have witnessed something akin to a reverse takeover of the Labour party. It is incomplete and it is certainly contested, but it is real.</p> <p>And what the head of this new movement \u2013 confirmed as its leader twice in 12 months \u2013 was sketching out today was the potential for a social movement in electoral politics. By invoking the victories of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/sadiq-khans-first-100-days-as-london-mayor-how-is-he-doing\">Sadiq Khan in London</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/marvin-rees-the-bristolian-bearing-the-weight-of-labour-hopes\">Marvin Rees in Bristol</a>, he was showing that a social movement can yield victory at the ballot box.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebf092e4b01b56deffc50c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T16:45:10.037Z\">5.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Business groups express doubts about Corbyn's vision</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is some business reaction to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech.</p> <p>From Josh Hardie, the<strong> CBI</strong>\u2019s director general</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The CBI shares much of Labour\u2019s vision for a fairer society underpinned by good business. But without an open dialogue there is a risk that some of their policies could take us backwards. </p> <p>With such significant economic challenges ahead, the UK needs a strong opposition firing on all cylinders and providing progressive, practical new ideas.</p> <p>The focus on research and development, infrastructure and education is encouraging, but artificially hiking wages and changing corporation tax could be investment dampeners, not drivers. </p> <p>Labour is certainly laying out a new way forward and we urge them to iron out inconsistent messages - especially the relationship between state and industry - and clarify policies that are sometimes hard to see delivered and paid for.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Simon Walker</strong>, the Institute of Directors\u2019 director general</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A credible opposition is crucial in keeping the Government on its toes. We will need an effective Labour party challenging the Conservatives during Brexit negotiations to get a deal in the best interests of the country. While Jeremy Corbyn did touch upon important areas for future economic success, like skills and infrastructure, he is not yet putting forward a plan which looks like a platform for government. The basic question is, how will he pay for these mammoth spending plans?</p> <p>The problem for business is that it simply does not see the world in the same way as the Labour leader. The IoD does not think companies are beyond reproach, we have been publically critical of Mike Ashley and Philip Green, but in this speech business was presented as a comic-book villain. Over 80% of people work in the private sector and there are more than five million businesses in the UK. They are the source of the nation\u2019s prosperity, the generators of employment and the funders of our public services. They are not a problem to be solved.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Terry Scuoler, chief executive of <strong>EEF,</strong> the manufacturers\u2019 organisation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst it is welcome to hear the leader of the Opposition talking about the importance of industrial strategy and, the importance of manufacturing, his credentials are far from established in terms of demonstrating an understanding of the overwhelming benefits of liberal capitalism and the society he claims to support.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebf0c4e4b049b74e4cb048\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T16:35:59.247Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn's speech in numbers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Press Association has filed some statistics about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There were a total of five mentions of either \u201csocialism\u201d or \u201csocialist\u201d.

He has smartened up (literally), his media performances have been noticeably better this week than they were at last year\u2019s conference and that speech was probably the best he\u2019s ever given on a national platform like this.</p> <p>Corbyn will never be a racy orator, but he did not try for that here and there was nothing that sounded dud or phoney. There was relatively little of the ritual opponent-bashing you get in these speeches (a blessing), no jokes that misfired (in fact, only one joke \u2013 but a good one), and instead just a serious policy manifesto. It did go on a bit, but dull and earnest is not necessarily bad, particularly if as a politician you have yet to establish your credentials as credible future prime minister.</p> <p>Corbyn did not indulge in any recriminations. Perhaps he could have made more of an effort to reach out beyond his natural constituency, but his speech focused on topics like housing, transport and education that do matter to people who read the Daily Mail. It is often said that Corbyn is a politician who gets most animated talking about human rights and world peace. But in this speech he restrained himself, and the Iraq/Saudia Arabia references were rather brief. It was noticeable that the loudest cheers came when he mentioned the Chilcot report. The Corbynites in the audience may have preferred 50 minutes of Blair-bashing, and 10 minutes of domestic policy. But Corbyn wisely did not give them what they wanted.</p> <p>Blair fought the 1997 general election with a five-point pledge card that eventually became very well known. At the moment Corbyn\u2019s 10 pledges have made zero dent on the public consciousness. But today he put them firmly on the table. Some seem little more than vague aspirations (a national education service), though not necessarily bad ones. Some are surprisingly similar to what the government is doing (like getting business to pay for training \u2013 or the apprenticeship levy, as George Osborne called it.)</p> <p>But his headline announcement, about giving councils new powers to borrow to build homes, seems a good one. Why? Because proposals like this have in the past had the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25205623\">backing of credible organisations like the Local Government Association</a>. And even <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/08/why-wont-osborne-let-councils-borrow-build-housing-even-tories-want-him\">Boris Johnson came out in favour of a proposal like this</a> when he was London mayor.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T15:22:05.288Z\">at 4.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ebd69fe4b049b74e4cafa4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T14:42:26.012Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn is on his peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everyone here \u2026 and every one of our hundreds of thousands of members \u2026. has something to contribute to our cause.

Given the fact that he is expected to leave parliament and become mayor of Greater Manchester next year (it would take a spectacular upset Labour to lose that contest), this was almost certainly Burnham\u2019s last speech to the conference as a frontbencher. He seemed quite emotional at the end, and he received a warm standing ovation.</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Burnham said that he was leaving the shadow cabinet.</strong> A reshuffle is due next week, and Burnham will probably be replaced then. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is my tenth conference speaking to you as a cabinet or shadow cabinet minister.</p> <p>And it will be my last.</p> <p>It is time for me to turn my full focus to Greater Manchester. </p> <p>That\u2019s why I can tell you all first today that I have asked Jeremy to plan a new shadow cabinet without me, although I will of course stay until it is in place.<br></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour had failed so far to respond to people\u2019s concerns about immigration.</strong> It had to show that it understood why people voted for Brexit, he said. Jeremy Corbyn is proposing various measures, including bringing back the migration impact fund, to deal with immigration concerns and Burnham did not directly contradict anything Corbyn has said. But his tone suggested that his stance on the subject is quite different from his leader\u2019s. Burnham said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, this party must fully face up to this fact: millions of lifelong Labour supporters voted to leave the EU and - let\u2019s be honest - voted for change on immigration.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t yet even begun to show to them that we understand why.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to hear this party make the patronising argument that people didn\u2019t understand their referendum vote. They understood it very well.</p> <p>The truth is the EU was working better for some parts of our country than it was for others.</p> <p>For some of our country\u2019s least affluent areas, it wasn\u2019t working well at all ...</p> <p>Labour voters in constituencies like mine are not narrow-minded, nor xenophobic, as some would say. </p> <p>They are warm and giving. Their parents and grandparents welcomed thousands of Ukrainians and Poles to Leigh after the Second World War.</p> <p>And today they continue to welcome refugees from all over the world. They have no problem with people coming here to work.</p> <p>But they do have a problem with people taking them for granted and with unlimited, unfunded, unskilled migration which damages their own living standards. </p> <p>And they have an even bigger problem with an out-of-touch elite who don\u2019t seem to care about it.</p> <p>If Labour now argues for the status quo, it will look like we have abandoned them too.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he favoured a \u201cfair\u201d Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So let\u2019s develop a plan for fair Brexit that deals with their concerns but supports our economy and keeps the Britain we have known - open, welcoming, playing its part in the world.</p> <p>Because the truth is, a hard Brexit would hit these Labour areas hardest of all.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Ironically Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, also used the phrase \u201cfair\u201d Brexit on the Today programme this morning when asked what sort of Brexi he wanted.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn criticised those in the party who have been attacking the record of the Blair/Brown governments.</strong> He said he was \u201csad to hear the achievements of our Labour government, in which I was proud to serve, being dismissed as if they were nothing.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He appealed for unity.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have given my all to this party and always put its interests above those of factions and personalities.</p> <p>And I have given exactly the same loyalty to all four of the Labour leaders I have served.</p> <p>Some say that makes me inconsistent.</p> <p>But, you know what conference? I have an old-fashioned belief - that a Labour government of any kind is a million times better for my constituents in Leigh than any Tory government and that is more likely to happen if Labour is united.</p> <p>So let us unite - let\u2019s have an end to divisive talk about deselections but, in return, let\u2019s have more respect for the democratic will of you, our members.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He called for a full inquiry into Orgreave.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Doesn\u2019t it make you angry, conference, that, thirty years on, former miners are still struggling for the truth? Ordinary people who were fighting for their jobs, their communities, their future.</p> <p>Whose own country tried to put them on trial. It\u2019s why, even today, Britain still feels like two countries. Norman Tebbitt, remember him, well he says an inquiry would be a waste of money. Well, he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he? Let me tell him why it\u2019s not. </p> <p>Kevin Thorne, a former miner at Orgeave, came to Westminster recently to lobby the Home Secretary for an inquiry. He was asked why, after all these years, he is still campaigning. He said this: \u201cI want my grandchildren to be able to trust the Police as I was brought up to do.\u201d</p> <p>That is why Orgreave matters, Conference. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would continue to campaign for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/12/andy-burnham-hillsborough-law-policing-and-crime-bill\"> a \u201cHillsborough law\u201d,</a> giving bereaved families being represented at inquests the same legal support as the police. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the rest of my time in parliament, I will fight for the proposed Hillsborough Law.</p> <p>A law to rebalance the justice system, away from the Establishment and decisively in favour of ordinary people. And I ask you to get fully behind that campaign.</p> <p>A Law that says no public bodies can distort or withhold the truth at inquests; that guarantees all bereaved families a level playing field and equal legal funding - and that Home Secretary should include those Birmingham families.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He accused Theresa May of \u201cpositioning herself to the right of the leave campaign\u201d.</strong> He justified that on the grounds that May has refused to guarantee that EU nationals living in the UK will be able to stay after Brexit. Even Vote Leave said they should stay, he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour should champion devolution and the northern powerhouse.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s seize this moment, put our stamp on devolution and make it a Labour campaign: for a more equal England. Conference, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the support you have given to me over the last ten years.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eef840b268d15ab3c85c5ae96f3418113874e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eef840b268d15ab3c85c5ae96f3418113874e67/0_122_3649_2190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:04:20.177Z\">at 1.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57eba45fe4b01b56deffc325\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T11:13:09.600Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In here speech during the home affairs debate <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, said that France and Britain should agree to each take half of the 1,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Calais.

Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learnt.</p> <p><strong>1 \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s re-election has strengthened his position in the party \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t decisively altered the balance of power.</strong> Normally the moment after an election victory is when a leader is constrained the least. But for Corbyn there is no one left to sack, any frontbench promotions will be determined by who offers to serve, not who Corbyn picks, and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-expected-to-lose-majority-support-of-labour-nec\">as the struggle over the national executive rule changes showed,</a> Corbyn cannot depend on getting Labour\u2019s key decision-making body to do what he wants. Significantly, within two days of his re-election, Corbyn effectively conceded that,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/jeremy-corbyn-puts-aside-objections-to-renewing-trident\"> for now, at least, he is giving up trying to change party policy on Trident. </a>This is a significant retreat on an issue on which Corbyn has campaigned all his life.<br></p> <p><strong>2 \u2013 Labour now feels like two parties that don\u2019t even like each other anymore but that cannot afford to get divorced. </strong>There has been no serious talk at all about a split, because the mechanics of the electoral system make that suicidal and both sides are emotionally attached to the Labour brand, but there is a vast gulf between the two camps, pro-Corbyn and anti-Corbyn. Superficially the divide is about policy, but much more it is about whether people are prepared to make an emotional investment in Corbyn\u2019s purist, poll-defying idealism. Labour has become a coalition and, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OwenJones84/a-strategy-for-jeremy-corbyns-leadership-to-succeed-9ffe4c27149b#.1hw5xd6ia\">as Owen Jones suggested in a recent essay</a>, one way forward might be a proper coalition agreement. And perhaps a quad, with Corbyn, John McDonnell, Tom Watson and Hilary Benn? They could ask David Cameron and Nick Clegg for some advice.</p> <p><strong>3 \u2013 Corbyn has made little progress over the last year in fleshing out a policy platform.</strong> The Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, who resigned from the shadow cabinet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/21/kerry-mccarthy-im-angry-some-people-dont-care-about-being-in-power-bristol-labour-corbyn\">told the Guardian recently</a> that she had never seen Corbyn \u201cmove beyond things you could fit on a T-shirt\u201d in his policy thinking and this conference seems to bear that out. A year ago, after his surprise election as leader, Corbyn could be forgiven for only having an outline view as to what he would do. This year he has barely moved on and conference has been relatively policy-lite. McDonnell did give a speech with a speech with a clear set of economic proposals but almost none of them have been worked up in any detail and his headline announcement (a \u00a310 minimum wage) was something he promised last year. Corbyn is also proposing a \u00a3500bn investment plan but the party has released no detail about this and at the moment the plan seems to amount to nothing more than a figure on a press release. On economic policy, and even more so in other areas like education and welfare, there is little evidence that the party has started taking difficult choices, or started engaging seriously with outside bodies on legislative proposals.<br></p> <p><strong>4 \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s critics are not united. </strong>At the time of the \u201ccoup\u201d shadow ministers announced their resignations on an hour by hour basis in a move that was clearly coordinated. But since Corbyn\u2019s re-election on Saturday there has been no agreed, group response from the MPs who left the front bench in the hope of forcing him out. A few have said publicly that they would be willing to go back, a few more may have been speaking to Corbyn privately, and Corbyn seems confident to have enough names to be able to announce a reshuffle next week. Another group may be willing to go back, but want to delay so that they can use the offer of going back as a bargaining tool to try to Corbyn to accept some form of shadow cabinet elections. A third group seem determined to remain on the back benches for good.</p> <p><strong>5 \u2013 Corbyn is probably safe at least until 2018.</strong> There is now a general recognition on the part of Corbyn\u2019s critics that this summer\u2019s leadership challenge achieved nothing and speculation about another leadership contest next year seems to have vanished. At the very least Corbyn should be safe until 2018, although there is also a widespread view that he will be able to remain leader until the general election if he wants to. After the EU referendum the prospect of an early election was used by MPs as an argument for challenging Corbyn immediately. But, now that he has won, it is Corbyn who is exploiting the \u201cearly election\u201d threat and he is citing it as a reason why MPs should back him.</p> <p><strong>6 \u2013 Labour is split over how to interpret the Brexit vote. </strong>Many MPs believe that immigration was a key factor and increasingly there are calls for the party to abandon its commitment to the free movement of labour. But Corbyn sees the Brexit vote as primarily a vote against the economic status quo and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/corbyn-defence-of-immigration-splits-shadow-cabinet-labour\">as he confirmed this morning, </a>he is opposed to immigration controls. Interestingly, this is one issue where Labour\u2019s old right, which is sceptical about immigration, disagrees with the pro-free movement Blairite right. On this topic Corbyn is a Blairite.</p> <p><strong>7 - Labour\u2019s leaders outside Westminster are more important to the party than ever.</strong> Devolution and the creation of elected mayors have created a new powerbase within British politics and Corbyn\u2019s opponents see it as offering the party a lifeline. Sadiq Khan openly paraded his credentials as an alternative leader this week. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, is being encouraged to develop a UK profile so that he can show English voters what a pragmatic Labour government can achieve. Mayoral elections next May should see other Labour figures taking executive office and in his speech yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson-says-party-must-prepare-for-fourth-industrial-revolution?page=with:block-57ea9feae4b08ca277ca0c82#block-57ea9feae4b08ca277ca0c82\">Tom Watson said these figures, and Labour councillors, would be the ones who led Labour back to power.</a> Not Corbyn, he implied.</p> <p><strong>8 - In person Labour members are much more civil to each other than anyone would guess from reading the papers.</strong> In the run-up to conference some people were predicting 1980s-style fights and blood on the floor, and <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/labour-mp-ruth-smeeth-to-take-24hour-minder-to-party-conference-after-flood-of-threats-a3350021.html\">one MP even said she was coming to the conference with a minder. </a>In practice it has been very peaceful. The level of heckling is not much worse than at an average conference, there have barely been any raised voices and the only punch thrown occurred when Clive Lewis (reportedly) hit a wall because he was angry with Corbyn\u2019s office interfering with his speech. That is not to say that the social media abuse has not been real. But Twitter is a real world, not <em>the</em> real world, and in realspace, if not cyberspace, Labour members seem to get on.</p> <p><strong>9 - Momentum is not Militant, and they can run a lively, successful conference. </strong>One of the highlights of Liverpool has been Momentum\u2019s The World Transformed alternative conference (or festival, as they prefer to call it) taking place about half a mile away. Anyone turning up expecting a Militant re-enactment will have been disappointed. Outside there were older, hard-core lefties selling \u201cdeselect your MP\u201d literature. But as journalists like Andrew Grice <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-momentum-world-transformed-critics-will-not-like-it-a7331036.html\">(here)</a> and Paul Mason<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/the-real-lesson-from-corbyns-victory-you-cant-hold-back-history\"> (here) </a>report, inside it was full of young, earnest, welcoming activists seemingly with no interest in becoming the next Derek Hatton. In the long run it is till not clear what impact Momentum will have on Labour, but this week its reputation has gone up.</p> <p><strong>10 - Corbyn has no obvious successor.</strong> Most parties normally have an unofficial leader-in-waiting. Often they never get the job (Yvette Cooper filled this role for Labour for much of the last parliament), but nevertheless the ULIW carries some clout. At Liverpool the position is vacant. Clive Lewis\u2019s standing as a potential, Corbyn-lite alternative leader is on the rise (for reasons Stephen Bush explains <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/09/what-will-labours-new-awkward-squad-do-next\">here),</a> and some Corbyn-sceptics, like Chuka Umunna and Lisa Nandy, have been prominent on the fringe.

It hasn\u2019t received much attention, but potentially it is significant. </p> <p>Delegates were voting on a package of changes to Labour party, the most important of which was one to give Scotland and Wales a seat each on the NEC. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-expected-to-lose-majority-support-of-labour-nec\">As Jessica Elgot reports,</a> that resulted in Jeremy Corbyn losing his majority on the NEC. Labour has published the exact voting figures this morning and the motion was carried by 80% to 20%. Only 8% of union votes were against, but 32% of constituency Labour party (CLP) delegates were.</p> <p>But the conference also voted on various alternative changes proposed by CLPs.

  "<p>Judges who are elected to state supreme courts are generally less supportive of LGBT rights claims than judges who are appointed, according to new research commissioned by a nonprofit law group.</p> <p>A report released on Wednesday analyzed 127 rulings in state high courts involving LGBT rights claims to understand the impact of judicial selection processes on such cases. The study, produced by Lambda Legal, found that judges chosen through partisan elections are least supportive of LGBT rights claims compared to their peers around the country who are selected through other methods. Lambda Legal is a non-profit that advocates for the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and those with HIV through litigation and other work.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to get a fair hearing in court you need to make sure that judges are free to make decisions, that they have the independence to rule on the law without fear of retaliation,\u201d said Eric Lesh, the report\u2019s author. \u201cHow does the way that judges are selected play or factor into the way that they are able to decide cases fairly in LGBT rights claims?\u201d</p> <p>The six state courts with partisan elections issued a pro-LGBT ruling in 53% of relevant cases, according to Lambda Legal\u2019s findings.</p> <p>State supreme courts, generally the final word on questions of state law, are filled through various means across the country. Both initial selection and retention of justices can be achieved through elections or appointment by governors or legislatures, depending on the state. The amount of money funding judicial campaigns has drawn increasing scrutiny in the past six years, with advocates for campaign finance reform concerned that justices meant to impartially rule on legal questions might be swayed by influential donors, a party platform, or an opinion popular with voters.</p> <p>Anthony Kreis, the lead researcher who analyzed the data, explained that the data set included the 127 state high court cases involving LGBT claims from 2003 through 2015. The data set started with cases that came after the supreme court ruling in Lawrence v Texas, which struck down the sodomy law in Texas, and only included cases decided on merit. Of the those 127 cases, each ruling was coded as either pro-LGBT or anti-LGBT. Most cases examined were challenges to state statutes that barred recognition of same-sex couples and questions on family law such as adoptions, according to the report.</p> <p>Kreis, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, noted that there were \u201cconflating factors\u201d to consider in evaluating states\u2019 high court rulings. For example, a state such as Massachusetts has justices appointed to lifetime tenures by the governor, but its court\u2019s decisions could also be impacted by the more liberal ideology of the state.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say it\u2019s absolutely because of [the judicial selection process] and not because of the ideological background\u201d of the state, Kreis said. </p> <p>Although the main variables examined were the method through which the state chose its judges, the researchers also factored in the high court\u2019s ideology and the political context of the state. According to the report, it \u201cis plausible that certain selection systems encourage judges to behave more ideologically than others cases dealing with LGBT rights\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cJudges who are in partisan election systems are polarized,\u201d Kreis said. \u201cJudges in liberal jurisdictions where they\u2019re \u2018partisanly\u2019 elected are much more in favor of LGBT rights in their decision making process. Conservative judges have the opposite effect; they\u2019re much more opposed. This suggests that the selection process matters.\u201d</p> <p>The report also highlighted some notably anti-LGBT justices throughout the US, such as Roy Moore, who was suspended from the Alabama high court for his opposition to marriage equality. Moore\u2019s trial to decide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/alabama-chief-justice-roy-moore-trial-campaign-for-governor\">whether he can keep his seat</a> began Wednesday.<br></p> <p>Jefferson Hughes, a justice on Louisiana\u2019s supreme court, was elected in 2012 after <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/news/baton-rouge/index.ssf/2012/12/republican_jeff_hughes_claims.html\">running campaign ads</a> describing himself as pro-life, pro-gun and pro-traditional marriage.

Louisiana and Alabama are two of the six states that select their high court justices through partisan elections.</p> <p>The report also examined the lack of diversity among state high court justices. According to Lambda Legal, 10 justices of the 340 on state high courts identify as openly gay or lesbian. Lambda Legal could find no openly HIV-positive or bisexual judges, and just two openly transgender judges. California is the only state that collects data on sexual orientation and gender identity of state judges.</p>",
  "<p>Junior doctors have lost a judicial review challenging the legality of a controversial new contract, which is now set to be introduced  next week.</p> <p>In a judgment published on Wednesday, Mr Justice Green rejected arguments presented at the high court by five junior doctors that the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had exceeded his powers.</p> <p>The decision means that the long-running impasse over the contract remains. The junior doctors, who formed the group <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.justiceforhealth.co.uk/\">Justice for Health</a>, claimed Green\u2019s finding that Hunt was not imposing the contract, but merely encouraging employers to introduce it, was a victory for them. </p> <p>Their interpretation was that it meant medics were free not to sign it and opened the door to negotiations with the NHS nationally or at trust level, although such a prospect appears unlikely.</p> <p>Amar Mashru, one of the five who brought the case, said: \u201cWhat is now allowed is the employers and employees at a national level to negotiate and agree terms which are genuinely in the interests of patients and staff. They are essentially free from the shackles of this irrational and hasty timeline set by the secretary of state.\u201d </p> <p>He said it was possible that trusts would retain the existing contract until new terms and conditions satisfactory to both sides were agreed.</p> <p>Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said: \u201cJunior doctors have raised a number of legitimate concerns that still need to be addressed and NHS trusts will be working hard with their junior doctors to do so. In particular, those issues that are within the remit of the contract \u2013 for example the introduction of a new guardian role to each trust \u2013 need to be implemented consistently.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAs for suggestions that individual trusts have a choice as to whether to introduce the new contract or not, NHS trusts tell us that they believe a single national contract offers a consistent approach that is in the best interests of patients and the wider NHS workforce. This is also the view of the NHS arm\u2019s-length bodies.\u201d</p> <p>The doctors had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/19/jeremy-hunt-acted-illegally-junior-doctors-contract-court-hears\">argued that the health secretary had no power</a>, whether solely or with others, to impose terms on which junior doctors were employed, only to make recommendations; that Hunt had acted in breach of the requirements of transparency, certainty and clarity; and that he had acted irrationally.</p> <p>But Green rejected all three grounds. And he further said that he did not accept the claimants\u2019 argument that the evidence base upon which the minister acted was inadequate and rejected the suggestion that Hunt had misled parliament.</p> <p>Dr Ellen McCourt, BMA junior doctor committee chair, said the concerns of junior doctors still needed to be addressed before the contract comes into effect.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s result should not be viewed as a win for the government,\u201d she said. \u201cThis ruling will do nothing to address the fact that morale among junior doctors is at an all-time low. Nor will it quell junior doctors\u2019 concerns about the imminent introduction of a flawed contract they have rejected, or the deep sense of anger and mistrust that has built up towards the government over the last year.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Health urged the BMA to drop the threat of industrial action in light of the ruling. \u201cWe welcome this clear decision by the judge that the secretary of state acted entirely lawfully,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe must now move on from this dispute to the crucial job of making sure patients get the same high standards of urgent and emergency care every day of the week, which involves more than the junior doctors\u2019 contract.\u201d</p> <p>Green heard that lawyers representing Hunt had run up bills of around \u00a3150,000 and said that Justice for Health should pay \u00a355,000 of that figure. </p> <p>In a two-day hearing last week at the royal courts of justice in London, Jenni Richards QC, for Justice for Health, asked the court to quash Hunt\u2019s decision to bring in the new contract, which she maintained he had no power to do, especially since the Health and Social Care Act 2012 reduced the scope of the health secretary\u2019s powers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b36dab313db0997d6ce63b82651c6d705e93069\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b36dab313db0997d6ce63b82651c6d705e93069/0_25_3121_1873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is now set to introduce the new contract next week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Clive Sheldon QC, appearing for Hunt, rejected the doctors\u2019 arguments and said their case was without substance. The health secretary had not decided to \u201ccompel\u201d NHS trusts to use the new contract, he had merely approved it, Sheldon said. </p> <p>\u201cThe secretary of state has not gone outside the scope of his powers,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThe secretary of state has been clear about what his powers are.\u201d <br></p> <p>The five doctors\u2019 high court legal challenge was crowdfunded by \u00a3300,000 from about 10,000 donors, most of them fellow junior doctors. </p> <p>Many, frustrated that eight days of strike action between January and May had failed to force Hunt to lift his threat of imposition, hoped that the lawsuit might delay or even scupper Hunt\u2019s plans. </p> <p>The BMA is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/bma-facing-backlash-from-members-over-handling-of-contract-dispute\">facing a backlash from its members</a> after first announcing, and then last Saturday calling off, plans for a series of four all-out strikes by junior doctors as a way of increasing the pressure on Hunt. </p> <p>As things stand, NHS trusts across England will start phasing in the contract from next week in a process that will take about 18 months to put all 54,000 doctors below the level of consultant on to the altered terms and conditions.<br></p> <p>This week Sir David Nicholson, who was the chief executive of the NHS in England until 2014, criticised ministers\u2019 handling of the year long dispute. </p> <p>\u201cClearly the government overall got it wrong,\u201d Nicholson said. He said given that today\u2019s generation of junior doctors wanted to work more flexibly and have more control over their lives, \u201cit seemed to me that the way the conversation was going \u2026 I was really worried that it was less to do with the issues around that particular problem and more to do with a general idea that somehow we needed to put the junior doctors in their place.\u201d</p>",

They may have no indoor plumbing, but they do have a tremendous amount of creativity and humor. Nabwala IGG\u2019s movies (and he has made over thirty) are shot on cheap video with horrendous special effects. What makes them so watchable is the glee with which the actors tackle the role, and the running Greek chorus commentary track. While the movie does have dialogue, there is a voice of God explaining and commenting on everything he sees with impeccable comic timing. (This has an interesting origin: when films first came to Uganda they were not dubbed, so when they were projected in video clubs, someone would talk over them to explain the scenes, even if he really didn\u2019t know what was going on himself. That tradition has stuck, even as Uganda begins to make its own movies.) When a visiting white doctor turns into a killing machine and starts shooting up the place, our narrator cracks: \u201cThis doctor needs borders!\u201d It got a bigger reaction than Shyamalan\u2019s twist ending to Split.</p> <p>IGG made sure to include special messages for the Austin screening of Bad Black, making this no-budget film with a paper-thin story the most unexpectedly touching thing I saw at the whole festival. An early look at Hollywood movies while guzzling beer at parties is one thing, but an invitation to experience something direct from another culture is what I call truly fantastic.</p>",
  "<p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian hardliner who presided over a period of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\">deepening and damaging sanctions</a>, has been blocked from running for president in Iran\u2019s elections next year. <br></p> <p>The former president\u2019s hopes were dashed after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, indicated in public that he did not see the prospect of his candidacy as being in the interests of the country. <br></p> <p>In a letter published on Tuesday, Ahmadinejad announced he would not be running, submitting to the wishes of the 77-year-old ayatollah. <br></p> <p>It comes after months of speculation that Ahmadinejad had been building up a campaign to confront the current president, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani, in next year\u2019s vote. Rouhani has to seek re-election if he wants to remain in power for another four years. Under Iranian law, presidents are only allowed two consecutive terms.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the semi-official Fars news agency reported that the supreme leader had explicitly told Ahmadinejad he should not run. Later, two conservative politicians confirmed those reports.</p> <p>On Monday, Khamenei\u2019s official website, in an apparent move to put his opinion on the record, published the transcription of his speech during a meeting with a group of his followers. </p> <p>\u201cSomeone came to see me and considering his own interests and the interests of the country, I told him he should not participate in that matter [elections],\u201d Khamenei is quoted as saying. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him not to participate, I told him I won\u2019t recommend him participating.\u201d</p> <p>In his letter on Tuesday, which was addressed to Khamenei, Ahmadinejad revealed he had a meeting with the leader at the end of last month, during which he was told not to run. </p> <p>\u201cYou recommended that it was not in [my] interests to run in the elections and I stated my obedience,\u201d he wrote. <br></p> <p>In theory, Ahmadinejad can still put his name on the list as a nominee and the supreme leader does not have the automatic power to block him. In practice, however, the ayatollah has the ultimate power in all state matters. </p> <p>The Guardian Council, a body of jurists and clerics who are close to Khamenei, vets all candidates before any elections in Iran, in a process that has been the subject of much controversy. There has been a heated debate over whether the Guardian Council has the constitutional footing to block candidates but in recent years, it has blocked many reformists and independents, as well as conservatives, from running in parliamentary and presidential elections. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e96ac69e166e52fc1177b9018ac39be58bf27cb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e96ac69e166e52fc1177b9018ac39be58bf27cb1/0_80_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, indicated he did not see the prospect of Ahmadinejad\u2019s candidacy as being in the interests of the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/18/life-iranians-nuclear-deal\">After the nuclear deal, the west should not disappoint Iranians for the third time | Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the vetting process, which has raised questions about the fairness of Iranian elections, turnouts are usually high in presidential elections.

An Afghan family of about eight only had three chairs, but they cooked me the most amazing biryani.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d113b8123650180a481e0dd97a49454cfbc5918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d113b8123650180a481e0dd97a49454cfbc5918/0_5_1501_996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken doner \u2026 Areed and Najima.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicken doner \u2026 Areed and Najima.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liz Hingley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Popa family\u2019s front room is a pink palace lavished with silk flowers \u2013 like Smethwick High Street brought indoors. The walls are heavy with icons looking down, while the youngest family member, a baby on the verge of walking, instead gazes up adoringly towards her doting grandmother. The family discusses the fact that Romanian ingredients are hard to come by in Smethwick but agree that Asda flour is decent enough, and cheap \u2013 no small matter when they get through six or seven homemade <em>lipie</em>, shallow Romanian loaves, with every meal. Some of their neighbours have more unusual requirements, like the family whose favourite dish calls for the African caterpillars known as <a href=\"http://goafrica.about.com/od/botswana/ss/Mopane-Worm.htm\">mopane worms</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s a shop in Smethwick where you can buy worms,\u201d they told Hingley, \u201cbut they don\u2019t come in often and Zimbabweans buy them up quickly.\u201d<br></p> <p>Iconography comes in all shapes, sizes and types. Propped up behind the settee in the Joneses\u2019s front room is a vast screenprint of Al Pacino as Scarface\u2019s dissolute Tony Montana, while a portrait of a hat-tipping, moonwalking Michael Jackson adorns the bright yellow walls of Debbie Farebrother\u2019s house. Farebrother\u2019s 30 years in Australia \u2013 she was born in Smethwick and returned in adulthood \u2013 seem to permeate the room: it feels as though the sun would shine in it day and night, regardless of the weather outside.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4eb768c353f4ec06406e4fceb32655a89124748\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4eb768c353f4ec06406e4fceb32655a89124748/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lipi Romanian bread\u2026 Mariana Popa with some of her relatives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lipi Romanian bread \u2026 Mariana Popa with some of her relatives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liz Hingley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hingley\u2019s homes are centred utterly on family, in a sense that encompasses both blood relations and trusted friends. The front rooms in these photographs are far too ungroomed and unselfconscious to pay host to mere acquaintances. She catches children daydreaming, chatting, wriggling alongside siblings, cousins and elders; or, in the case of Marcus and Jamie Leigh Jones, staring grumpily over the top of one those gimmicky \u201cbespoke\u201d Coke bottles. Theirs is labelled \u201cMum\u201d.<br></p> <p>Most of the rooms have sofas you can settle into and be absorbed by. Bums shift to make room for another relative or someone who\u2019s unwell but doesn\u2019t want to be consigned to the bedroom, away from life. That seems familiar. When I was growing up, not a million miles from Smethwick, our own sofa, positioned what felt like inches from the TV, was the seat of daily life: breakfast, dinner and tea were eaten off trays on our knees from Monday to Saturday, making Sundays at the table feel even more formal and, perhaps for that reason, more tense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"810fbb6b9bc82ae28f5c8143b31ef1ea3336d173\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/810fbb6b9bc82ae28f5c8143b31ef1ea3336d173/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beans on toast with grated cheese\u2026 Marcus, Gillian and Jamie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beans on toast with grated cheese \u2026 Marcus, Gillian and Jamie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liz Hingley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few of Hingley\u2019s homes are striking for their lack of furniture. New arrivals have to sit on the floor \u2013 that\u2019s why, Hingley says, so many of the people she meets focus on food and cooking as a way of making a home. <br></p> <p>Nevertheless, for all the families, home is a place of refuge, somewhere that comfort can be found, or made. You understand from these photos the central importance of comforting smells, the sound of sizzling pans in the background while you make yourself comfy in the front room, familiar voices squeezing into small spaces.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/britains-most-racist-election-smethwick-50-years-on\">In 1964 Smethwick became notorious</a> for the vile racist campaign that saw Tory candidate Peter Griffiths elected as its MP. (The following year, Malcolm X visited the area on the invitation of local anti-racist campaigners.)

  "<p>Ukraine is looking at introducing a new law that would see all books imported from Russia checked for \u201canti-Ukrainian\u201d content, and banned if they include it.</p> <p>The draft law, which proposes \u201cto restrict access to the Ukrainian market of foreign printed material with anti-Ukrainian content\u201d, was adopted earlier this month by Ukraine\u2019s cabinet of ministers, <a href=\"http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1473534559\">the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group reported</a>.</p> <p>The bill proposes that books would be assessed by an \u201cexpert council\u201d for \u201cpopularisation or propaganda of bodies of an aggressor state and their particular actions which create a positive image of the employees of the aggressor state, employees of Soviet state security bodies, justify or declare as legitimate occupation of Ukrainian territory\u201d, according to the human rights group. Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister Vyacheslav Kyrylenko has spoken of his confidence that the law will be passed by the end of the year.</p> <p>It follows the Ukrainian State Television and Radio Committee\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33863697\">ban in 2015 of 38 books published in Russia</a>, aimed at \u201csafeguarding Ukrainian citizens against the use of information warfare and disinformation methods, against the spread of hate ideology, fascism, xenophobia and separatism\u201d.</p> <p>In her report about the new law, Halya Coynash from the Kharkiv human rights group said that \u201cmeasures are undoubtedly needed to counter the lies told, especially in areas within or close to territory under Russian occupation or Kremlin-backed militant control\u201d, but added that \u201cit is not clear that this law, nor previous legislative initiatives achieve that aim, while being guaranteed to elicit accusations that Ukraine is introducing censorship\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAny ban needs to be seen in context. I do think it\u2019s a bad move, and ultimately rather meaningless. But the lies and propaganda coming from Russia, particularly since Euromaidan and its invasion of Crimea, have been toxic and overwhelming,\u201d Coynash told the Guardian.</p> <p>While she welcomed the fact the bill is specifically about Russia \u2013 \u201cit does not cover books published, for example, in the UK, which criticise Ukraine, nor does it apply to books published in Ukraine, with the exception of Russian-occupied Crimea\u201d \u2013 she questioned its reach, given that it covers only printed matter, and the \u201cwoolliness\u201d of its language.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/23/ukraine-crimea-what-putin-thinking-russia\">Ukraine and Crimea: what is Putin thinking?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere does, however, seem a valid aim, namely to combat a situation where a country waging covert war against Ukraine is also quite legally selling books in which the ideologues and fighters in that war present their distorted explanation of why Ukraine either doesn\u2019t exist or has no right to,\u201d she said, citing writing by Alexander Dugin, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a87747de-a713-11e4-b6bd-00144feab7de\">who called for a \u201cgenocide\u201d of Ukrainians in 2014</a> and Putin\u2019s adviser Sergei Glazyev, as cause for concern.</p> <p></p> <p>Coynash warned that while the bill specifically targets those mass-importing books for sale \u2013 individuals still able to bring up to 10 copies into Ukraine without restrictions \u2013 it is likely to be met with accusations of censorship. \u201cBanning a few offensive books seems rather more symbolic, in my opinion, and possibly counterproductive \u2013 [bringing] cries of censorship balanced against extremely modest results,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether or not it works the aim has nothing to do with censorship.\u201d</p> <p>British Ukrainian translator Steve Komarnyckyj, meanwhile, believes the ban is likely to be unworkable.</p> <p>\u201cI believe there is a case for banning deliberately misleading material which can be shown to be factually incorrect,\u201d he said, referring to news stories that relied on fake data, such as the story that <a href=\"http://russia-insider.com/en/why-mh17-was-most-likely-shot-down-ukrainian-su-25-jet/ri9362\">ran in Russian media</a> saying a civilian plane was brought down by a Ukrainian aircraft, when investigations have since been proved it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/flight-mh17-shot-down-by-missile-brought-in-from-russia-ukraine-malaysia-airlines\">destroyed by a Buk missile brought in from Russia</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/27/dystopian-ukraine-novel-written-on-facebook-during-protests-gets-english-translation\">Dystopian Ukraine novel, written on Facebook during protests, gets English translation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Komarnyckyj, who recently translated into English Oleh Shynkarenko\u2019s novel Kaharlyk, which was written on Facebook during the Maidan protests, said he believes such a ban would be \u201copen to corruption and ineffective\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMost Ukrainian and Russian books are available on the internet (there is a huge piracy problem) so a ban is probably unworkable. What Ukraine should do is expose media fakes and expose the lamentable work of authors such as Dugin and expose Putin\u2019s methods and agenda.

In 2010 just 11% of homeless acceptances in England were caused by the end of an AST.</p> <p>The government\u2019s statistical release states: \u201cAffordability [of housing] is an increasingly significant issue, as more households facing the end of a private tenancy are unable to find an alternative without assistance.\u201d</p> <p>Bob Blackman, a Tory backbencher who has drawn up a <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/homelessnessreduction.html\">private member\u2019s bill</a> seeking to require councils to do more to help households at risk of losing their homes, said: \u201cIt is a national disgrace when we have the highest number of people in employment ever, we have a low rate of unemployment, that we still have people sleeping rough. Goodness knows what will happen if there is a recession.\u201d</p> <p>He said the government was \u201cvery sympathetic\u201d towards his bill, which will have its second reading in the Commons at the end of October, and he was negotiating with ministers to get proper support. \u201cI think it sits with Theresa May\u2019s social agenda so that everyone benefits from the economic situation of the country, which is very positive,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>The quarterly statistics also reveal a sharp rise in the number of homeless households with children who had been unlawfully resident in unsuitable temporary bed and breakfast accommodation for longer than six weeks.</p> <p>Although councils are required to ensure families do not stay in B&amp;B accommodation for longer than 42 days, 1,140 households found themselves in this position in the three months to June, up 29% on the same period in 2015 and the highest recorded number since 2003.</p> <p>Outer London boroughs in London such as Croydon (169), Redbridge (132) and Harrow (120) recorded the highest number of households in breach of the six-week limit, and there are signs the phenomenon is spreading beyond the capital, to places such as Luton (87), Reading (65) and Peterborough (30).<br></p> <p>Local authorities have blamed use of B&amp;Bs on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2013/jan/04/homelessness-growing-bed-and-breakfast-crisis-croydon-housing\">chronic shortages of affordable suitable temporary housing</a> in their areas, a shortage caused in part by government cuts to housing benefit levels.<br></p> <p>The figures show that 73,120 households were in temporary accommodation, up 9% on a year earlier, and nearly three-quarters (52,820) were in London.</p> <p>The homelessness charity Crisis called on MPs to support Blackman\u2019s bill, which has cross-party support. Its chief executive, Jon Sparkes, said: \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough to help people at crisis point. We need to prevent them from losing their home in the first place.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWe need a change in the law to prevent more people from losing their home and to make sure all homeless people can get the help they need, while councils need the funding to make this work. Prevention has already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/welsh-law-early-support-prevents-homelessness-crisis\">shown to work in Wales</a>, where it has dramatically reduced the need for people to be rehoused.\u201d <br></p> <p>Martin Tett, the housing spokesman for the Local Government Association, said: \u201cCouncils want to help everyone at risk of homelessness and support those who are homeless into accommodation as soon as possible. Faced with significant cuts to their budgets, falling social housing availability and welfare reforms, it is clear councils cannot tackle this challenge alone.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell Robb, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said: \u201cThese figures are a heartbreaking reminder of the devastating impact our drastic shortage of affordable homes is having. Every day at Shelter we hear from families struggling to keep their heads above water when faced with the double blow of welfare cuts and expensive, unstable private renting, with far too many ultimately losing the battle to stay in their home.\u201d</p> <p>A DCLG spokesman said: \u201cThis government is committed to supporting the most vulnerable in our society and ensuring our country works for everyone, not just the privileged few.</p> <p>\u201cStatutory homelessness remains less than half the 2003-04 peak and we are investing over \u00a3500m to both tackle homelessness and prevent it happening in the first place.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Pangolins, the world\u2019s most illegally trafficked mammal, were thrown a lifeline at a global wildlife summit on Wednesday with a total trade ban in all species. </p> <p>More than a million wild pangolins have been killed in the last decade, to feed the huge and rising appetite in China and Vietnam for its meat and its scales, a supposed medicine. The unique scaly anteaters are fast heading for extinction in Asia and poachers are now plundering Africa. </p> <p>But the 182 nations of the <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng\">Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) unanimously agreed a total ban on international trade on all species at the summit in Johannesburg, prompting cheers and applause from delegates. </p> <p>Cites works to crack down on wildlife trafficking, currently a $20bn-a-year criminal enterprise, and to ensure the legal trade in food, skins, pets and traditional remedies does not threaten the survival of species. The summit also boosted protection for the barbary ape on Wednesday, Europe\u2019s only wild primate, and a spectacular-horned mountain goat.</p> <p>The four Asian species of pangolin \u2013 Indian, Philippine, Sunda and Chinese - have been decimated by illegal poaching. The animals breed slowly and are easy to catch \u2013 they simply roll up when threatened. \u201cIt is an effective strategy against a hungry lion, but a disadvantage when approached by a human collector,\u201d said Nigeria\u2019s delegate, who added that the price of pangolin scales has risen tenfold in last five years.</p> <p>The rampant scale of the black market has been revealed by frequent huge seizures: Indonesian authorities confiscated and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/picture/2015/apr/30/thousands-of-frozen-pangolins-lie-in-a-pit-in-indonesia\">burned thousands of frozen pangolins</a> in 2015, while a Chinese ship which ran aground in the Philippines in 2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/15/chinese-vessel-philippine-reef-illegal-pangolin-meat\">carrying 10 tonnes of pangolin</a>. But traffickers have increasingly targeted the four African species: giant, South African, long-tailed and white-bellied. In June, more than 11 tonnes of pangolin scales were seized in Hong Kong in just two shipments from Africa.</p> <p>Vietnam\u2019s delegate said the upgrading of pangolins to Cites appendix 1 on Wednesday \u2013 the strictest protection possible \u2013 was critical for the survival of the Sunda and Chinese pangolins in particular, which are critically endangered. The move will pressure affected nations into tougher law enforcement and higher penalties for criminals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca767de98bdbe90cbd51dab496f9f7ff75934fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca767de98bdbe90cbd51dab496f9f7ff75934fd6/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen pangolins lie in a pit before being burned after a seizure in Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frozen pangolins lie in a pit before being burned after a seizure in Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/WCS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indonesia was the only nation to oppose the new protection for Sunda and Chinese pangolins, while China abstained, noting that pangolins are also caught for bushmeat in many countries and that habitat loss is also a factor. Laos supported the Asian pangolin proposals, but the Guardian revealed on Tuesday how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/27/revealed-how-senior-laos-officials-cut-deals-with-animal-traffickers\">senior Laos officials have cut deals with wildlife traffickers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a huge win and rare piece of good news for some of the world\u2019s most trafficked and endangered animals,\u201d said Ginette Hemley, head of the WWF delegation to Cites. \u201cThis eliminates any question about legality of trade, making it harder for criminals to traffic them and increasing the consequences for those who do.\u201d She said efforts to reduce the demand in China and Vietnam were vital too.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision will help give pangolins a fighting chance,\u201d said Dr Susan Lieberman, at the Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThe world is standing up for the little guy with this pivotal decision. These species need extra protection and now they will get it.\u201d</p> <p>Like pangolins, the protection for the endangered <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12561/0\">barbary ape</a> \u2013 the only wild primate in Europe \u2013 was increased to the highest level. The population of the ape, found in Gibraltar, Morocco and Algeria, has at least halved in the last 30 years, to as few as 6,500.</p> <p>Many barbary apes, mostly infants, are illegally captured each year, largely for the European exotic pet trade and to be used as props for tourist photos. Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, MEP and head of the European parliament delegation to Cites, said: \u201cThis is a key next step in protecting a species for which the EU is unfortunately a key destination market.\u201d </p> <p>Some of the Cites decisions on Wednesday removed existing protection from species where conservation efforts have been successful. South Africa won unanimous support for the removal of the strictest protection from the Cape mountain Zebra. Its population is now growing at 9% a year, with 4,800 living in the country. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6977cd6f15359f9014384ed2225aef8954fbfe0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6977cd6f15359f9014384ed2225aef8954fbfe0a/0_0_3631_2421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The protection for the endangered barbary ape - the only wild primate in Europe - was increased to the highest level.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The protection for the endangered barbary ape - the only wild primate in Europe - was increased to the highest level.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruno D'Amicis/NPL/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is one of the success stories of large mammals in South Africa\u201d said South Africa\u2019s environment minister, Edna Molewa. \u201cIt is no longer at risk of extinction.\u201d The looser protection will allow more trophy hunting, which South Africa says provides incentives for conservation efforts on private land.</p> <p>The wood bison, one of the two subspecies of American bison, was completely removed from the Cites protective list on Wednesday, as its population has grown to 9,000 and is not threatened by poaching. There are about 500,000 American bison in total, far fewer than the 20 million or more that once roamed the continent.</p> <p>Also on Wednesday, Georgia and the EU gained some protection for the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3794/0\">western tur</a>, a mountain goat with spectacular horns found only in the Caucasus mountains. The population of the goat, hunted as trophies, has fallen from 12,000 to 4,000 in Georgia in the last 30 years.

Agents play an important role in the business of the game and we want to ensure that players and clubs get the best possible service within an agreed set of rules and regulations which apply to all stakeholders.</p> <p>\u201cWe are totally committed to helping any investigation into the various allegations and to continue to work with the relevant football authorities, led by The FA, to further explore what steps can be taken in English football to put in place an effective system of licensing and codes of conduct for agents.</p> <p>\u201cThe global move to deregulation has not worked and it has allowed the system to be more open to manipulation and abuse. The time has come for the key stakeholders in this country to genuinely come together to establish a new framework for the future and we would be happy to progress those discussions with immediate effect.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, changes to the current set-up should also be enforceable globally and this must involve UEFA and FIFA to help spread best practice around the world and re-introduce a system of licensing and regulation which works and is meaningful. We can make a positive start here to promote a better approach across the game.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebd4b6e4b049b74e4caf95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T14:35:25.716Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Quiz!

York crown court heard the resident had not been given any hot food or drink as she spent her last day asleep in her room.</p> <p>The hospital discharge papers for Barritt, who had dementia, stated that she needed to be kept warm at her care home facility. She died of hypothermia despite two nurses checking on her about 10 times on the day of her death.</p> <p>The care home was fined on Wednesday for allowing what the judge described as an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d.</p> <p>Following the decision, Barritt\u2019s family said in a statement: \u201cThe last four years have been very hard for the family, coming to terms with the tragic circumstances of Mum\u2019s death from hypothermia.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to believe an elderly lady with dementia could be treated in such an appalling way in a care home that claimed to specialise in care for vulnerable people.</p> <p>\u201cA fine, no matter how large, could never replace a loved one: what price can you put on your mother\u2019s life?\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at the court on Wednesday, Judge Paul Batty QC said there were \u201csystematic, systemic failures\u201d at the care home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a7bb072896aae2a256d08d58fc470f809504258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7bb072896aae2a256d08d58fc470f809504258/267_0_3798_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"York crown court\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At York crown court, Judge Paul Batty QC blamed a failure to revise Annie Barritt\u2019s care plan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said that when Barritt was brought into hospital \u201cher body temperature was at a level barely compatible with human life\u201d.</p> <p>The court heard that, about a week before her death, Barritt had been in hospital following a fall, and her discharge papers stated that she needed to be kept warm as her temperature was low.</p> <p>Batty said: \u201cThere was in my judgment no amendment to Mrs Barritt\u2019s care plan. Those trusted with her care should have been aware of this cautionary note from the hospital. They were not.</p> <p>\u201cThe failure to revise Mrs Barritt\u2019s care plan was indicative to other residents. This was not an isolated occurrence.\u201d</p> <p>Maria Mallaband Care Ltd of Leeds pleaded guilty to a health-and-safety charge relating to Barritt\u2019s death at a hearing in June. At the time, the company ran 30 homes for the elderly across the country, including Oaklands, and cared for 2,600 residents.</p> <p>Batty said: \u201cIt can be seen that this case does not involve an isolated and tragic act. The death of this much loved lady, I regret to say in the context of this case, was an accident waiting to happen.</p> <p>\u201cIt my judgment it is very serious and there were systematic, systemic failures in that care home.\u201d </p> <p>Barritt was admitted to the home in July 2012 by her \u201cloving and attentive family\u201d because they thought it was the safest place for her. She had suffered from dementia for five years and was unable to make decisions for herself. She died at the home on 4 November 2012.</p> <p>The court heard previously that investigations into her death revealed the radiators in her room and other rooms nearby were never maintained. </p> <p>Staff and relatives of residents had also warned management repeatedly for two years that the oil-fired heating in the home did not work properly \u2013 but nothing had been done to rectify the situation.<br></p> <p>The home had also run out of fuel on several occasions during the two winters before her death, the court heard previously. </p> <p>Speaking at court on Tuesday, David Hercock, prosecuting on behalf of Harrogate district council, said: \u201cBy the time a night-shift nurse realised [Barritt] was in trouble at 7.50pm, [Barritt] felt ice cold, she wasn\u2019t breathing and her temperature was so low it couldn\u2019t register on a standard thermometer. She was taken by ambulance to Harrogate district hospital, but died there later the same day.\u201d</p> <p>Maria Mallaband Care has an annual turnover of \u00a350m and has won national awards. However, Oaklands showed losses of \u00a31.75m in 2015, and \u00a34.2m in 2016.</p> <p>Tony Moule, the environmental health officer at Harrogate borough council, said: \u201cOur investigation revealed that there were a number of serious failures with regard to health-and-safety legislation.<br></p> <p>\u201cNo fine can ever compensate the family for the loss of their mother in such shocking circumstances. For an elderly vulnerable person to suffer hypothermia while in bed in her room, under the care of a national care provider, beggars belief.<br></p> <p>\u201cCare homes must take their responsibilities seriously and Maria Mallaband Care Group Ltd failed in its duty of care. We hope that this case sends out a message which will help to ensure that such events don\u2019t happen in the future.\u201d</p>",

Clinton was knowledgeable and poised; Trump was volatile and at times barely coherent.</p> <p>Despite all evidence that he floundered badly on Monday night, Trump spent the entire following day bragging about winning and insisting that his distracting sniffling was due to a faulty or tampered microphone. He even doubled down on insulting a former Miss Universe, who Clinton pointed out he had called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d, by explaining on Fox News that she had gained \u201ca massive amount of weight\u201d.</p> <p>Lord, give me that confidence!</p> <p>For women like Clinton who are advised to tone down their intelligence lest they come across as unlikeable, the debate and its aftermath mark a promising shift in the way that smart women are perceived. Finally, a man who was markedly less prepared and talented than his female opponent was called out as such. Finally, a woman who has spent her life doing her homework wasn\u2019t made out to be a condescending shrew.

And despite the generally positive reactions to her performance, what\u2019s easy to forget is how much work Clinton likely did to project the exact right amount of confidence without seeming smug, the precise formulation of smiling and silence in the face of bold faced lies and idiocy. In all this, too, I\u2019m sure she studied up.</p> <p>And it worked. The pre-debate expectations-lowering around Trump\u2019s performance and the post-debate posturing were all in vain. Despite Trump\u2019s bluster and bravado, this mediocre man came across as exactly what he is \u2013 middling and unimpressive. And Trump\u2019s massive sense of entitlement and self-regard wasn\u2019t enough to shadow the fact that Clinton is simply better, in every way. Better at debating, better at leading, better at outsmarting an opponent.</p> <p>For women across the country who recognized all too well <a href=\"http://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/780586441432829952\">Trump\u2019s interruptions</a> or Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/opinion/hillary-clintons-everywoman-moment.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region\">practiced patience</a>, the last few days have been validating.

However, Labour MPs are still wary of these fine words given that he signals at the weekend that they will still have to fight selection battles after the boundary review.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/andy-burnham-to-step-down-from-shadow-cabinet-labour-party-conference\">Labour conference: Andy Burnham to leave shadow cabinet</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3) The Labour leader acknowledged that debate in the party had at times spilled over into abuse and hate, including misogyny and antisemitism, especially on social media.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is an important recognition. Corbyn is often criticised for coupling rejection of antisemitism with a rejection of \u201cother kinds of racism\u201d as well, which some say does not amount to an acceptance that Labour has particularly struggled with accusations of antisemitism. His words are some of the strongest he has given on the subject, saying he will fight with every breath to oppose the evil of prejudice against Jewish people.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4) Corbyn again stresses his success in increasing the party membership to more than half a million people.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is a crucial element of Corbyn\u2019s power, as his mandate is based on the enthusiasm of thousands of people for his leadership. He is expected to use the membership to help him shape policy and perhaps even contribute to electing people to the shadow cabinet.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5) Corbyn claims a number of policy victories as his own, including the government\u2019s defeats over tax credits and proposed disability cuts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is debatable.

He promises economic solutions for the future, not the past.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn is in effect tackling the arguments of some of his critics that he is harking back to socialist policies of the 1970s. Instead, he is linking his purpose to a new wave of anti-establishment movements across the world in which people disillusioned with the effects of globalisation are demanding change.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>7) Corbyn attacks the Tories for \u201cgerrymandering\u201d by trying to change parliamentary boundaries for the next election.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: The Labour leader strongly opposes the boundary review. But it may also be helpful to him because it will pit a number of Labour MPs against each other when their seats are abolished or changed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>8) An attack on Sir Philip Green, the former BHS boss, goes down well in the hall.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn points out that Green was hired by the Tories to do an efficiency review and links this to the government being wedded to a failed economic model of the past. It is part of casting himself as a candidate for change.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>9) Corbyn promises everybody a decent home, a proper living wage, secure employment rights and an end to zero-hour contracts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: It is quite hard for anyone in Labour to disagree with this and part of Corbyn\u2019s strategy will be to unite his party on matters of domestic policy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>10) Corbyn explains his 10 policy proposals, from not taking the country into unnecessary wars to an end to inequality. He jokes that they are not the Ten Commandments.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is a little bit of self-deprecating humour aimed at those who claim he is treated as the messiah by his followers. The serious point is that he is on the way to successfully enshrining the points of his leadership campaign as policy, allowing him more control over the direction of the party.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11) The Labour leader promises an end to the local authority borrowing cap, which would allow another 12,000 council homes to be built.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An earlier draft of the speech predicted 60,000 more homes, suggesting the estimate is a cautious one. This will be hugely welcomed by councils as local authority housing stock has been depleted by the right-to-buy scheme.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>12) Labour would borrow \u00a3500bn to invest in infrastructure and public services to end \u201cmanaged decline\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Plenty of sensible independent analysts have been calling for these things. Many voters may think it essential for growth and adequate public services but others may worry about Labour again being seen to be proposing borrowing when they are yet to rebuild their reputation on the economy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>13) Corbyn promises a \u201cnew deal for rebuilding Britain\u201d that involves raising corporation tax by 1.5% to help pay for the education of college students.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This may be the start of a new trend of \u201chypothecation\u201d in tax policy, where Labour links a specific tax rise to a specific benefit for society. The theory is that people and businesses are more inclined to stomach a tax rise that is going towards a named social good.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>14) A new \u00a3160m fund will be available to ensure schoolchildren have access to arts and culture through a special \u201cpupil premium\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Getting every child to learn about culture and music is a personal priority for Corbyn. He may have misspoken when talking about England and Wales as education is devolved.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>15) Labour will scrap the work capability assessment.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This will be another unifier for the party. Many MPs were not happy with last year\u2019s decision to abstain on a welfare vote and Corbyn is firmly pitching his leadership as one that will stand up for people\u2019s rights to fair benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>16) Corbyn stuck to his line on defending immigration, saying it was the Labour way to oppose racism, myths and division.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is one issue of domestic policy on which there is division in the shadow cabinet. A number of frontbenchers think Labour should take from the Brexit vote that people want stronger controls on immigration.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>17) Corbyn defines his own aims of Brexit as including the freedom to intervene in our own industries, no obligation to liberalise or privatise our public services and a new relationship with Europe based on cooperation and internationalism.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: These are all laudable aims for Labour, but Corbyn does not give much detail on the central question of the Brexit negotiations: the trade-off between the single market and free movement. The end to restrictions on state aid would be significant, though, as the government would be better able to rescue struggling industries such as steel.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>18) The Labour leader reiterates his apology for the Iraq war.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This one is a crowd-pleaser, as Corbyn again takes the opportunity to draw a dividing line between his own leadership and that of the last Labour government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>19) A Corbyn government would end arms sales to Saudi Arabia over its actions in Yemen.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> This is another major policy based on reports that Saudi Arabia has committed war crimes. Corbyn has been a long-standing critic of Saudi Arabia, which is an ally of the UK government.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>20) Corbyn acknowledges there is an \u201celectoral mountain to climb\u201d, especially if there is a snap election next year.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: As focus turns from the party battle to the possibility of one against the Tories, Corbyn stresses the \u201cneeds and aspirations of middle- and lower-income voters, of ordinary families\u201d which Labour must address. He again focuses on the need for a \u201csocialism of the 21st century\u201d \u2013 looking forwards rather than backwards.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>21) A rare personal passage describes Corbyn getting his socialism from his parents and working as a teacher and trade union organiser.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: The Labour leader is reluctant to talk about his family, but he refers to his teacher mother and engineer father who instilled in him a love for socialism and peace. It may be the beginnings of a project to introduce the electorate more to Jeremy the man.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>22) There is a big standing ovation as Corbyn finishes on the slogan: \u201cTogether, we can shape the future \u2026 and build a fairer Britain \u2026 in a peaceful world.\u201d A choir sings Jerusalem.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn looks pleased with his performance, which was more assured and fluent than last year. There was very little of controversy in the speech for Labour critics of Corbyn to oppose. The choice of Jerusalem appears designed to dispel notions that the Labour leader does not do patriotism.<br></p> </blockquote>",

The list, however, has been criticised as unreliable, because some organisations list all their staff to avoid being caught out, making it harder to identify genuine lobbyists. Others involved in lobbying have avoided joining the register.</p> <p>The European parliament welcomed the proposal to extend the lobbyists\u2019 register to all EU institutions. The French Socialist politician Sylvie Guillaume, a vice-president of the European parliament, said member states needed to face up to their responsibilities. \u201cAt a time when several scandals have been revealed and citizens\u2019 trust is eroded, it is vital to be entirely transparent about the various interest groups gravitating around the European institutions,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Transparency International delivered a scathing verdict on the reforms. Daniel Freund at the campaign group\u2019s EU office said: \u201cCitizens and lobbyists are demanding stricter rules for lobbying the EU, but the institutions are not listening.\u201d</p> <p>The German Green MEP Sven Giegold said the measures were an important step toward transparency, but the proposals \u201cstopped halfway\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cOnly commissioners and director generals are currently included, while lobbying of other senior staff and heads of units in the EU agencies would remain in the dark,\u201d he said. \u201cLobby transparency will remain empty words for the permanent representations of the member states in Brussels, not to speak of the governments in their capitals.\u201d</p>",

But peer mentoring offers a way to sidestep it. There are no teachers wagging fingers; just friendly faces offering the benefit of their experience. But what does peer mentoring look like in practice? And does it work?<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.mandbf.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Peer_Mentoring_in_Schools.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mentoring and Befriending Foundation</a> (pdf) defines it as a one-to-one relationship, where the mentor volunteers their support to another student. Normally, it\u2019s during a time of transition in the mentee\u2019s life.</p> <p>Birmingham\u2019s Hamstead Hall Academy runs two strands of the scheme: one for more able students, and another for those experiencing personal or family issues. Attendance is voluntary and pupils are encouraged to share experiences and work on specific subject areas. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about making students independent learners,\u201d says Melios Michael, the scheme\u2019s coordinator. \u201cThat\u2019s what every teacher wants.\u201d</p> <p>Tia, who has just started year 8, says the sessions are fun and supportive. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same if they were led by a teacher,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs my confidence grew, I was getting better at maths \u2013 and that then had an effect on my other subjects too.\u201d </p> <p>Another student, Rahul, has gone from mentee to mentor. \u201cYou don\u2019t get everything right, but with a mentor you are more willing to have a second try, compared to in a classroom with loads of people,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/aug/31/great-expectations-how-to-help-your-students-fulfil-their-potential\">Great expectations: how to help your students fulfil their potential</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prospective mentors undergo a careful selection process. After completing an initial application, those who go to the next stage take part in an assessment day, led by the current mentor team. </p> <h2><strong>Mutual benefits</strong></h2> <p>But the successful ones have discovered that the benefits go both ways. As well as being useful for university applications, students say these schemes help to build their confidence and develop strong presentation skills. </p> <p>For any school that may be considering setting up such a programme, training and support for students is key, according to Melios Michael. \u201cThey have to be given some freedom to take on responsibilities, but within certain boundaries.\u201d</p> <p>At Headlands School in Bridlington, peer mentoring takes a different form, with a focus on year 7 students who are finding school life difficult. They meet in a dedicated mentoring room first thing every morning and are accompanied from lesson to lesson by their mentors. At the end of the day, the pair meet again to debrief and check they\u2019re organised for the next day. </p> <p>It\u2019s proved popular with the students: 49 applied for just 20 mentoring positions last year. </p> <p>\u201cMentors are allowed to wear red hoodies instead of the standard uniform, so they have a high status in the school community,\u201d coordinator Vaughan Hewitt explains. \u201cThey are visible and reassuring for many younger students.\u201d</p> <p> Hewitt says he wants to create an atmosphere where mentees feel they have a big brother or sister to look out for them.</p> <h2>How to make it work</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/14/meditation-made-my-students-calmer-kinder-and-more-focused\">Meditation made my students calmer, kinder and more focused</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But how effective are peer mentoring schemes? A 2008 <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/DCSF-RR033-R.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> (pdf) found that the degree of formalisation was a key factor in determining the success of peer mentoring programmes. Schemes with good recruitment, clear aims, embedded procedures for referral, and training of mentors were more likely to work for pupils. It added that mentees can also benefit from coordinator-led training themselves, in order to manage expectations and let them know what they can bring to the scheme. </p> <p>But although pupils say mentoring boosts their confidence, there is a lack of clear evidence about the impact on academic performance or behaviour. It\u2019s something Michael broadly recognises \u2013 although he and his students maintain it can have an influence. </p> <p>\u201cIt definitely builds their confidence,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rest depends on the programme and the training. It doesn\u2019t happen for everyone, but the grades can follow.\u201d </p> <p>Hewitt adds: \u201cYou can see in the faces of the kids \u2013 who, over time, become bouncy and lively \u2013 that this scheme works.\u201d </p> <p>Peer mentoring is not a silver bullet, then. But it certainly has its place in a school\u2019s arsenal of weapons to encourage students to succeed and be confident with their learning. </p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

But that need not be a problem. Most of them have always had other jobs, or are married to, or live with, people who make a living. Perhaps only twice in the last years of the 19th century, with the boom in universal literacy, and in the last years of the 20th century with the revolution in bookselling, has it been possible. But that boom is well and truly over. It doesn't make much different to the author whether the book is sold in paper or as an e-book. The problem is that the overall number is down, for the simple reason that there is so much competition for people's attention. For instance, I have at least 30 boxsets which friends of mine have told me are the greatest things ever shown or made. Because I still read books, I will never have the time to see any of them. Other people choose differently. </p> <p>But on the plus side, people can now publish their own books for very little money and call themselves a published writer. I'm sure that in future the market will find a way of distributing and promoting those books if they feel, as in the case of Fifty Shades of Grey, they can make a lot of money out of them. The best way to encourage new writing is to make sure that children and young people are exposed all the time to good old writing. This should happen at school and at home but there are also great enterprises like First Story, which do their best to encourage.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebbc0fe4b0757c5291924b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:49:18.691Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">&quot;The 20th century has proved far bloodier than most of us foresaw&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16766445\">Anna Page</a> asks:</p> <p><em>I have just finished Where My Heart Used to Beat for a book club.

I could see very little myself, but quite a lot of people have said this to me, so perhaps there is something that I am not aware of. I think it may lie in the fact that the main character does at least finally understand who he is and where he has come from. My fear is that many of the wars so far this century are still related to the first world war, and the reordering of the great empires, particularly in the Middle East. My second fear is that some of them have a religious element, and the last thing war needs is an irrational fury. On the other hand there is far greater international communication and co-operation through the UN, Nato and the EU. In the catastrophic months leading up to August 1914, our foreign secretary never left London. That level of non-communication is now unthinkable. But the aftermath of the 20th century has proved so far much bloodier than most of us foresaw.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:50:05.848Z\">at 1.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ebbb10e4b01b56deffc3b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:44:54.546Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12761530\">DreamEcho</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Many years ago, I heard you say there was a musical link between Birdsong and Charlotte Gray.

I was only 39 when I wrote the book, and Stephen is almost 30 by the end, so I wasn't quite a different generation. And he is pretty grown up for his age. It is very interesting to revisit young characters in fiction. I have just read The Catcher in the Rye for the fifth time with roughly eight year intervals, and for the fifth time I see Holden and his story completely differently. I had never really noticed how argumentative, difficult and even violent he is. </p> <p>I am currently finding a voice for a 17-year-old boy with a north African background. Apart from double-checking a few cultural and religious references, I am very much enjoying the liberation of writing in the voice of someone with no knowledge of and no interest in history. In the course of the book, he will encounter people with a different understanding of life but it is fun to write in the person of someone who thinks only about sex and food and where he is going to spend the night.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebb9c0e4b01b56deffc3ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:38:44.907Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16765200\">OleksandrOK</a> asks:</p> <p><em>What is your favourite movie?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/sep/26/sebastian-faulks-webchat-where-my-heart-used-to-beat#comment-84217146\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16765623\" title=\"View SebastianFaulks\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16765623\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for SebastianFaulks\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16765623\" title=\"View SebastianFaulks\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">SebastianFaulks</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84217146\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 September 2016 1:36pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I enjoyed Sideways.

We have not yet recovered from the crimes and misdemeanours of the financial sector that led to the crash, but I think the political focus is now simply on trying to make some of these people pay a fair amount of tax. No progress seems yet to have been made. The idea of a society atomised into small sections, many of which depend on a virtual world \u2013 whether of finance, the internet, religion or psychosis \u2013 still seems to me the characteristic problem. I'm afraid it's much easier for novelists to dramatise than to offer practical solutions. But of course, everything begins with education, and that would be a good place to start.</p> <p>One thing that has changed is that people have lost even more trust in the political class. And we are now a country with an unpopular and unelected leadership, and no formal opposition.

A great deal more has come to light in the years since then, and indeed whole tunnel systems have been discovered on the western front.

Other women\u2019s dads equate Bill Clinton\u2019s wandering eye with Hillary\u2019s supposed failure as a human being \u2013 if she can\u2019t even hold her own husband\u2019s interest, how can she captivate a country?

As a librarian, Butor is especially vexed by her father parroting misinformation about Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state and stance on gun control; she\u2019s doubled down on debating him, but sometimes, she resigns herself to live and let live: \u201cHe is \u2026 my dad, so I want to have a relationship with him.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s famous pantsuits have been a source of consternation between Tabitha Clark, 31, and her uncle, the man who will walk her down the aisle at her wedding. Clark\u2019s uncle equates Bill Clinton\u2019s roaming eye with Hillary\u2019s supposed failures as a human being; his takeaway is not to trust any woman who wears a pantsuit \u2013 never mind that Clark wears pantsuits to her job. When she reminds him of this, he says that she\u2019s different, since she\u2019s not in politics. \u201cHe\u2019s actually very supportive of my life, except that I\u2019m a liberal,\u201d Clark jokes.<br></p> <p>Another friend explains that her Hillary-hating father bought her tool sets as well as Barbies: \u201cMy dad is a smart guy.

It insisted that everything in it would have also been recorded elsewhere so no vital information would have been lost. </p> <p> Fulcher, who left the force after being disciplined over the way he handled Halliwell, said the fact the policy book was missing came out during his hearing. </p> <p> He said: \u201cWhen I asked for the gold policy file to be produced at my disciplinary hearing I was told: \u2018It\u2019s gone missing, believed stolen from the chief constable\u2019s office.\u2019 It is ridiculous.\u201d </p> <p>Despite catching him, Fulcher found himself in trouble over how he questioned Halliwell. After the taxi driver became his prime subject for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/19/sian-ocallaghan-murder-detective\">suspected abduction of O\u2019Callaghan,</a> Fulcher had him taken to a remote hill fort, Barbury Castle. Fulcher believed O\u2019Callaghan was still alive and wanted to give Halliwell one last chance to come clean. </p> <p>Halliwell took Fulcher to O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s body \u2013 she was already dead \u2013 and from there led him to a field where he had buried Godden\u2019s body eight years before. </p> <p>A judge initially ruled that this \u201cconfession\u201d evidence was not admissible in court because Halliwell had been denied basic rights such as access to a lawyer. There was other evidence linking Halliwell to O\u2019Callaghan and he pleaded guilty to her murder in 2012. But he denied having anything to do with Godden\u2019s death and was only convicted last week following a trial at Bristol crown court. </p> <p> Fulcher was keen to see the policy book during the disciplinary process to find out how his actions were judged at the time by his bosses. </p> <p> During legal argument in court in 2012 about the confession Geenty said Fulcher\u2019s tactics were \u201cgutsy\u201d and \u201cbrave\u201d. He added: \u201cI would like to think I would make a similar decision in his circumstances.\u201d Geenty has now retired. </p> <p> Wiltshire police insisted the loss of the book would not affect efforts to find out if Halliwell was a serial killer. The force told the Guardian: \u201cDuring the course of a major investigation such as the investigation into the disappearance of Sian O\u2019Callaghan a number of senior officers will maintain policy books.</p> <p>\u201cEx-chief constable Pat Geenty, who was the gold commander and the ACC of the force, has been spoken to today and he has confirmed he had two gold policy books, one of which remains missing.</p> <p>\u201cEvery effort was made to locate the missing policy book during the investigation and the misconduct process. To date this book has not been located. There is no evidence that the book was stolen. It should also be noted that the governance of the investigation was also recorded through gold groups.\u201d </p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>Leicester City are busy making history again. No other English team have managed to win their first two Champions League matches. Leicester\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/leicester-city-porto-champion-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 victory against Porto</a> makes qualification to the knockout stages look distinctly possible with six points on the board already but whatever happens from now they hold the distinction of coming to terms with elevation to the Champions League more quickly than any of their illustrious predecessors.</p> <p>On the domestic front, after three defeats in the opening six games, the history made last season is fast becoming a distant memory. The key to success last time was a solid start and managing to stay ahead for most of the campaign. Leicester have looked far from solid in the league and not just in conceding three goals from first-half corners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">at Manchester United last week</a>. It is already being said \u2013 Claudio Ranieri is asked the question on a weekly basis \u2013 that subconsciously or otherwise Leicester are saving their best efforts for Europe this season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/27/riyad-mahrez-champions-league-leicester-porto\">Riyad Mahrez passes Champions League test to show he belongs in the elite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Naturally the manager denies it. His stock answer runs along the lines of preparing for every game meticulously and separately. Only when Leicester have finished with a Premier League engagement do they permit themselves to look forward to a European fixture, and vice versa. Leicester take one game at a time, in other words, or at least that is what they are trying to do.</p> <p>Yet not only do results and form suggest they are not succeeding in their aim, Ranieri rather gave the game away at Old Trafford on Saturday by taking Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez off at half-time. Fair enough, at 4-0 down the game was beyond them and the Leicester manager was entitled to husband his resources as best he could with a view to the next game but it is going to be hard convincing players and supporters after that double withdrawal that Leicester\u2019s focus remains on the league, and that they are not moving most of their casino chips on to the square marked European adventure.</p> <p>Leicester are getting carried away by the excitement of Europe. Who wouldn\u2019t, in their position? With the best will in the world, they are unlikely to win the Premier League again. Not this season, not next season, perhaps not ever. Even if Ranieri and his players could keep up the dashing hit-and-run tactics of last season, even if they could somehow retain the element of surprise and stealth, the other teams in the race have all improved and strengthened.</p> <p>Many of them have new managers and massively increased budgets, Manchester City have not just won six league games in a row they have won all 10 of their fixtures under Pep Guardiola. Things have moved on. If Leicester\u2019s success last season was possible only because they were consistently brilliant while the other contenders were dozing or rebuilding, the last part of that equation has altered. City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham, to name four, do not look as if they intend to be caught napping again.</p> <p>Maybe the first part of the equation has changed too. If Leicester are not quite the same force it is perhaps because they know they will not be playing for the same prize. Ranieri will continue to talk a good game, his players will continue to run themselves into the ground on his behalf but lightning will not strike twice.</p> <p>Fairytales are ephemeral things, difficult to repeat on demand. Ranieri appears to understand this. When he talked of \u201ccontinuing the fairytale\u201d he was speaking of the Champions League challenge, not a domestic season already in danger of returning to the mundane. In all probability everyone at Leicester knows deep down that last season is likely to prove a one-off and nothing is going to be as phenomenal or exciting again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Europe, just like last season at home, there are no expectations, Leicester can operate under the radar again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With the possible exception of Europe. Here, at least, Leicester are making footsteps on untrodden ground. Here, just like last season at home, there are no expectations, Leicester can operate under the radar again. After the big adventure reality has returned with a bump in the Premier League but the Champions League still permits big dreams and exciting possibilities.</p> <p>This is not to suggest Leicester are capable of winning the thing. Ask Ranieri about that and he will laugh and say no chance. He spent most of last season responding in exactly the same way to questions about the possibility of Leicester winning the Premier League. Leicester becoming champions is clearly no guarantee of European success. English champions have been failing to terrorise the superpowers of Europe for some years but Leicester have not failed their European audition. They have not fallen at the first hurdle. They look confident and purposeful, and have put themselves in a good position to still be around after Christmas.</p> <p>If they make it to the knockout stage, they appear to have a team perfectly suited to the challenge of winning over two legs. Quick-breaking, compact in defending, usually capable of a goal or two even when pinned back or having to be patient. At least that is what it appears Leicester can do based on the evidence of last season. Based on the evidence of the defeat at United reaching the knockout stage may be a dream too far, unless we are in fact watching two different Leicesters this season. There\u2019s the one at home, who understand that after the goodwill earned last season practically anything short of a dalliance with relegation will not attract too much condemnation this time. Then there\u2019s the one in Europe, the one seeing how far they can go in an intoxicating environment no one imagined a club such as Leicester would ever to be able to sample.</p> <p>Ranieri denies Leicester are picking their matches but he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he? He has to, though it doesn\u2019t mean he has any real control over the situation. He\u2019s up against human nature here, always assuming the manager himself isn\u2019t as guilty as his players of subconsciously prioritising the European games. Not many of us without degrees in psychology are capable of understanding or influencing the subconscious mind. As Bertie Wooster once said, when Jeeves had broached the subject: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said off-hand that I had a subconscious mind but I suppose I must have without knowing it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft was surprised and fascinated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/playstation-boss-andrew-house-ps4-pro-our-approach-isnt-reactive-this-time-around\">Sony\u2019s decision not to support 4K UHD Blu-ray discs</a> with its PlayStation 4 Pro console, an executive has revealed. </p> <p>Albert Penello, who leads planning for the Xbox division, said that he expected Sony to feature a 4K disc player in its updated PS4 machine, which is launching on 10 November. Microsoft is supporting the format \u2013 which allows gamers to player UHD movies on their machine \u2013 in both its Xbox One S and Project Scorpio platforms. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to bait any sort of console war, I have a lot of respect for what Sony does, but analytically, I think they made some interesting decisions in their product that surprised me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of a 4K disc player, given Sony\u2019s media background, was a surprise. Looking at what they\u2019ve done historically, I don\u2019t think many people would have predicted that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that [Sony] arrived at a very similar sort of strategy to Scorpio \u2013 we came to this bold idea independently of each other. Even though the tactics are different, the idea, fundamentally, is very similar.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8225b52f68e44643cca80e5a13df9fa5590d877d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8225b52f68e44643cca80e5a13df9fa5590d877d/0_0_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft Xbox One S and new Wireless Controller\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Microsoft Xbox One S and new Wireless Controller</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Penello said he was pleased with the Xbox One S, which was launched last month offering a slimmer build, as well as support for 4K video and HDR visual effects.</p> <p>\u201cIf you step away from the salty internet commentary, we had a group of people working on it for a couple of years, and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we did the original Xbox 360 Slim, we added a bunch of new features, we improved the quality of the design and I enjoy that process. With Xbox One S, we added a ton of value into the box while keeping the price the same, we really took a leadership position in 4K and HDR, and we made some bold technology decisions with Wi-Fi in the box and going to Bluetooth on the controllers.\u201d </p> <p>He was also keen to explain the company\u2019s strategy for Project Scorpio, the more powerful Xbox One derivative arriving next winter.</p> <p>\u201cWe made a pretty bold decision in announcing that as early as we did,\u201d he said. \u201cOur reasoning was, when you\u2019re in this new world of iterative consoles, you\u2019re going to want to give customers a little bit more of a heads up \u2013 we wanted people to go into this holiday with their eyes open, knowing that Xbox One S was shipping but that Scorpio was coming. </p> <p>\u201cFrankly it also gave us more time to be open with our development partners so we could get better games when Scoprio launched. There were a lot of rumours about what Sony was going to ship and when, but it didn\u2019t really factor into our decision to announce Scorpio at E3 and it hasn\u2019t really changed our plans. We said we were going to build the most powerful console \u2013 that\u2019s going to hold true.\u201d</p> <p>When asked if there\u2019s a chance consumers may become alienated by a more iterative approach to console development, Penello acknowledged that significantly updating hardware during the lifecycle was a risk.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is something we thought a lot about as we were going through the plans for Scorpio,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we have a lot more details to unveil about how that\u2019s going to come to market. </p> <p>\u201cAn analogy with the cellphone market is one way people are reconciling how this change is going to happen. I\u2019ve heard other people make analogies with the PC market; they\u2019re both logical comparisons, but they immediately take you to the pitfalls of those approaches. One of things we have to make sure of is that as we go through this transition with customers and developers in a way that makes sense for the console market. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to make it very clear: it\u2019s one family of consoles. All of your accessories work, all of your games work. We don\u2019t want customers to feel dumb for buying the wrong thing. We\u2019re going to do it in a way that makes sense for console players. When Scorpio is out and people realise how easy it is, a lot of those fears will be mitigated.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1dRgWpGePs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F1dRgWpGePs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But a big question is whether consumers actually want 4K resolution technology. UHD television sets are only now becoming affordable and there remains a lot of confusion over the benefits \u2013 and over which TV models support which features. </p> <p>\u201cNaturally technology is going to migrate to 4K,\u201d said Penello. \u201cThis is not a flash in the pan \u2013 it\u2019s not like 3D TV, it\u2019s not like Smart TVs, I think that 4K is going to be, over the next few years, the predominant screen resolution that people are going to buy when they upgrade their sets. There are groups of data that have varying market share stats, but they pretty much agree that 4K will eventually take over. </p> <p>\u201cPersonally, I think the shift from SD to HD was very meaningful \u2013 and I think the same about the move from 1080p to 4K. I do believe that, once the content starts to show up, people will be like, wow, this is worth the upgrade. When you look at a UHD Blu-ray, when you look at a 4K HDR streams from Netflix or Amazon, I believe you can really see the difference.\u201d</p> <p>There have, however, been doubts expressed in the games media that Project Scorpio would have the processing power to run games that have been rendered in native 4K resolution with HDR effects at 60 frames-per-second. The current Xbox One struggles to render 1080p HD resolution games at that frame rate. Penello confirmed Microsoft\u2019s claims that \u201ctrue\u201d 4K gaming on Scorpio is the ambition \u2013 but stepped away from guaranteeing that this would be achievable at high frame rates.</p> <p>\u201cOn the games, we had to give ourselves a goal for what performance level we wanted to build in the box \u2013 and our goal was to be able to deliver true 4K games: the same engines running on Xbox One being about to run in Scoprio on 4K,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve said very clearly that it\u2019s up to the developers how they want to take advantage of that power. Some developers focus on effects, some on frame rate some on resolution \u2013 it\u2019s up to them what they want to do.\u201d <br></p> <p>Penello did state, however, that he has faith that developers will be able to master 4K graphics rendering. \u201cWe don\u2019t tell developers what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you go back and look at things like putting a hard drive in a box, cloud computing, and the ethernet port that we included in the original xbox, and now 4K and HDR \u2013 these are all things that developers came to us and asked us to support. It\u2019s a dialogue through the product development process \u2013 you speak to developers, you look at where technology is going and you make a set of decisions about the platform, the canvas that they create their art on.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look to PC games development to understand this. In the last five years, there\u2019s been a real renaissance in PC gaming, and that\u2019s happening with Nvidia and AMD investing in really high-end performance \u2013 to the point where PCs have eclipsed consoles much more significantly than ever before. In fact consoles used to lead PCs and it would take a while for them to catch up. </p> <p>\u201cIf you look at game engines like Frostbite and Unreal, developers have got really good at scaling \u2013 they\u2019re excellent at figuring out how to build textures at very high resolutions, then being able to optimise that artwork for various platforms. With that in consideration, it will be easier to take advantage of the performance difference of Scorpio because these guys are already building games that far surpass what consoles can do today.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s possible, though, that we may have to wait for developers to gain experience with the Scorpio hardware before we seem them pushing the native 4K capabilities of the platform. \u201cThe developers have to go through a transition, just like customers,\u201d said Penello. \u201cWe are spending as much time and energy on our dev tools as we are on anything customer-facing. Making it easier for developers to take advantage of the power, making it easier for developers who are working on an Xbox One game to get a great Scorpio game and vice versa \u2013 we\u2019re developing those tools now.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a critical part of the work we\u2019re doing to make that transition.\u201d </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/14/xbox-project-scorpion-playstation-4-pro-nintendo-nx-consoles-beginners-guide\"><strong>A buyer\u2019s guide to the new Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo consoles</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\"><br></a></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Vice-president Joe Biden will make a cameo Wednesday on Law &amp; Order: Special Victim\u2019s Unit, the well-known police procedural, highlighting a very real partnership between the politician and the show\u2019s leading actor, Mariska Hargitay. </p> <p>Hargitay leads the show\u2019s upcoming season, the 18th, playing detective Olivia Benson. Biden will appear in the second episode of the season on 28 September to commend the fictional detectives on their work to end the rape kit backlog, shorthand for thousands of uncounted and untested sexual assault kits that police collected but never processed. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness of the problem at all levels, from citizens to elected officials,\u201d said Ilse Knecht, a senior policy adviser for the not-for-profit Joyful Heart Foundation, founded by Hargitay with the express purpose of ending the backlog. </p> <p>\u201cIt definitely is something that people are becoming more aware of, and more angered by honestly, and inspired to action \u2013 but there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d </p> <p>The episode specifically addresses efforts to end the backlog in Detroit, where more than 11,000 kits were discovered. Now, nearly 10,000 have been tested, identifying 762 suspected serial rapists impacting 40 states and 50 convictions.</p> <p>\u201cRape kit\u201d is the term used to describe forensic evidence collected by nurses following a sexual assault. Women who submit to such exams often undergo invasive, sometimes hours-long examinations of their bodies to collect evidence immediately following the trauma of sexual assault.</p> <p>Evidence from rape kits has helped identify <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/24/untested-rape-kits-backlog-us-legislators\">serial rapists</a>, has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/07/25/texas-man-exonerated-through-dna-testing-he-didnt-know-was-going-to-happen/?utm_term=.9543ca8c5344\">exonerated the innocent</a>, and helps build a strong court case. Many advocates also believe that regular testing of rape kits could encourage more women to report sexual assault. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\">US Department of Justice</a> estimates that roughly one in three women report an assault. </p> <p>Rape kit backlogs have been found in states across the country, including backlogs of thousands in major cities such as Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, Cleveland and Memphis, Tennessee. Hargitay\u2019s foundation estimates that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.joyfulheartfoundation.org/events/talk-san-francisco-untested-rape-kits\">175,000 backlogged kits</a> were found nationwide as of 2014.</p> <p>For Biden, the episode may hold special meaning. One of Biden\u2019s signature accomplishments as a senator was passage of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/stanford-sexual-assault-joe-biden-victim-letter-brock-turner\">Violence Against Women Act</a>. Biden was also a lead sponsor of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rainn.org/news/biden-talks-about-rape-kit-initiative\">Debbie Smith Act</a>, the first to directly address and attempt to end the rape kit backlog.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a rape kit left sitting on a shelf, there\u2019s a victim without justice,\u201d then senator Biden said during the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://votesmart.org/public-statement/381667/senate-passes-bidens-debbie-smith-reauthorization-act#.V-rrf5MYhAY\">bill\u2019s reauthorization in 2008</a>. \u201cIt is unconscionable that we have the ability to solve these crimes and hold the perpetrators responsible, but because of red tape and lack of funding, the criminals are free and their victims continue to live in fear.\u201d </p> <p>The show marks one of many collaborations between Hargitay and Biden, including on NBC.

We still do not know how life began on Earth. If we could find some elsewhere, we could look to see how similar or different it was from Earth life. Does it rely on DNA, for example? Do its similarities and differences hold clues about how it, and therefore we, were formed?</p> <p>However, this is where the risk and the fear of failure lies. Despite what you might think from the news stories, water is no guarantee of life. Water is certainly a prerequisite on Earth and there are good scientific reasons for believing water may be essential for life of any description, but there is no guarantee that a watery celestial body will automatically play host to microbes.</p> <p>Perhaps this is the reason that Nasa has seemed strangely reluctant to take the next step of actually looking for life. Earlier this century, they shied away from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Planet_Finder\" title=\"\">Terrestrial Planet Finder</a>, a telescope designed to look for Earth-like worlds and analyse their atmospheres for traces of life. With their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/curiosity-rover\" title=\"\">Mars Curiosity rover</a> in 2012, they specifically did not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2012/aug/05/curiosity-rover-nasa-life-mars\" title=\"\">put any life-detecting equipment</a> on board.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/sep/03/nasa-releases-first-close-up-images-jupiter-juno-spacecraft-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xn9q\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2693924\"            data-video-name=\"Nasa releases first close-up images of Jupiter taken by Juno spacecraft  \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Nasa\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57caacc2e4b0456abb93d78e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/03/160903jupiter_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/03/160903jupiter.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/03/160903jupiter_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/sep/03/nasa-releases-first-close-up-images-jupiter-juno-spacecraft-video\">Nasa releases first close-up images of Jupiter taken by Juno spacecraft</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Monday\u2019s Europa announcement offers the potential to really look for life, yet again Nasa seems to be shying away. Scientists said they had seen what looks like geysers shooting water into space from Europa, which has long been known to contain a global ocean. Scientists have repeatedly speculated that microbial life might be found underneath this moon\u2019s ice surface and have spent decades wondering how to get below the ice to look for it. Now that the water is jetting into space, nature is doing all the hard work. A craft could fly through those plumes, sample the water and look for life.</p> <p>By a piece of cosmic good fortune, Nasa is planning a mission to Europa. Yet the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/jupiter-europa-water-plumes-nasa\" title=\"\">using that mission to look for the evidence of life in those plumes was virtually dismissed</a>. \u201cThe Europa flyby is not a life-finding mission,\u201d said programme scientist Curt Niebur. \u201cThat mission is focused on finding the habitability of Europa.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eceaf72def8118c191a9babac3a426b3b057a63b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eceaf72def8118c191a9babac3a426b3b057a63b/162_65_1477_1648/896.jpg\" alt=\"Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa.\" width=\"896\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is time for vision and commitment.\u2019 Nasa image of Europa shows suspected plumes of water vapour erupting at the bottom left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA, ESA, W.

What better way is there to determine Europa\u2019s habitability than to look for life?</p> <p>Nasa was not always this timid. In the 1970s it sent two landers to the surface of Mars. These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/datablog/2016/jul/23/forty-years-of-missions-to-mars\" title=\"\">Viking missions</a> carried experiments to look for life. The results were deemed inconclusive and then simply not followed up. This could have been a mistake. A recent re-analysis of the data suggested that, while the results fell short of a clear detection of Martian life, there were enough positive indicators to warrant a follow-up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/stephen-hawking-light-years-dangerous-aliens\">Why Stephen Hawking is light years from the truth about \u2018dangerous aliens\u2019 | Seth Shostak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps in response, Nasa has now quietly stated that its next Mars rover in 2020 will also look for life. But at least the European Space Agency is proving bolder. In 2020 it plans to launch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/13/exomars-giant-nose-life-on-mars-prepares-launch\" title=\"\">ExoMars rover to Mars</a> that will carry a suite of instruments capable of looking for the evidence of life, either past or present. That search should now be extended to Europa.</p> <p>There is admirable scientific caution, and there is ducking the challenge. To go to Europa now without the ability to look for life is the latter. It is time for vision and commitment: discovering life on another planet would send shockwaves through science and fundamentally transform our understanding of our place in the universe: we must step up the search.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to infrastructure development in developing countries, there are projects that instantly appeal \u2013 like hospitals. Or schools. And then there are those that are a much harder sell; sewers, for example, or prisons. </p> <p>But the world\u2019s prisons are home to an <a href=\"https://www.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/PRI-Prisons-global-trends-report-LR.pdf\">estimated 10 million people globally</a> (pdf) and this number is rising. The world\u2019s prison population has gone up 10% since 2004, and in some countries, such as Indonesia, the increase has been as high as 183%. </p> <p>These people are not necessarily hardened criminals. Around a third of prisoners globally haven\u2019t even been found guilty \u2013 they are on pre-trial detention. They are likely to be drawn disproportionately from the poorest and most marginalised groups in society, and in some places there are even <a href=\"https://www.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/PRI-Prisons-global-trends-report-LR.pdf\">children living in prisons with their parents</a> (pdf) in their thousands. In developing countries, they are typically crammed into buildings that are old and uncared for, neglect that leads to tragedies like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/16/honduras-prison-fire-victims-identified\">fire in 2012</a> that killed over 300 prisoners in Honduras. </p> <p>There are many issues of concern when working with prison populations such as access to legal services, prevention of torture and justice system efficiency. But also key is the design and construction of the buildings where prisoners will spend their time: the prison itself. So what makes a good prison, and why is it is so important to get the design right? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c585f822450926271ddade9c4567a60066313726\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c585f822450926271ddade9c4567a60066313726/0_95_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wearing their distinctive pink uniforms, people suspected of involvement in Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide line up before re-entering Kigali\u2019s central prison from a day at work in the fields next to the prison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wearing their distinctive pink uniforms, people suspected of involvement in Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide line up before re-entering Kigali\u2019s central prison from a day at work in the fields next to the prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karel Prinsloo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isabel Hight has spent over 35 years advising on prison development and management in East Timor, Liberia, Sudan, Rwanda, Afghanistan and Congo for organisations like the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Having recently retired, below she reflects on her work. </p> <p><strong>Why is the architectural design of prisons so important from a human rights and humane treatment perspective? </strong> </p> <p>Architecture sends a silent message to everyone walking into any place. It tells you what to expect and where the limits of behaviour are. Prisons are the same. In my view, design is crucial to creating an environment in which prisoners can live and not become institutionalised. This means providing spaces for staying in contact with families, work, education, and playing sport. </p> <p><strong>How easy is it to persuade governments in developing countries to build well-designed prisons? </strong> </p> <p>Governments generally recognise the need, but hospitals or schools often take priority. They can be receptive to donor funding of new prisons. But large scale imprisonment is primarily a western concept and donors can be tempted to build prisons similar to those in their own countries. Historically colonial powers such as the Belgians, French and British built prisons that were essentially replicas of what they had back home. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a3c0e8067ff76e58041fad67343283deff05003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3c0e8067ff76e58041fad67343283deff05003/0_150_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prisons, inspired by ninenteenth century prison architecture, can be found around the world\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prisons, inspired by nineteenth century prison architecture, can be found around the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is this what you see on the ground? Why are these prisons so problematic? </strong> </p> <p>Yes, in Africa, for example, if you are familiar with nineteenth century British prisons you can recognise instantly similar layouts in former British colonies. Large, two to three storey buildings, long corridors, rather like you see on [the BBC series] Porridge. These prisons, designed based on outdated ideas about incarceration and now very decrepit, are still in use \u2013 and their limitations made worse by overcrowding. Living spaces built for 20 but holding two or three times that number are not unusual. </p> <p><strong>Why is it important to take local cultural values into consideration?</strong></p> <p>What it comes back to is the purpose of imprisonment. If you want prisoners to lead a more law abiding life when they leave, for example, then it\u2019s essential to design buildings so they can keep up with social practices and community life. This means factors like eating arrangements \u2013 do you sit and eat communally, do you eat in isolation in your cell? To eat alone is socially unusual in most communities, and can be quite alienating and institutionalising. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ef4ae88f3a6e8dd26228e04dc94ff2796e905cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ef4ae88f3a6e8dd26228e04dc94ff2796e905cc/0_1_3168_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congolese inmate displays her voter card in a detention cell in Geti prison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Congolese inmate displays her voter card in a detention cell in Geti prison.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Akena/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is developed countries using a design from home still an issue? </strong></p> <p>Yes, this is still a challenge. A prison I know of in Asia was built based on the design of a European high security prison \u2013 it\u2019s single cell and without heating. You can\u2019t have a prison in that particular place without heating and single cells were alien to staff and prisoners. Prisons like that are under-used or abandoned.</p> <p><strong>What do design teams and architects need to think about initially? </strong> </p> <p>Choosing the location is the first issue. Prisons need to be where people are, near large population centres: prisons need staff; prisoners need to attend courts, lawyers need to see their clients; prisons depend on community services ranging from rubbish collection to health services; families need to visit. </p> <p><strong>What sort of thing typically goes wrong when a prison is badly designed? </strong> </p> <p>Inadequate water supply is a common problem. I know of prisons that have been built where the water is, say, a kilometre away and that wasn\u2019t factored into the costing so the prison is really unusable. It\u2019s a similar story with electricity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"843823951862addad27a0d78e2dabed7c4d2be29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/843823951862addad27a0d78e2dabed7c4d2be29/0_80_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The women\u2019s wing of Pul-e-Charkhi prison on the outskirts of Kabul, Afghanistan.

If the kitchen isn\u2019t working, for example, prisoners will organise supplies from outside, and start cooking in unsuitable places like sleeping areas. This creates problems with hygiene and vermin. And like anything limited in prisons, food can become currency. It will be controlled by prisoners or the staff and that can lead to abuse and corruption.</p> <p><strong>How does architecture impact the mental health of prisoners?</strong></p> <p>It varies. What we do know is that very restricted environments where prisoners are isolated from staff and each other quickly have a negative impact on everyone. It\u2019s really best to design the flow of movement of staff and prisoners so there is contact between them. Providing activities also helps. In some prisons I know of, companies have supported workshops in prisons, and prisoners can then go on to work for them once released. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2371b7250795bc225f32b080e11fc179d50e0a23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2371b7250795bc225f32b080e11fc179d50e0a23/0_31_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colonel Abdull Wahed, logistical director of Pol-i Charkhy\u2019s prison, smokes a cigarette as a prison cook prepares lunch for more than 300 prisoners at the jail in Kabul, Afghanistan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colonel Abdull Wahed, logistical director of Pol-i Charkhy\u2019s prison, smokes a cigarette as a prison cook prepares lunch for more than 300 prisoners at the jail in Kabul, Afghanistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You must have seen some very disturbing things in your career ...</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve seen the very best of conditions, some awful conditions and much in between. I\u2019ve seen the consequences of poor sanitation, insufficient food, lack of natural light, lack of fresh air, dilapidated living areas, overcrowding. But in most places the staff are doing the best they can. Doing harm is not what drives them. Of course repressive regimes, and prisons designed to do harm, exist. But where repression is not the intent, poor conditions and treatment are usually the result of a lack of know how and resources. Attitudes to prison design have also changed since I started my career because of the greater possibility of travel. Donors often sponsor developing country prison officials\u2019 attendance at international conferences, training and study tours, all of which can and have a marked impact when they return home.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>A new TV sitcom, Damned, started on Tuesday night on Channel 4.

  "<p>What would you do with \u00a3119,000? It\u2019s a nice problem to have, but not one the majority of us will ever have to grapple with, given that the average UK income is \u00a326,500.</p> <p>The \u00a3119,000 threshold is what it takes to become one of the UK\u2019s super-rich, the top 1% of earners in the country. They are concentrated in sectors such as finance and business, and between them they are worth <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/top-one-per-cent-of-earners-twice-as-rich-as-ten-years-ago-10205660.html\">more than \u00a3250bn to the UK\u2019s economy</a>.

Under-representation is rife, old boys\u2019 networks persist, and a pay gap emerges as a result. It\u2019s just one manifestation of a social order in which women are marginalised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/27/women-poorly-represented-in-top-1-per-cent-uk-earners-study-finds\">Women poorly represented in top 1% of UK earners, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while this is undoubtedly frustrating for the individual women held back by a glass ceiling at the very top of their careers, it\u2019s difficult to see it as a key feminist issue in the context of the visceral economic inequalities facing the UK\u2019s most disadvantaged women.</p> <p>This brand of \u201ccorporate feminism\u201d concerned with women in boardrooms and the equal distribution of millionaires has gained much attention over the last few years, in large part due to the \u201clean in\u201d philosophies of top businesswomen such as Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg and Yahoo\u2019s Marissa Mayer. Work hard, dream big, want it enough, say these these wealthy, white, highly educated women, and you can achieve anything.</p> <p>It\u2019s attractive as a marketing exercise for gender equality: the onus is on individuals to just try a bit harder, while systemically unequal structures keep ticking along in the background.</p> <p>Inevitably, individual women predisposed to make it by privilege do so, and are held up as role models for \u201chaving it all\u201d. But structural barriers and societal inequality don\u2019t just evaporate when you set your mind to something. And, as a real model for women\u2019s liberation, it fails.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/artikler/forskning/research-2015/article.2015-05-20.3011019632\">Evidence</a> shows that an increase in women business leaders has little impact on anyone but the women leaders themselves. It\u2019s a work promotion dressed up as a feminist campaign.</p> <p>This, then, is the issue with framing the under-representation of women among the super-rich as a feminist issue. Economic inequality is indeed a key force in marginalising women, but it\u2019s not because we\u2019re having to remortgage a mansion to pay for a cruise. Rather, women are more likely to be reliant on social security and insecure work, and thus end up hit hardest by austerity measures. We\u2019re more likely to have caring responsibilities and financial dependants but less likely to control the household\u2019s finances.</p> <p>In employment terms, too, there are very real feminist issues to be addressed: cuts to legal aid that disproportionately affect women; the fact that we\u2019re over-represented in the low-paid service industries, or indeed the unpaid domestic one. The plight of wealthy, employed women frustrated in joining what is essentially an elite private members\u2019 club somewhat pales in comparison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/its-equal-pay-day-it-took-us-69-extra-days-to-catch-up-to-the-men\">It's Equal Pay Day. It took us 69 extra days to catch up to the men | Larissa Waters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If capitalism plays a key role in sustaining gender inequality in all of these ways, it follows that a focus on women in corporate leadership may not just be naive and ultimately useless, but in fact a completely false flag. It\u2019s a mantra that feminism is about nothing more than equality with men, but at its logical conclusion this suggests that the appearance of women in any space currently dominated by men is a success in and of itself.</p> <p>In fact, big corporations and structural inequality are entangled in a symbiotic relationship that will never be addressed by individual women filling the moulds of the men before them. Feminism should challenge this inequality at its roots, rather than simply change its figureheads.</p> <p>The significance of the LSE\u2019s research for feminists, then, should be in what it says about gross economic inequality rather than the limited financial ability of the most privileged women to oppress others. A worthwhile feminist focus would be on the redistribution of wealth to redress the gendered effects of poverty and employment.</p> <p>Indeed, aiming for a society in which everyone has enough to survive would seem a more pressing priority than making the rich richer. Because for as long as the vast majority of women make little more than \u00a3119,000 in their entire working lives, the genders of those doing so in a year mean very little in terms of feminist progress.</p> <p></p>",
  "<h2>\u2018It\u2019s a well made product for a first consumer version\u2019<sup><sub><br></sub></sup></h2> <p>Rating: 4 out of 5 <br></p> <p>The image is very smooth and almost seems to go beyond a set resolution, it\u2019s just a slightly blurred reality. The headset weighs little and is easy to put on, much due to the integrated headphones and software service. <br></p> <p>That said, it doesn\u2019t fit my head. If I tighten it even a little it will hurt after half an hour or so, and without tightening it slides down my nose so things go blurry. I\u2019ve tried adjusting it according to the setup guide but I\u2019m suspecting the hard frame and narrow top band might be giving me issues. The headphones are open backed and don\u2019t close out other audio, I can hear my PC whirring in the background.</p> <p>I think this is a well made product for a first consumer version, very polished in most areas. I would suggest trying to find a demo in a store before purchase though. It might or might not fit your face/head/glasses. Also consider the price including the upcoming Touch motion controllers, which I personally think is an integral part of a VR (virtual reality) system. <br></p> <p><em><a href=\"http://andreasaronsson.com/2016/05/12/three-headsets-three-pictures-three-years/\">Andreas \u201cBOLL\u201d Aronsson</a>, a VR enthusiast in his 30s from Sweden<br></em></p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s amazing and has a great future\u2019<sup><sub><br></sub></sup></h2> <p>Rating: 5 out of 5 </p> <p>I have purchased one and a new PC with the Founders 1080 graphics card.

Aggie excitedly points out that Ahad is dressed to match the puppets \u2013 same orange T-shirt, same green trainers, same hair bunches.</p> <p>The opening minutes are a hit with the children as Ahad makes fun from the simplest of means in a game of \u201ccan it fly?\u201d A sheet of paper is produced and dropped gently to the floor, then gets turned into an aeroplane and then gets ripped to pieces. Soon, the children are handing over their feathers which Ahad clutches in her hands as she attempts to take flight herself. When the first Emily puppet is brought out, and sent high into the sky holding a bunch of balloons, Hilda isn\u2019t the only child who says she wants to play with them.</p> <p>Older children are likely to inquire why Emily is able to fly, and indeed want to know more about her as a character. But if the set-up feels frustratingly thin, there\u2019s a string of jolly encounters once she\u2019s airborne. Ahad produces a series of lumpy clouds with their own personalities: one looks like a cranky man and another comes with its own raindrops, at which point Hilda pulls up her hood. Emily rides a seagull (\u201cyuck,\u201d we all agree) and umbrellas are opened to create a makeshift jungle canopy. A chatty parrot is popular with the front row and a pair of oversized red gloves become crabs for an underwater scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28dbb929eb5acfab81252c4b2eec9f353b796930\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28dbb929eb5acfab81252c4b2eec9f353b796930/0_459_5099_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Let\u2019s Fly at the Little Angel theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let\u2019s Fly is a co-production by the Little Angel and Goblin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Emily\u2019s journey includes a stop-off in London, with recognisable landmarks including the <a href=\"http://www.thegherkinlondon.com/\">Gherkin</a> featured in the set.

  "<p>For how long is it reasonable to leave a TV audience waiting for justice? In the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-fall\">The Fall</a>, it is now more than three years since we first met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/18/jamie-dornan-i-keep-playing-sick-psychopaths-it-worries-me\">Jamie Dornan</a>\u2019s serial killer Paul Spector, and almost two since we saw DSI Stella Gibson finally meet him over the interview table, then later witness his shooting. Did he survive? Did his victim, Rose, locked in the boot of her car for four days? Does anyone even care any more, save those people who weirdly get off on fancying a killer Dornan? </p> <p>None of these questions currently feel pressing; unsurprisingly, given writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/07/the-fall-allan-cubitt-women-violence\">Allan Cubbitt</a>\u2019s entirely relaxed attitude to answering them in the confines of his series. The last outing finished less on a cliffhanger than a demand to the BBC to renew the series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e378df77ecd218a09f4491c3fa818b0fd9ccbff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e378df77ecd218a09f4491c3fa818b0fd9ccbff/0_0_2825_4246/665.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Anderson Stella\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stella performance \u2026 Gillian Anderson returns as DSI Gibson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Sloan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which they obligingly did. And so Gibson is back: persuading us in stylish trailers to reinvest in The Fall by reminding us that it is unlike anything else on television. Largely that\u2019s because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/24/jane-bond-gillian-anderson-next-007-twitter\">Gillian Anderson</a>\u2019s complex \u2013 if not unproblematic \u2013 performance as the detective consumed by her mission. Unrushed, deliberate, she\u2019s almost hypnotic to watch; a distinctive detective in an overcrowded televisual landscape. The question is: will the third series be able to match and develop the character Anderson created?</p> <p>The Fall is divisive: it is accused (rightly, in my opinion) of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/16/the-fall-misogyny-gillian-anderson-tv\">being misogynistic</a>, of glamourising violence, and of some of its characters being in thrall to its perpetrator\u2019s sexy braininess. But the first season was truly gripping; the second, much less so. There were undoubtedly moments \u2013 such as the shifting power balance in the <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/03/the-fall-allan-cubitt-season-2-finale\">interview room</a> as Gibson and Spector eyeballed each other at last \u2013 but it also had a terribly judged subplot with the teenage babysitter, and an episode where Spector literally hid in Gibson\u2019s wardrobe, a flashing warning that things might have been stretched just that bit too far.</p> <p>So what do we want from season three? No more of the latter stuff. In fact, I\u2019d be thrilled if Spector died in the ambulance, and we could watch Gibson make sense of it all without the sexualised strangulations or cat-and-mouse antics, and in the knowledge that she will never bring him to justice. But we do know Spector gets as far as hospital \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKWjuz0trgU\">or so the trailer tells us</a> \u2013 and Stella, of course, is only in Belfast on a mini-secondment, which leaves us all in a bind: without the case she presumably has to go home; with the case, the show could be heading down a dead end. Six more hours of drawing parallels between Gibson and Spector \u2013 their desire for control, their emotional restraint \u2013 doesn\u2019t sound like appointment TV. We must see a shift in the dynamic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cd17a17d05210ad8ac765067e3a17aa1d67282a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cd17a17d05210ad8ac765067e3a17aa1d67282a/0_112_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Dornan Paul Spector The Fall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambulance chasing \u2026 Jamie Dornan as Paul Spector in The Fall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Sloan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team clearly have confidence that they\u2019ve pulled off this third act: even before it has aired, Anderson has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/20/bbc-the-fall-allan-cubbitt-gillian-anderson-dci-stella-gibson\">she expects to play Gibson again next year</a>, and Cubbitt says <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-fall/news/a807281/the-fall-writer-hints-at-a-fourth-series-as-new-pictures-of-jamie-dornan-and-gillian-anderson-debut/\">he\u2019s thinking of storylines beyond Spector</a>. Here\u2019s hoping he manages to have them here. Getting rid of the powerplay between detective and killer would give Stella space to grow as a character beyond the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tvandradioblog/2014/dec/19/-sp-the-fall-an-anatomy-of-dci-stella-gibsons-series-2-blouses\">perfectly pressed silk shirts</a> and dream journalling, while Paul\u2019s absence would allow Rose to own her story, should she survive, and allow his family \u2013 and their babysitter \u2013 to rebuild their lives.

  "<p>The reality of climate change is here, and the science behind our warming planet is clear. July and August 2016 were the hottest months in recorded history. And last year was the hottest on record. Wildfires have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/california-blue-cut-wildfire-san-bernardino-evacuation\">scorched California</a>. Thousand-year floods have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/louisiana-governor-requests-bailout-flood-damage-costs\">devastated Louisiana</a>. Temperatures are soaring. Sea levels are rising. Weather is more extreme. Greenhouse gases have been steadily increasing for decades. </p> <p>But the trove of research and resulting evidence for human-caused climate change still leaves us with questions. Many of us don\u2019t know how climate change will affect us, collectively and individually. We aren\u2019t certain how we are responsible or what can we do about it.</p> <p>With nothing less than the future of our planet at stake, the teaching of facts and promotion of understanding must be the order of the day. That is why we introduced <a href=\"http://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/new-markey-legislation-would-help-educate-americas-young-people-about-climate-change\">the Climate Change Education Act</a> in the US House and the Senate. The legislation would require the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) to create a Climate Change Education Program geared towards teaching students and others about climate change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/fracking-digging-drilling-paris-agreement-fossil-fuels\">No fracking, drilling or digging: it\u2019s the only way to save life on Earth | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In much the same way we teach our children the ABCs as a foundation for a lifetime of learning, we must encourage a national discussion, especially with our youth, about how we can reduce our carbon footprint and serve as stewards of our environment.</p> <p>This Climate Change Education Program would explore climate change solutions, the dangers we face in a warming world, and the small changes in daily routines that can have a profound global impact. It would promote education about national strategies for resilience to the effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and rising sea levels. It would look at how to make sure our infrastructure is safe and reliable. The program would also incorporate the latest scientific and technological discoveries and provide formal and informal learning opportunities to people of all ages.</p> <p>The legislation would establish a grant program to support public outreach programs, improve quality and access to education for green-collar jobs, and build capacity so local communities can address climate mitigation and adaptation issues.</p> <p>We can feel, see and hear the impacts of climate change every day. Here in the United States, families are already preparing to leave their homes as they gradually become submerged, as in the case of Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana. </p> <p>California has been particularly hard hit by the most dire consequences of climate change: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/14/california-drought-sierra-nevada-snowpack-500-year-record-low\">droughts</a>, wildfires and air pollution. Record-breaking drought now running five years has yielded wildfires that have burned up millions of acres. Climate change has led to the first extinction of a species of mammal, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/jun/29/bramble-cay-melomys-australia-extinction-climate-change-great-barrier-reef\">Bramble Cay melomy</a> in Australia. It is also expanding the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as Lyme disease, West Nile fever and water-borne diseases.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/paris-climate-agreement-poised-to-come-into-force\">historic Paris agreement</a> signed last year and adopted this month by the United States has united the countries of the world in action on climate change. To achieve the objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change of avoiding dangerous global warming, all countries of the world will need to do more individually and collectively. </p> <p>If the United States is going to lead this international coalition, it must begin its commitment at home. And that must include educating our people, especially our students and young people, about what we all can and must do to implement solutions to the climate crisis, including the deployment of clean energy and the expansion of energy efficiency. The US must demonstrate how people working together can achieve even greater carbon pollution reductions, grow our economies and create jobs.</p> <p>There is a trove of science behind climate change but there is still much more to learn, especially about the consequences of climate change. It is time we began to learn together, as families, as communities and as a country. If only because we are truly in this together.</p>",

  "<p>Where a confluence of rivers meet the Peruvian city of Iquitos, the world\u2019s largest city to be inaccessible by road, lies Bel\u00e9n, a partially floating shanty town and market where endangered monkeys change hands for a few dollars and wildlife traffickers take orders to stock informal zoos or private collections with the abundant fauna from the world\u2019s largest rainforest.</p> <p>Wildlife is part of the town\u2019s daily trade. A ban on selling bushmeat is openly ignored in Bel\u00e9n\u2019s market. Deep-auburn slabs of the smoked meat of the endangered South America tapir (<em>Tapirus terrestris</em>) are stacked high on trestle tables. The protruding hoof of a peccary or the paw of an agouti betray the fact that there is hunted game on sale.</p> <p>A yellow-footed tortoise (<em>Chelonoid denticulata</em>), <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9008/0\">listed as vulnerable by the IUCN red list</a>, is butchered for the pot while still quivering, its head moves from side to side. The woman cutting up its front-parts remarks: \u201cThis animal dies when it\u2019s in the pot.\u201d Biodiversity served up in all its gory detail. The soft-shelled eggs of the taricaya, an Amazon river turtle (<em>Podocnemis unifilis</em>), also listed as vulnerable, are served in pungent heaps to customers in the rubbish-strewn alleys. </p> <p>Indigenous communities are allowed to hunt and eat wild game but selling the meat is prohibited. But old habits die hard, says Clelia Rengifo, the head of wildlife trafficking control for the regional government of Loreto, Peru\u2019s largest Amazon region which occupies one-third of the country, an area bigger than Germany.</p> <p>Peru\u2019s environmental police rarely seize bushmeat in Bel\u00e9n, because, she says, it is too dangerous. \u201cBefore you know it the people start to gather and there\u2019s a machete flying, a shot fired or a knife appears. It\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d<br></p> <p>The illicit trade in endangered species \u2013 dead or alive \u2013 and how to stop it will be discussed at the <a href=\"https://cites.org/cop17\">17<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Conference of the Parties to Cites</a> in Johannesburg, South Africa, which began at the weekend. The world\u2019s largest ever wildlife conference opened with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/23/wildlife-trade-summit-is-a-do-or-die-moment-for-endangered-animals\">calls for changes to the protection levels of 500 species of wild animals and plants</a>. </p> <p>Peru\u2019s rich biodiversity and poor enforcement makes it a hub for the multi-billion dollar illegal trade which ranks fourth after drug trafficking, arms, and the trafficking of human beings, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/revealed-the-criminals-making-millions-from-illegal-wildlife-trafficking\">one of the largest transnational organised criminal activities</a>. </p> <p>The sale of living wild fauna in is also illegal in Peru. Yet small parrots, locally known as pihuichos, chirp from plastic washing up bowls. Other containers hold terrapins and infant black caimans, which can grow to more than five metres in length as adults.</p> <p>Sensing potential clients, a stallholder pulls a tiny pygmy marmoset and a saddle-backed tamarin from her bun as they emit high-pitched shrieks. The two baby \u2018pocket\u2019 monkeys fit comfortably in the palm of her hand.</p> <p>\u201cTo catch them they had to kill their mothers,\u201d says Noga Shanee, an activist and the co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.neoprimate.org/index.php/en/\">NeoTropical Primate Conservation</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be91a3ff07f98e784f6ec23483816342b1264853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be91a3ff07f98e784f6ec23483816342b1264853/0_0_4032_2888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conservationist Noga Shanee holds a baby Saddle-backed Tamarin with an infant pygmy marmoset on her shoulder in Bel\u00e9n market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conservationist Noga Shanee holds a baby saddle-backed tamarin with an infant pygmy marmoset on her shoulder in Bel\u00e9n market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Collyns/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe knows how to keep them alive but once they\u2019re sold they usually die in a few weeks,\u201d says Shanee, an Israeli who has spent the last decade in Peru rescuing monkeys.<br></p> <p>As the tiny monkeys clamber over her shoulders, she puts on her bravest face. \u201cI really like these monkeys but you should never buy them. You may think you can save them but if you buy them she will understand that \u2018gringos\u2019 \u2013 white people \u2013 like to buy monkeys and they\u2019ll keep on taking them from the wild.\u201d</p> <p>A Bel\u00e9n local who works as an informal tour guide told the Guardian on condition of anonymity that bigger species such as woolly, spider and squirrel monkeys were kept in homes where he sometimes took tourists or collectors working for informal zoos. Collectors from neighbouring Ecuador or Colombia often use small private aircraft to transport animals out of the country, he alleged. </p> <p>Local traffickers buy animals from ribere\u00f1os, poor riverside dwellers, as they come to market in Bel\u00e9n. In secret locations large numbers of tortoises, terrapins or parrots are stored for potential clients, he said. He alleged police officers can be bribed for a small quantity of animals, and documents permitting animals to be transported out of Peru can be bought from corrupt officials. </p> <p>Airport security makes it harder to traffic animals by plane so most are taken upriver along the Amazon to Pucallpa, capital of the neigbouring Ucayali region, and from there by road to Peru\u2019s Pacific coast.</p> <p>No one has ever been jailed for wildlife trafficking in Peru, confirmed Yovana Murillo of the <a href=\"https://peru.wcs.org/en-us/home.aspx\">Wildlife Conservation Society Peru</a>.</p> <p>Responding to allegations of corruption in the regional government, Rengifo said public servants were very badly paid which \u201csometimes led to criminal acts\u201d. Enforcement in this trafficking hub compared unfavourably with other Amazon regions. Between January and July 2016, Loreto had seized only 447 live animals around a third of the 1,478 live animals confiscated in neighbouring San Martin region in a similar period (January and August 2016), according to Peru\u2019s environmental police records. </p> <p>The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has identified 383 animal species being trafficked in Peru over the last decade on well-run routes from more than 40 markets in 10 cities including the capital Lima. Supplied by Iquitos and other Amazon cities, parrots or monkeys are often seized at border crossings. But an estimated nine out of 10 trafficked animals die en route, says Murillo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83fb82247ead2fbe7f660c5d0d945ab3b93e160f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83fb82247ead2fbe7f660c5d0d945ab3b93e160f/0_351_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bald-headed uakari monkey grooms Gudrun Sperrer, founder of the Pilpintuwasi Animal Orphanage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bald-headed Uakari monkey grooms Gudrun Sperrer, founder of the Pilpintuwasi Animal Orphanage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Collyns/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If they are lucky, rescued monkeys will be taken to <a href=\"http://www.amazonanimalorphanage.org/\">Pilpintuwasi Butterfly Farm and Animal Orphanage</a>.

That will mean future generations are already dead,\u201d she said despondently. Increasing numbers of well-meaning tourists who buy baby animals thinking they can rescue them had worsened the situation, she added.</p> <p>But even the people employed to protect wildlife were involved, she alleged. \u201cIf they\u2019re told: \u2018We\u2019re going to take this monkey to a zoo where it\u2019s being taken care of, where we have the money to study the species\u2019, they make papers, they sign papers that are fake.\u201d</p>",

Is a doctor\u2019s note now to be considered part of sportsmanship?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/25/unfair-advantage-bradley-wiggins-banned-substances-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54tfb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2749475\"            data-video-name=\"\u2018I did not seek an unfair advantage\u2019, says Bradley Wiggins on banned substances \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e7a6eae4b03598d1ce869f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/25/160925WigginsMarr_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/25/160925WigginsMarr.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/25/160925WigginsMarr_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/25/unfair-advantage-bradley-wiggins-banned-substances-video\">\u2018I did not seek an unfair advantage\u2019, says Bradley Wiggins on banned substances</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And on the eve of the Rio Paralympics, there were reports of unhappiness within the British camp over allegations that classifications were being \u2013 how shall we say? \u2013 manipulated in the pursuit of more medals.

But the story is starting to look a little different.</p> <p>The shock here \u2013 if it is a shock \u2013 should not be that UK sports officials are as adept at playing the system as anyone else \u2013 within but sometimes also outside the law. It should rather be the persistence of the myth that only foreigners (especially Russians) cheat, and that British sport across the board \u2013 just because it is British \u2013 is cleaner, more honest and, yes, more innocent than everyone else\u2019s.

  "<p>When the Jamaican writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/marlon-james\">Marlon James</a> won the Man Booker prize last year with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/13/marlon-james-wins-the-man-booker-prize-2015\"><em>A Brief History of Seven Killings</em></a> he became internationally famous, yet his earlier two novels had marked him out as a writer of great originality and talent.</p> <p>Jacob Ross is another writer who deserves a much wider audience. He has been a British citizen since the 80s but was originally from Grenada, and his first two books of short stories powerfully evoked Grenadian society. In <em>Song for Simone</em> he explored childhood. In <em>A Way to Catch the Dust</em> he dug deep into the psyches of a cross-section of Grenadians, most noticeably in \u201cRum an Coke\u201d, a story about a mother who injects heroin into the neck of her son\u2019s sleeping drug dealer. In 2008 he published his first novel,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/25/fiction2\"><em> Pynter Bender</em></a>, about a blind boy raised by women on a pre-independence Caribbean island still struggling with the legacy of slavery.</p> <p>Ross\u2019s new novel, the first of a trilogy, marks a departure into crime thrillers. Michael \u201cDigger\u201d Digson is barely out of school and unable to afford the fees for university. Hanging over him is his mother\u2019s unexplained disappearance, during a demonstration against the rape of a woman, when he was a child. The rapist, the son of an influential politician, was whisked off the island. Digger\u2019s father is also a powerful man, the police commissioner. His mother worked for him as a maid and Digger is known as his \u201coutside child\u201d \u2013 a child who turned up at the gates of his father\u2019s big house to be fed some coins through the railings. The novel opens with a crime that leads to Digger\u2019s reluctant recruitment into the police force by DC Chilman, a drunkard who is unscrupulously plucking a new, young squad off the streets. Digger has two extraordinary skills that make him stand out: an ability to recognise voices, and the skill of reading human bones \u2013 but only in the dark, under LED lights.</p> <p>As a plainclothes officer in this rogue police force, Digger has his work cut out for him. It\u2019s his job to pursue cases of missing persons; these cases lead him into the island\u2019s sordid underbelly. There\u2019s Nathan, possibly gay, who left his mother\u2019s house one day and never returned. At the isolated Fire Baptist Church the pastor has complete control over subdued women trapped in a compound patrolled by threatening \u201cwatchmen\u201d dangling knotted ropes. A girl disappears in a remote Indian community where intergenerational incest is the norm and a father would rather kill his daughter than see her in a relationship with a \u201cblackfella\u201d. Communities and individuals are full of secrets, silences and lies, and often prove impenetrable. Digger decides to investigate his mother\u2019s disappearance, in spite of being warned away. As the novel progresses and he unpicks the complex web of relationships that spreads beneath the surface of this society, he discovers painful truths and some shocking surprises.</p> <p>Ross\u2019s characters are always powerfully delineated through brilliant visual descriptions, dialogue that trips off the tongue, and keenly observed behaviour. He excels at creating empathetic female characters. Women hold communities together; they raise the children alone, they turn to each other for support, they are let down by the men. When Miss Stanislaus joins the police force, we encounter a prettily dressed, sweetly smiling, ballbusting heroine who crushes a bullying male colleague with a smart putdown \u2013 the novel is not without many moments of humour.</p> <p>But grief and loss are the strongest seams running through this book \u2013 the grief of those whose loved ones meet a premature death, the loss of those whose lives were cut unnecessarily short. <em>The Bone Readers</em> is a page-turner, but its insights and language are equally testament to a literary novel of impressive depth and acuity.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Bone Readers</em> is published by Peepal Tree.

  "<p>Alabama\u2019s chief supreme court justice, Roy Moore, will go to trial on Wednesday to learn whether he will keep his seat as the land\u2019s top judge. He hopes, almost certainly, to be thrown out.</p> <p>Moore has picked a political fight that may not make sense to people elsewhere. But in Alabama, his intentions are clear: by carrying his fight against the federal government to the brink of judicial destruction, he is appealing to the rebellious nature of Alabamians and positioning himself to run for governor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/alabama-judge-roy-moore-suspended-gay-marriage-stance\">Alabama judge Roy Moore suspended over anti-gay marriage stance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stakes are high for him. He will turn 70 in February, which means he will not be allowed to run for a supreme court spot during the next election, in 2018. And as the sitting chief justice, he has no power to change the trajectory of gay marriage, the issue that brought him to this point. So the worst punishment the Alabama court of judiciary \u2013 a court for judges \u2013 could inflict on him would be to allow him to serve out his term, fading into obscurity as neither martyr nor decision-maker.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the irony,\u201d said Wayne Flynt, a historian at Auburn University. \u201cHe needs them to remove him.\u201d</p> <p>The sparring began in February last year. That\u2019s when a US district court judge <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/12/alabama-same-sex-marriages-federal-judge\">ordered Alabama\u2019s county-level judges</a> to issue marriage licenses to anyone who qualified, regardless of gender or orientation. </p> <p>That night, Moore sent an email out to all those lower judges, with a clear order of his own: \u201cNo probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent with Article 1, Section 36.03, of the Alabama Constitution or ... 30-1-19, Ala. Code 1975.\u201d</p> <p>No probate judge <em>shall</em>.</p> <p>The rest of the citation was legal filigree. The word \u201cshall\u201d made it an order, and artfully recalled the source of Moore\u2019s fame and power: standing up to the federal government in 2003, over the display of the Ten Commandments in his courthouse. <em>Thou shall, and shall not</em>.</p> <p>A special judicial court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/alabama-judge-roy-moore-suspended-gay-marriage-stance\">removed Moore from his position</a> after that showdown, but the people of Alabama immediately elected him back to it. </p> <p>Moore can do that \u2013 intuit the counterintuitive, surge with the insurgency \u2013 because those Alabama characteristics shaped him from birth. He grew up on Sand Mountain, an Appalachian foothill in north Alabama where his family looked like the other families on the mountain: poor, white, Baptist. He was smart, and a believer, and worked his way through West Point and a turn in Vietnam. He returned to Sand Mountain with a law degree and won an election to a local judicial district. He might have swung his gavel forever in near-anonymity except for one thing: his devotion to the Ten Commandments, which he installed in his courtroom.</p> <p>After a suit by the American Civil Liberties Union in 1997, a judge in Montgomery ordered Moore to either take down the icons or add other diverse documents for context. The following conflict taught Moore a lesson he carried throughout his career: he lost his appeal over the commandments on a decision by a federal judge. But the ensuing pro-Moore rally brought about 25,000 supporters to the steps of the state capital in Montgomery.</p> <p>Moore had glimpsed the power, in Alabama, of one man shaking his fist at the federal government.</p> <p>It\u2019s a trait that goes all the way back to the civil war, and the state\u2019s humiliation in Reconstruction. \u201cEver since the secession, Alabama has been trying to find other ways to accomplish the same end,\u201d said Flynt, the historian. \u201cLately, that has meant claiming a different set of rules apply to us.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Alabama has wielded the 10th amendment to the US constitution on a variety of issues \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/12/alabama-judges-gay-marriage-licenses\">same-sex marriage, for one</a> \u2013 to claim sovereignty as a state.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is we\u2019ve been inconsistent,\u201d Flynt said. \u201cAlabama would never support Massachusetts in a fight to legalize abortions in the third trimester. Or the state of Washington, if it wanted to ban all guns. We would say those states must bend to national opposition. We want it both ways.\u201d</p> <p>After his email last year, a judicial ethics commission suspended Moore, saying his order to lower judges was an abuse of power. In a 32-page complaint, the commission said Moore had \u201cflagrantly disregarded and abused his authority\u201d and \u201cabandoned his role as a neutral and detached chief administrator of the judicial system\u201d.</p> <p>Moore struck back, saying the commission \u201chas chosen to listen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/alabama-gay-marriage-same-sex-ambrosia-starling-roy-moore\">people like Ambrosia Starling</a>, a professed transvestite, and other gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals, as well as organizations which support their agenda\u201d.</p> <p>Now Moore aims to once again parlay a possible setback in Montgomery into defiant victory. A recent poll by one of the state\u2019s most influential conservative groups, the Alabama Forestry Association, found that Moore led other possible contenders by a large margin among likely Republican voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/alabama-gay-marriage-same-sex-ambrosia-starling-roy-moore\">Fighting gay marriage law is 'rude': polite Alabama drag queen is voice for equality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an open secret here that Moore has his eye on the governorship, or at least attorney general,\u201d said Richard Cohen, president of the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org\">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, one of Moore\u2019s most consistent opponents. Losing his trial may help his political aspirations, Cohen said, but that shouldn\u2019t be a consideration in court. \u201cIt\u2019s high time the judiciary throws out the ayatollah of Alabama.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to say how successful Moore might be in politics, regardless.</p> <p>He may have spent his career attempting to re-create Alabama in the image of his beloved Sand Mountain, and doing so has tapped into Alabama\u2019s idiosyncratic, sometimes backward, sometimes noble yearning for self determination. But over the decades, the state has changed. Figures whom Moore emulates, such as the late governor George C Wallace, now embarrass Alabamians. In both of Moore\u2019s previous runs for governor, polls have shown that his constituency embraces his ideals, but finds his approach distasteful.</p> <p>\u201cBeing a Baptist, I can tell him that most Baptists don\u2019t agree with his methods,\u201d Flynt said. \u201cPeople here don\u2019t want to be portrayed as ridge-running hayseeds anymore.\u201d<br></p>",

They also looked at the cost efficiency of each car, including vehicle, fuel, and maintenance costs.

The lifetime of a car is estimated at 14 years and about 170,000 miles. As co-author Marco Miotti explained,</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>We use parameters that reflect the U.S. consumer experience when going to buy a new car.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>As the chart in the lower right corner of the above figure shows, when only accounting for the vehicle purchase cost, gasoline-powered cars are the cheapest. However, hybrid and electric vehicles have lower fuel and regular maintenance costs. In the US, there are also federal rebates that bring the consumer costs down further yet, so the cheapest electric cars (in cost per distance driven) cost less than the cheapest gasoline cars. When including state tax rebates like in California, electric cars are by far the best deal available.</p> <p>Some might object that it\u2019s unfair to include tax rebates, and the MIT app allows for a comparison with or without those rebates. However, as Trancik noted, the app is aimed at consumers, and for them the rebates are a reality. Moreover, the cost of gasoline in the USA does not reflect the costs inflicted by its carbon pollution via climate change. Over the lifetime of the car, the electric car tax rebates roughly offset the gasoline<a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/carbon-the-huge-overlooked-fossil-fuel-subsidy.html\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/carbon-the-huge-overlooked-fossil-fuel-subsidy.html\">carbon pollution subsidy</a>.

It is embarrassing for the company that it failed to protect its own former premises from being squatted and doubly embarrassing that this luxury building, in far better shape than many of the buildings they fill with property guardians, has been left empty when it could have provided low-cost, temporary accommodation \u2013 complete with tasteful carpets, luxury shower, high-speed Wi-Fi and air conditioning \u2013 to several people priced out of the extortionate London rental market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/27/london-protesters-occupy-former-hq-of-property-management-firm\">London protesters occupy former HQ of property management firm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, there is a more serious purpose to this occupation. We need to highlight the major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing\" title=\"\">housing crisis</a> across the UK, especially in London, and to come up with some sustainable and workable solutions.</p> <p>Camelot is one of dozens of property guardian companies. More and more are springing up. The companies have the potential to make handsome profits out of some of the poorest people who cannot afford commercial rents. And the owners of the empty buildings can secure reductions in the rates they pay to local authorities if they fill these buildings with property guardians.</p> <p>Property guardianship can exploit those at the bottom of the housing food chain while making big profits for those at the top of the tree. It has taken off because of the housing crisis and is a symptom of it. Commercial rents are obscenely expensive, especially in London, and the pool of social housing has shrunk to unsustainable levels.</p> <p>There are more than a million empty buildings across the UK and a fairer way needs to be found to use them to provide housing for those in need.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/nov/14/squatting-laws-landlords-housing-providers\" title=\"\">squatting of empty residential properties</a> previously provided temporary shelter for some of the most vulnerable people in society but the combination of criminalising this practice in 2011, in a law we would like to see repealed, coupled with the explosion in property guardian companies, has reduced this source of shelter. As a result we are hearing more stories of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/people-are-sharing-a-message-to-help-homeless-people-in-the-cold-a6815806.html\" title=\"\">homeless people freezing to death</a> on the streets during the winter months.

The guardians are licensees rather than tenants and so have fewer rights, but what is the definition of a violation of the licence that can result in a speedy eviction in less than the 28 days\u2019 notice required under eviction law? And do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/feb/04/hmos-housing-benefit-english-seaside\" title=\"\">houses in multiple occupation (HMOs)</a> rules apply to property guardians? These rules limit the number of people sharing kitchens, bathrooms etc.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the poorest and most vulnerable people in society have the right to access safe and decent housing. Empty buildings must be utilised urgently, not for commercial gain as property guardian companies and the building owners currently do, but to provide not-for-profit social housing for the tens of thousands of homeless people who urgently need a safe place to live.</p> <p>John McDonnell has called for all buildings that have been empty for more than six months to be used to provide social housing. <a href=\"http://www.squashcampaign.org/mps-briefing-on-legal-aid-bill-amendments/#.V-ppuZc_Jtc.blogger\" title=\"\">We support the shadow chancellor\u2019s call</a>. The causes of the housing crisis are complex and long-term solutions cannot be put into place by tomorrow morning. But we have a short-term solution staring us in the face.

Open up empty buildings now and let homeless people get off the streets before temperatures really start to drop.</p>",
  "<p>By now, you know what Destiny is: a hybrid first-person shooter and massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, it throws players into a vast space opera as they fight four alien races to defend an embattled future Earth on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>Or more reductively, you play as a space wizard and shoot aliens in the head to get cool new guns and make numbers go up.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a tricky concept to get your head around. But what Rise of Iron, the fourth expansion to the game, reveals is that developer Bungie has only just figured out what\u2019s going on.</p> <p>Rise of Iron brings Destiny into its third year, and picks up with the game\u2019s wider story in a calm position. The two-year-long arc that saw players follow the Hive from Earth to the Moon, descend into the Hellmouth to defeat Crota, and then fly to Saturn to take on his daddy Oryx is now over.</p> <p>In its place is a new, stand-alone yarn about the Lords of Iron: figures from Destiny\u2019s prehistory whose last surviving member, Lord Saladin, is already known to fans through his association with the elite multiplayer activity, Iron Banner.</p> <p>When the Fallen (that\u2019s the alien race that has a personality, as opposed to the bug demons, the robots or the Space Marines from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/22/warhammer-40000-forbidden-stars-review-an-absorbing-evening-of-combat\">Warhammer 40K</a>) reappears in a part of Earth that\u2019s seen little combat for years, they unearth Siva, a forgotten technology that lets them reprogram their bodies, running the risk of Earth falling for good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"033f028bbcee14242dec985cd469a14560a8dedf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/033f028bbcee14242dec985cd469a14560a8dedf/63_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Destiny: Rise of Iron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rise of Iron feels like it was built from the ground up by looking at what players actually spent their time doing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Activision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as 2015\u2019s Taken King introduced players to the Dreadnaught, the floating home of Oryx, so Rise of Iron has its own new area: the Plaguelands, a section of Old Russia that\u2019s been warped by the presence of Siva and colonised by the biohacker Fallen.</p> <p>It\u2019s extremely vast, a facet of the fact that this is the first Destiny expansion limited to current generation consoles (PS3 and Xbox 360 players will still be able to play Destiny, but their game world is forever frozen in September 2016). The first time you enter a zone of the Plaguelands called Lord\u2019s Watch, and see guns firing off in the distance, you think it\u2019s a classic Bungie skybox. But a few minutes zooming on your Sparrow vehicle and you\u2019re actually there, up on top of the guns, trying to disable them.</p> <p>Not quite so vast, though, is the main campaign. From the start of the first mission to the end of the last, it took me a shade under three hours, and I wasn\u2019t rushing things. When Lord Saladin told me it was time to \u201cfinish this\u201d I was genuinely confused \u2013 I\u2019d barely started it.</p> <p>But the end of the campaign is only the start of Rise of Iron. The Plaguelands, like the Dreadnaught before them, are more jam-packed with stuff than any of Destiny\u2019s previous environments, and simply wandering around doing the odd patrol mission and shooting aliens in the head will soon have you finding tantalising threads to pull, exposing hidden mechanics and collectibles.</p> <p>There\u2019s dormant Siva to collect, hidden in difficult-to-access areas; there are Siva caches, which can be presented to the Archon\u2019s Forge for a shot at a public event similar to last year\u2019s Court of Oryx; there are dead ghosts, hidden chests and Iron Medallions to find \u2013 those last of which are part of a quest chain which grants players an updated version of the Gjallahorn, a rocket launcher which dominated the first Destiny.</p> <p>(There\u2019s also the raid. But the game came out a week ago, and although the raid itself was released soon after, we\u2019re not quite ready to take on Destiny\u2019s highest-level content quite yet. It will be rated separately.)</p> <p>Against that background, then, it feels like the short campaign isn\u2019t Bungie dropping the ball, but finally getting that the scripted single-player missions aren\u2019t really what we\u2019re here for. To an extent, it\u2019s a shame: the missions in Rise of Iron are so much better than those in the original game that it feels like they come from a completely different team. From the large-scale stuff \u2013 this release actually has a coherent story \u2013 to the minor attention to detail, like the fact that for the first time, characters refer to your Guardian using actual gendered pronouns, as opposed to just calling them \u201cGuardian\u201d over and over.</p> <p>But Rise of Iron feels like it was built from the ground up by looking at what players actually spent their time doing, and catering to that, rather than forcing them down the paths Bungie would like them to go. It\u2019s not quite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/15/steven-moffat-doctor-who-sherlock\">fan-service</a>, although it does veer close to it at times: not just the reintroduction of Gjallahorn, but also small asides from your ghost about \u201cliving in your backpack\u201d, and grimoire cards repositioning your character as an outstanding hero, rather than just one Guardian amongst many.</p> <p>I like this sort of thing \u2013 but then, I would. According to the game, I\u2019m edging up on my 40,000th kill; I\u2019ve played through over 200 strikes; I\u2019ve even won almost 300 multiplayer matches, and if you\u2019d asked me before I checked that, I\u2019d have told you that I didn\u2019t play multiplayer much.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve never touched Destiny before, there\u2019s still hope. The game is now available in a buy-once, play-everything bundle for a genuinely impressive \u00a335. Given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/10/destiny-the-dark-below-should-players-stomach-the-cost\">the stick Destiny received</a> back when its first two expansions came out for \u00a320 each \u2013 and containing much, much less than Rise of Iron does \u2013 it\u2019s yet another example of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/destiny-halo-bungie-massively-multiplayer-shooter\">how Bungie is learning as it goes</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39jvouEt44s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/39jvouEt44s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Official Rise of Iron launch trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Some of the price difference is accounted for by Bungie\u2019s latest revenue stream: a real-money shop for cosmetic items. Even that has received a smart update, though, with the latest tranche of trinkets focusing, not on how your character looks, but how your character\u2019s guns look. After all, those are front and centre most of the time you play, and they\u2019re the real star of the game.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve been playing the game for a long time, too, you\u2019ll be pleased to hear that unlike previous updates, your favourite weapons can stick around, being infused up to the current max level. That has its downsides, though: there\u2019s no thrill of finding a new item in your arsenal if you\u2019re just going to tear it down to bring your old scout rifle up to snuff.</p> <p>More to the point, it means that if you do pick the game up fresh \u2013 or even just come back after a lengthy absence \u2013 the \u201creset button\u201d typical of MMO updates isn\u2019t there. You will feel a bit under-equipped compared to veterans, and there\u2019s not an easy way out other than just playing your way up to an equally big gear collection.</p> <p>With Rise of Iron, Bungie has finally learned what the Destiny fanbase actually wants, and seems on its way to giving it to them. Now it needs to work out how to convince others that they need to be in the Destiny fanbase in the first place. That task, I think, is one that this latest, and last, update might struggle with.</p> <p><strong>Activision; PS4 (version tested)/Xbox One; Pegi rating: 16+</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/17/destiny-rise-of-iron-first-look\"><strong>Destiny Rise of Iron first look: new strike, new maps \u2013 just don\u2019t hug the wolves</strong></a><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/27/egx-2016-our-13-favourite-video-games-from-the-festival\"><strong>EGX 2016: our 13 favourite video games from the festival</strong></a><br></li> </ul>",

The government\u2019s devolution agenda, moving power from Whitehall to local regions, may have been championed by a Conservative chancellor, but has been, for the most part, taken up by Labour councils keen for greater control over their own destiny. </p> <p>Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, says that despite Labour council leaders controlling more than 50% of the UK economy, the nature of that power had not yet completely sunk in. \u201cWe have not fully realised the potential of what we have got and this is what we are going to be working on,\u201d she says. In a changing political landscape being shaped by the Brexit vote but also by the devolution of powers out to the regions, especially in the north, Labour needs to reclaim the agenda. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken our foot off the accelerator as a party, but there is now recognition that devolution is here and it\u2019s going to stay,\u201d says Blake. </p> <p>And it is not just those that have embraced devolution and metro mayors who believe they have much to offer Labour.

Brought in to replace England v England Youth internationals as a Cup final warm-up, it took place five times between 1970 and 1974, and then never again. The results aren\u2019t even included on <a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/thefacup/more/pastresults#\">the FA\u2019s official website</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/nov/08/joy-of-six-fa-cup-first-round\">The Joy of Six: FA Cup first round memories | Scott Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the first two years, the play-off was held on the eve of the Cup final, at a separate London venue to Wembley \u2013 the idea being that punters at a loose end in the big smoke would go along, as they had done for the England friendlies. Despite serving as the undercard to two classic finals, the games failed to fire the public imagination \u2013 perhaps understandably, given that the teams\u2019 fans weren\u2019t actually in town.</p> <p>The first play-off winners were Manchester United, who beat second division Watford 2-0 at Highbury the night before Chelsea took on Leeds. Bobby Charlton and George Best both featured, with Brian Kidd scoring both goals for United, who had failed to break down Don Revie\u2019s Leeds in 270 minutes of semi-final action, going down 1-0 in the second replay. A crowd of more than 15,000 turned out \u2013 not a roaring success, but something to work with.</p> <p>The problems really set in the following year, when the FA decided to hold the match between Stoke and Everton at \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Selhurst Park. The Potters won 3-2, but barely 5,000 fans made the long trip to south London. The Stoke Sentinel reported \u201centertainment worthy of a better response than a meagre crowd\u201d as Stoke\u2019s all-time top scorer, John Ritchie, bagged the winner. Technically, this was the club\u2019s highest FA Cup finish until 2011, when they reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/14/manchester-city-stoke-city-fa-cup\">their first final</a>.</p> <p>With interest dwindling, the FA took a bold decision \u2013 moving the match to the following pre-season, some three months after the respective Cup final. The idea of the match serving as a warm-up match in the capital was also knocked on the head, so Stoke \u2013 who had won the League Cup in the interim, but lost to Arsenal for the second consecutive year in the FA Cup semi-finals \u2013 travelled to St Andrew\u2019s to face Birmingham City, newly promoted from Division Two.</p> <p>The Blues became the only second-tier side to claim a third-placed finish, and earned victory in a novel way \u2013 winning the FA Cup\u2019s first penalty shootout. A total of 25,841 fans turned up for the game \u2013 vindicating the FA\u2019s decision to allow one side to host the match. Opinion was divided on the penalty shootout format \u2013 the Sunday Times called it a \u201ccoconut shy ritual\u201d \u2013 and it would not be seen again in the FA Cup for another 20 years.</p> <p>Having reached the Cup final in 1971 and 1972, Arsenal could be forgiven for a lack of interest after being humbled in the 1973 semi-final by the eventual shock winners, Sunderland. They hosted the play-off match, again held in August, but were beaten 3-1 by Wolves, with Derek Dougan scoring twice. Highbury\u2019s second play-off game drew 6,000 more fans than the first, but Arsenal were involved. The FA began to sense that this wouldn\u2019t catch on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c37cb264f474ea938a7c446b8eeecb48af04c7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c37cb264f474ea938a7c446b8eeecb48af04c7c/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A small group of fans are escorted out of Highbury by the police prior to kick-off.

It\u2019s a collection that has been used by other researchers working in artificial intelligence and which is currently available for download in its entirety <a href=\"http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mbweb/\">from the University of Toronto</a>.</p> <p>Forster says that she \u201calways appreciates an interesting use of words\u201d, but while Hostile Witness is available to download for free, no one asked her permission to use her novel as raw material to train a computer.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m still thinking in the old way, that a reader will read my book \u2013 it didn\u2019t even occur to me that a machine could read my book. What I found curious was that these were referred to as \u2018free books written by as yet unpublished authors\u2019 because my state is very different,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Like many of the novels in the Book Corpus collection, the edition of Hostile Witness used in the research was published on Smashwords and includes a copyright declaration that reserves \u201call rights\u201d, specifies that the ebook is \u201clicensed for your personal enjoyment only\u201d, and offers the reader thanks for \u201crespecting the hard work of this author\u201d.

Realism overlying a fantasy.\u201d</p> <p>The flow of the dialogue is very important, she continues. \u201cI am very cognizant of using modern diction and age-appropriate word choices. If my female character is 24 she\u2019s not going to speak in a formal manner. Conversations between the hero and heroine have realistic word choices, but there is additionally an element of fantasy there. What they want a hero to say, but what might not actually occur in real life. That\u2019s what readers want and expect from a romance novel.\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy isn\u2019t sure how to respond to the idea that her work has been used for an entirely different purpose to the one she intended, a purpose that may result in services to make the tech giant a lot of money.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to gauge the use of my work and the exact purpose for its use without having seen it in action,\u201d she says. \u201cMy assumption would be they purchased a copy of the book originally.

It was that he did it with the biggest audience he could find, in an attempt to sear her weight fluctuation into the public consciousness, forever changing how she would be remembered.</p> <p>Then on Monday night, in a twist of cosmic justice, Trump \u2013 now the Republican nominee for president \u2013 was presented with a bigger audience for his comments about Machado\u2019s weight than he ever could have imagined, or wanted.</p> <p>In what has been billed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">the most-watched debate in presidential history</a>, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made Trump\u2019s remarks to Machado a centerpiece of their first televised clash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">citing the name-calling</a> \u2013 in particular, Trump calling her \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d in reference to her Latina origins \u2013 as a prime example of her opponent\u2019s demeaning views about women.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s treatment of Machado reached its nadir in January 1997 when, having put the recently crowned Miss Universe on a stringent diet and exercise regime, he scheduled a trip with her to a New York City gym. There he blindsided her with dozens of cameramen, who gathered to film her jumping rope, lifting weights and pedaling a stationary bike. Trump cast himself in the role of disapproving dad, leaning over Machado as she hid her mortification behind a show of charms only the world\u2019s top beauty queen could have mustered, laughing along with reporters and even once planting a kiss on Trump\u2019s cheek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"182c369144cbcc05e3426777492f101cf5a3bc56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/182c369144cbcc05e3426777492f101cf5a3bc56/0_0_1478_1790/826.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Machado of Venezuela reacts as she is crowned Miss Universe on 17 May 1996.\" width=\"826\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Machado of Venezuela reacts as she is crowned Miss Universe on 17 May 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Draper/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although she appeared happy, smiling for the crowd of cameras as she dutifully skipped rope, she tells the Guardian she felt like a mouse in a cage, running endlessly on her fixed wheel for the entertainment of others. \u201cI was in some gym in New York like a mouse,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at that mouse: how she run, how she jump, how she make exercise. Like that. In that moment is when \u2026 problems come to me and start.\u201d</p> <p>The media loved the spectacle, and so did Trump, who didn\u2019t hesitate to pass out some memorable if fallacious tidbits himself. \u201cShe weighed 118 pounds or 117 pounds and she went up to 170, so this is somebody who likes to eat,\u201d he said in an interview at the time. In fact Machado says she gained only a fraction of that weight but she didn\u2019t dare correct him; she was already frightened he\u2019d make good on a threat to strip her of her crown if she didn\u2019t follow through on the performance at the gym. (Trump\u2019s campaign did not return a request for comment.)</p> <p>Machado never did lose her crown, but she lost her health for a time. Though she had never suffered from eating disorders previously, in the years that followed the ordeal at the gym, she struggled with anorexia and bulimia. It took five years before she was fully recovered, and longer before she could talk about what she went through. Now she hopes to use the insights gleaned to help teenagers struggling to love their bodies.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter what, no matter who tells you that you don\u2019t look good, that is only outside,\u201d she said, speaking partly, perhaps, to her younger self. \u201cYou are more than some weight. You are more than some phase. You are more than if you are short or tall, or you are black or you are white, or you are skinny or fat or whatever. Your value is how you can work, how you can feel for the people around you.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIn this moment 20 years later, the only thing I need to say is I\u2019m a really happy person. I\u2019m a very successful person. I have my family, my daughter, my career, my dreams, my ideas.\u201d Referring to Trump\u2019s character, she said: \u201cAnd he can\u2019t be a president of the United States of America.\u201d</p> <p>That Machado is thriving these days was readily apparent from where she sat in her publicist\u2019s fourth-floor office in West Hollywood, and apparent in many different realms. She has traded pageants for success as an actor, starring in a string of telenovelas \u2013 a childhood dream come true. She is also a successful businesswoman, with a line of products bearing her name. And she is the proud mother of a seven-year-old girl, whose privacy she fiercely protects; a question about whether she would encourage her daughter to compete in beauty pageants was met with stern disapproval.</p> <p>More recently, she has added another title to her list of identities: activist. In June,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/former-miss-universe-civil-rights-legend-delores-huerta-team-up-against-trump/2016/06/15/a287616e-3313-11e6-8758-d58e76e11b12_story.html\"> Machado teamed up with civil rights icon Dolores Huerta</a> in Virginia to join immigrant advocacy groups in encouraging Latinos to register \u2013 and to vote for Clinton. She took her own advice to heart, too. On 19 August she became a registered US citizen, pledging in a<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJS8lOEjhGV/\"> post on Instagram</a> to cast her ballot for Clinton. Later that month she traveled to Florida to lend her star power to a Clinton campaign drive to register Latino voters, posting video excerpts from the trip to social media accounts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"I so proud and inspiration to be a U.S. Citizen!

Both have been broadly insulted by Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">has called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d</a> and regularly refers to women as animals; Machado has the dubious distinction of being the recipient of both racial and gender-specific slurs, a powerful reference point that certainly isn\u2019t lost on the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cAlicia Machado has seen first hand the dangerous impact Trump\u2019s hateful and divisive rhetoric can have on people,\u201d a Clinton spokesperson said of Machado\u2019s involvement with the campaign. \u201cAs a Latina, as a first-time voter and as a respected leader in the Latino community, Alicia has become an invaluable voice of our campaign to help mobilize Latinos against Trump\u2019s bigoted agenda and to educate the community about Hillary\u2019s plans to build a better future for them.\u201d</p> <p>In the first presidential debate on Monday, Machado\u2019s value could scarcely have been more evident.

Trump tried to deflect the damaging line of inquiry, saying he had actually been questioning her stamina.

And, for the first time all debate, Trump had noticeably lost his cool, switching focus to offensive comments he had made about TV personality Rosie O\u2019Donnell and saying: \u201cI think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\u201d</p> <p>Another measure of the attack\u2019s effectiveness came the following morning, when Trump was asked on Fox and Friends what, if anything, from the debate had gotten under his skin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">Without hesitation he singled out Machado</a>. \u201cShe was the worst we ever had, the worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible,\u201d he said of the former beauty queen.</p> <p>\u201cShe was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a problem,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe had a real problem, not only that, her attitude and we had a real problem with her. Hillary went back into the years and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn\u2019t quite that way, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/fat-people-rise-up-we-could-swing-this-election\">Fat people, rise up!

It\u2019s a similar case with his continued insistence on how right he is to call women out for their weight. Machado understands this, perhaps even more acutely than Clinton, because she\u2019s lived it; and she is willing to relive and keep reliving this painful episode if it means shedding light on a man she feels has no business anywhere near the Oval Office.</p> <p>On a call organized by the Clinton campaign on Tuesday afternoon billed as a chance to let Machado respond to Trump\u2019s most recent attacks, the former beauty queen was much more interested in talking about his Democratic rival, whose mention of her story in the debate the night before had moved her to tears. She \u201cnever imagined it would matter to someone so powerful\u201d, she said. </p> <p>But as someone who straddles two powerful voting blocs this election cycle, Machado is a double threat to Trump, and she feels that her celebrity means she has a responsibility to speak up about her experiences when they can help people. \u201cIf I can be a voice for my Latino community in this moment, I will do it,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a matter of Trump: a few years ago she survived a battle with breast cancer, and as a person of faith, she said she struggled to make sense of why God sent her such a challenge. Tearing up ever so slightly for the first time in an hour-long interview, she said she finally determined it was because she needed to share her story: \u201cPeople believe in my words,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople look at me as a strong person. That is my character \u2013 I\u2019m a strong woman.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has mounted a forceful defence of immigration from the EU and elsewhere before his party conference speech, causing a fresh split in his shadow cabinet.</p> <p> The Labour leader is expected to use his speech to promise a Labour government will not \u201csow division\u201d by promising to cut immigration.</p> <p> His position suggests Labour will not respond to the Brexit vote by seeking curbs on free movement of people across the EU, but senior shadow cabinet ministers have said there must be controls and the current system is in chaos.<br></p> <p> Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday morning, Corbyn said he understood \u201cthe problems that can come in some areas\u201d, which is why he would create a \u201cmigrant impact fund\u201d to ease pressure on public services.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMigrants that have come to this country make an enormous contribution to it. Our conference understands that and Tom Watson put that case very well about the work that migrants have done in the NHS and education and other industries ... we should live with that but also understand the number of British people.\u201d</p> <p> Pointing out that numbers vary from year to year, Corbyn said there were many industries such as farming that depended on migrant labour.</p> <p> Asked if people should stop worrying about immigration, he said: \u201cWe have to allay people\u2019s concerns about the impact ... and recognise the huge contribution made to our economy and the numbers of people working in the NHS that are pretty crucial to the survival of the NHS.\u201d</p> <p> Corbyn suggested the UK should continue to accept free movement from the EU, while maintaining access to the single market on the same basis as other member states.</p> <p>But some of his frontbench allies were already striking a different tone, including Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, and Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary.</p> <p> In a conference intervention, Burnham will say: \u201cLabour must face up fully to this fact: millions of our lifelong supporters voted to leave the EU and voted for change on immigration.\u201d</p> <p> Rayner told BBC there must be \u201ccontrols\u201d and described the current system as chaos. \u201cWe have to have controls on immigration, that\u2019s quite clear,\u201d she told BBC News. \u201cYou have to know who is coming in to your country and who is leaving your country.</p> <p> \u201cWe have to got to make sure that our economic situation is good for everybody because immigration is a good thing for us, but what undermines [that] is when people feel that it is unvetted and that we are not able to deal with the issues and the concerns that people have around that.\u201d</p> <p> Corbyn repeatedly said during the referendum campaign that he did not believe Britain should seek to cut immigration. The Labour leader will tell conference on Wednesday: \u201cA Labour government will not offer false promises. We will not sow division or fan the flames of fear. We will instead tackle the real issues of immigration \u2013 and make the changes that are needed.\u201d</p> <p> His spokesman told journalists: \u201cHe is not concerned about numbers,\u201d adding that rather than seeking controls on immigration, Labour would seek to mitigate its effects on low-paid workers with the reintroduction of a \u201cmigrant impact fund\u201d.</p> <p>Gordon Brown introduced a \u00a350m fund to ease the pressure of migration on public services in 2008 but David Cameron\u2019s coalition government scrapped it in the summer of 2010. </p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cAs long as the consequences of immigration are tackled, it is not an objective to reduce the numbers, to reduce immigration.\u201d</p> <p> The prime minister, Theresa May, has made clear she will seek controls on freedom of movement when Brexit negotiations commence, and some Labour MPs believe that message will resonate with working-class voters who feel their wages are under pressure.</p> <p> The Leeds West MP, Rachel Reeves, told a fringe meeting on Tuesday that her constituency was like a \u201ctinder box\u201d and voters\u2019 concerns about immigration and lack of control over their lives could \u201cexplode\u201d on to the streets if they remained unaddressed.</p> <p> Reeves is among several prominent backbenchers, including Chuka Umunna, Stephen Kinnock and Emma Reynolds, who have responded to the vote to leave the EU with calls to reopen the debate on freedom of movement. Yvette Cooper, the former shadow home secretary, also called for changes to free movement before the last election.</p>",
  "<p>Those who dismiss the grassroots movements that look to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> for a political voice as unable to go beyond protest seem unable to understand how much politics beyond the Westminster elite has changed \u2013 especially on the left. The thousands of Momentum supporters who are signing up to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuuLWY06_PAhWmBcAKHQoyBf8QFggeMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftheworldtransformed.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHlGZ8IOTL6Vqybqy7Jo6iAeuO90g&amp;sig2=QRPtkc6bcm6iwzFwCNiE-A\">the World Transformed festival</a> to coincide with the Labour conference in Liverpool are just the tip of the iceberg of an imaginative new politics.</p> <p>The initiatives of generations of women since the early 1970s exemplify the direction of this change and what it could mean in the future. To categorise decades of feminist activities simply as \u201cprotest\u201d is to miss out entirely on how feminism has changed the lives of millions of women in the here and now. They have protested and made demands on government, for sure. But what has been decisive is women organising themselves to find collective solutions through mutuality and collaboration \u2013 in providing childcare, setting up domestic violence or rape crisis centres, and achieving changes in health provision. These initiatives have subsequently been the basis for leftwing councils using public funds to support this de facto expansion of public services.</p> <p>In other words, \u201cnew politics\u201d is about a lot more than politics in its narrow party-political, parliamentary sense. It opens up a new relationship between electoral politics and the mutuality and solidarity in everyday life, in the community and the workplace. Corbyn has come to represent this opening up of politics in Britain. It is what he has been doing all his life, and this is what young people can sense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you turn your gaze from Westminster, there are examples of people taking collective responsibility everywhere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As one Momentum volunteer told me: \u201cOnly with Corbyn\u2019s first leadership campaign did the new politics come into the mainstream. I get infuriated when people talk of the new politics as a Jeremy fan club. This isn\u2019t and was never about just one man.\u201d</p> <p>From its formation as the Labour representation committee, the Labour party has had a relationship with the solidarity and mutuality of everyday working-class life. But it has always been limited by the commitment of the parliamentary Labour party not simply to parliament, but also to what Ralph Miliband termed \u201cparliamentarism\u201d \u2013 the \u201cdogmatic devotion to the parliamentary system\u201d and the rejection of \u201cany kind of political action (such as industrial action for political purposes) beyond the framework and conventions of the parliamentary system\u201d. Underlying this is deference to the moral authority of the British state. To suggest it might lie anywhere else is in effect a challenge to the authority of the state.</p> <p>In this way, reselection of MPs, the non-parliamentary election of the leader and party conference control over policy all confront the long British tradition of rule from above. Hence the near-hysterical reaction to any challenge, as in recent months when Corbyn has stood firm against the majority will of the PLP.</p> <p>The new young Labour members and supporters, by contrast, understand the importance of Corbyn\u2019s allegiance to his predominantly extra-parliamentary mandate. To them, this commitment is not simply about democratic formalities: the members voted for him, the MPs can\u2019t force him to resign. Rather, to quote another Momentum volunteer, it\u2019s also about \u201cwhat Jeremy means when he speaks of \u2018people-powered politics\u2019. It\u2019s not good enough for a leader to speak for people, it\u2019s about empowering those people to speak for themselves. In essence, it\u2019s about creating a vehicle for the untapped potential of communities to collectively organise and lead the fightback.\u201d</p> <p>When you turn your political gaze from Westminster, there are examples of people taking such collective responsibility everywhere, as they apply their creativity to building alternatives on the razed earth of austerity Britain. Momentum will be central in developing this people-powered politics, especially at local level, where its members are involved in a variety of grassroots initiatives.</p> <p>Its structures and mentality need to be responsive, a resource, and a source of support. On my doorstep, in Hackney Momentum, we try to ensure that our meetings always include a discussion with local campaigns \u2013 such as the occupation of empty council houses by Sisters Uncut, seeking to create and get council support for a centre for women facing domestic violence. We discuss with them how Momentum can support them, build their social base and political impact. We focus on this promotion of grassroots solutions alongside political education aimed at the young people enthused by the new politics and canvassing for the Labour party, and opening up local party structures to the creative initiatives around them. Our own institutions are being built to facilitate this dual strategy of reaching outside the Labour party as well as working inside it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/labour-unions-zero-hours-contracts-workers\">How do Labour and the unions make themselves relevant in the 21st century? | Abi Wilkinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s important also not to dismiss the older labour movement institutions. The people who gave so much of their lives to building and sustaining them often have the capacity to transform the content and reach of these institutions too.

  "<p>If you did your growing up in the 20th century, the chances are your youthful predictions for 2016 would have involved colonies on the Moon, flying cars and friendly, subservient robots. Although these visions of ultra-modernity are sadly yet to be, we can always console ourselves with the fact that at least we\u2019ll all soon be using virtual reality, gaming\u2019s holy grail, which has been tantalisingly out of reach since its initial appearance in the early 90s. But this month even that small piece of future-certainty looked questionable with news that, in the US, sales of Oculus Rift (\u00a3549), the Facebook-owned technology that re-sparked interest in VR, and HTC Vive (\u00a3799), its technically superior rival, had both ground to a halt. PC gaming platform Steam showed a 0% growth for Vive and a 0.01% increase in Oculus Rift ownership last month, a possible indication that early adopters have got theirs, and everybody else is waiting for some decent games and a price reduction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/16/playstation-virtual-reality-vr-headset-game-andrew-house\">PlayStation boss: virtual reality throws out the game-design rule book</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sony is hoping its launch of <strong>PlayStation VR</strong> (out 13 October, \u00a3349.99) will buck that trend and persuade punters that looking like a wildly gesticulating beekeeper is a small price to pay for this new level of escapism. The company has also announced a sort-of-new console to go with its VR headset. Mooted earlier in the year, the <strong>PS4 Pro</strong> (\u00a3349, 10 November) will play PS4 games in 4K, the new much-better-than-HD standard for people with ostentatious TVs, although Sony insists that it will not have any exclusive titles, a move designed to assuage fears that owners of the current PS4 would be left behind as players migrate to the more powerful system. Not planned for release until the end of next year, Microsoft\u2019s Project Scorpio will do the same thing for the Xbox One, but with slightly higher spec than PS4 Pro, a fact likely to be cited ad nauseam in endless online arguments about which one is better.

Like Temple Run and its ilk, this new Mario game is an endless runner. Your job is to guide the diminutive plumber around obstacles, hop on enemies\u2019 heads and collect coins, all without ever pausing for breath. The exciting bit will be finding out whether Nintendo\u2019s trademark panache can reinvigorate a genre so tired you\u2019d need defibrillators to wake it up.</p> <p>Back in the present there was the release of <strong>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</strong> (PS4, Xbox One, PC), a stealth game that presented players with a dystopian vision of what the world might one day look like, this time as a society split between those who have cybernetic implants, and \u201cnaturals\u201d who haven\u2019t. Its rainy rendition of conspiracy-theory-rich future Prague, with brief sojourns in Dubai, London and the Alps, provide a playground for testing returning protagonist Adam Jensen\u2019s catalogue of physical augmentations, ranging from high-jumping robot legs to ocular implants that let him see through walls. These mean you can approach missions in a variety of ways, frequently obviating the need for shooting anyone at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/the-month-in-games-no-mans-sky-pokemon-go-ghostbusters\">The month in games: No Man\u2019s Sky goes where no gamer has gone before</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>F1 2016</strong> (PS4, Xbox One, PC) is firmly rooted in the now: its cars, drivers, teams and events reflecting this Formula One season\u2019s actual lineup. In a game filled with this much authenticity, there\u2019s no room for music, just you and what sounds like a chainsaw with gears, hurtling around accurately recreated real-world circuits. Along with a 10-year career mode, you can also now upgrade your car, earning resource points by completing challenges during practice sessions, like driving through gates marked on the track, or beating lap times. This has the benefit of subtly teaching you about things like tyre management and pit strategy without making the game feel like reading the instructions on a tax return.</p> <p>More disappointing this month was <strong>Metroid Prime: Federation Force</strong> (3DS), a multiplayer riff on Nintendo\u2019s popular and venerable Metroid franchise. Its first-person shooting action is hampered by controls that don\u2019t work well enough, the claw-like position your hand needs to adopt to move and shoot compounded by long, carpal tunnel syndrome-baiting boss fights that leave you feeling as though you\u2019ve spent four hours with a grip exerciser. If you like your games gruelling and dreary, Federation Force\u2019s insipid brand of masochism might just be for you.</p>",

Not surprisingly, <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2016/09/facebook-apologizes-for-feeding-inflated-video-view-numbers-to-advertisers/\">Facebook makes mistakes</a>. There is no auditing, no independence; we simply take Facebook\u2019s word for it, when and how much the errors occur. Like Poseidon, FB blows, the currents move, and content producers and advertisers are swept in new directions.</p> <p>Public opinion seems to vacillate between valorizing and excoriating the digital empires.

Speaking clearly about this power and its effects is critical. Ultimately, the public needs more voice, more choice, more power.

  "<p>There is a quiet power to Simon Norfolk\u2019s black-and-white study of what looks like an ordinary staircase in a nondescript house. What strikes you first in this photograph \u2013 which features in a new exhibition called <a href=\"http://www.michaelhoppengallery.com/exhibitions/139/overview\">? The Image as Question</a> \u2013 is how the light plays on each polished surface: the gleaming handrail and pristine skirting board, the gloss-painted wall. It is then you notice that the surface of each stair is not straight but gently curving, worn by the footsteps of those who have walked down them over the years.</p> <p>The French thinker Roland Barthes identified what he called the punctum: the crucial, often accidental, detail of a photograph that reveals something deeper. The curve of the worn stairs is not an accidental detail in Norfolk\u2019s photograph, but the crucial element in the composition that, as Barthes put it, \u201crises from the scene\u201d with a force that makes it suddenly seem like a new photograph. Those who walked down these stairs, leaving the imprint of their vast numbers, were heading towards their deaths in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. It is a photograph that evokes horror in the most subtle and affecting way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"461b7e9e69a93a48eaa2d1cc0172c98e61cf8d91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461b7e9e69a93a48eaa2d1cc0172c98e61cf8d91/0_0_701_1050/668.jpg\" alt=\"September 11th, New York, NY 2001 by Melanie Einzig.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">September 11th, New York, NY 2001 by Melanie Einzig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melanie Einzig. Courtesy Michael Hoppen Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPart of the fascination with all photography is that the medium is firmly grounded in the documentary tradition,\u201d Michael Hoppen notes in his introduction to the show. \u201cIt has been used as a record of crime scenes, zoological specimens, lunar and space exploration, phrenology, fashion and importantly, art and science. It has been used as \u2018proof\u2019 of simple things such as family holidays and equally of atrocities taking place on the global stage. Any contemporary artist using photography has to accept the evidential language embedded in the medium.\u201d</p> <p>That last sentence perhaps provides the subtext to the exhibition, which concerns the threatened position of documentary photography in an age of digital profligacy. Photographs are now so ubiquitous and, when shared on social media, often so unmoored from their context as to seem drained of meaning. The images here, Hoppen insists, have \u201ca shared gravitas, a weightiness that emanates from their documentary function\u201d.</p> <p>That is certainly true of Norfolk\u2019s image of the stairs at Auschwitz, but its power also comes from its formal and compositional poetry: the fall of the light, the geometry of curves, horizontals and verticals, the perspective that, as Norfolk has noted, echoes that of an earlier image: <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/photographs/frederick-h-evans-a-sea-of-steps-5717415-details.aspx\">Sea of Steps</a>, a staircase in Wells Cathedral made to appear almost celestial by Frederick Evans in 1903. It is not so much a photograph as evidence, then, rather an evocation of the immeasurable human suffering that took place on this ordinary-looking site.</p> <p>The exhibition roams far and wide, from photography as research material for painters to images made by microscopic and telescopic cameras to the inevitable grisly crime scene shots by accomplished ambulance chasers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/mar/31/the-best-of-weegees-new-york-street-photography-in-pictures\">Arthur \u201cWeegee\u201d Fellig</a> and his Mexican counterpart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/21/enrique-metinides-photography-dead-mexico\">Enrique Metinides</a>. It is an intriguing show enlivened by the fact that the stories behind the photographs \u2013 which all come from Hoppen\u2019s extensive personal collection \u2013 are often as interesting as the images themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f9db218738333b05600aeda566f64fec9bf1833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f9db218738333b05600aeda566f64fec9bf1833/0_0_3678_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two men wrestling, photographed by Francis Bacon in New York in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"828\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enlarged contact sheet of two men wrestling, New York, from the studio of Francis Bacon, circa 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Hoppen Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A relatively understated, but characteristically voyeuristic, photograph by Metinides taken in Mexico City in 1958 shows a blood-splattered cluster of personal items \u2013 love letters and a golden purse.

Six per cent of the population \u2013 those with long-term, multiple illnesses \u2013 are responsible for half of the city\u2019s health spend. With the pressure on from NHS England to reduce costs by nearly \u00a31bn by 2021 in the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear region as central funding is squeezed, the focus on the most needy patients makes sense.</p> <p>Local GP Dr Fadi Khalil describes Sunderland\u2019s scheme \u2013 one of 14 across England \u2013 as \u201cmassive\u201d in scale. Covering nearly 300,000 patients at 50 GP practices across the city, it is focused on reducing hospital admissions via a series of initiatives designed to offer care that aim to keep patients well and cared for where they live.</p> <p>In the past, despite the \u201cbest intentions in the world\u201d, the most needy patients weren\u2019t getting the best care because of a disjointed and fragmented set of services, says Khalil. Patients had to undergo repeat visits to A&amp;E, repeat crisis admissions to hospital, and had to repeat their stories to a string of frontline primary, community, acute and social care staff.</p> <p>This was not only bad for them but a tremendous waste of precious resources. Finally, under the vanguard programme, local authority and health commissioners and providers are being encouraged to work together with patients.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past when someone [got] a chest infection, they would end up in hospital. Now we\u2019ve got things in place that keep them at home where they\u2019re safer and more familiar with their environment,\u201d Khalil says. Such patients, who have been identified by their GPs as at risk of rapid onset of health problems, have access to their GP, and a nurse or paramedic out of hours who can visit them at home, and who make regular check-ups to prevent urgent, unplanned visits to hospital.</p> <p>Five teams, created late last year, are at the core of Sunderland\u2019s scheme, with community matrons, district nurses and social workers all were moved into the same office.</p> <p>It was a shock to the system at first and \u201cinitially quite daunting\u201d, according to adult social care team manager Rachel Daurat, particularly to the social workers who had to move out of their dedicated offices at Sunderland city council. </p> <p>She says health and social care have traditionally worked to entirely different agendas. However, working together on a patient case has meant they have been able to learn from each other\u2019s perspectives and ensure different providers are working in harmony to improve circumstances for those receiving their care.</p> <p>Sue Hughes, a district nurse taking part in the initiative agrees: \u201cWe are just a team now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe understand the pressures we each face day to day and we support each other.

But over time the ocean smashed away two grand piers as well as Portpatrick\u2019s future as a transport hub. When the crossing moved to nearby Stranraer, sailor numbers dwindled. Villagers knew that to get them back, they needed to improve the harbour with modern moorings and improved toilet facilities while keeping its charm, or risk losing precious tourist revenue to competing harbours up and down the coast.</p> <p>The harbour\u2019s private owners, Portpatrick Harbour Ltd, had applied in 2007 to build a 57-berth marina and fix pontoons to the listed harbour floor. Councillors quashed the plans, saying it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate for the conservation of the area\u201d. Locals then looked for a way to bring the harbour into community ownership where it could be maintained and improved in keeping with the village. They formed a trust, and by 2012 the villagers had reached an agreement with the owners to buy it for \u00a3350,000, financed through money from a local windfarm and a \u00a3125,000 loan from the owners themselves, which had to be repaid by 2015.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/184368484\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/184368484\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Portpatrick: how community shares saved a village </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Banks and other lending institutions had balked at lending the trust the money to repay the loan for a harbour that had, since its purchase, been valued at only \u00a375,000. And because it needed to finance debt, the trust wasn\u2019t eligible for government grants or other types of non-profit funding like the marine coastal communities fund set up by Danny Alexander, then deputy treasurer in the coalition government, to address the desperate plight of declining seaside towns.</p> <p>When Calum Currie, an offshore oil technician born and bred in the village, joined the trust in December 2014, he realised there was no way the community would be able to pay back the loan by the deadline. Currie sent a letter round calling locals to the village hall for an extraordinary general meeting. In January 2015, 160 people gathered to discuss what to do next.</p> <p>Currie contacted Community Shares Scotland (CSS) \u2013 a scheme funded by the Big Lottery Fund Scotland and Carnegie UK Trust. He hoped Portpatrick Trust might be eligible to become Scotland\u2019s first community benefits society, which would allow it to sell shares in the harbour to secure it into community ownership.</p> <p>Since 2009, more than 100,000 people have invested \u00a3120m of share capital into 400 community businesses across the UK.

Emails were sent to regular visitors. Shops and stores advertised the share sale to tourists. The launch date was set for the annual folk festival in September, when the harbour would likely be full.</p> <p>Robert Erskine, a lifeboat coxswain at Portpatrick since 1984, was among those going between the boats at the festival selling shares in the harbour for a minimum of \u00a325. Each shareholder got one vote, no matter how many shares they bought. This key difference from other kinds of ownership structures prevents large investors from taking over. But few investors buy community shares to make money or wrest control. \u201cA lot of people bought shares for their grandchildren,\u201d Erskine says. \u201cIt made people feel part of the community.\u201d</p> <p>In just three weeks, Portpatrick had raised enough money to save the harbour, with the 554 shareholders coming from as far away as Canada and Bermuda. Currie was elected chair of the Portpatrick Harbour Community Benefit Society. \u201cWithout community shares we would have been dead in the water,\u201d he says. \u201cThe financial benefits of the community share sale allowed us to find a future when there were no other avenues open to us.\u201d</p> <p>In Scotland\u2019s more remote communities, radical action has a rich history. \u201cMany Scottish communities are remote enough that they\u2019ve just got to get on and find a way to make things happen,\u201d says McIntyre. These projects aren\u2019t always in response to budget cuts, but the result of positive changes in the way people look at community ownership, according to Jim Metcalf, head of practice at Carnegie UK. \u201cCommunities are finding ways to fund things that would have never happened without public support,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/27/hastings-pier-reopens-after-restoration-project-heritage-lottery-fund-east-sussex\">Hastings Pier reopens following \u00a314.2m restoration project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The community shares network runs parallel with an active Scottish community land movement, which started not long after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/aug/04/kirstyscott\">Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust</a> was formed in 1997 to save the island from centuries of absentee landlords. The Scottish government got its <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Environment/land-reform\">Community Land Act through Holyrood earlier this year </a>and has recently allocated \u00a310m a year until 2020 to support communities trying to invest in land buyouts.</p> <p>Holyrood has also bolstered asset buyouts with a <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/engage/CommEmpowerBill\">Community Empowerment Act</a>, passed last year, to help people take control of local assets when council resources fall short. Portpatrick wanted to use the act to acquire a strip of overgrown wasteland by the harbour to tidy it up and turn it into a picnic area. But the act was so new that the council didn\u2019t have the paperwork. So Currie negotiated directly with them instead. \u201cWe said that we\u2019re not the kind for hanging around, and \u2013 fair play to them \u2013 they worked with us,\u201d he says.</p> <p>By employing members of the community, the benefits society has turned the wasteland into freshly mown lawn and installed new moorings in the harbour. It is negotiating with the council to take over the running of some communal toilets and to modernise facilities.</p> <p>Currie dreams of fixing up the village hall using the money earned from mooring fees; expected to be \u00a320,000 this financial year. \u201cWhat better way to save your community hall than off the back of your harbour. Together the two of them are stronger, and we could go on to save something else,\u201d he says.</p> <p>With each small improvement, the society must make sure the harbour is running a profit, so shareholders can get their money back if they want it. \u201cNow we know the harbour won\u2019t get spoiled or used for some individual\u2019s private gain,\u201d Currie says.</p> <p>A year on from the share offer, Portpatrick is becoming the poster child for community action. Currie has been invited to give evidence to Scottish parliamentary committees about community ownership models. Kevin Stewart, the SNP minister for local government and housing, sees the harbour as part of a broader movement of local residents doing things for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cPortpatrick shows how a community can take control of its own future,\u201d he says. \u201cHanding decision-making to local people, especially in choosing local spending priorities, is exactly the type of activity we want to see more of.\u201d</p> <p>Not-for-profit organisations are also watching closely. \u201cThe Portpatrick Harbour Community Benefit Society is an inspiration. It is this kind of new political and economic energy that is needed to reverse years of neglect and decline,\u201d says Fernanda Balata, project lead on coastal and marine environment at the New Economics Foundation thinktank. Nef is putting together the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/blue-new-deal\">Blue New Deal</a>, which advises coastal communities across the UK that lack funding and are looking for other means to help themselves.</p> <p>Currie says that for the communities at the heart of the movement, it\u2019s not all about the money. \u201cFor the community to have control of the harbour and for everyone to have a voice, that\u2019s priceless,\u201d he says.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Portpatrick is part of a series of local economies documented at </em><a href=\"http://www.farnearer.org/\"><em>farnearer.org</em></a><em>, with funding from the Friends Provident Foundation <br></em></p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September as Portpatrick was once the main crossing to Donaghadee not Donegal<br></em></p> <p><em><br></em></p>",

He would have still had achieved more to build Israel\u2019s security than nearly anyone else alive.</p> <p>He could have resigned from the Knesset in the mid-1960s, following his mentor and patron David Ben-Gurion. Still in his early 40s, instead of languishing on the backbenchers, a lucrative future in business was open to him, as the man who had negotiated Israel\u2019s most crucial arms and technology deals, and had laid the foundations for its defense industry.</p> <p>In 1977, when he lost the election to Menachem Begin and Likud first came to power, the correct thing would have been to make way for a new generation of Labor Party leaders. But he soldiered on a leader of the opposition, despite another humiliating defeat in 1981.</p> <p>The crushing loss in 1996, by a fraction of a point to Benjamin Netanyahu, should have been another clear signal that his time was up. And again, four years later when he lost in a secret ballot for the presidency against political nonentity Moshe Katzav, he kept on going, even when he seemed pathetic to everyone around.</p> <p>Even when he was pushed by younger prime ministers in to minor cabinet posts way beneath his experience. Even when he twice felt forced to leave the party he had served for over six decades. Even when his last hurrah, a second and finally successful run for president, meant separating from his wife Sonia and leading their last years apart.</p> <p>On the way he broke nearly all the Israeli political records of longevity. He served as Knesset member for over 47 years, no one else comes even close. He is the only man to have ever served in all four top government jobs \u2212 defense, foreign and finance minister, as well as prime minister. He had reached the top again and again, won the Nobel Peace Prize. But it was never enough and he always wanted to keep going.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb52fae4b04cbd30bc3d0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterbeaumont\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T05:20:49.400Z\">6.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile Yaakov Katz in the Jerusalem Post has <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Pushing-the-nation-forward-468867\">this take</a> on Peres\u2019s wars and his political disappointments. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In his 93 years, Peres saw it all and was at every major juncture this country went through in its 68 years of statehood.

Weird Martin has changed the code for the door, so just getting into the office is hard today. Denise the dictatorial boss is tasked with creating a&#xa0;streamlined cluster team (I think she means making cuts) and employs sneaky former-cop Nitin \u2013 known, borderline racistly, as Night In \u2013 to spy on his colleagues.

Social work is clearly something that Brand cares about and knows about (her mother was a social worker); it suits her style \u2013 sort of celebratory and respectful, but in a mucky way.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s biggest independent co-op, Midcounties, has had to make a record payout of over \u00a314,000 to a newspaper delivery worker it had been underpaying for more than four years, as the Guardian reported on Monday. A second delivery worker, who complained that on some days his pay averaged 69p an hour, also received compensation. There is no data to show how many workers in Britain might be paid at illegal levels below the statutory minimum. Compliance action mainly depends on individuals or their unions making complaints. However, it is a matter of fact that, since Labour introduced the minimum wage in 1999, the enforcement arm of HMRC has identified nearly \u00a370m in underpayments affecting more than 300,000 workers. According to <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/ensuring-employers-comply-with-national-minimum-wage-regulations/\">the National Audit Office</a>, the number of workers identified as being owed arrears more than doubled from 2014-15 to 2015-16, rising from 26,000 to 58,000. Yet in the past five years, just \u00a35m has been levied on non-compliant employers and since February 2014, although 700 employers have been named and shamed on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy\">the department for business\u2019s</a> website after claims were settled, there have been just three prosecutions.</p> <p>A low wage economy comes with a heavy price tag. It is not only that employers have no incentive to invest in training or upgrading skills for their employees, or buying new equipment for their factories when they can increase productivity by hiring more cheap workers; the gap between take-home pay and what a worker actually needs to live on is met by the taxpayer, through the working tax credit system. That is why when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-uk-gdp-other-rich-nations-george-osborne\">George Osborne triumphantly announced</a> that he was replacing the minimum wage with a \u201cnational living wage\u201d just over a year ago, he declared that it would be the first step on a trajectory that would take Britain from a low-wage, high-tax, high-welfare economy to the higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare country of his ambitions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/only-three-out-of-700-firms-prosecuted-for-paying-below-minimum-wage\">Only three out of 700 firms prosecuted for paying below minimum wage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mr Osborne\u2019s national living wage came in last April at \u00a37.20 an hour. It is projected to rise to somewhere around \u00a39 an hour by 2020. It is intended to reach 60% of median earnings. That will be a severe shock to those industries and sectors like food and agriculture, and in particular social care \u2013 the source of one in ten of all low pay complaints \u2013 where there is a culture of low pay. That will be changed only by consistently high levels of enforcement. As the NAO observed in a report earlier this year, without knowing the scale of the problem, it is impossible to assess the effectiveness of the HMRC compliance operation. On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/gangsters-on-our-doorstep\">one recent analysis</a>, there were so few HMRC inspectors that it was estimated they could get round every employer only once ever 250 years. Since then, the enforcement budget has been increased, and the maximum fine has doubled from 100% of the underpayment to 200%. But the number of prosecutions remains vanishingly small. The priority is compensation, not costly court cases. That is wrong.</p> <p>When the national living wage reaches 60% of the median wage <a href=\"https://minimumwage.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/22/compliance-and-enforcement-the-challenge-of-the-national-living-wage/\">it will cover nearly 14%</a> of the workforce. The minimum wage covered just 5%. The extension of differing rates for people up to the age of 25 has also made it more complex \u2013 an even bigger compliance challenge. If the government is serious about ending low pay, it must get serious about enforcement. That means prosecutions.</p>",
  "<p>Just three employers have been prosecuted for paying workers below the minimum wage despite HM Revenue and Customs finding 700 who have broken the law in the past two and a half years.</p> <p>Since February 2014, the government has \u201cnamed and shamed\u201d 700 employers who have underpaid more than 13,000 workers by over \u00a33.5m.

It is not yet known if Midcounties Co-op will be prosecuted for this and another case. It has already apologised and repaid the worker and is assessing whether it also underpaid 200 other newspaper delivery workers.</p> <p>Roger Lilley, one of the workers who received back pay because of underpayment of the minimum wage, on Tuesday wrote to Theresa May, the prime minister and also his constituency MP, requesting her help in raising his case with the business secretary, Greg Clarke and the director general of HMRC, Jon Thompson.</p> <p>A spokesman for the department for business, energy and industrial strategy which, with HMRC, oversees the application of the minimum wage, said \u201cthe government\u2019s priority is ensuring that workers receive the money they are owed as quickly as possible\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cFor this reason, in the vast majority of cases, HMRC seeks compliance using the civil route, which is the quickest way of ensuring workers receive their arrears,\u201d they said. \u201cUnder the civil route, employers are not only faced with reputational consequences but also face a financial penalty for breaking the law. Where there is evidence that an offence has been committed the case will always be considered for prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>The Midcounties Co-op case was the latest of a spate of low pay cases exposed by the Guardian including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/sports-direct-staff-to-receive-back-pay-unite-hmrc\">Sports Direct</a> to the parcel giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/hermes-may-face-hmrc-investigation-into-allegations-of-low-pay\">Hermes</a>, which delivers for John Lewis and Next. </p> <p>This week 20 couriers for Hermes, which has been accused of paying rates which amount to less than the \u00a37.20 national living wage, submitted further testimonies to HM Revenue and Customs arguing Hermes is wrong to class them as self-employed.

The move is likely to increase pressure on the tax authority to launch a full investigation into employment practices at the firm which uses 10,500 couriers.</p> <p>Their cases were forwarded to Jon Thompson, HMRC chief executive, by Field. He said they showed a pattern which indicated the couriers were wrongly classed as self-employed.

  "<p>Ever since the state of Israel was created in 1948, Shimon Peres, who has died aged 93, was at or near the centre of action. A protege of David Ben-Gurion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2012/may/14/archive-1948-establishment-israel-jewish-state\">Israel\u2019s first prime minister</a>, Peres became premier himself on three occasions, foreign minister for another three, and state president from 2007 until 2014. He fashioned alliances with France in the 1950s, and planted the seeds for Israel\u2019s embryonic electronics and aircraft industries. During the 60s, he honed the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and secretly amassed Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons.</p> <p>For 15 long years after it fell from power in 1977, Peres led the Labour party. In the early 80s, he resuscitated Israel\u2019s economy, and in 1994 shared the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/\">Nobel prize</a> for his role in the efforts to create peace in the Middle East through the Oslo accords. In the same year, he cemented Israel\u2019s peace treaty with Jordan. Defeated at the polls in 1996, he returned in 2001 as foreign minister, thereby giving Israel\u2019s controversial new premier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/ariel-sharon\">Ariel Sharon</a>, a much-needed veneer of respectability. And in 2006, he left Labour, his home for five decades, to help Sharon set up his powerful new breakaway faction, Kadima.</p> <p>A simple listing of achievements only hints at the phenomenon that was Peres. The Jerusalem Report news magazine called him \u201cIsrael\u2019s only world-class statesman, perhaps Zionism\u2019s last pragmatic visionary\u201d. Peres wrote 11 books, read poetry voraciously, and could quote from Old Testament prophets, French literature and Chinese philosophy with equal ease. After the assassination of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryyitzhak-rabin-1580649.html\">Yitzhak Rabin</a> in 1995, he bound together a shattered nation.</p> <p>And yet, despite all his talent, there was something tragic about the man. Peres contested five elections without winning a single outright victory. His longest tenure as premier was two years, and came while he was in an awkward alliance with his Likud enemies. He lost the Labour leadership on the eve of the party\u2019s return to power in 1992. A slew of terrorist attacks in early 1996 allowed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> victory over Peres in Israel\u2019s first direct prime ministerial elections. No wonder Orly Azoulay titled her 1996 biography of him The Man Who Didn\u2019t Know How to Win.</p> <p>Some of his initiatives were halted before they had got going, such as his 1987 London agreement with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-king-hussein-of-jordan-1069507.html\">King Hussein of Jordan</a>. Others collapsed because opponents chipped away at the scaffolding, as with the Oslo accords. Even when in 2000 he stood for state president \u2013 the ultimate consolation prize for veterans \u2013 Knesset members opted not for him but for the pedestrian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/moshe-katsav\">Moshe Katsav</a>.</p> <p>All the same, Peres campaigned well into his 80s. No sooner had the media written him off as a \u201cserial loser\u201d than he would pop up again as a saviour in a time of crisis. He was used to playing the long game. In 2007 Katsav resigned in disgrace amid charges of sexual improprieties, and Peres was elected president in his stead. Virtually across the board, Israeli editorials spoke of a national sigh of relief in recognition of a long-maligned yet irreplaceable figure.</p> <p>\u201cI am a child of the generation that lost one world and went on to build another,\u201d Peres once wrote.</p> <p>Son of Yitzhak and Sarah Persky (he later Hebraised the family surname), he was born in Vishneva, then a largely Jewish town located in the borderlands between modern Belarus, Poland and Lithuania. His New York-born cousin Betty Perske, one year his junior, went on to achieve fame as the actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/13/lauren-bacall-obituary\">Lauren Bacall</a>. Shimon\u2019s maternal grandfather, Zvi Meltzer, who later died in the Holocaust, inspired his love for literature. Frequent antisemitic raids undermined Vishneva\u2019s patina of autonomy. At the age of 10, Shimon left to settle in Tel Aviv, where his father, a lumber merchant, had emigrated two years earlier.</p> <p>At 15 Peres joined the Ben Shemen agricultural youth village, a crucible of future Israeli leaders. He soon met the Ukrainian-born Sonia Gelman and wooed her by moonlight with readings from Marx\u2019s Das Kapital. The couple married in 1945 after Sonia had served as a nurse and driver with the British Army in Egypt. She became a source of strength to him in private and an enigmatically deferential figure in public.</p> <p>Peres became leader of the Hano\u2019ar Ha\u2019oved (Working Youth) Zionist movement when he was 19, and founded Kibbutz Alumot in the Jordan Valley. Apprised of his skills, Ben-Gurion appointed Peres head of mobilisation for the Haganah underground in 1947. He procured plane parts from the US, Italy and Czechoslovakia during the 1948 war. He even became secretary of Israel\u2019s navy, although he confessed: \u201cMy experience consisted of moderate proficiency at breaststroke and one childhood attempt to launch a raft off the coast of Tel Aviv.\u201d</p> <p>In 1950 Peres travelled to Washington as military attache. By 1953, aged 29, he was director of the entire defence ministry, an office he held until 1959. Peres helped plan the Sinai campaign of 1956. In 1957, he successfully lobbied the French government for a nuclear reactor, and established a hi-tech intelligence unit, Lakam, whose operatives served him in future clandestine ventures. He also tried to abolish military rule over Israel\u2019s Arab citizens, but Ben-Gurion overruled him and the law was only repealed in 1966.</p> <p>Israel later promised that it would not introduce atomic weapons into the region \u2013 \u201cat my urging\u201d, wrote Peres. Though he conceded that Arab leaders saw his creation, Israel\u2019s secret Dimona plant in the Negev Desert, as \u201ca worrisome fuzzy deterrent\u201d, Peres the politician enjoyed creating such deliberate ambiguities.</p> <p>In 1959 Peres was elected to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for the ruling Mapai party (forerunner of Labour) and immediately became deputy defence minister. He bought Israel\u2019s first US weapons, but resigned in 1965 with the prime minister, Ben-Gurion. Their breakaway Rafi party proved unsuccessful, winning only 10 seats, and in 1968 Rafi rejoined Labour, as did Peres, who became its deputy general secretary.</p> <p>Israel gained the Palestinian-populated territories of Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 war \u2013 an acquisition that was to change its politics more profoundly than was realised at the time. In 1969 Peres was charged with developing these areas, and absorbing new eastern European immigrants. He then served in turn as communications, transport and information minister. When, in 1974, the prime minister, Golda Meir, was forced to resign, Peres gamely stood for election to the vacant post of party leader, but lost narrowly to an equally youthful, native-born military hero, Rabin. This was a battle that would be repeated often over the next two decades.</p> <p>Appointed defence minister that June, Peres immediately plunged into the intricacies of negotiating a second interim Sinai treaty with Egypt. He also opened a \u201cgood fence\u201d border crossing with Lebanon, revitalised the IDF after the near-humiliation of the 1973 war, allowed legally questionable settlements on the West Bank, and masterminded the daring rescue of hostages from Entebbe in 1976. Yet support haemorrhaged for a government blighted by scandal and economic malaise. Rabin resigned in April 1977 and Peres was prime minister for barely a month before <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0816.html\">Menachem Begin</a>\u2019s Likud demolished Labour at the polls.</p> <p>Peres thus won the dubious privilege of becoming Labour\u2019s first-ever opposition leader. He then saw Begin negotiate the historic peace agreement with Egypt that he had expected to make himself. Rabin\u2019s memoirs decried Peres for betraying him in 1977, and Begin was able to exploit the spat to triumph at the 1981 polls. Peres meanwhile became a vice-president of the Socialist International in 1978. There he befriended <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-willy-brandt-1556598.html\">Willy Brandt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/30/obituaries/bruno-kreisky-austria-s-leader-for-a-record-13-years-dies-at-79.html\">Bruno Kreisky</a>, British Labour politicians and delegates from Africa and Asia. Such ties were to prove invaluable.</p> <p>Likud\u2019s ill-fated Lebanese war of 1982 allowed Peres to tap into national unease. He fought the 1984 elections to a dead heat, and duly headed a national unity government, agreeing that he would hand power to Likud\u2019s pugnacious new leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/01/yitzhak-shamir\">Yitzhak Shamir</a>, after two years. As prime minister, Peres made up for lost time. He withdrew troops from Beirut to a narrow \u201csecurity zone\u201d in southern Lebanon. Then he slashed Israel\u2019s inflation rate from 450% to 16% by forcing the Histadrut labour confederation and big business into a national compact. When Shamir became prime minister, Peres served as foreign minister (1986-88), during which time the iconoclastic pragmatist and security hawk, who once called settlements \u201cthe roots and eyes of Israel\u201d, blossomed into a peace campaigner.</p> <p>He had first met King Hussein in 1974. Their mutual respect was clear from the outset. Peres felt that a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation could break the stalemate in the territories, and bring peace to Israel, and in 1987 negotiated with the king in London. Shamir, angry that Peres had \u201cgone behind his back\u201d, quashed the deal. The acrimony between them deepened, and probably exacerbated Palestinian frustration. For his part Hussein blamed Peres for leaking their secret talks.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s 1988 election took place against the backdrop of the Palestinian intifada (the uprising against Israel in the occupied territories). It ended in deadlock, and led to another unsatisfactory \u201cunity government\u201d. Peres rejected Shamir\u2019s endorsement of settlements and, in 1990, sought to topple the government. At the last moment, the religious Shas party withdrew the support it had promised him. In early 1992, Rabin replaced Peres as party leader, and went on to win the June elections for Labour.</p> <p>Miraculously, their enmity turned to partnership, with Peres, the foreign minister, as the engine and Rabin, the prime minister, as the gears and brakes (or so Peres later described it). A longtime foe of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Peres now persuaded Rabin to consider talks with the PLO leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/11/israel.guardianobituaries\">Yasser Arafat</a>. Peres\u2019s lieutenants, led by Yossi Beilin and Uri Savir, opened a secret track with PLO negotiators outside Oslo. At the subsequent White House lawn signing in September 1993, Peres nudged a reluctant Rabin to shake hands with Arafat \u2013 an image that went round the world.</p> <p>For two years, Peres worked furiously to keep the imperfect peace on track. Given the problem of settlements, it was, he quipped, an attempt \u201cto turn an omelette back into eggs\u201d. He negotiated directly with Arafat, turned the \u201cGaza and Jericho First\u201d proposals agreed at the White House into reality, drafted the 1994 Paris Protocol of Israeli-Palestinian economic relations, promoted regional summits and in 1995 sealed Oslo II (an agreement to restore Palestinian rule to six major West Bank towns). Rabin, meanwhile, concentrated on Syrian talks via his protege, the military chief of staff Ehud Barak.</p> <p>But Israeli fury at persistent terrorism prompted demonstrations against the Rabin-Peres administration. In 1995, Yigal Amir assassinated Rabin at a peace rally. Peres, Amir\u2019s other intended target, was just metres away. He took over as prime minister on a wave of sympathy. With hindsight, Peres\u2019s decision not to call immediate elections was an error. Nonetheless, he achieved much in his six months in charge: he implemented Oslo II ahead of schedule, assuaged the religious right, bolstered the economy and co-operated with Arafat over the first-ever Palestinian elections.</p> <p>Support for Peres evaporated when successive bomb attacks killed dozens in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and talks with Syria came to naught. Likud warned: \u201cPeres will divide Jerusalem.\u201d Arab states feared that his dream of a borderless Middle East spelled Israeli economic colonialism by stealth. Peres\u2019s retaliatory invasion of Lebanon in April 1996 also misfired, when more than 100 refugees perished in one Israeli bombing. For all Peres\u2019s Panglossian fantasies of a \u201cnew Middle East\u201d the electorate narrowly yet decisively favoured Netanyahu that May.</p> <p>Peres chided \u201cBibi\u201d for \u201c111 days of verbiage\u201d, and held on as party chairman until Barak ousted him in 1997. After Labour\u2019s victory in 1999, Barak gave Peres the nebulous portfolio of \u201cregional co-operation minister\u201d, but sidetracked him over the peace process. Peres had meanwhile founded a centre for peace in his name, with headquarters in Ajami, a largely Arab neighbourhood of Jaffa. It is dedicated to dialogue, cultural, economic and youth initiatives, and healthcare assistance to Palestinians.</p> <p>In 1998 he wrote forewords to four books on the 50th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence. He also released For the Future of Israel, a series of philosophical conversations with the author Robert Littell. Where other Israeli politicians grudgingly accepted a Palestinian state as inevitable, only Peres argued in Le Monde that it was necessary for Israel\u2019s future. When the new intifada broke out in 2000, polls backed Peres to restore the peace process. In the event, Barak sabotaged his rival\u2019s \u201cvirtual candidacy\u201d, only to lose at the polls himself. Peres emerged as foreign minister under Sharon in a Likud-Labour coalition government. This time Peres was the liberal brake to Sharon\u2019s determinedly rightwing engine. Whether he was an effective brake was another story.</p> <p>Although many Israeli leftists felt outraged at his \u201cbetrayal\u201d, experienced Peres-watchers knew that his personal friendship with Sharon counted for more than ideological congruence. Less charitable souls felt that his overvaulting ambition had once again trumped his principles. Similar charges resurfaced in 2005, when he left Labour to co-found Kadima with Sharon, barely a month after losing the Labour leadership to an outside candidate, Amir Peretz. Peres served as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ehud-olmert\">Ehud Olmert</a>\u2019s deputy premier after Kadima convincingly won elections in 2006. The following year, by now Israel\u2019s longest serving parliamentarian, he left the Knesset to contest the presidency.</p> <p>As Israel\u2019s ninth president, he helped restore his nation\u2019s battered reputation. He became the first Israeli head of state to address a Muslim state legislature when he spoke to Turkey\u2019s national assembly in November 2007. Turkey and Japan supported his \u201cvalley of peace initiative\u201d for economic revival and joint industrial projects in the West Bank. In 2008 he launched the Israeli Presidential Conference, an annual brainstorming forum which attracted guests including George W Bush, Elie Wiesel, Robert De Niro, Rupert Murdoch and Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy. In 2009 Peres served as \u201cnational host\u201d for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-benedict-xvi\">Pope Benedict XVI</a>\u2019s visit to Israel. At last he gained the affection of Oriental Jews \u2013 half of Israel\u2019s population \u2013 who had once seen him as an Ashkenazi elitist.</p> <p>Most unusually for an Israeli president, Peres became his nation\u2019s top diplomat. He asked Palestinians and Arab nations to join in \u201ca great journey towards a world built on logic and intellect, not land\u201d. He negotiated directly with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mahmoud-abbas\">Mahmoud Abbas</a>, president of the Palestinian Authority, on behalf of a taciturn Netanyahu. He placated President Barack Obama when Israeli actions offended the Oval Office. And in 2013 he delivered a video interview beamed from Jerusalem to a security summit in Abu Dhabi for 29 foreign ministers of Arab and Muslim countries. His honours included appointment as honorary GCMG in 2008, award of the US presidential medal of freedom in 2012 and the Congressional gold medal in 2014.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Peres still engendered controversy. In his inaugural presidential speech he bluntly stated that Israel had to \u201cget rid of the territories\u201d. He averred that he had changed his position, not his beliefs. Although many hailed him as a man of vision and peace, Israeli rightists flayed him for playing into the hands of the PLO. Many Likud supporters resented the way he pushed his peace agenda while the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, was persona non grata in most capitals. More than that, his stance seemed to contradict Netanyahu\u2019s policies.</p> <p>For their part, the Israeli left accused Peres of acting as a figleaf for an obdurate Likud administration. They were dismayed when in 2009 he defended Israel\u2019s continuing attack on Gaza. Days later he found himself at the centre of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/30/turkish-prime-minister-gaza-davos\">an unseemly row</a> with the Turkish prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a> at the Davos world economic summit as a result. Though Peres\u2019s diplomatic intercession smoothed ruffled feathers, he still warned against a nuclear Iran \u201ctaking over the Middle East\u201d and rejected the critical UN report into the Gaza war. Former liberal allies were perplexed when, that May, he proclaimed newly elected Likud premier Netanyahu a peace pioneer \u2013 an opinion he reversed in 2015 when he blamed Netanyahu (re-elected that year) for talking peace but doing nothing to implement it.</p> <p>\u201cOver the years,\u201d wrote the Israeli historian Ze\u2019ev Sternhell, \u201cShimon Peres \u2026 destroyed everything of value [in Labour].\u201d Other leftists blamed him for initiating with Oslo II the settlement bypass roads that seemed to render a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Peres repeatedly called Abbas a serious and true partner for peace, even admiring the courage, if not agreeing with the timing, of Abbas\u2019s 2012 UN bid for Palestinian statehood. Yet many Palestinians blamed Peres for saddling them with inferior terms in the Paris economic deal of 1994. Now Israeli critics charged him with abusing the apolitical nature of the presidency.</p> <p>After leaving the presidency in 2014, Peres continued work for his peace centre. When Israeli authorities denied the centre tax-exempt status because it trained doctors from Gaza, the centre suspended its application and continued with its programme, which by 2015 had helped 250 personnel. As late as November 2015, his health now failing, he insisted that Israel faced \u201ceternal war\u201d if there was no Palestinian state.</p> <p>Peres was an intriguingly contradictory figure: a romantic in a cynical age, an Israeli icon with a Polish accent and francophone sensibility, who carried about him the taint (deserved or otherwise) of political chicanery. Unlike holiness, he told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\">David Frost</a>, politics is built on compromise. Nor was he above taking audacious decisions, as in 1989 when he ordered Mossad to abduct the nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu from British soil, or in 2002, when he attracted millions to invest in nanotechnology.</p> <p>He certainly brought a touch of aesthetic philosophical discrimination to the world of politics. His books included The Next Step (1965), David\u2019s Sling: The Arming of Israel (1970), Entebbe Diary (1991), The New Middle East (1993), Battling for Peace (1995), The Imaginary Voyage: With Herzl in Israel (2000) and Ben Gurion: A Political Life (2011). Among the numerous biographies of him are Matti Golan\u2019s Road to Peace (1989) and Michael Bar-Zohar\u2019s Shimon Peres (2013).</p> <p>He is survived by his daughter, Zvia, sons, Yonathan and Nehemia, and six grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Shimon Peres, statesman, born 1 August 1923; died 28 September 2016.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September 2016.

For example, Uber reserves the right to deactivate its drivers\u2019 account and restrict them from using the app.</p> <p>And because Uber\u2019s app sets the price of a fare, workers effectively have a cap on how much they earn.</p> <p>An Uber spokesman says that \u201cdriver partners have full control over when, how often and for how long they drive, meaning they can log in and out of the app whenever they choose\u201d.</p> <p>He adds that drivers are free to work across multiple apps, another factor that may make a court less likely to find its drivers are employees.</p> <p>Although he declines to make a prediction on how any cases would turn, Stewart says it is \u201cinherently more plausible that Airtasker is simply connecting people that want to provide work with those that want to use their services\u201d than Uber, which \u201cis a brand associated with transportation services\u201d.</p> <p>A Foodora spokeswoman says it is confident it is not exploiting any loopholes in the way it engages delivery drivers, while a Deliveroo spokeswoman says its drivers are independent contractors.</p> <p>\u201cWe offer work in the form of deliveries.

Although about 1m Australians work as independent contractors in their main job, a stable 10% over the past 10 to 15 years, it remains to be seen whether the gig economy will drive an increase in that number.</p> <p>He says the government would need to consider legislative responses including changes to labour law, tax, superannuation, safety, injury compensation and even welfare, after the Productivity Commission said the rise of the gig economy and automation could require consideration of a universal basic income.</p> <p>For unions the task is clearer \u2013 with the Airtasker case, they hope to exert some industrial pressure so that workers have more choice than merely to work or not to work.</p> <p>And there may be some middle ground. Fung says he is relaxed about increasing recommended pay rates because Airtasker would take a cut of a bigger pie if users responded positively.</p> <p>It\u2019s the tug of war between what users will pay and workers will work for that is barely mediated by the Airtasker platform at all. If Unions NSW and the Maurice Blackburn cases don\u2019t succeed, it will be no business of employment law either. Then the future of work will have arrived.</p>",

The candidates sparred over the war in Iraq for nearly two-thirds of the debate, and Bush\u2019s defenses appeared weak in the face of Kerry\u2019s persistent criticisms. Bush subsequently lost around five points of his polling lead.</p> <p>A similar scene played out again in 2012, between another incumbent, Obama, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Despite trailing in the polls, Romney was well prepared for the first debate, and Obama \u2013 often glancing at his notes \u2013 didn\u2019t perform particularly well. More than seven in 10 Americans told Gallup that Romney did a better job, which was reflected in post-debate polls when Obama\u2019s lead decreased by around three points.</p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s current lead holds up by the first debate in late September (which would be a very long post-convention bump indeed), her debate performance could once again change the balance of the race.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton\u2019s post-DNC bump had disappeared almost entirely by yesterday, with the latest shows pre-debate showing the pair neck-and-neck. </p> <p>But largely favorable reviews across the board for Clinton\u2019s debate performance may now affect polls - even if that may not reflect the eventual election winner.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8416e4b08ca277ca0bdd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:53:34.851Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mary J Blige interviews Clinton</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hip hop queen Mary J Blige interviewed Hillary Clinton for a new show to be unveiled on Apple Music Friday, with a preview showing Blige questioning Clinton about race and singing to her. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of people in my community think Obama was blocked in Congress because he was black.

However, moderators try to avoid becoming the third debater on stage, and instead force the candidates to spar with one another. There were moments, especially early on, that Holt could have been more forceful in maintaining order. But he also wisely used his discretion to keep the debate going at times instead of sticking to the somewhat arbitrary 15 minutes allotted for each segment.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/us/politics/lester-holt-moderator.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;_r=0\">Michael M Grynbaum called him</a> the \u201cminimalist moderator\u201d:</p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He was silent for minutes at a time, allowing Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

Lehrer was so boringly nonpartisan, so unwilling to play gotcha that he was always hotly in demand to moderate debates. For the first half or so, Holt gave simple, broad, open-ended questions and let the candidates go at it. He didn\u2019t venture into live fact-checking, didn\u2019t much quarrel with the nominees, didn\u2019t ask persnickety questions...

Back in 2011, a few months after Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought the club as it loitered in the second tier of English football, Leicester welcomed Real Madrid to the King Power for a glitzy friendly and the new owner said he hoped his side would soon duel with Europe\u2019s elite in proper, competitive matches. Everyone chortled. Then everyone\u2019s laughs turned to applause. And now Leicester are about to host a Champions League group game against one of the continent\u2019s most prestigious clubs, the two-times champions of Europe, FC Porto. </p> <p>If Leicester win today, they\u2019ll have six points from two games and one foot in the knockout stages in their very first participation in the tournament. It might also be their last participation in it, bearing in mind how their Premier League title defence has started, so this really is a time to savour. There\u2019ll be merry bedlam in the King Power stands, that\u2019s for sure. Leicester\u2019s players will be inspired. Everything suggests that this tournament will bring the best out of them this season.</p> <p>As for Porto, this country tends not to bring the best out of them. Despite their glorious history they have a sorry record in England, having never won in 16 visits (although they did get two draws, including one against Manchester United in 2004, which, funnily enough, was pretty much the last time Jose Mourinho looked happy at Old Trafford until Leicester turned up there looking all distracted last Saturday). If they are to improve on that record today, they will have to find a way of containing Islam Slimani, in particular. The striker took great pleasure in tormenting them when he was a Sporting Lisbon player. He has scored against them five times in three matches this year already, including once less than a month ago. After dropping two points at home to FC Copenhagen in their first group matches, Porto may approach this game thinking that a draw would be acceptable. If they take a cautious stance, it\u2019ll be up to Leicester to rise to the challenge and plot or blast a way through them. Bring it! </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T17:45:10.099Z\">at 6.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea4084e4b08ee6d0d2f3ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:49:00.574Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TEAMS</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Leicester</strong>: Schmeichel; Hernandez, Morgan, Huth, Fuchs; Mahrez, Drinkwater, Amartey, Albrighton; Slimani, Vardy</p> <p><em><strong>Subs</strong>: Zieler, Musa King, Schlupp, Simpson, Okazaki, Gray</em></p> <p><strong>Porto</strong>: Casillas; Layun, Felipe, Marcano, Alex Telles; Andr\u00e9 Andr\u00e9, Danilo, Oliver Torres; Andr\u00e9 Silva, Lopez, Otavio</p> <p><em><strong>Subs</strong>: Sa, Boly, Ruben Neves, Depoitre, Herrera, Corona, Jota</em></p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: C Cakir (Turkey)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T17:57:31.613Z\">at 6.57pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>Indigenous peoples are part blockading one of the main tributaries of the River Amazon and demanding that Peru\u2019s new president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski visit them - with no positive response to date. The protest is one of the latest instances of social unrest across Peru and in Loreto in particular, which, at 50% larger than the UK, is Peru\u2019s biggest and most difficult-to-access region - as well as one of the poorest.</p> <p>This poverty, together with poor infrastructure and a weak or non-existent state, is particularly outrageous given that some of Peru\u2019s historically most productive oil fields are in Loreto. True, more than 40 years of operations, mostly by foreign companies, have transformed the region to the extent that the economy is now largely dependent on oil, generating wealth through tax revenues and casual employment for many people. But how have such revenues been spent? And what of the fact that the location of the oil fields has meant the systematic invasion and exploitation of huge swathes of indigenous peoples\u2019 territories - allegedly contaminating rivers and local inhabitants, blocking efforts by communities to obtain land title, creating economic dependency, dominating local politics, buying off leaders, misleading community members, dumping trash, wasting staggering amounts of energy and resources, and, in general, leaving precious little behind in terms of infrastructure, basic services, education, beneficial projects and skilled, sustainable employment?<br></p> <p>The problems caused by operations in this region tend to only make Peruvian or international media when there is some kind of \u201cspill\u201d - oil painting black the forest, fish, fauna. None has been recently reported where the protestors are, but not far upriver approximately <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2016/09/negotiations-and-protests-ongoing-in-wake-of-oil-spills-in-peruvian-amazon/\">4,000 barrels were spilled</a>, by the North Peruvian Pipeline, in mid-August at a community called Nuevo Alianza. Then another spill was reported on 24 September along the River Pastaza near the border with Ecuador, and then yet another was reported the following day upriver from Nuevo Alianza. As of 12 August 2016 Peru\u2019s government agency regulating energy and mining, OSINERGMIN, had registered 190 pipeline spills across the country since 1997 - although it attributes 67 of them to vandalism.<br></p> <p>One indigenous leader involved in this struggle is Kichwa man Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn, currently at the protest. Here, in an interview on 24 September with the Guardian in Loreto\u2019s capital, Iquitos, Fach\u00edn gives his take on what is happening there and in Loreto in general: </p> <p>DH: Where exactly is the protest taking place?</p> <p>JF: It\u2019s on the River Maranon at the oil pumping station at Saramuro [the start of the North Peruvian Pipeline running from Loreto to Peru\u2019s Pacific coast].</p> <p>DH: How many people, more or less?</p> <p>JF: We\u2019re talking about more than 2000 indigenous people. And more keep arriving, gathering there.</p> <p>DH: How long have the protesters been there for?</p> <p>JF: It\u2019s an indefinite protest. It\u2019s been going on 24 days now [as of 24 September] and it will continue until their demands are met. And they\u2019re asking, to resolve those demands, that the country\u2019s leading authorities visit: the president or prime minister and relevant ministers, such as the Minister of Energy and Mining, Health, Education, Agriculture and Economy and Finance. They\u2019re also requesting Loreto\u2019s four congressmen, the regional governor, the president of Perupetro, the president of Petroperu, and Pluspetrol\u2019s general manager. That\u2019s what they\u2019re requesting - to discuss, at a political level, the viability of oil activity in that region. That\u2019s what\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s why they want those people.</p> <p>DH: What are the main problems? That\u2019s to say, why are people there protesting? What are the complaints?</p> <p>JF: Well, this is the result of all the oil spills over the last few years. People can\u2019t take any more. So they\u2019re protesting. The main reason is the contamination over the last 40 years - and the issue of doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2016/jan/14/look-at-the-oil-spilled-in-the-worlds-2nd-best-place-for-wildlife\">remediation in Lot 8</a> [a concession held by state-owned company Petroperu until 1996 and then Pluspetrol since then], Lot 192 [held by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/indigenous-peruvians-amazon-pollution-settlement-us-oil-occidental\">US-based company Occidental</a> before 2000, by Pluspetrol from 2000 to August 2015, and now by Canadian-headquartered Pacific Exploration and Production], and along all the pipelines. Another issue is the proposed Law on Environmental Vigilance and Monitoring - for that to be discussed. Another issue is the revision of Pluspetrol\u2019s contract [for Lot 8], given that it\u2019s been working for many years there with total impunity. Another issue is fixing, or replacing, the North Peruvian Pipeline [run by Petroperu].</p> <p>DH: It\u2019s not only the North Peruvian Pipeline where there are spills or leaks, right? There are other pipelines.</p> <p>JF: There\u2019s an entire network. We want to discuss this and have a technical study done to see what has happened to this infrastructure after 40 years.</p> <p>DH: The companies have worked there for 40 years?</p> <p>JF: More than 40 years. 45 years, there or thereabouts. More than four decades. The pipelines are leaking now. Just today there was a leak, in Andoas [on the River Pastaza]. They\u2019re looking into how much was spilt. </p> <p>DH: When was that?</p> <p>JF: Lot 192. It\u2019s just been made public. There are spills in the oil concessions themselves as well as along the transport routes. </p> <p>DH: Is the contamination the result of the spills only, or other oil operations?</p> <p>JF: No. The contamination is the result of many things. One is that for more than 35 years companies have been dumping their production waters into the rivers, directly, into tributaries, lakes, pools. Across the four rivers [Corrientes, Maranon, Pastaza, Tigre]. That stopped in 2009. In addition, there has also been contamination caused by the chemical waste in the oil installations. The other cause has been the spills. So there are many factors. And after 40 years things are the same. People are tired of it. The round-tables we\u2019ve held have come to nothing. We don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to do the clean-up. That\u2019s why now there\u2019s an indefinite protest. We\u2019re tired of discussing it with state functionaries who don\u2019t have the capacity to solve the problem. That\u2019s why we want the ministers to come - and the companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c11ee8be29bd7c9e3ef87145b6a5685c8d21d6a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c11ee8be29bd7c9e3ef87145b6a5685c8d21d6a0/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn at a protest on the River Tigre in the Peruvian Amazon in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn at a protest on the River Tigre in the Peruvian Amazon in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>DH: Has anyone from the state or government turned up yet?</p> <p>JF: The regional governor [Fernando Melendez]. He agreed that he would transmit our message, our demands, to the national government. But he misunderstood. He didn\u2019t listen closely. As a result, they sent a commission [to Iquitos] - more functionaries - but the protesters won\u2019t speak with them. They want to speak to the ministers and the companies.</p> <p>DH: Who\u2019s on the commission [which has since been reported to have returned to Lima]?</p> <p>JF: A Vice-Minister from the Ministry of Culture, which, according to them, is the state institution responsible for this issue. We don\u2019t accept that. It isn\u2019t the state institution responsible. Another is a presidential advisor. We\u2019re fed up of talking to advisers. We continue insisting on wanting to talk to the ministers. </p> <p>DH: About the pipeline spills. . . Sometimes the government, state or Petroperu say they\u2019re caused by \u201ccuts\u201d - a type of sabotage. What would you say to that?</p> <p>JF: We\u2019ve responded to this before. It\u2019s not that it isn\u2019t impossible that sometimes there is sabotage. Sabotage is possible. But linking it to indigenous peoples is a real stretch. You go to an indigenous community and you\u2019ll see no one has the knowledge or technical capacity to do it. What we\u2019ve learnt is that these are overseen by the companies themselves to cover up their own responsibility. It\u2019s a strategy they\u2019re using.</p> <p>DH: Wait. You\u2019re saying sometimes there are cuts but that it\u2019s the company, or someone connected to the company, that\u2019s doing it?</p> <p>JF: There are interests in doing that. Strategically it suits their purposes to blame indigenous peoples and say the spills are caused by them. We have sources, who want to remain anonymous, and they know that this is effectively overseen by the company - and it suits them. You go to a community and you\u2019d see they have no equipment to do this kind of thing. Where would they get it? You can\u2019t use just any piece of equipment to sabotage a pipeline. </p> <p>DH: Sometimes the pipeline is underwater too.</p> <p>JF: Underwater. So how do you think an indigenous man is going to be able to cause a spill? It\u2019s impossible. We\u2019ve responded to this idea and we don\u2019t accept it - but it doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t happen. It could happen. Someone could do it, but it\u2019s not part of indigenous people\u2019s culture to do this sort of thing. </p> <p>DH: What are the impacts of the contamination? </p> <p>JF: The impacts are very visible. A week ago we went to [an installation in Lot 8] and nearby found dead fish. In a lake across which a Pluspetrol pipeline crosses. With Petroperu, it\u2019s exactly the same: the fish are dying where there are spills. And the impacts are worse when the rivers swell.</p> <p>DH: Who are the indigenous peoples participating in the protest? </p> <p>JF: There are the Achuar people, Urarina people, Cocamas, Kichwas. . . And the others are joining. . . We\u2019re in a country where there is no strict protection. What would happen today if indigenous peoples said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want oil operations in this area\u201d and they closed it down? It wouldn\u2019t take much for the state to send in the army or navy. That\u2019s the type of country we\u2019re living in.</p> <p>DH: Are there other things the protestors want? E.g. better services in their communities, health posts, schools, electricity, jobs?</p> <p>JF: Compensation from the state for use of indigenous territories, which would take the form of an investment plan for health, education and alternative projects. Other requests are that land is titled according to [the International Labour Organization\u2019s] Convention 169, that prior consultation is done for Lot 192, and that a truth commission is set up to investigate the impunity with which oil activities have taken place over the last four decades.</p> <p>DH: Last question. Obviously oil is very important for Loreto. Many people work in the industry. How do you see, therefore, the region\u2019s future? </p> <p>JF: Loreto\u2019s oil future, right now, is bleak because of the international context, although the national government\u2019s policy, for more than 30 years, has been oriented towards oil. But that is no longer Loreto\u2019s future. Loreto, strategically, has been made dependent on oil by past governments. As a result of activity declining, Loreto is now in total crisis because the economy depends on oil, and for indigenous peoples it\u2019s even worse because their territories have been impoverished and there have been serious environmental impacts. How can one talk about oil having a future when it has such a past? But to suddenly stop an extractive operation is very difficult - very difficult - because there are many poor people who depend on it for work. What\u2019s the future of oil? That\u2019s now the largest issue being discussed. Diversification of the economy, tourism, the forestry sector - but with very clear laws - environmental services, biodiversity, other alternative activities. . . There are many potential options to explore, but there hasn\u2019t been any interest in doing so because policy is designed from the top - and what the top wants for Loreto is to divide it up into oil concessions so the entire Amazon can be explored and exploited and companies continue operating and contaminating. That\u2019s the strategy for Loreto. For people in Lima, for the rest of the country, Loreto is just a place where you exploit oil. Nothing else. </p> <p>DH: Thank you, Jos\u00e9.</p> <p>JF: Thank you. </p> <p>Petroperu did not provide comment in response to Fach\u00edn\u2019s claims about pipeline sabotage.</p>",
  "<p>Australia should follow the lead of the US in requiring public companies to disclose how much their chief executive makes each year directly compared with an \u201caverage\u201d rank-and file-employee.

Comparing CEO pay against the median pay of a worker at the same company is the ideal way to compare ratios, given that companies in some sectors pay workers higher across the board. But a comparison with the average worker salary also provides insight into income inequality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"iframed\">  <iframe src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/27t8r/5/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"100%\" height=\"920\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Commonwealth Bank has the highest CEO pay ratio in our sample, with Ian Narev earning more than 100 times the salary of an average worker. Even the lowest paid chief executive in our sample earned 15 times the average Australian annual salary. The figures for many of the corporations were impacted by the inclusion of bonus or equity elements of pay. For example, Fortescue Metals is the second highest ranked when salary and bonus are considered, but falls to sixth place when equity-based remuneration is also considered.</p> <p>There\u2019s quite a debate about what actually makes up CEO pay. Some argue that US pay ratios are more like 70 to one when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/ceo-pay\">only cash remuneration</a> is taken into account. Others include equity claims exercised \u2013 like stock options \u2013 and come up with a much higher ratio of something like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/\">300 to one</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iGvSP/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"100%\" height=\"870\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Cash bonuses paid to chief executives are likewise controversial, with some suggestions that observed reductions in CEO pay levels in 2015-16 are <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-31/australian-ceo-pay-packets-fall-but-bonuses-rise/7799656\">simply a case of shifting pay into cash bonuses rather than cash salaries</a>. Certainly the ranking of our sample firms change when cash bonuses are included, indicating that bonuses are a significant source of remuneration. A cash bonus is effectively the same as a salary if it\u2019s very likely to be paid and so should logically form part of the pay ratio.</p> <p>The CEO pay ratio is an important measure of income inequality over time and Australian regulators should consider making this information mandatory. This would greatly enhance comparability with US and UK companies.</p> <p>Research evidence describes wide differences in CEO remuneration across the world, with US CEO pay described as an outlier at 23% greater than the UK and 55% greater than continental Europe, thereby contributing to <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102541\">income inequality</a> in that country.</p> <p>Disclosure of the ratio would allow Australian investors to understand better where a particular chief executive lies in terms of pay packet size relative to other firms of similar size and industry.</p> <p>In recent years, Australian corporate boards have been subject to the two-strikes legislation under which shareholders vote on the company\u2019s remuneration report at the annual general meeting. Any company receiving 25% or more of no votes from eligible shareholders at two consecutive meetings must <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/executive-pay-pain-wont-go-away-18696\">put a motion to shareholders to spill the board</a>.</p> <p>The increased accountability around remuneration resulting from the two-strikes rule has provided shareholder and lobby groups with solid evidence about executive pay levels and disclosure. For example, the Australian Shareholders\u2019 Association <a href=\"https://www.australianshareholders.com.au/companies\">actively monitors the remuneration of selected corporations</a> with the intention of influencing remuneration report voting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.corrs.com.au/thinking/insights/proxy-advisers-in-the-interests-of-market-integrity-it-s-time-for-reform/\">Proxy advisers also have an important role to play in lobbying institutional investors</a> on remuneration voting. Disclosure of the Australian CEO pay ratio would be a useful input to that discussion.</p> <p>While the two-strikes legislation has improved corporate accountability around executive pay, disclosure of the CEO pay ratio would provide a useful summary measure to voting investors, independent of location and currency.</p> <p>Historically, executive pay has not always been at the current controversial levels but has steadily increased since the mid-1970s, an increase which has continued after the global financial crisis.

I travel to the mainland very often and my observation is that China has been developing,\u201d Chow says when asked about the repression that observers say has intensified since Xi Jinping took power in 2012.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.conservativehumanrights.com/reports/submissions/CPHRC_China_Human_Rights_Report_Final.pdf\">Conservative party report</a> claimed that under President Xi \u201cvery serious threats to Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms have emerged as a source of grave concern\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSome say it is the worst time for human rights in China since the Tiananmen massacre\u201d.</p> <p>But when Chow looks to the mainland he sees something different; a place of economic opportunity and expanding personal freedoms where \u201cordinary people from all walks of life\u201d can freely use the internet to criticise the government. <br></p> <p>\u201cI can tell you more people are getting more open-minded,\u201d the pro-Beijing leader claims before heading off on a post-campaign holiday. \u201cEven the government is more open-minded in some sense.\u201d</p>"
