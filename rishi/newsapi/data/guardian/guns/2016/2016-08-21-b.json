Uzbekistan\u2019s Ikhtiyor Navruzov appeared to have lost to Mandakhnaran Ganzorig 7-6 at 65 kilograms on Sunday. Uzbekistan challenged the scoring, likely because the Mongolian began running around in celebration with less than 10 seconds left rather than engaging with Navruzov. </p> <p>Navruzov won his challenge and the match on criteria as the last wrestler to score. Ganzorig, who had already started celebrating, fell to his knees in disappointment. The Mongolian coaches went much further than that. Byambarenchin Bayoraa took his shoes and shirt off and threw them to the mat in disgust in front of the officials. Tsenrenbataar Tsostbayar stripped all the way down to his blue briefs.

France have been coached by Claude Onesta since 2001, and have been utterly dominant in a way that is rare to see in a team sport. Both coaches are among the best that handball has ever seen. If nothing else it should be an interesting tactical battle.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks Kari.

This is because the USA uses a \u201cmedal count\u201d table and not, as is the case for the majority of the rest of the world a \u201cmedal table\u201d. The difference? In the \u201ccount\u201d table all medals are treated equally with a gold valued exactly the same as a bronze. Tell that to Usain Bolt and many others please! In contrast, the medals table counts golds first followed by silver and then bronze. This is fine for GB and China \u2013 as clearly GB has many more medals of a higher color than China but does a disservice to countries with many silvers and bronzes who are placed behind countries \u2013 such as Singapore and Fiji \u2013 with exactly one gold. My suggestion is to use a simple points system with gold = 5, silver = 3 and bronze = 1. USA would be on top with 364 points, GB narrowly pips China 218 to 210 but Mexico, with 3 silvers and 2 bronzes gets placed above the \u201cone gold\u201d countries with 11 points to 5.

They suffer horrible injuries, and genuinely risk their lives for their sport. They compete in a huge number of events, hundreds of races a year. And they manage to do all this, despite being obliged to starve themselves half to death for most of their adult lives.</p> <p>Trust me. Jockeys are ridiculous athletes, bordering on superhuman. And if they can control a charging horse while risking great injury a few times every day, you definitely wouldn\u2019t want to pick a fight with one.

Any way you do this is wildly insulting to incredibly focused and dedicated athletes while I ponder how many spare not he\u2019s I have on my belt, but anyway. Arguably would it be a Bolt or perhaps even a Neymar? Ignoring the financial elements, and assuming everyone has to train, diet etc, those appear to me to be the ones who can rely most on some innate skill and/or physical advantage. Maybe actually it\u2019ll be the keen eye and steady hand of one of the [ahem] less athletic disciplines like shooting or archery, but I still feel that needs a ludicrous focus that simple inbuilt skill wot be enough for.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t get to where Bolt and Neymar are without putting yourself through it. Lots of gipping at training for Bolt, for sure. I\u2019d say the innate talent, allied to his laidback character, manifests more in how he handles pressure. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b9827ae4b0377cf1118b33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T10:30:33.329Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cMuch as I thoroughly enjoyed Bolt doing what Bolt does like he rest of the world,\u201d emails Michael Hunt, \u201cmy vote would go for pretty much any other gold medalist, almost all bronze medalist and a good number of the silvers at the point of realisation. One thing that occasionally steers me back to football is when you see someone genuinely joyful at scoring a goal for instance, rather than striking a pose and expecting everyone to come praise them. Just before Bolt\u2019s triple for instance the pole vault saw at least 2 of the 3 medalists shrieking uncontrollably at what could be the high point of their careers. For all the training and hype, Farah doesn\u2019t cross the line with the demeanor of someone who believes the gold is his by right. Coddled and overcompensated though many may be, seeing genuine happiness still has a habit of getting to me.\u201d</p> <p>Disagree with what you say about Bolt, who isn\u2019t faking it - he is how you see him - but yes, genuine happiness is amazing. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b9814fe4b047b85f602281\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T10:24:18.440Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oh, and I\u2019d be keen for some jockey exposition. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b98003e4b047b85f602276\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T10:19:59.673Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cI have the greatest respect for the incredible stamina of the modern professional tennis player,\u201d says Rob Marriott. \u201cBut how many of them would keep going with a broken pelvis, like Geraint Thomas did in the 2013 Tour de France?

  "<p>The United States men\u2019s basketball team saved their best for last, capping an occasionally precarious Olympic tournament with a stress-free 96-66 rout of Serbia to capture yet another gold medal in the final event of the Rio Games.</p> <p>Kevin Durant poured in a game-high 30 points \u2013 matching his total from the gold medal game four years ago in London \u2013 as the US team overcame a punchless opening with suffocating defense to run away before a lively crowd of 10,658 at Carioca Arena 1. The Americans have now won six of the last seven Olympic titles in men\u2019s basketball and 15 of 19 overall. Faster, higher, stronger indeed.</p> <p>Serbia had given the Americans a scare in the preliminary round, clawing back from a 23-5 deficit to push the tournament favorites to the limit before losing by three. That sparked a two-game win streak that lifted them into the medal round on a tie-breaker, followed by wins over Croatia and Australia.</p> <p>This one played out more like the teams\u2019 previous meeting in the 2014 Fiba Basketball World Cup final where Team USA won a 129\u201392 blowout in Madrid.</p> <p>\u201cThey have the best coaching staff in the world,\u201d Serbia coach Aleksandar \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 said. \u201cThey did a great job scouting us and they knew everything that was coming from our guns. Unfortunately some of our guns were not that loaded as in the first game. We didn\u2019t move the ball well, share the ball well.\u201d</p> <p>The US team missed 13 of their first 20 shots from the floor and half of their eight free throws during a first quarter that saw five lead changes. But after a Stefan Bir\u010devi\u0107 free throw gave the Serbians a 14-11 edge, Team USA used a 22-6 run capped by a Durant steal and breakaway dunk to extend a 13-point advantage, prompting \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 to call timeout.</p> <p>There was little he could do to stem the tide. The US team was moving the ball beautifully and dominating in every facet. By half-time Durant had posted 24 points \u2013 18 in the second quarter alone \u2013 and Cousins had already posted a double-double (11 points, 12 rebounds) and the US led 52-29.</p> <p>\u201cWe started pretty good but in the second quarter we did not look like ourselves,\u201d Serbia\u2019s Stefan Markovi\u0107 said. \u201cWhen you have 12 superstars against you, you cannot wait for them to attack. You have to attack first.</p> <p>\u201cIf you let them play as they want, they will kill you. Each of the 12 guys can do that. You cannot stop these players like that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/21/usa-mens-basketball-team-beat-serbia-claim-gold-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vmfk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2673668\"            data-video-name=\"USA men's basketball team beat Serbia to claim gold \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ba1ce4e4b047b85f60252a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/21/160821basketball_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/21/160821basketball.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/21/160821basketball_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/21/usa-mens-basketball-team-beat-serbia-claim-gold-video\">USA men\u2019s basketball team beat Serbia to claim gold</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Carmelo Anthony opened the third quarter with three-pointer from the corner and the onslaught was on again. The long-distance attack that had powered Serbia in the first meeting, when they made 10-of-25 three-point shots (40%), stalled badly as they were limited to 4-of-24 (17%) from beyond the arc. By early in the fourth quarter Team USA led 84-43 and the result was but a handshake away.</p> <p>From when Serbia led 14-11, the US team outscored them 85-52. When Anthony exited the game with two minutes remaining, the New York Knicks forward shared a extended embrace with Durant and Mike Krzyzewski, who is stepping down as USA head coach after these Olympics, before taking his place at the end of the bench.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a special moment for me,\u201d said Anthony, the unofficial team captain who became the first ever three-time Olympic gold medalist in men\u2019s basketball. \u201cI know this is the end. This is it for me.\u201d</p> <p>After the final buzzer sounded and the US had won by the largest margin in a gold medal game since the original Dream Team throttled Croatia by 32 in Barcelona, the players draped themselves in American flags and celebrated with the many USA fans near courtside before parading into the tunnel.</p> <p>The latest iteration of the US men\u2019s team is no longer a collection of the best players on offer. This year\u2019s Olympic squad included only one All-NBA first team choice (DeAndre Jordan), down from the complete set who made the trip to Barcelona. The perfunctory blowouts of those days are no longer the norm.</p> <p>But Dream Team VII managed to avoid the nightmare outcome that seemed around the corner after a preliminary round that saw them pushed by Australia, Serbia and France in wins by 10 points or less. The difference was a tightened defense that limited all three knockout-stage opponents to under 40% shooting from the floor.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable feeling,\u201d said Kyrie Irving, who followed up his first ever NBA championship in June with an Olympic gold. \u201cWe came together at the right time. We figured it out offensively and defensively and came out with the gold.\u201d</p> <p>And of course there was Durant, who paced the team\u2019s equal-opportunity attack with 19.4 points per game, fifth-best in the tournament.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone through a lot of examination with the fact that he signed with the (Golden State) Warriors,\u201d said Jerry Colangelo, managing director of USA Basketball. \u201cHe\u2019s been under a little bit of pressure, and to see him bust out like he did here was wonderful. I think it\u2019s really going to help his psyche going forward. I couldn\u2019t be happier for him.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony, who joins Gennady Volnov and Sergey Belov of the Soviet Union as the lone men\u2019s basketball players to win four Olympic medals, earned his first back in 2004, when the USA lost three times and stumbled to a bronze that prompted a wholesale overhaul of the program under Colangelo.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to understand it and have a feeling about it when you\u2019re going through it,\u201d he said. \u201cNot until you have some time to yourself, you get a chance to reflect back on this journey starting back in 2004 up until now. I don\u2019t think I can explain how I feel right at this moment.\u201d</p> <p>With Anthony insisting he\u2019s made his final appearance with Team USA, Sunday\u2019s game took on a tenor of transition. But he is confident the team, which will be coached by San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich moving forward, is in good hands.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve given enough to team USA basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as I\u2019m going to miss it, it\u2019s time to pass it on to some of the guys who were here and some of the younger guys that are coming along, to give them an opportunity to be a part of something great.\u201d</p>",

Last week, state department spokesman John Kirby said the US \u201ctook advantage of the leverage\u201d that the delivery provided, in order \u201cto make sure they got out safely and efficiently\u201d.</p> <p>Kirk, who is facing a tough re-election battle for his Senate seat, has been a vocal critic of the Iran nuclear accord. </p> <p>The senator has a penchant for <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-mark-kirk-graham-met-0612-20150611-story.html\">stirring controversy</a> with his remarks, once telling a newspaper people drive faster through black neighborhoods.

  "<p>My birding friend Rob may have got married only the day before, but nothing stops him from looking regularly at his pager to check out the latest sightings of rare birds. Fortunately, he then took the trouble to text me the news: that a <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=055012\">collared pratincole</a> had turned up at the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/h/hamwall/about.aspx\">RSPB\u2019s Ham Wall reserve</a>, just down the road from my home.</p> <p>It would have been rude not to pay this bird a visit, especially as it should have been sunning itself on some Mediterranean marsh, not flying around the Somerset Levels. I had never actually seen this species before in Britain, so I walked along the disused railway line that bisects the marshes with more than the usual spring in my step.</p> <p>It was impossible to miss it \u2013 or at least hard to avoid where it had last been sighted. The usual crowd of locals and visitors clustered around their telescopes like a Masonic meeting, swapping stories and occasionally taking a look at where the bird had last been seen.</p> <p>For a few moments, I thought this would be another case of \u201cyou should have been here earlier\u201d, as vagrant birds have a nasty habit of heading off after a few hours. But then an excited cry went up, as this exotic visitor flew straight past our appreciative gathering. </p> <p>The name pratincole means \u201cmeadow-dweller\u201d, though it usually lives in marshes. Technically it is classified as a wader, but it looked far more like a tern, as it bounded to and fro across the sky, hawking for insects on long, slender, curiously kinked wings. From time to time, it took a rest, usually out of sight behind clumps of reeds, before appearing once again to delight its audience. </p> <p>At one point the bird came close enough for me to see its main distinguishing features: mid-brown above and white below, with a forked tail and white rump, making it look rather like a giant house martin. As it twisted in mid-air I caught a glimpse of the reddish-brown underwings. </p> <p>There were other exotic birds here too. A pair of <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=024022\">glossy ibis</a> was feeding on the marsh, while several <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=020013\">great white egrets</a> flapped lazily across the reed beds, as if in slow motion. A few years ago these would have attracted just as much attention as the bird we had all come to see, but now they are such a regular sight that most birders barely give them a second glance. Maybe in a few years time the same will be true of the collared pratincole.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/20/birdwatch-jack-snipe-somerset-reedbeds\">A jack snipe plays hide and seek in the Somerset reedbeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eight pairs of great white egrets have nested here this year, a new record, which, considering the species had not even bred in Britain before 2012, is quite astonishing. Along with the <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=020059\">bitterns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=030088\">marsh harriers</a> that have also colonised in recent years, these exotic waterbirds simply confirm the fact that this is now one of the very best places to watch birds in the whole of the country. I\u2019m certainly glad this amazing site is right on my doorstep.</p> <p>I let the pratincole do one more fly-past on those spring-loaded wings, before heading back home to the usual work and domestic duties. In the meantime I can look forward to the next rare and unexpected bird to turn up here on the <a href=\"http://www.avalonmarshes.org/Ham_Wall\">Avalon Marshes</a>. I suspect I won\u2019t have too long to wait.<strong></strong></p>",

But the introduction of Brindle\u2019s miserly medium-pace stalled the Storm, as she ended Taylor\u2019s innings \u2013 which was full of handsome drives, cuts and flicks to leg \u2013 when she had her caught at mid-off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/david-willey-england-odi-squad-pakistan-injury\">David Willey ruled out of England\u2019s ODI squad to face Pakistan with injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Knight and Priest \u2013 who had swatted down the ground - were both caught in the deep trying to push the score along, before Wilson played a handy cameo. \u201cYou want to kick on having been 70 off 10 overs,\u201d said Knight. \u201cVipers pulled it back really well but then we just weren\u2019t good enough with the ball, and that cost us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a special few months,\u201d said Edwards, while confirming that she would play on next season. \u201cGetting a group together with a blank canvas, and then to get to finals day and put in a performance like that is brilliant.

Three days later, when he saw a doctor in Central Booking, he was diagnosed with a fractured jaw, a concussion, and a broken finger.</p> <p>Godley was admittedly nervous to be recounting these stories to a room of police officers and cadets on Thursday.

  "<p>Each person sleeping rough is a sign that our society has fallen short, and successive governments have pledged to tackle homelessness. Labour has always been committed to ending homelessness, indeed under the last Labour government it fell by 62%. Yet under this Tory government rough sleeping has doubled and homelessness is up by a third. Behind each figure lies the story of individual suffering, whether it is rough sleepers huddled together in doorways, or those placed in emergency accommodation with their children by their local council, unsure of where else to turn or what is next. This is the harsh end of the housing crisis and we must fight it.</p> <p>It is Labour that is tackling rising homelessness, in government in Wales and in Labour-led local authorities up and down the country. And in parliament, it is Labour that is exposing the Tories\u2019 failure on homelessness. The Labour Campaign to End Homelessness appeal (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/17/we-call-on-labour-to-pledge-to-end-homelessness\" title=\"\">Letter</a>, 17 August) is a welcome intervention. It is right that Labour recommits itself to ending homelessness and explores proposals to provide greater support to those facing homelessness.</p> <p>Figures from the charity Crisis show that two-thirds of councils attribute the rise in homelessness directly to government policy on welfare reform \u2013 from the bedroom tax to the cap on housing benefit. The communities and local government select committee has just released a report on homelessness with wide-ranging recommendations (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/new-homelessness-strategy-is-a-must-say-mps\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 18 August). The government urgently needs a clear plan to help those currently homeless and to address the root causes of homelessness. Failure to do so would be a betrayal of some of our society\u2019s most vulnerable.<br><strong>Teresa Pearce MP</strong><br><em>Labour spokeswoman on housing and planning</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is a simple problem at the heart of homelessness \u2013 and a corresponding remedy, not addressed by the latest Labour proposals. It is to be found in the original passage of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act in 1977. Previously, whenever parliament brought forward legislation giving local authorities duties to house people, governments produced bills containing measures to provide powers and financial resources (subsidies and borrowing powers) to enable councils to provide new housing according to the local numbers affected.</p> <p>But in 1977 the then Labour government ducked this issue, and in doing so they facilitated the passage of the measure as a private member\u2019s bill sponsored by the Liberal MP Stephen Ross, without any financial backing from Whitehall.</p> <p>The results have always been unsatisfactory, because the act gives authorities duties to house people without any guaranteed resources to do so. This is why there is repeated litigation in which councils seek to avoid housing individual test cases. Councils still have other long-established statutory duties to house defined categories of household in priority need, but the government subsidies that used to underpin those duties have long since been withdrawn by central government. The right to buy has long been the biggest privatisation cash cow of income flowing from councils to HM Treasury.</p> <p>The answer is simple: both major parties need to support legislation to restore to local councils the powers and subsidies/borrowing approvals to provide new (or acquired) affordable homes to discharge their housing duties. Unless that happens I\u2019d guess that we will still be discussing the homelessness problem 40 years from now.<br><strong>Steve Smart</strong><br><em>Malvern, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The letter from Labour MPs and others on the need to address homelessness misses one crucial policy: we cannot build new homes without access to land. Before the government and others begin to build more homes they will need to acquire land, and in the face of this increase in demand, landowners will naturally increase the price of land, meaning the cost of these new homes will escalate. The answer is to remember that land is not a manufactured good but a free gift of nature. Housing policy needs to acknowledge that land speculation (the hoarding of land out of use) is the underlying cause of the high cost of homes. An annual land value tax would kill land speculation in its tracks and provide government with the funds to build more homes.<br><strong>Dave Wetzel</strong><br><em>Brentford, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Many readers will welcome the letter calling on the Labour party to pledge to end homelessness. But there are two causes of concern. First is the letter\u2019s focus on the most visible aspect of homelessness, rough sleeping. It claims that \u201cunder the last Labour government, homelessness fell substantially\u201d. Although true for rough sleepers, it is not true for the numbers in temporary accommodation, which more than doubled in England from 47,000 in 1998 to 100,000 in 2005 before eventually coming down to 50,000 in 2010. A policy focus on the much smaller numbers of rough sleepers will not address the problem of temporary accommodation.</p> <p>Second, in order for a sustainable reduction in temporary accommodation numbers to occur, there will need to be two policy changes, one of which gets no mention and the second bottom billing. The unmentioned policy change is an improvement in private tenants\u2019 security in order to make them less vulnerable to landlords\u2019 rent increases and evictions \u2013 which is now a major cause of homelessness. The second policy change is concerted investment in new social housing, especially public housing \u2013 number five in the letter\u2019s list of priorities. Unless a future Labour government gives top priority to new genuinely affordable social rental housing, the danger is that it will simply repeat the lamentable record on this issue of the 1997-2010 New Labour governments.<br><strong>Dr Paul Watt</strong><br><em>Department of Geography, Environment and Development Studies, Birkbeck, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is scandalous that the loopholes allowing the heirs of multi-billionaires to escape inheritance tax have persisted for so long (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/duke-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-inheritance-tax-reform\" title=\"\">Duke\u2019s death prompts calls for tax reform</a>, 12 August). But just as scandalous is the method by which most of the Duke of Westminster\u2019s wealth was accumulated. His massive fortune arose largely from the unfairness of the leasehold system of property tenure, which allows freeholders of large estates to sell long leases on their land at a profit, whilst continuing to accrue sizeable revenues at the expense of the leaseholders as their leases shorten. The leaseholders also bear the full burden of repairs and maintenance of their homes, even though these are actually owned by landowners who contribute virtually nothing to preserve the fabric of the buildings on their estates.</p> <p>The residential leasehold system hardly exists outside of England and Wales. Our immediate neighbours, Scotland and Ireland, are doing their best to eradicate this exploitative form of tenure. Both countries allow existing leaseholders to acquire their freeholds on terms that reflect the fact that the relative contribution of leaseholders to the value of their homes is considerably greater than that of parasitic landowners.<br><strong>Nigel Wilkins</strong><br><em>Campaign for the Abolition of Residential Leasehold, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 An all-party committee of MPs has just published a strongly worded report on the issue of rising homelessness. Yet it was a majority of MPs that have just voted through the Housing and Planning Act, which will phase out security of tenure in the social sector and will force councils to sell off housing stock to subsidise the sale of housing association properties. The Chartered Institute of Housing has warned that, as a consequence of this law, 350,000 social rented homes could be sold, pushing more families into the private sector.</p> <p>And it was a majority of MPs that in 2010 approved the government\u2019s decision to drastically cut housing benefit for private tenants and freeze it, making it now impossible for many families to afford rents in cities such as London or Brighton and forcing families to have recourse to food banks. It was also a majority of MPs that voted in March 2012 to impose benefit caps and the bedroom tax, reducing housing benefit for social tenants as well.</p> <p>During all these years both CASE Central and Brighton Benefits Campaign have spoken to an increasing number of vulnerable tenants whose housing benefit has failed to cover their rents, who have been threatened with eviction at a landlord\u2019s whim, and who have been labelled as \u201cintentionally homeless\u201d by the homeless service. It is difficult for us to understand the consistency of the actions of an all-party committee formed, at least in part, by the same MPs that have deliberately voted for legislation that would clearly increase poverty, desperation and insecurity of tenure.<br><strong>Giuseppina Salamone </strong><em>Community, Advice, Support and Education</em><br><strong>Pip Tindall</strong> <em>Brighton Benefits Campaign</em><br><em>Brighton </em></p> <p>\u2022 Any new strategy on homelessness must have building more homes that people can afford at its core if it is going to succeed. Recent research by the Resolution Foundation demonstrated home ownership is at a 30-year low. Meanwhile, the ending of a private tenancy remains by far the single biggest cause of homelessness.</p> <p>Our own analysis reveals that of the \u00a345bn invested in housing by the government up to 2020-21, only \u00a32bn is dedicated to below-market rented housing \u2013 just 4%. This has to change if we are to reverse a trend which has seen homelessness rise steadily since 2010.</p> <p>We are delighted to see that the communities and local government select committee has endorsed what could become a crucial piece of legislation to tackle homelessness.</p> <p>But our housing crisis and our homelessness crisis are inextricably linked. It is crucial that a new legislative framework on homelessness is matched by a commitment to increase the supply of homes.<br><strong>Gavin Smart</strong><br><em>Deputy chief executive, Chartered Institute of Housing</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Let me quote the same study, which states, \u201ccaution is required when extrapolating experiences in other countries to the UK since the mode of operation, underlying geology and regulatory environment are likely to be different\u201d and \u201cthe PHE position remains, therefore, that the shale gas extraction process poses a low risk to human health if properly run and regulated\u201d.</p> <p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas present throughout the UK at very low levels. PHE recognised that radon may be released to the environment from shale\u2013gas activities, as is the case with existing natural gas supplies, but at concentrations that are not expected to result in significant additional radon exposure. PHE will be undertaking baseline outdoor and household radon monitoring in the Vale of Pickering in North Yorkshire in areas around Third Energy\u2019s KM8 well near Kirby Misperton at three-monthly intervals. The first monitoring \u201cmeasurements indicated that the radon concentration in the outdoor air around KM8 is close to the UK average\u201d. There is no indication of elevated radon concentrations in Pickering, a radon affected area in close proximity of KM8. The analysis for the control site in Oxfordshire showed that the radon concentrations were similar to those for the Vale of Pickering.</p> <p>Study after study undertaken in the UK by renowned universities, professional associations and regulators state that risks to the public\u2019s health are low as long as the shale gas industry is properly regulated. As a population we are fortunate to have a world-class system of regulation in this country.

  "<p>I\u2019m not quite sure how to put this, so I\u2019m just going to come out and say it: I think I would vote for George Osborne.</p> <p>Very quickly, a qualifier. I would not vote for any version of Osborne who existed before the middle of last week. The Osborne who suffocated us all under the greying blanket of austerity. The Osborne who half-heartedly attempted to waft away Brexit. The Osborne whose greatest public performance was getting booed at the Paralympics. The Osborne whose automatic response to any form of spontaneity involved nervously flicking his tongue in and out while blinking, like a looping gif of an android being dunked in a bathtub. I have looked inside my heart, and I will never be able to align myself with this man.</p> <p>However, the Osborne photographed listlessly firing a machine gun into the depths of the Vietnamese jungle, near a memorial to the Viet Cong, because what the hell, what are we going to do, sack him? There\u2019s a man I can get behind. This guy very clearly doesn\u2019t care any more. This guy looks like he gets morning drunk in Wetherspoons. He looks like he regrets at least one of his tattoos. He looks for all the world like someone who only went to Vietnam because he heard that for the right money they will let you ride a sad old circus elephant through a minefield for a laugh. This Osborne has edged towards the precipice, and he has realised that nothing matters. He\u2019s dangerous. He\u2019s a rebel. He\u2019s even started to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/status/766578753304571904\">tweet flippantly</a>. He would absolutely get my vote</p> <p>Similarly, I\u2019m also ready to admit that I might have got Michael Gove wrong. All these years, I had written him off as uptight and out-of-touch, a lacquered ventriloquist\u2019s dummy unable to escape his offensively pragmatic Westminster bubble. But then last week I saw the photo of him looking sweaty and dishevelled during a miserable jog \u2013 face peppered with an Ian-Beale-wilderness beard, eyes far away and full of dulled self-loathing \u2013 and everything changed. I didn\u2019t see Gove in that photograph. I saw a man who had given up. I saw a man with nothing to live for. I saw defeat. Put simply, I saw myself. Give Michael Gove 2.0 a crack at the Tory leadership, all his rehearsed charm replaced with sloped shoulders and a guttural sigh of resignation, and I would vote for him in a fingerclick.</p> <p>I don\u2019t care what people say. I don\u2019t care about the studies claiming that success is attractive. I don\u2019t care about the proven benefits of confidence and certainty. I don\u2019t want my politicians to be smart and bulletproof and statesmanlike. I want them to have known defeat. I want them to be human. And it looks like the only to make them human is to utterly obliterate their sense of self-worth first.</p> <p>You agree with me, I know you do. Quick, here\u2019s a test. Which Ed Miliband would you vote for: the Miliband who so desperately wanted to be prime minister that he carved his policies on to a giant gravestone, or the Miliband from a month after the election, when he was so utterly bereft that he had stopped shaving and started to resemble the lecturer from uni who everyone had a crush on? Of course the latter. Of course.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t always work, I will admit. During his time in charge of the country, David Cameron always appeared to secretly resent all the peripheral trappings that leadership required \u2013 all the state schools and staycations \u2013 and so seeing him tub around Corsica in his \u00a3225 swimming trunks this month, giddy with school\u2019s-out freedom, had exactly the opposite effect. His resignation didn\u2019t shatter him into a trillion pieces, and so now we can never trust him again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/19/was-george-osborne-machine-gun-firing-vietnam-in-poor-taste\">Was George Osborne's machine gun fun in Vietnam in poor taste?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Same goes for Tony Blair. Ever since leaving office in 2007, he has bounced from one ethically iffy job to another, getting exponentially richer with every coat of Ronseal he has appeared to have applied to his body. And everyone hates him for it. Imagine how different it would be if he had grown a tatty beard, stopped brushing his teeth and got pictured playing his stupid guitar for spare change outside an abandoned Woolworth\u2019s. Why, he\u2019d be back in Downing Street in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>This is how I want my politicians. I want them to be like the rest of us, broken and crumpled. I want their first words every morning to be swearwords because they can\u2019t face looking the world in the eye, and their last words every evening to be \u201cugh\u201d because they can\u2019t bear the prospect of having to do it all over again.</p> <p>We can do it. We can do it by taking everything away from them the moment they get it, and seeing if they can crawl their way back to the summit. George Osborne is nearly there. He\u2019s one harrowing Latvian stag weekend away from rock bottom, and only then will he start to look like one of us. He can do it. I believe in him.</p> <p>Incidentally, Farage\u2019s moustache doesn\u2019t count. I want my politicians broken, not done up like a cackhanded \u2019Allo \u2019Allo! am-dram.</p>",
  "<p>My mother-in-law, Elizabeth Goodacre, known to her family and friends as Beth, who has died aged 87, was a leading researcher in the field of teaching children to read.</p> <p>Her early books included Reading in Infant Classes (1967), Teachers and Their Pupils\u2019 Home Backgrounds (1968), School and Home (1970) and Children and Learning to Read (1971). She was an adviser to the BBC series for young readers Words and Pictures and researched the major impact that teachers\u2019 expectations based on pupils\u2019 home background had on the children\u2019s achievements, a phenomenon that perpetuated disadvantage.</p> <p>She was born in Sydney, Australia, to Will Standish, who had worked in the timber industry, and Josephine Anderson, an ABC radio presenter. Beth was an only child, arriving unexpectedly after 22 years of marriage. Her father died when she was eight and her mother when she was 18. She trained as a teacher and, like many young Australians in the postwar period, took up the opportunity to travel to the \u201cmother country\u201d in 1951.</p> <p>As a result of taking up amateur dramatics, she met David Goodacre, whom she married in 1960. He was an architect whose designs included the family home in Cuffley, Hertfordshire. Beth combined raising three children with an academic career in educational psychology at the National Foundation for Educational Research. A Labour supporter, she stood in local council elections in the staunchly Conservative Northaw and Cuffley ward.</p> <p>In 1973 she was appointed principal lecturer in education at Trent Park College of Education, shortly before it merged with Middlesex Polytechnic in 1974 (becoming Middlesex University in 1992). She was promoted to a chair in education in the 1980s and became head of department in 1990, retiring in 1994.</p> <p>Beth revisited her homeland in the 90s, initially as an invited speaker at a teacher training conference at the University of Western Sydney, later to do field work for a book, Living the Past: Reconstruction, Recreation, Re-enactment and Education at Museums and Historical Sites, written with Gavin Baldwin and published in 2002. In the intervening years, she retained her Australian nationality and consistently failed the \u201cTebbit test\u201d of loyalty to her adopted country by supporting the Australian cricket team.</p> <p>David died in 2003.

  "<p>The creation of the 1.3 million hectare <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2015/11/a-critical-gift-peru-rejoices-as-a-new-national-park-is-born/\">Sierra del Divisor National Park</a> in the western Amazon in November 2015 generated considerable elation and Peruvian and international media coverage. Logging, gold-mining, coca cultivation and narco-trafficking were highlighted by some media as ongoing threats to the new park, but why such failure to acknowledge what is possibly, in the long-term, the most serious threat of all? </p> <p>The sorry, alarming fact is that approximately 40% of the park is superimposed by an oil and gas concession run by a Canadian-headquartered company, Pacific Exploration and Production. This is despite Peru\u2019s 1997 Law of Protected Natural Areas stating \u201cthe extraction of natural resources is not permitted\u201d in parks, while 2001 regulations on Protected Natural Areas state \u201cthe exploitation of natural resources is prohibited.\u201d In addition, Peru\u2019s 1993 Constitution \u201cobliges\u201d the government \u201cto promote the conservation of biological diversity and protected natural areas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3cacbdf0785ee245bbaa50bc84ee93116fae4a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3cacbdf0785ee245bbaa50bc84ee93116fae4a9/7_208_465_279/465.png\" alt=\"Map showing how Pacific's concession, Lot 135, with its boundaries in black and purple, overlaps the Sierra del Divisor National Park, with boundaries in red and sky blue.\" width=\"465\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map showing how Pacific\u2019s concession, Lot 135, with its boundaries in black and purple, overlaps the Sierra del Divisor National Park, with boundaries in red and sky blue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screenshot from July 2016 Perupetro map.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peru\u2019s government is currently preparing a \u201cPlan Maestro\u201d - \u201cMaster Plan\u201d - for the park and deciding how different areas within it will be used. Proposals seen by the Guardian, in Environment Ministry (MINAM) and Culture Ministry (MINCU) documents, are deeply concerning. While it is encouraging that almost the entire south-east part of the park is being proposed as a \u201cstrictly protected zone\u201d because it overlaps the <a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/11271\">Isconahua Reserve</a> established in 1998 to protect indigenous peoples living in \u201cisolation\u201d, the whole north-east part of the park, which overlaps the <em>proposed</em> Yavari-Tapiche Reserve for other indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d, is not due to receive the same level of protection and instead is slated to be a \u201cspecial use zone.\u201d<br></p> <p>Why? Compare a MINCU map of the proposed zonification with maps from Peru\u2019s oil and gas sector and the reason is obvious: the proposed \u201cspecial use zone\u201d in the north-east corresponds to that part of the park overlapped by the oil and gas concession, Lot 135, where Pacific explored in late 2012 and 2013.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b8a859d8810ab8bcf49736868994b0e27e58989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8a859d8810ab8bcf49736868994b0e27e58989/0_0_474_380/474.png\" alt=\"2009 Pacific map showing the company\u2019s interest in operating in part of what is now the Sierra del Divisor National Park, marked in dark green.

According to MINCU\u2019s map, the very southern tip of the park - and therefore the very southern tip of the Isconahua Reserve - will also be a \u201cspecial use zone\u201d, rather than a \u201cstrictly protected zone.\u201d Why? Again, the reason is obvious: that part of the park and reserve corresponds to an oil and gas concession, Lot 138, which was held by Pacific up until December 2014. </p> <p>It is a similar story in the far west of the park where one - admittedly tiny - area is also proposed as a \u201cspecial use zone.\u201d Yet again, the reason is obvious: that part of the park corresponds to an oil and gas concession too, Lot 31-B, ultimately controlled by the US-based Maple Resources Corporation. </p> <p>Indeed, the west and north-west of the park fall within what would be the Sierra del Divisor Occidental Reserve, effectively proposed in 2007 as another off-limits area for indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d but which, like Yavari-Tapiche, has never been established. Only a small part of that proposed reserve now inside the park is due to be a \u201cstrictly protected zone.\u201d </p> <p>This zonification is being proposed by SERNANP despite Peru\u2019s 2001 regulations clearly stating that a newly-created \u201cprotected natural area\u201d must respect the \u201cproperty rights and other acquired rights\u201d of indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation.\u201d In addition, the regulations state that it must \u201cpromote mechanisms to make the objectives and aims of Protected Natural Areas compatible with their ancestral uses.\u201d</p> <p>Responses to the proposed zonification by indigenous organisations in Peru have included accusing SERNANP, which sits within MINAM and runs Peru\u2019s \u201cprotected natural areas\u201d, of backtracking on promises made during the administrative process to establish the park and \u201cmisinforming\u201d indigenous communities in the region. According to a declaration made in April this year by ORPIO, an indigenous federation representing more than 20 indigenous organisations in Peru\u2019s northern Amazon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Along with [indigenous organisations] AIDESEP and ORAU we supported the creation of the Sierra del Divisor National Park on the condition that the rights and protection of the indigenous peoples living there would be guaranteed by SERNANP, as much as in the law establishing the park and regulations for its management as in practice. . . Contrary to its commitments to acknowledge the proposed Yavari Tapiche and Sierra del Divisor Occidental Reserves for indigenous peoples in isolation and give them the highest level of protection by classifying them as strictly protected zones, SERNANP has omitted all references to such peoples and reserves in the law creating the park as well as in the proposed zonification, and has even failed to acknowledge the proposed reserves in its maps.</p> </blockquote> <p>AIDESEP, an indigenous federation representing indigenous organisations across all Peru\u2019s Amazon, has been extremely critical too. \u201cSERNANP ignores existence of indigenous peoples in isolation in order to prioritise \u201ceconomic rights\u201d,\u201d ran the title of an AIDESEP statement summarising ORPIO\u2019s April declaration. </p> <p>The very north of the park also overlaps an area considered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2014/nov/28/brazil-javari-valley-threatened-peruvian-oil-tribes\">Mats\u00e9s indigenous people</a> to be part of their territory. A statement released in April by Mats\u00e9s from both Peru and Brazil said they reject any kind of oil and gas operations and demand Lot 135 is annulled. It also said the Mats\u00e9s confirm the presence of indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d in the Yavari-Tapiche Reserve and claim the Brazilian government\u2019s National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) has evidence of them - and that as a result the two governments, Peru\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s, should coordinate.</p> <p>\u201cConsidering that part of the Sierra del Divisor National Park is the ancestral territory of the Mats\u00e9s and peoples in isolation, we urge that the park\u2019s Plan Maestro and zonification respects the presence of such peoples in the area proposed for the Yavari-Tapiche Reserve, as well as respecting the right of the Mats\u00e9s\u2019s traditional use of this zone and prohibiting activities by third parties,\u201d the Mats\u00e9s statement read. \u201cWe urge that the future control posts in the park in the River Yaquerana basin are run exclusively by the Mats\u00e9s.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, in July, ORPIO took legal action against MINCU, filing a case with the Superior Court of Justice in Lima. According to ORPIO, MINCU is violating 2007 regulations by moving too slowly to create the proposed Yavari-Tapiche Reserve and four others, and, in the meantime, failing to \u201cimplement the necessary mechanisms and measures\u201d to protect the indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d living there. </p> <p>Asked to respond to the indigenous organisations\u2019 accusations, SERNANP\u2019s Mariela Huachillo told the Guardian that they plan \u201cto implement the necessary mechanisms and measures to guarantee the protection of indigenous peoples in isolation and initial contact.\u201d She says that national parks are intended to protect \u201ccultural characteristics\u201d \u201cassociated\u201d with \u201cintangible\u201d eco-systems, that no \u201cnew rights\u201d can be granted to exploit natural resources, and that the park will be monitored and protected from outsiders. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, SERNANP cannot impose restrictions, through the zonification, on other sectors for which it is not responsible,\u201d Huachillo says.</p> <p>According to Huachillo, SERNANP is developing the Plan Maestro \u201cwith the financial support\u201d of CEDIA, a Peruvian NGO. CEDIA\u2019s Lelis Rivera told the Guardian the funds have been provided by the US-based Rainforest Trust, and that, while his NGO has provided \u201ctechnical and financial support\u201d, the Plan Maestro is ultimately \u201cthe responsibility of SERNANP.\u201d He says that the proposed zonification emerged from the administrative process establishing the park and can be traced back to 2012, that local indigenous communities agreed to the zonification, and that both AIDESEP and MINCU have been, from the start, part of the Ad Hoc Commission to develop the Plan Maestro and as a result the existence of the proposed reserves and the protection of the indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d \u201cis being taken into account.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe zonification comes with conditions, rules and laws which justify each type of zone, what you can and can\u2019t do where, and what are the special considerations for each space,\u201d Rivera told the Guardian. </p> <p>Just a few days after the park was created the US-based Andes Amazon Fund (AAF) announced it would provide $1 million, over five years, to help SERNANP to protect the park. AAF\u2019s Enrique Ortiz told the Guardian the money, none of which has been disbursed yet, will not be spent \u201con the development of the Master Plan or zoning\u201d, but that it will be spent on \u201cprotection activities\u201d although they \u201care still working out exactly what those will be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe zoning is a responsibility of SERNANP and we are not involved in it,\u201d Ortiz says. \u201cWe would certainly believe that SERNANP should address those concerns of the indigenous organizations.\u201d </p> <p>But will SERNANP do so? Can the proposed zonification be improved? Can the Rainforest Trust, given that it is providing funds, wield any influence?</p> <p>SERNANP\u2019s Huachillo effectively dodged those first two questions, saying instead that the establishment of the park didn\u2019t prohibit the Yavari-Tapiche and Sierra del Divisor Occidental Reserves from being created. CEDIA\u2019s Rivera\u2019s answer was more encouraging: \u201cThe law states that SERNANP can change the zonification at any moment, if reality requires it, for example, if an acquired right is annulled or a reserve for the indigenous people in isolation is established.\u201d</p> <p>Pacific told the Guardian it disagrees that the north-east of the park is not being proposed as a \u201cstrictly protected zone\u201d because it is overlapped by its concession. </p> <p>\u201cPacific does not accept that part of the park could eventually not be considered a protected zone simply because part of it is assigned to [our company] under block 135,\u201d says Pacific\u2019s Melissa Mackie. \u201cWe have sculpted our operations based on the existence of these environmental restrictions.\u201d</p> <p>Pacific signed the contract for Lot 135 in 2007 - for 30 years for oil or 40 years for gas.

  "<p>New mothers are facing increasing discrimination when they take maternity leave including being made redundant and switched to zero-hours contracts.</p> <p>Citizens Advice has recorded a nearly 60% rise in the number of women seeking advice about maternity leave issues this year. Just over 3,300 came to the charity with such issues in the year to June compared to 2,099 last year.</p> <p>The surge in reported problems has emerged after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/12/sports-direct-staff-who-took-maternity-leave-put-on-zero-hours-contracts\">the Guardian revealed that Sports Direct workers returning from maternity leave are claiming they were moved on to zero-hours contracts</a>. The claims were made in court documents relating to a breach-of-contract case in which workers say they were excluded from the retailer\u2019s generous bonus scheme.</p> <p>Citizens Advice says the introduction of fees for employment tribunals, through which workers can challenge poor treatment, has combined with the rise of zero-hours contracts, agency work and multiple part-time jobs to make employees more vulnerable to sharp practice on maternity rights.</p> <p>Legally, women are protected from losing their job, having their hours changed or their responsibility reduced as a result of pregnancy. While employment and sex discrimination legislation offers protection, responsibility for enforcing such employment rights is spread across a wide range of agencies, from HMRC to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.</p> <p>\u201cThis confusing landscape means some bad bosses are getting away with treating their employees unfairly,\u201d Guy said. \u201cThere is an opportunity for the government to consider bringing together the expertise of all current labour market enforcement functions into one well-resourced, effective body to investigate bad practice.\u201d</p> <p>Citizens Advice said the most common issue it dealt with in relation to maternity leave was being made redundant followed by a reduction in hours, including being moved to a zero-hours contract and having a role changed upon return to work.</p> <p>A report into the issue, released by Citizens Advice this week, highlights the case of Nadia, who worked as a head chef in a local pub on a permanent contract. When she had difficulties during her pregnancy that meant she could no longer work in the kitchen she was offered work as a waitress on a zero-hours contract.</p> <p>Another woman, who works for a national retail chain, told the Guardian she had her hours cut from about 34 a week to 26 during her pregnancy after she arrived late for work on one occasion. </p> <p>\u201cThey said it was for my safety but that didn\u2019t make sense. I was fine,\u201d she said.

They included Roger Kline, who undertook research at Middlesex University in 2014 that lamented NHS leadership in London as overwhelmingly white. It has also introduced an NHS workforce race equality standard, which requires trusts to increase the number of people of a BME background in senior positions. </p> <p>An NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cThis is an issue that the NHS must address. That\u2019s why in June this year we published the first NHS workforce race equality standard (WRES) report, which gave feedback to every hospital and trust across the NHS about the experiences of their BME staff.

This includes training and developing 75 champions based in trusts who will help reduce inequality and spread best practice.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Hot baths.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Ancient.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Bubbly.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s nice. I love a long, hot bath with a book and a cup of tea.</strong> Who doesn\u2019t?</p> <p><strong>Cats. But otherwise, sure. It\u2019s like being back in the womb, but with a book and a cup of tea.</strong> And it\u2019s good for you. Better than exercise!</p> <p><strong>Really? </strong>Well, in one narrow way, based on a single study with a small sample, perhaps.</p> <p><strong>I see. How do we know this? </strong>Some scientist called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-36744906\">Dr Steve Faulkner</a> did this experiment at Loughborough University where he fitted 10 unfit males with rectal thermometers and other devices, then got them to have long, hot, relaxing baths.</p> <p><strong>I think I\u2019d be more relaxed without the thermometer. </strong>You get used to it. After the bath, the men got a meal, and on another day they did some vigorous cycling instead of the bath.</p> <p><strong>And?</strong> Much to everyone\u2019s surprise, <a href=\"http://diabetestimes.co.uk/hot-bath-help-control-type-2-diabetes/\">the bathers had peak blood sugar levels after eating that were 10% lower than the cyclists\u2019</a>. In short, the study suggests that hot baths might do a better job than exercise at lowering your blood sugar, which is the challenge in diabetes. The theory is that it is something to do with \u201cheat shock proteins\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Fantastic! When I develop diabetes, I\u2019ll remember that. </strong>Controlling peak blood sugar may also prevent diabetes. Plus, having a long, hot bath was found to increase calorie burning by 80%. Nowhere near as much as cycling, but still useful. In an hour in a hot bath, the men each burned 126 calories, which is about the same as a half-hour walk.</p> <p><strong>So, quick recap: science says I can stop doing exercise and eat whatever I like as long as I have plenty of baths?</strong> No. Science says: \u201cWe would always encourage increased physical activity and exercise as the best way to maintain good health.\u201d Faulkner does, anyway.</p> <p><strong>How about the risks, such as slipping over on the tiles or getting wrinkly toes?

  "<p>The producer Anne Balfour-Fraser, who has died aged 92, oversaw the making of some 100 short films between the mid-1950s and mid-80s.

  "<p>Frank Ocean seems to like to look chaotic, even slapdash. This long-teased album\u2019s eventual release as an Apple Music stream was announced on his Tumblr with a post that read: \u201cFUCK, SORRY.. I TOOK A NAP, BUT IT\u2019S PLAYING ON APPLE RADIO RN.\u201d It\u2019s titled Blonde online and in his Boys Don\u2019t Cry magazine, which accompanies the release, but Blond on the album CD artwork \u2013 which also manages to misspell \u201cElliot [sic] Smith\u201d (Ocean borrows the entire chorus of Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nabO_UXb6MM\">Fond Farewell</a> for his track Siegfried). Sonically, there\u2019s no dramatic shift from Endless, the \u201cvisual album\u201d that appeared just two days ago: indeed it could be a continuation of that album. It\u2019s a very subdued record: the melodies meander, more often than not without drums, and snatches of dialogue and weird electronic glitches interrupt conventional-seeming parts. Seven of the 17 tracks are under the three-minute mark. There\u2019s a rap verse in Japanese at the end of Nikes<strong>.</strong> One might be tempted on first hearing to think that the tangled and overlong creative process has got the better of Ocean, and that he\u2019s just released a hodge-podge of more or less finished ideas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/19/frank-ocean-endless-review-brilliantly-confounding\">Frank Ocean: Endless first-listen review \u2013 brilliantly confounding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It only takes a couple of plays to put paid to that suspicion. Another of Ocean\u2019s Tumblr posts reads \u201cTHANK YOU ALL. ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO NEVER LET ME FORGET I HAD TO FINISH. WHICH IS BASICALLY EVERY ONE OF YA\u2019LL.\u201d Once you\u2019re immersed in it, it becomes abundantly clear he\u2019s taken this seriously, and this very much is a finished album. It\u2019s a carefully structured album to boot: the segue from Be Yourself, constructed from a concerned phone message from Ocean\u2019s mother, into Solo, an intensely affecting song about drugged paralysis, is just the most obvious example. Elsewhere it flows in subtle ways from one track to the next, an inexorable sense of a narrative being spun out but never spelled out.</p> <p>It\u2019s a complicated, indulgent, moody record, though, one that deals in textures and impressions more than in pop hooks and instant thrills. Its superstar guest spots are woven into the textures, not signposted: Beyonc\u00e9, for example, just adds wordless harmonising to the adolescent memories of Pink + White, and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s contribution to Skyline To is as a writer and producer, with his voice only appearing as a few cryptic, barked ad-libs. Guitars ripple throughout, some of which are certainly Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood; any that are not are certainly beholden to him. James Blake appears on the credits, where he is on the record it\u2019s impossible to tell, though his influence is everywhere. The only person who really leaps out is Outkast\u2019s Andr\u00e9 3000, verbally somersaulting over a minute of bleeps and jazz piano on Solo (Reprise), but even he doesn\u2019t break the mood.</p> <p>It\u2019s precisely that consistency of mood that brings together all the seeming weirdness into something extraordinarily listenable as a complete piece. When detuned guitar arpeggios suddenly take over the track then collapse into electronic glitch, in the episodic Nights, or when robot voices intrude on the otherwise Bill Withers-like guitar-and-vocal ballad Self Control, they\u2019re not gimmicks or attempts to be modern: once you\u2019re in Frank Ocean world, they seem completely natural. We\u2019re seeing the maturation of a few trends of the last few years. The indiefication of hip-hop culture, which had its most mainstream expression with the bromance between Jay-Z and Chris Martin, and saw every other mainstream rap/R&amp;B tune have a moaning white guy chorus for a while, is here expressed in infinitely more musically and emotionally sophisticated form. Likewise the weird electronic side of \u201calt-R&amp;B\u201d \u2013 the dialogue between black American culture and British bedroom experimentalists like Blake and the xx \u2013 is subsumed elegantly into Ocean\u2019s writing and recording process.</p> <p>Under all the subtlety and still surfaces, there are actually hooks here \u2013 just not the needy, salesmanlike kind that wave at you, shouting; \u201cHere I am, remember this song!\u201d The melodies\u2013 not only on the swaying soul waltz of \u2018Pink + White\u2019, or the tick-tock melody of the conventional R&amp;B sections of Night, but in the outer-space balladry of Siegfried and the future gospel crawl of the heartbreaking Godspeed \u2013 lodge very quickly in the memory and stay there. And there are single moments like the way Ocean hollers \u201cI\u2019m not brave!\u201d in Siegfried that can stop you in your tracks. Once these musical elements are in your subconscious, a complicated set of ideas starts to unfold. Among all the immediate autobiographical and introspective themes of weed, cars, women, men, consumerism, growing up and responsibility, are all kinds of complex wordplay, and references to Shakespeare and Teutonic myth, but as with everything these are subtly done. They don\u2019t clang into the songs as signals of bourgeois erudition, but slide in, signposting more and deeper themes which will only become apparent as we live with the album. And yes, it\u2019s true: this is going to be an album worth living with. </p>",

The subject was the rejection of conventional society with its racism, warfare and repression; and the construction of alternative realities.

Like that show, this one promises to use music, objects and images not only to reanimate pop and social history but also to evoke something of the magic and mania of that tumultuous period.

The free speech protests marked a direct link from the civil rights movement, in which Savio had participated, to the anti-war protests that would convulse Berkeley at the end of the 60s; just as the Beatniks of the previous decade, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg\">Allen Ginsberg</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Cassady\">Neal Cassady</a>, had profoundly influenced the hippies.</p> <p>We meet Rick Moss, curator at the <a href=\"http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/locations/african-american-museum-library-oakland\">African American Museum in Oakland</a>, who was 12 when the Black Panthers started galvanising his San Francisco community. \u201cIt was very empowering because at no point in your upbringing were you ever given examples of where black people were standing up for themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when you see guys swaggering to the state capitol and they\u2019re having their weapons, it\u2019s like The Lone Ranger. We were like: \u2018This is great! This is what you do, you stand up to injustice.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Then there are the artists who defined the aesthetics of psychedelia. One, Joe McHugh, created a Jefferson Airplane-inspired poster called <a href=\"https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/538883911641195435/\">White Rabbit</a>, which depicted a rabbit standing on a chessboard, the words \u201ckeep your head\u201d dematerialising in the background. The other, Stanley Miller, known as Mouse, made the <a href=\"http://www.rrauction.com/Stanley-Mouse-Grateful-Dead-Painting.html\">skull and roses artwork for the Grateful Dead</a>, although he much preferred hanging out with Janis Joplin. \u201cShe was wild,\u201d he remembers, with a glint in his eye. \u201cThe first time she came to my studio she chased me around \u2013 I was kind of scared of her.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People drew pictures of the psych experience with lot of colours and mandalas, but to me, on acid everything got clear</p> <footer> <cite>Stanley 'Mouse' Miller</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Music had drawn him from Detroit to California: \u201cIt was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/16/how-we-made-eight-miles-high-the-byrds\">the Byrds</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mamas_%26_the_Papas\">the Mama and the Papas</a> \u2013 that ringing sound, like a siren calling me,\u201d he says, still dreamy at the memory. Like most of the cultural productions of the time, his posters were drug-induced, but he never employed the bulbous lettering and eye-searing hues popular at the time. \u201cA lot of people, how they drew pictures of the psych experience was a lot of colours and mandalas, but to me, [on acid] everything got super-clear.\u201d</p> <p>Miller later moved to London, where he spent a year working for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(UK_magazine)\">Nova magazine</a> and hanging out at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps\">Beatles\u2019 Apple headquarters</a> on Savile Row (now a branch of Abercrombie and Fitch). He saw their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_rooftop_concert\">final concert take place on the building\u2019s roof</a>, without realising that he was witnessing history. He also stopped taking acid that year. \u201cIt fell out of fashion.

The architect <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller\">Buckminster Fuller</a> \u2013 whose <a href=\"https://bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/geodesic-domes\">geodesic dome</a> was displayed in the USA pavilion at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Biosph%C3%A8re\">1967 World Expo in Montreal</a> \u2013 had made the point \u201cthat people think it\u2019s a flat Earth, which makes them think its resources are infinite, and if they just understood it is a sphere, and therefore finite, they would treat everything differently.\u201d</p> <p>Brand got badges printed that asked: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?\u201d and the following year an image taken by satellite was released by Nasa. It gave the cover image and title to Brand\u2019s next project, the Whole Earth Catalog, published in the autumn of 1968, biannually until 1972, then sporadically afterwards.</p> <p>Like many of the originators of San Francisco\u2019s counterculture, Brand had become fed up with the enormous influx of rubberneckers into Haight-Ashbury and, in 1968, headed out to New Mexico and Colorado to participate in the movement to live on communes in America\u2019s vast countryside. Before long, he realised that the communards would need tools, books and ideas, which he decided to collate into a mail-order catalogue. \u201cWhim is the best source,\u201d he says. \u201cThe catalogue enables the ability to have a whim and then act upon it, and that\u2019s pretty much my life.\u201d</p> <p>Brand hands me his copy of the first Whole Earth Catalog, dog-eared and with the dimensions of an oversized magazine (a copy will be in the show).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b41f1bf8e5198d3876ca59d66beda9fe50479eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b41f1bf8e5198d3876ca59d66beda9fe50479eb/0_234_3710_2226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Psychedelic rock concert at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Psychedelic rock concert at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Purely on a media level, the Whole Earth Catalog has been hugely influential; when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/behind-the-relaunch-of-the-new-york-times-magazine-by-jake-silverstein.html?_r=0\">the New York Times relaunched its Sunday magazine</a> in February last year, it also had a globe on the cover. The pages inside the catalogue are wonderfully designed, stuffed with information, but never messy or confusing. It wasn\u2019t this, however, that made the catalogue truly groundbreaking. First of all, it was crowdsourced \u2013 40 years before the term became commonplace. Brand appealed for readers to send in suggestions for items that those in communes would find useful (\u201cthe customers know best,\u201d he said), paid $10 per item used, and printed the most helpful, making up about a quarter of the overall content. This underlined the fact that the catalogue wasn\u2019t a book so much as a network, where likeminded people could find and share the information they needed to enter and improve alternative worlds. Symbolising this \u2013 alongside boots and teepees \u2013 the first issue featured Hewlett-Packard\u2019s desktop computer, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard_9100A\">9100A Calculator</a>, then retailing at $4,900.</p> <p>Brand straddled the worlds of the communes and computers, having become interested in the latter while studying at Stanford, where he filmed the first public demonstration of a computer mouse in 1968. \u201cI was just endlessly impatient for all these things to come into the world, because I\u2019d already seen it \u2013 the mouse and online typing, being able to mutually massage something on screen with another person, which even now is kind of difficult \u2026 [it was] apparatus to augment the human intellect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3d88c11a01e7a4e988b8e9f79d97a292a262528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3d88c11a01e7a4e988b8e9f79d97a292a262528/0_0_3937_3087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swingeing London 67 (a) 1968 69, Richard Hamilton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swingeing London 67 (a) 1968 69, Richard Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Hamilton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This reconceptualising of the world as an information network made the catalogue hugely inspiring to a significant handful of local computer scientists. To the most forward-thinking and idealistic, the possibilities of technology hinted at a new world in which information could be shared among likeminded people, leaping over barriers of geography, race or class.</p> <p>One of them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/stevejobs\">Steve Jobs</a>, who was brought up in Palo Alto and who, in 2005, told a group of graduating students at Stanford <a href=\"http://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/\">in a famous speech</a>: \u201cThe Whole Earth Catalog \u2026 was one of the bibles of my generation \u2026 it was a sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\u201d</p> <p>Jobs concluded his address with: \u201cStay hungry, stay foolish\u201d \u2013 Brand\u2019s motto from a mid-70s issue, intended as the final one, which Jobs claimed as his ethos and which has now become ubiquitous as a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Stay+hungry,+stay+foolish+t+shirt&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjutJD1rs3OAhWBWxoKHRiSAeEQ_AUICSgC&amp;biw=2222&amp;bih=1170\">T-shirt slogan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&amp;biw=2222&amp;bih=1170&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=Stay+hungry%2C+stay+foolish+meme&amp;oq=Stay+hungry%2C+stay+foolish+meme&amp;gs_l=img.3...12704.12859.0.12974.2.2.0.0.0.0.54.80.2.2.0.cprnk%2Ctoken%3Doa...0...1.1j2.64.img..0.1.54...0.c2jp1Q61ywE\">meme</a>.

He points to the fact that the Grateful Dead were so community-minded that they even had an enclave at their concerts where audience members could stand and tape the shows. \u201cThey were experimental, avant garde and they literally allowed people to record their concerts,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, at a time when you were making money selling records, to let people make their own.

Team USA now have six straight women\u2019s Olympic basketball golds. Only two other teams in Olympic history \u2013 in any sport \u2013 have won as many in a row: the US men from 1936 to 1968 in basketball and India\u2019s men\u2019s field hockey team <a href=\"http://www.sportskeeda.com/hockey/revisiting-india-hockeys-record-breaking-run-at-1956-olympics-its-diamond-jubilee\">from 1928 to 1956</a>. The team\u2019s winning streak is up to 49 games overall and only one of those have been by single digits. Nine players on the current roster entered Saturday\u2019s match-up with Spain with gold medals already in their Olympic career. The full roster arrives back home with 29 career golds. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing stuff that may never be done again,\u201d head coach Geno Auriemma said after the game. </p> <p>Diana Taurasi said the 2016 US team is the best she\u2019s ever been on \u201chands down.\u201d The sharp-shooting guard now has four Olympic golds to go along with three WNBA titles, three NCAA titles and six Euroleague championships. She knows great teams. </p> <p>The US entered the tournament as the heavy favorite, but picking a \u201cfavorite\u201d implies there is competition. Bolt is going to win sprinting events as long as his shoes aren\u2019t accidentally tied together, and this US women\u2019s team were going to win basketball gold as long as the team bus got them to the arena in time.</p> <p>Taurasi, Maya Moore, Sue Bird, Brittney Griner and friends achieved that level of dominance in which their accomplishment is immediately removed from the present and compared to history. We know they\u2019re the best women\u2019s basketball team of 2016. We know they\u2019re the best women\u2019s basketball team of their era. Those are not up for reasonable debate. But does the 2016 US women\u2019s basketball team deserve to be talked about among the best teams in American history in any sport? It\u2019s hard to make the case that they do not. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/09/olympic-moments-dream-team-1992\">50 stunning Olympic moments No48: the Dream Team win gold in 1992 | Ian McCourt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first obvious comparison comes with Olympic basketball <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/09/olympic-moments-dream-team-1992\">and the 1992 \u201cDream Team\u201d</a> that cruised to a gold medal in the men\u2019s tournament by an average margin of victory of 43.8 points, not too far ahead of the 37.2 points per game margin the US women just put up. That men\u2019s team was so good, they famously reduced the competition to getting autographs and going for moral victories. Same with the 2016 women. After Sunday\u2019s gold medal game, Spanish point guard Silvia Dominguez said her team was \u201cglad that we could compete like the first quarter.\u201d Did Spain have the lead after the first quarter? Nope. They were down four points, 21-17. Even the 1992 Dream Team trailed Croatia 25-23 in the first half of their gold medal game. It\u2019s also fair to note that the \u201892 team feasted in part because the sport was only starting to explode internationally. But Team USA\u2019s competition in Rio included 14 current WNBA players, and many more former WNBA players. And while the Dream Team had legends like Jordan, Magic and Bird, these US women have Taurasi, Catchings and their own Bird (and, for an extra bonus point: no Christian Laettner equivalent).</p> <p>An overwhelming case can\u2019t be made that the US women are better than the \u201892 men, but there\u2019s no sense arguing they\u2019re lesser than either. You can\u2019t minimize greatness. </p> <p>College basketball have teams that deserve to be in the same sentence, beginning with the UCLA men\u2019s basketball dynasty under John Wooden from 1963 through 1975. Ten titles in 12 years behind star players \u2013 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then Lew Alcindor, and Bill Walton, then and very much always Bill Walton \u2013 and a legendary coach in John Wooden. These US women meet all those criteria: the sustained dominance, the generational talents and the iconic coach. </p> <p>Any discussion of basketball dominance <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-uconn-auriemma-20160403-story.html\">must include Auriemma\u2019s UConn program</a>, winners of four NCAA titles in a row and 10 of the last 16. Four months ago the Huskies tore through the NCAA Tournament field, winning games by an average margin of 39 points and the title game over Syracuse by a final score of 82-51. Taurasi made it known where the 2016 Olympic team stands among her basketball achievements and fellow UConn product Breanna Stewart \u2013 a member of both the 2016 Huskies and 2016 Olympic team \u2013 said winning gold was her biggest athletic achievement. </p> <p>Of course, when it comes to basketball, no discussion of greatest ever can avoid talking about the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls, as we were reminded during this NBA season with every Golden State Warriors (regular season) game. </p> <p>Leaping from basketball to compare the US women to all-time teams from other sports is harder to discuss \u2013 what\u2019s the three-pointer to home run conversion rate? \u2013 but doing so doesn\u2019t minimize their accomplishments. When people find themselves wondering: \u201cIs that basketball team as good as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1927_New_York_Yankees_season\">the 1927 Yankees</a>?\u201d, you know you\u2019re talking about a pretty amazing basketball team. </p> <p>The 17-0 Miami Dolphins of 1972 went undefeated, but they eeked out a lot of victories along the way. The 2007 Patriots destroyed the opposition on the way to 18-0, but finished at 18-1. The \u201885 Chicago Bears won Super Bowl 46-10, but they also didn\u2019t go undefeated. The 1998 New York Yankees deserve consideration from baseball thanks to coasting to a World Series title after posting a 114-48 regular season record. And no doubt sports historians or sports hipsters will mention the <a href=\"http://1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings\">1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings</a> and their 57-0-1 record. They were undoubtedly great and no one can take that, or their stockings, away from them. </p> <p>Every team mentioned above, and most definitely the 2016 US women\u2019s basketball team, deserves consideration among the greatest. The only way to find better groups is to go to the world of fiction. Could the US women beat Michael Jordan\u2019s Space Jam team when he employed extra long reach <a href=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.mandatory.com/media/2013/06/27-michael-jordan-space-jam-stretched-arm.png\">to dunk with an alien on his back?</a> Do they have a defender who could shut down Air Bud? Maybe not. </p> <p>But if we\u2019re being real, the women are without question among the best teams of all-time. </p>",

It is not about looking at how people look, how they speak, how they run, it is not about being muscular. It is all about sport. When you walk out of your apartment you think about performing, you do not think about how your opponent looks. So I think the advice from me to everybody is just to go out there and have fun.\u201d </p> <p>So many South Africans have united behind Semenya, using <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-37095600\">the twitter hashtag #handsoffcaster</a>. Listening to her talk it was clear they are motivated by much more than chauvinism.</p> <p>Inspiring as Semenya\u2019s words were, the truth is that her competitors don\u2019t all think like she does. Britain\u2019s Lynsey Sharp, who finished sixth, was congratulated on Twitter by her team-mate, Nigel Levine, who wrote \u201cHappy for Lynsey Sharp for coming 3rd in women 800m\u201d. </p> <p>Sharp, who wrote a paper on Semenya while she was studying at law school, has seemed to struggle to contain her emotions this week. On the BBC, Paula Radcliffe explained why she felt Sharp was so upset. \u201cHowever hard she goes away and trains, however hard Jenny Meadows goes and trains, they are never going to be able to compete with that level of strength and recovery that those levels of elevated testosterone brings.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/29/what-is-an-intersex-athlete-explaining-the-case-of-caster-semenya\">What is an intersex athlete? Explaining the case of Caster Semenya</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Radcliffe said that Semenya and the other hyperandrogenic women should either \u201ctake the medication to suppress the levels, or they choose to have an operation or they choose not to compete\u201d. Incredible as this sounds, Radcliffe is right that several hyperandrogenic athletes have undergone major surgery at the behest of athletics officials. </p> <p>In 2013 it was revealed that four young female athletes from developing countries, all with atypically high but entirely natural levels of testosterone, were sent to a clinic in France where doctors proposed removing their gonads and partially removing their clitorises. All four agreed, and a year later they returned to competition.</p> <p>Hyperandrogenic athletes need protection. So do the runners such as Sharp, who feel, <a href=\"http://sportsscientists.com/2016/07/caster-semenya-debate/\">with good reason</a>, that they are competing at an unfair disadvantage. There are no easy answers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/caster-semenya-800m-heat-gender-controversy-rio-olympics\">and precious little agreement</a>. As for Semenya, she is stuck in the middle, a human rights pioneer to some, something near a pariah to others. She said that her coaches had told her to try and forget about everything but her running. \u201cI know what I can do,\u201d she said, \u201cI just want to be a better athlete.\u201d </p> <p>And on Saturday night, as she crossed the finish line and celebrated her win by flexing her biceps and brushing imaginary dust from her shoulders, she looked like nothing other than what she is. A happy, proud, and brilliantly talented woman.</p>",

That was a quite wonderful team goal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bee04024812a4dd53bfa77f6894516b44cef427\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bee04024812a4dd53bfa77f6894516b44cef427/0_0_2929_1835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stuani slots home number two.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stuani slots home number two.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T13:34:09.719Z\">at 2.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b9a8b3e4b0377cf1118bcf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T13:15:22.937Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>45 min</strong> Lovely play for the left-back George \u2018Put\u2019 Friend, who nutmegs Love and then cuts the ball back to Negredo, whose shot is blocked.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b9a81be4b0b7e649001b56\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T13:10:25.127Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>41 min </strong>Sunderland will be aggrieved at the scoreline, legitimately so given all their possession, though they haven\u2019t threatened to trouble the scorers as much as they would like.

That\u2019s how long it is since Sunderland and Middlesbrough last met in the Premier League, when they drew 1-1 in January 2009. The managers were Ricky Sbragia and Gareth Southgate, the goalscorers were Kenwyne Jones and Afonso Alves and players had names rather than hashtags and at signs.</p> <p>Boro were relegated that season and have only just returned under Aitor Karanka, and Sunderland are hoping to avoid the usual relegation battle under David Moyes. Both sides had decent starts to this season last weekend. Middlesbrough played well in drawing at home to Stoke, while Sunderland were a little unfortunate to lose 2-1 at Manchester City, a performance that looks even better after subsequent City results.</p> <p>There\u2019s no Premier League derby like a north-east derby.

  "<p>Farewell then Usain St Leo Bolt, also known as Lightning, also known (but only to his mum) as \u201cVJ\u201d and now also known for as long as anyone cares to keep measuring these things as the greatest track and field athlete ever. Eight years on from that introductory Beijing Olympics, the most compelling figure of the modern Games capped another frictionless display of human ultimacy in Rio by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/usain-bolt-jamaica-4x100m-gold-olympic-triple-treble-rio-2016\" title=\"\">leading Jamaica home</a> in the 4x100&#xa0;metres relay and earning not just another gold medal but a lovely collegiate moment of farewell.</p> <p>Bolt ran the final leg in Rio, taking the baton level with Japan\u2019s Aska Cambridge. From there it was just a case of rolling himself upright and oozing into that thrillingly powerful stride to take it by a suitable measure of fresh air. Watching him giggle and pose and goof about with Asafa Powell, Yohan Blake and Nickel Ashmeade at the end it seemed absurd anybody could have doubted the dreadfully monikered \u201cThreePeat\u201d, aka the Triple Treble, would come to pass. Bolt will now retire from Olympic competition with an astonishing full house of nine successive gold sprint medals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The 100m in particular has tended to eat its young. It belongs now to this departing Olympic colossus.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It makes sense in most sports to reject the title \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d. Time has not yet run out. The boundaries are always being pushed back, new peaks crested. With Bolt the notion of full-blown GOAT-ism seems less of a stretch. This isn\u2019t just a Threepeat, it\u2019s an unThreepeatable Threepeat. For a man whose life is measured out in fractions of a second his longevity is equally astonishing. Carl Lewis is the only previous man to have won two Olympic 100m sprint gold medals. Nobody had ever done it in the 200m. For Bolt to win both three times in a row, to do so while smiling and clowning and running a race apart, is something beyond, barely species\u2011parity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/20/usain-bolt-wins-olympic-games-triple-treble-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vt3h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2670425\"            data-video-name=\"Usain Bolt wins Olympic Games triple treble \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b8373de4b0b7e6490016a5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/20/160819BoltHighlightsxx_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/20/160819BoltHighlightsxx.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11796700&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/20/usain-bolt-wins-olympic-games-triple-treble-video-report\">Usain Bolt wins Olympic Games triple treble</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>These aren\u2019t the kind of medals you win by stealth, or in a talent lull. The sprints remain the extreme razor edge of all athletic competition, a strange, intoxicating quest for speed, relentlessly whittled away at by an industrial-scale machinery of expendable human material. The 100m in particular has tended to eat its young. It belongs now to this departing Olympic colossus, the man who forgot to tie his shoelaces before that gold medal run in Beijing, the prodigy chastised as lazy, the teenager whose high jinks included spending a night hiding inside a cupboard at the former prime minister\u2019s house during a track team excursion.</p> <p>Bolt\u2019s greatness as a competitor will be measured out in medals and times. His influence is just as profound beyond the track. After his gold in Beijing the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, had spoken disapprovingly of Bolt\u2019s chest-slapping exuberance, his ditzy pre-race routines. \u201cThis is not the way we perceive being a champion,\u201d Rogge&#xa0;noted.</p> <p>Time to perceive a little differently, old boy. That same champion has for the past eight years carried Rogge\u2019s sport on his back. Never mind the A-list reach, Bolt\u2019s status as track and field\u2019s sole member of the outright mega-brand sporting overclass. Here\u2019s an interesting stat: take Bolt away and the top 26 fastest times run for the 100m all belong to athletes who have failed a drug test. For the Olympics Bolt has been both a lure and an act of intoxicating misdirection.</p> <p>In Rio there were rows of empty seats once again inside the strangely incoherent concrete blob of an Olympic stadium, with its undulating white roof plonked on top as a leaky aforethought. Bolt drew the usual crackle of electricity around the stands, posing for the cameras, waving to the crowd, spreading around a little of that wonderfully easy sense of showmanship.</p> <p>His grand racing style will also be missed. At times there is almost something of the old amateur spirit about all this, the illusion of effortless superiority, in itself a form of intimidation. Denis Compton, so the story goes, turned up for a Test against South Africa without his bat, wandered down to the Lord\u2019s museum to borrow one and went out and scored a hundred. It is a story Bolt, who giggled at the end here about how little Jamaica had practised their baton changes (\u201cJust once, maybe twice,\u201d according to Asafa Powell), would enjoy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9458de6a923c8454a38ce5e931b4e4203a2a52c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9458de6a923c8454a38ce5e931b4e4203a2a52c1/624_439_2423_1454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usain Bolt soaks up the crowd\u2019s adulation in Rio after anchoring Jamaica to victory in the 4x100m to secure his ninth Olympic gold medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His father Wellesley once attributed his speed to early consumption of the Trelawny yam, a crop locals say has medicinal qualities. Growing up, Bolt played football and cricket, and like Blake was spotted while haring around the outfield as a schoolboy, the sheer venom of his runup enough to suggest serious speed in reserve.</p> <p>The big breakthrough was the 2002 world junior championships in Kingston where Bolt became the youngest 200m champion aged only 15, a race he still holds very dear. The slack years followed. \u201cEverything was easy for me,\u201d Bolt said after his 100m win in Rio. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to train hard to be the best. It was really easy. I wasn\u2019t ready. I was just enjoying life. And then after a time I figured, if you want to be in this work, if you want to be the best, you have to train to be the best.\u201d</p> <p>Then came Beijing and outright ignition. A year after taking up the 100m in earnest Bolt became the first man to win three golds and set world records in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. The odd injury aside, the odd minor dip, he hasn\u2019t stopped since.</p> <p>There is of course a shadow at the edge of this, a skein of suspicion among those bruised by relentless disappointments elsewhere. Bolt has never failed a drug test. Almost everyone else around him has. Even Bolt\u2019s relay team here had two athletes, Blake and Powell, who have failed tests. Bolt himself remains an enthusiastic client of Hans \u201cHealing Hans\u201d M\u00fcller\u2011Wohlfahrt, the German doctor and physical guru who injects his own herbal remedies into his clients, including a calf\u2019s blood serum that some find a little troubling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So why retire now? Look closer and this is perhaps a simple case of an athlete with nothing left to prove.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The human brain struggles to process such anomalous brilliance. How, the sceptics ask, can it be possible to run faster than athletes running faster than nature allows, and not just by a head but by an exhilarating&#xa0;margin?</p> <p>There is a competing counter\u2011narrative, the fact of simple physical exceptionalism. Bolt isn\u2019t just unusually tall and unusually powerful in the hips and thighs, he\u2019s unusually flexible too. No tall man has ever been able to run a bend like this, to start well enough, to get himself in position to apply the full extension of that overwhelmingly easy power in full flight. Bolt is the big man who runs like a small man, feet moving at the same fast-twitch speed, but covering one and a half times the distance in stride length. When he runs as he should, in a regular human-scale field, the basic mechanics say he\u2019s unbeatable.</p> <p>So why retire now? Bolt is about to turn thirty. He\u2019s still in control of his sport. Look closer though and this is perhaps a simple case of an athlete with nothing left to prove, set now on following the money in whatever peak earning years he has left. Bolt is currently the 32nd best paid athlete in the world, with an annual income of $32.5m putting him just below Gareth Bale, just above Serena Williams</p> <p>One figure stands out though. A relatively tiny $2.5m of that comes from what he does on the track, the rest from commercial work, To put this into context Bale earns seventy percent of his income from playing football, Bolt just seven per cent. The man who plays right-field for the Atlanta Braves earns $18m a year more than the architect of the Triple Treble. Wayne Rooney\u2019s basic wage is eight times larger than the sporting income of the greatest ever Olympian</p> <p>For Bolt those outside earnings will continue to roll in even when he quits the sport, his chief paymaster Puma accompanied by, among others, Nippon, Optus, Champion Shave, a range of bespoke insole called Enertor, and even a cameo in the computer game Temple Run. Why keep punishing the body after all these years? This is an athlete who has in the most basic sense outgrown his own sport.</p> <p>A final world championships in London await next year. The Olympics will roll on regardless. New stars will emerge, albeit shadowed now by the memory of that gloriously uplifting figure in green and yellow, always moving away, always raising the limits of the possible.</p>",

Clinton also raised more funds, taking in $52m for her campaign and Democrats, according to July filings with the Federal Election Commission, while Trump raised $37m for his campaign and Republicans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">Paul Manafort resigns as chairman of Donald Trump campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s largest expenses in July were from a new push for online fundraising, as he moved away from donating to his own campaign and more actively solicited money from voters. Trump has <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/forgiving-campaign-loans-trump-fulfills-his-pledge-self-fund-primary-n613536\">given about $52m</a> to his own campaign, but is no longer self-funding the bulk of the effort through loans or donations.</p> <p>The campaign paid a Texas-based web design and marketing firm, Giles-Parscale, $8.4m in July, about twice as much as it made over the last year. The firm\u2019s president, Brad Parscale, is digital director for Trump\u2019s campaign, and has worked for Trump\u2019s real estate business since 2011. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign also paid $20,000 to the consulting firm of Corey Lewandowski, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-out\">campaign manager he fired in June</a>, two weeks after Lewandowski left the campaign and became a paid pundit on CNN. The sum was roughly equal to how much Trump\u2019s campaign paid him as manager.</p> <p>The campaign also paid $356.01 to Meredith McIver, an employee of the Trump Organization who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-plagiarism-scandal-michelle-obama\">took the blame for plagiarizing Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 convention speech</a> for use in Melania Trump\u2019s 2016 speech. McIver is listed as a co-writer for several of Donald Trump\u2019s books, and because of her work as an \u201cin-house\u201d writer for Trump\u2019s private business, the campaign risked violating campaign laws if it had not separately paid her.</p> <p>Though the financial documents show little sign that Trump has opened offices around swing states, Trump did show some signs of scaling up for the general election. He paid $100,000 to Cambridge Analytics, a data analysis firm that formerly worked for Senator Ted Cruz and has ties to Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire who supports Trump. He also paid his Alabama state director, Chess Bedsole, $64,000, three times his last payment, in December, even though Alabama has voted Republican for decades.</p> <p>The campaign paid about $2m for private jets and $500,000 to pay for expenses on Trump\u2019s personal plane. Last month, Trump paid more than $773,000 to companies he owns; since the beginning of the race, his campaign has paid more than $7.5m to Trump companies or those owned by family members. In all, his campaign spent $18.5m in July, including $1.8m on hats and merchandise.</p> <p>Clinton, in contrast, reported 703 staffers, $2m on travel and signs of new offices. In July, her campaign spent a total of $38m, filings show, mostly on advertising. Last week, Trump spent $4.8m on his first general election ads, which aired in four swing states.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s personal finances remain mostly opaque, since the candidate has refused to release his tax returns \u2013 breaking 40 years of precedent by presidential nominees \u2013 and because his business is structured in a labyrinth of holdings, third parties and debt. A New York Times investigation into Trump\u2019s finances found <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/politics/donald-trump-debt.html\">he had at least $650m in debt</a>, far more than he disclosed on earlier FEC forms. Trump has said he will not release his returns while they are under an IRS audit, though no law prohibits that release.</p> <p>Clinton has released several years of tax returns, including from 2015, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-tax-returns\">she and her husband made nearly $11m</a>. But she has been haunted by the web of donors, including foreign governments, that give to the family\u2019s sprawling Clinton Foundation. The philanthropic organization has said it will no longer accept foreign donations if Clinton is elected president, but her campaign manager, Robby Mook, refused to say that it would stop taking those donations during the campaign.</p> <p>Political action committees allied with Democrats were boosted by several billionaires, filings also show. George Soros gave $1.5m to a Planned Parenthood Super Pac and $500,000 to the Senate Majority Pac, and Tom Steyer gave $7m to his own Super Pac, called NextGen Climate Action Committee. Michael Bloomberg gave $5m to his own group, called Independence USA, and though the former New York mayor has endorsed Clinton, his Pac is also working to help Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, because of his support for gun control measures.</p> <p>Conservative billionaires have largely shied from donating to Trump\u2019s campaign, and filings showed that Paul Singer and Charles and David Koch are concentrating on groups to support Senate and House candidates. Mercer, on the other hand, has given $2m to a pro-Trump Super Pac, and also funds Breitbart News, whose boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Stephen Bannon, took control of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign</a> last week.</p>",

Ipswich increasingly resemble an analogue operation in a fast-moving Championship that is in danger of moving in two distinct streams. Sixth and seventh-placed finishes in successive years have been more than reasonable on the face of it, but discord about the team\u2019s style accompanied a sharp decline in the second half of 2015\u201116 and the opprobrium grew louder after a limp 2-0 defeat at Brentford the previous Saturday.</p> <p>Ipswich were neither passive nor agricultural against their local rivals and McCarthy was certainly forthcoming after the game when asked if their performance would have eased fans\u2019 concerns.</p> <p>\u201cI get sick to death,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play one bad half [at Brentford] and we\u2019re all shit and can\u2019t play. \u2018The manager doesn\u2019t care, get somebody who cares,\u2019 I\u2019m \u2018a boring cunt\u2019 \u2013 somebody called me that last week. I wish they would say it to my face on my own because his pint of lager, he\u2019d have been wearing it.</p> <p>\u201cLet me tell you, if that\u2019s what they think about me and my team then they are sadly mistaken. I\u2019m not having that and it does hurt me. Up and down like a bloody fiddler\u2019s elbow \u2013 I\u2019m all right one week but I\u2019m not the next.\u201d</p> <p>It is as much a wider symptom of the times than an indictment of Ipswich\u2019s stasis but there was enough here to encourage the doubters. Ipswich tore into Norwich from the first whistle and should have been awarded a goal within two minutes when Jonathan Douglas stabbed a loose ball past Michael McGovern. Offside was given; replays suggested Douglas was level with the last defender and McCarthy was prepared to steer his frustration in a different direction upon reviewing the decision.</p> <p>\u201cIf that is the case then I\u2019ll be battering PGMOL\u2019s door down again on Monday morning with a tirade of: \u2018Hey, any chance of us getting a decision?\u2019\u201d he said of Professional Game Match Officials Limited. \u201cNo I won\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019ll be doing it tonight on their answering machine.\u201d</p> <p>Ipswich had been denied another legitimate-looking goal in their midweek draw at Wolves. Their luck appeared to be comprehensively out in the 26th minute when Norwich, hitherto pegged back, constructed a move that hinted at their residual Premier League quality. Ivo Pinto, beating Freddie Sears too easily on the right, cut the ball back for a quick exchange of passes between Jonny Howson, Wes Hoolahan and Cameron Jerome, the latter finishing crisply to Bartosz Bialkowski\u2019s right from 18 yards.</p> <p>The smart money at that point was on Norwich making their technical advantage count; they controlled possession for the rest of the first half and more of the same appeared likely until, with the interval looming, the Ipswich left-back Jonas Knudsen equalised with a fizzing low drive of his own. Knudsen\u2019s right foot is generally used for little more than the proverbial; this time, after Norwich had failed to defend a long throw correctly, he had enough trust in its ability to let fly from outside the area and restore parity.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy him for that,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to my left foot. He does all the shitty jobs, gets up and down, so it\u2019s nice for him to get some love for scoring against Norwich.\u201d</p> <p>The Ipswich substitute Teddy Bishop might have done the same towards the end of the tense second half, but Norwich had the clearer late chances. Their own replacement, Steven Whittaker, had one effort cleared off the line and struck a post with another; on balance nobody at Portman Road could complain and the visitors\u2019 manager, Alex Neil, was of similar mind.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we did enough to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe probably had the best chances, but I don\u2019t think we moved the ball quickly enough. It\u2019s a rubbish goal for us to concede, we had a chance to score a second and within 45 seconds it comes from a throw-in we haven\u2019t set up for. I\u2019m really frustrated with that.\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy would probably settle for Neil\u2019s frustrations. Norwich, he believes, will be among the leading pack for the remainder of the season and despite their frayed edges here it is hard to disagree. If this morsel of encouragement galvanises Ipswich into a run of form, meanwhile, he should be able to enjoy a more consistent reception from his public.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 If you were, to put it Jarvis Cocker\u2019s way, fully grown in the year 2000 then the following will make you feel decidedly old. When Ryan Sessegnon opened Fulham\u2019s account against Cardiff from close range he became, at 16 years and 94 days, the first player born in the 2000s to score in the Championship. It was a statistic Slavisa Jokanovic enjoyed; less palatable to the Fulham manager is the data analysis carried out by his colleague Craig Kline, who heads up the club\u2019s recruitment model, and he did not hold back from criticising his methods after the 2-2 draw. \u201cI\u2019ve lost many players in this process in nine months,\u201d Jokanovic said. \u201cIn the last two days I lost a few players who [Kline] believes are not good enough. I had an opinion from one of the best managers in the world on one of the players and he believes it is a good signing for us and I believe that too. Craig doesn\u2019t believe it is a good signing for us and this guy is not with us.\u201d Jokanovic may have been referring to James Wilson, who has joined Derby on loan from Manchester United. Regardless, battlelines appear to have been drawn. As analytics become increasingly focal to recruitment down the leagues, this kind of discord is likely to repeat itself; in the short term, you wonder just how long Jokanovic, whose spell at Watford suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/30/slavisa-jokanovic-fulham-manager\" title=\"\">he does not exactly pick his club owners</a>, is prepared to stand for the status quo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9293ff316588026060564cc7dc75a9719e2a249\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9293ff316588026060564cc7dc75a9719e2a249/12_182_3629_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fulham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon becomes the first player born after the turn of the millennium to score in the Championship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fulham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon becomes the first player born after the turn of the millennium to score in the Championship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Garcia/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 Nottingham Forest are setting themselves up as the division\u2019s great entertainers. If successive 4-3 home wins against newly promoted teams bode ill for their stability against more practised opposition there can be little doubt about the early value for money provided by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/08/montanier-nottingham-forest-championship-football-league\" title=\"\">Philippe Montanier\u2019s young side</a>. And especially the 19-year-old winger Oliver Burke, who finished clinically twice against Wigan and has the Premier League vultures circling. If Burke, with three goals to his name now this season, is smouldering then the Wigan striker Will Grigg is \u2013 yes \u2013 on fire. Four in four now for the Northern Ireland back-up striker after his pair at the City Ground; perhaps it is time someone thought up a song for him.</p> <p>\u2022 The early-season buoyancy at Huddersfield looked like being checked slightly by Yorkshire rivals Barnsley as their derby entered stoppage time. Then the substitute Jonathan Hogg adjusted himself to score emphatically from 15 yards, hand them a 2-1 win that puts then top of the Championship and heighten the sense that under David Wagner the Terriers are on to something. Hogg was the fourth substitute to score an important goal for Huddersfield in four games; although unpolished in some respects they are super-fit and playing insistently, with the kind of intensity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/09/huddersfield-david-wagner-borussia-dortmund\" title=\"\">you would expect J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s former right-hand man to demand</a>. Can they keep it up? \u201cIt\u2019s a picture of the quality and togetherness we have that everyone who starts and plays from the bench knows their job,\u201d Wagner said. It feels as if they are around to stay.</p> <p>\u2022 Four games, four wins for Bolton in League One and after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/09/bolton-wanderers-relegated-johnny-russell-derby\" title=\"\">such an execrable 2015-16 season</a> the shoots of recovery are evident. Phil Parkinson certainly seemed a canny appointment for a club reacquainting itself with lower-division life and although it took a late Josh Vela goal to beat Fleetwood 2-1 the adjustment has been smoother than expected. If they need a handy example of what can go wrong if a decline is not addressed swiftly, they only need look down the table: Sheffield United, four games into their sixth campaign at this level, now sit bottom of it after Steve Morison\u2019s 89th-minute penalty winner for Millwall.</p> <p>\u2022 Taking a loanee from Chelsea risks becoming law for Football League clubs, such is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/sep/09/chelsea-loan-players-change-rules-wild-west-football\" title=\"\">number of youngsters the Premier League club trains up and ships out</a>. They rarely make it all the way down to League Two but one, the 20-year-old winger Alex Kiwomya, has made an immediate impact with Crewe and scored his third goal of the season in the 1-1 draw at Newport. It was a marvellous 50-yard solo run and curled finish from Kiwomya, who will climb back up the divisions quickly on this evidence; there is hope that he will follow in the footsteps of his uncle, the former Ipswich and Arsenal striker Chris Kiwomya.</p>",

  "<p>The war on terror has inordinately affected Latino immigrants for the last 15 years, according to two sociologists who say Donald Trump has simply made explicit fears that long linked linked terrorism with anxieties about migrants and Muslims.<br></p> \n<p>In a research paper presented on Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Seattle, Lu\u00eds Romero and Amina Zarrugh, sociologists at the University of Texas at Austin, argued that since the attacks of September 11 2001, the US has increasingly merged terrorism and immigration in official policy and the daily work of its government agencies.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump is articulating, in its most explicit terms, a connection that\u2019s been insinuated and elaborated perhaps less colorfully and less explicitly, but that\u2019s been going on for quite some time,\u201d Zarrugh said. \u201cThe American public has been primed for these connections for at least a decade.\u201d</p> \n<p>She and Romero pored over 15 years\u2019 worth of speeches and government documents to chart the merger and its effect on Latinos. Months after the attack, congressmen started warning of \u201cporous borders\u201d, and years of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/17/trent-franks/isis-mexico-and-planning-cross-border/\">false</a> <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/11/21/exclusive-rep-john-culberson.html\">claims </a>and <a href=\"http://dev.factcheck.org/2006/08/democrats-ask-do-you-feel-safer/\">alarming ads</a> about terrorist activity at or near the border followed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey started framing almost any migrant at the US-Mexico border as a potential terrorist threat,\u201d Zarrugh said. \u201cIn the past, the border was a place to stop drug trafficking and undocumented migration, but there became a surveillance-driven, militarized perspective of migrants as potential terrorists.\u201d</p> \n<p>That rhetoric became policy, she said, and \u201cpolicy began to shape this \u2018us-versus-them\u2019 sentiment in new ways\u201d.</p> \n<p>Lawmakers used national security proposals as vehicles for immigration laws, Romero added. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic to use the term Trojan horse,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause a lot of the rhetoric used against immigrants is about Trojan horses, of terrorist threats using immigrants to enter the US.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both researchers were quick to note that Muslims and south-west Asian people were unfairly targeted by much of the rhetoric and measures, though their paper studied the way \u201cirrational fear of Muslims has mapped on to immigration\u201d, in Romero\u2019s words. \u201cIncreased surveillance and security were an easy sell.\u201d</p> \n<p>None of the 19 hijackers who carried out the attacks on September 11 entered the country illegally, though three had overstayed their visas or violated their rules of stay. But alongside calls for surveillance of migrants, the newly created Department of Homeland Security soon absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and 21 other agencies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e3c8407ae66c6c1ae9312dc8d61052e2cbdce31\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e3c8407ae66c6c1ae9312dc8d61052e2cbdce31/0_58_3868_2320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US border patrol agents at the town of Nogales, Arizona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US border patrol agents at the town of Nogales, Arizona.

She also pointed to ID laws as another example of how post-9/11 laws had affected Latinos: her advocacy group saw an increase in national origin cases for Hispanic migrants and citizens. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe saw an increase in employer scrutiny,\u201d she said, \u201cand again this conflation with, \u2018You look foreign, you sound foreign, you might be a threat, so let me take an extra security step.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/29/us-mexico-border-wall-trump-cruz-immigration-friendship-park\">A wall apart: divided families meet at a single, tiny spot on the US-Mexico border</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The proposal for a wall along the southern border, taken up by Trump, has perhaps become the most visible symbol of the merged issues.

  "<p>A woman who won a judgment against her local authority after she nearly drowned during a school swimming lesson 16 years ago has been awarded \u00a32m in compensation.</p> <p>Annie Woodland was a 10-year-old pupil at Whitmore junior school in Basildon, Essex, when she was pulled from the water and resuscitated at Gloucester Park pool in July 2000. </p> <p>She suffered severe brain damage as a result. She still has memory problems, fatigue, poor balance and says the hidden nature of her injury makes it hard for people to understand. </p> <p>Her parents began a legal battle and, in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/23/woman-almost-drowned-essex-ruling-annie-woodland\">the supreme court made a ruling</a> that Essex county council owed a \u201cnon-delegable duty of care\u201d, despite the swimming lessons being contracted out to a third party. At the trial that followed last year, the high court concluded that the lifeguards and swimming teachers responsible for supervising Woodland had breached their duty of care.</p> <p>A settlement of \u00a32m has just been agreed, with the local authority paying two-thirds and the lifeguard at the time making up the rest. </p> <p>Woodland, now 26, lives in the Blackpool area with her partner, Sam Hill, and their 13-month-old son, Joey. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have Joey I would probably be in quite a bad way still.

It\u2019s a lonely place to be.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother, Alison, 50, said Annie had been \u201ca happy, confident little girl\u201d. She said the legal action had not been driven by money but to stop it happening to anyone else: \u201cAt least I know now that whatever happens in the future she is going to be safe and secure.\u201d </p> <p>The family\u2019s lawyer, Jennifer Maloney, a serious injury specialist at the law firm Slater and Gordon, said: \u201cAnnie is a brave young woman who has been forced to spend most of her childhood and all of her adult life dealing with the devastating consequences of what happened. She deserves some peace of mind which I hope this settlement will bring.\u201d </p> <p>An Essex county council spokesman confirmed that the local authority had agreed the settlement.<br></p>",

  "<p>The assassination of Reinhard Heydrich is recognised as one of the most audacious operations of the second world war. But J\u00e1n Kubi\u0161 and Josef Gabc\u00edk, the two British-trained Czechoslovak paratroopers credited with killing one of Hitler\u2019s most fanatical henchmen and chief mastermind of the Holocaust, are believed to be buried in Prague in an unmarked grave.<br></p> <p>Now campaigners are calling on the Czech Republic to rescue their remains from obscurity and give them the burial they deserve. The pair are believed to lie in \u010e\u00e1blice cemetery in Prague in a common plot also used to bury executed Nazis and wartime collaborators. The spot is close to where thousands of political prisoners killed under Czechoslovakia\u2019s former communist regime are thought to be buried.</p> <p>Despite the distinction of assassinating a leading Nazi, Kubi\u0161 and Gabc\u00edk were for decades ignored in their homeland and have yet to receive a proper burial \u2013 a failing that campaigners blame on the country\u2019s present-day rulers\u2019 reluctance to face its totalitarian past. \u201cIn Britain and France, resistance fighters are treated with the utmost respect. Ours are in mass graves and people are turning away from them,\u201d said Neela Winkelmann, of the Prague-based European Platform of Memory and Conscience. \u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful what we have done to Gabc\u00edk and Kubi\u0161. They killed the only Nazi leader to be assassinated in the war, and he just happened to be one of the main architects of the Holocaust.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b8c95cf6595c397cc86114be35d3294120b1af2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b8c95cf6595c397cc86114be35d3294120b1af2/0_0_3596_4173/862.jpg\" alt=\"Reinhard Heydrich.\" width=\"862\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reinhard Heydrich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler\u2019s feared deputy in the SS hierarchy, was acting head of the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia when he suffered serious wounds from a grenade tossed by Kubi\u0161 into his open-topped Mercedes as he was driven to work in occupied Prague on 27 May, 1942. The grenade is believed to have been thrown after Gabc\u00edk\u2019s British-made Sten gun jammed. Heydrich died eight days later.</p> <p>His assassination had been ordered by Czechoslovakia\u2019s London-based government-in-exile in response to the Nazis\u2019 brutal suppression of the country\u2019s internal resistance movement. It unleashed a wave of bloody reprisals in which an estimated 15,000 Czechs were killed, including virtually all the inhabitants of the villages of Lidice and Lekazy, razed to the ground on Hitler\u2019s orders.</p> <p>The assassins hid in Prague\u2019s St Cyril and Methodius Orthodox cathedral before being traced. They committed suicide with five other resistance fighters rather than surrender. The events are recounted in a new film, Anthropoid \u2013 to be released in Britain on 9 September with Jamie Dornan as Kubi\u0161 and Cillian Murphy as Gabc\u00edk. The production follows the 2009 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/16/hhhh-laurent-binet-review\">publication of <em>HHhH</em></a>, a novel based on the assassination by the French author Laurent Binet.</p> <p>Yet the assassins\u2019 renown is at odds with the anonymity of their reputed resting place, next to bushes close to the outer edge of the \u010e\u00e1blice cemetery. Historians believe their bodies were dumped there along with their co-conspirators by the Nazi occupiers. The heads are said to have been removed and put in pickle jars in preparation for use as Nazi museum exhibits. But they disappeared at the end of the war.</p> <p>A nearby plaque pays tribute to \u201cthose who gave their lives\u201d by assassinating Heydrich but omits mention of Gabc\u00edk or Kubi\u0161. Under communism, the paratroopers\u2019 exploits were ignored because, according to campaigners, the authorities did not want to credit them as they had been based and trained in Britain. \u201cThere was no general awareness during Communist times that the bodies of Gabc\u00edk and Kubi\u0161 were here because they came from the wrong side,\u201d said Jiri Linek, of the organisation of former political prisoners, which maintains the graves holding the remains of those who perished during the Communist era.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had come from Russia they would have made big heroes of them. But they came from Britain and many of the political prisoners after the Communists took control in 1948 had been former army men with the resistance based in England.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners have written to the Czech Republic\u2019s Social Democratic prime minister, Bohuslav Sobotka, calling for the bodies to be exhumed and given a proper burial. They also want the cemetery \u2013 estimated to hold between 2,400 and 14,000 bodies in mass graves \u2013 declared a national memorial to victims of Nazism and communism.</p> <p>While the government responded by establishing parliamentary round table talks, the proposals are bogged down amid objections over costs.</p>",
  "<p>Brian Rix, Lord Rix, who has died aged 92, devoted his life almost equally to stage farce \u2013 as one of the most brilliant comic actors in the postwar years \u2013 and to campaigning for people with learning disabilities. He was successful at both. In the theatre, both in management and on stage, his name became synonymous with the \u201cWhitehall farces\u201d, named after the London venue and with plotlines usually involving a lie, a comic deception and someone being caught with his trousers around his ankles. Rix also ran repertory companies and presented more than 90 farces on television in the 1960s \u2013 to huge audiences \u2013 starring the big names of the day, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/23/dora-bryan\">Dora Bryan</a>, Sid James, Sheila Hancock and John Le Mesurier.</p> <p>Then, as the father of a child with Down\u2019s syndrome, he changed the direction of his life and became a campaigner and fundraiser for people with learning disability, in particular for the charity <a href=\"https://www.mencap.org.uk/\">Mencap</a>. He was its secretary general for seven years from 1980, and by the time he left the role, Mencap \u2013 and learning disability in general \u2013 had a much higher profile in the UK. He served as Mencap\u2019s chairman, 1988-98, then its president until his death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/26/letters-lord-rix-obituary\">Letters: Lord Rix obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born in Cottingham, east Yorkshire, Rix was the son of Herbert, a Hull shipowner keen on cricket, and his wife, Fanny, who loved amateur theatre. He maintained that being the youngest of four children meant he always had to fight for attention. His sister, Sheila, later Sheila Mercier, became an actor before him and is well known for her part as Annie Sugden in Emmerdale Farm.</p> <p>When Brian was four, the family moved to Hornsea, on the coast. Rix was sent as a boarder to Bootham school, in York, but hated it, admitting later to being a \u201cprecocious brat\u201d. He had an instinctive flair for self-projection that did not help with his academic studies. His father wanted him to go to Oxford to distinguish himself as a cricketer, but the second world war broke out and Rix became a pilot, navigator and bomb-aimer with the RAF. Then, faced with a 10-month wait before he was called up for duty, he wangled himself a tour with Donald Wolfit in King Lear and worked for Ensa (the Entertainments National Service Association). Further deferred, he took to rep in Harrogate.</p> <p>By the time he was demobbed in 1947, remembering Wolfit as an actor-manager he decided that this was the role for him. His father and two uncles shelled out \u00a3900, and Rix put in \u00a3100 of his own, to hire the King\u2019s Hall, Ilkley. Appearing in his first production there, the American farce Nothing But the Truth, he found the door through which he was supposed to enter the stage blocked and had to come in through the window of what was supposed to be a New York 28th-floor apartment. The \u00a31,000 investment produced a \u00a33,000 loss, but luckily a season of Babes in the Wood at Bridlington kept him afloat.</p> <p>It was at Bridlington that he laid the foundation of his future success as a shrewd picker of farces. He alone saw the commercial potential of the forces play Reluctant Heroes, which had been turned down by all the leading managements. By the time it reached London at the Whitehall theatre in September 1950, taking over from the long-running Worm\u2019s Eye View, Rix had made himself a force to be reckoned with in theatre management. He was to be associated with the Whitehall theatre for 25 years.</p> <p>In 1952 Reluctant Heroes became one of the first West End plays to be partly televised. As a result, there were huge queues outside the Whitehall. Rix negotiated a contract with the BBC that lasted 17 years. The TV work included a number of Sunday Night Theatre productions under the Brian Rix Presents banner in the late 50s and early 60s.</p> <p>Management was the art that mattered to him. For years he put on and appeared in the most noted farces of the West End, including Dry Rot by John Chapman, who had understudied him in Reluctant Heroes. Rix also appeared in the film of Dry Rot (1956), one of 11 film credits.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTqdS-b1zW8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mTqdS-b1zW8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The 1956 film Dry Rot, starring Brian Rix, Peggy Mount and Sid James</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For three years, 1977-80, he became controller to the ragbag of theatres run by the new masters of farces and musicals, the cinema owner Laurie Marsh and the playwright Ray Cooney. He vowed never to work as a subordinate again.</p> <p>Around this time, an activity that had been secondary to his stage work started to take over. In 1949 he had married the actor Elspet Gray; the first of their four children, Shelley, was born with Down\u2019s syndrome. Rix had already done some work with the Stars Organisation for Spastics (now the Stars Foundation for Cerebral Palsy) and in the late 70s, after 30 years of almost non-stop farce production and acting, he felt \u201cthe audience was going to get bored because I was getting bored,\u201d he said in an interview with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/22/brian-rix-actor-learning-disabilities-mencap\">Guardian</a> in 2014. He threw himself instead into fundraising for learning disability charities, and in 1978 he began the Let\u2019s Go! TV programmes for people with learning disabilities \u2013 he made 40 of them.</p> <p>In 1979 a job advert in the Guardian caught Rix\u2019s eye, for the position of Mencap\u2019s secretary general. He applied and was initially turned down, but was later accepted and started work in 1980. Those who thought Rix might be a humorous figurehead misjudged his passion and his management skills. His first act was to get the heads of the many departments together for one of the usual conferences \u2013 to tell them that such unwieldy meetings would be redundant in future, as he proposed to create four group heads. He visited regions, local societies, schools and adult training centres.</p> <p>He was not in the slightest bit afraid of controversy. In 1987 he clashed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/15/guardianobituaries.conservatives\">Lord Hailsham</a>, the lord chancellor, over the involuntary sterilisation of a 17-year-old girl with learning disabilities; even years later, Rix could not bring himself to say anything good about the man. Ministers who were late in living up to promises received blunt, if polite, letters or deputations.</p> <p>Once he moved on from the secretary general role to became chairman of Mencap, he was able to resume his theatrical career with a revival of Dry Rot at the Lyric theatre in 1989. But he tore a muscle on the opening night and received mixed notices. From 1986, Rix served as chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain Drama Panel, resigning in 1993 over cuts being made to drama.</p> <p>He was appointed CBE in 1977, was knighted in 1986 and in 1992 was made a life peer.

Never did he forget how he and Elspet had to fight pressure from the establishment \u2013 and family \u2013 to place their young daughter Shelley in a spartan institution and walk away.</p> <p>Some present-day disability-rights activists have mistakenly seen Rix as an apologist for residential care. It is true that he was concerned at the isolation of some disabled people living in the community, following the rundown of the long-stay hospitals, but it was under his chairmanship that Mencap laid plans for <a href=\"http://www.glh.org.uk/\">Golden Lane Housing</a>, which today provides homes for more than 1,700 people with support needs. He believed that learning disabled people should live in family-sized groups, rather than alone.</p> <p>As its secretary general for seven years, he modernised Mencap and raised its turnover sixfold. As chairman for 10 years thereafter, his proudest achievement was to drive through the constitutional changes that created a national assembly, made up of people with learning disabilities, their families and carers, and that gave majority control of the charity to elected trustees, of whom at least one must be a person with a learning disability.</p> <p>In the Lords, as a crossbencher, Rix spoke and lobbied on learning disability and autism at every opportunity. He was shocked by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/01/panorama-care-home-abuse-investigation-government-review\">Winterbourne View scandal</a> in 2011 and deplored the \u201cmonstrous\u201d treatment of 1,300 people subsequently found living in similar \u201cassessment and treatment\u201d units in a reinvention of long-stay care.</p> <p>\u2022 Brian Norman Roger Rix, Lord Rix, actor-manager and learning disability campaigner, born 27 January 1924; died 20 August 2016</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/03/dennis-barker\">Dennis Barker</a> died in 2015</p>",
  "<p>When Fox News chairman Roger Ailes was deposed in a lurid sex scandal as the most powerful man in news last month, many expressed surprise and others disbelief. Not Gabriel Sherman, New York Magazine\u2019s national affairs editor, and a man who has most doggedly chronicled the TV executive\u2019s reign.</p> <p>In his 2014 book <a href=\"http://www.theloudestvoiceintheroom.com/\">The Loudest Voice in the Room</a>, Sherman reported that Ailes had offered television producer Randi Harrison an extra $100 a week in the 1980s if she agreed to have sex with him whenever he wanted. The allegation elicited furious denials but after Fox anchor<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/28/gretchen-carlson-fox-news-roger-ailes\"> Gretchen Carlson</a> came forward with similar claims and other women followed suit, and Sherman continued to break scoop after scoop, Ailes fate was sealed.</p> <p>Now Ailes, \u00e9minence grise to a string of Republican presidents and the taste maker for rightwing media, has been ousted by his mentor Rupert Murdoch and Fox lawyers are investigating allegations of decades-long sexual harassment. Ailes continues to vehemently deny all the allegations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e363c76dda915d0aecbc5971c605469b1349ff56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e363c76dda915d0aecbc5971c605469b1349ff56/0_0_1920_2398/801.jpg\" alt=\"Gabriel Sherman\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gabriel Sherman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Kim/New York Magazine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of the things that makes it such a challenging story is the power of [Fox\u2019s] media relations department to control the message,\u201d Sherman says by way of understatement.

Ailes told colleagues while Sherman was writing the book: \u201cI know where he lives, and I\u2019m gonna send people to beat the shit out of him,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/media/tipsheets/morning-media/2016/08/another-ailes-spectacularsecond-amendment-sagaerstwhile-ap-power-duo-reunites-001084\">according to Politico</a>.</p> <p>In conversation, Sherman is laudably detached, even clinical about the vigor with which Ailes tried to shake him off, the same tone he strikes in the unusual note appended to the end of his book about the 614 sources he interviewed.</p> <p>\u201c[H]e had amassed power by harnessing television to control the images of politicians and media personalities,\u201d Sherman writes of Ailes. \u201cAnd so it made sense that he would seek the same degree of influence over the story he cared about most: his own.\u201d</p> <p>Sherman says that the campaign against him gave him one of his few reporting advantages over the course of composing Loudest Voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t take it personally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant to have your reputation maligned on various websites \u2013 and reading about threats he made against me, that wasn\u2019t fun. But as a journalist I just used it as a wealth of material, because he was showing me who he was just by the extreme lengths he went to just to suppress my book.\u201d</p> <p>With his reputation and his legacy in tatters, it looks certain that Ailes will spend years fighting allegations of harassment of the many women at the network, even if Carlson, who has begun legal action personally, settles. But Sherman says the Murdoch family may pay far greater sums in lost revenue than the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/fmr-fox-booker-harassed-by-ailes-for-20-years.html\">millions</a> Ailes is alleged to have spent to silence his accusers.</p> <p> \u201cA lot of people have drawn parallels to the UK phone hacking scandal but I think in terms of the potential impact on 21st Century Fox, this could be far greater,\u201d Sherman says of Ailes\u2019s demise. Fox News is a wildly profitable fiefdom within the Murdoch empire, with revenue of about $2.3bn last year and much lower expenses than either of its less lucrative competitors, CNN and MSNBC. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/28/gretchen-carlson-fox-news-roger-ailes\">Gretchen Carlson angry it took so long for Fox News to fire Roger Ailes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe News of the World [Murdoch\u2019s most profitable UK tabloid before he closed it following the hacking scandal] was not a major profit engine,\u201d says Sherman, who has covered the media since his early days at the Observer.</p> <p>\u201cBy the time the scandal hit, newspapers had fallen on hard times,\u201d Sherman observes. \u201cThe News of the World used to be the Fox News of the Murdoch empire years ago, but it was a dwindling asset \u2013 Fox News is still in its prime. So to have a scandal that rocks it to the core poses a great risk to the corporate parent.\u201d </p> <p>The scandal is so damaging because supporters and detractors of the network all agree on one thing: Fox News <em>i</em><em>s</em> Roger Ailes. Or was.</p> <p>The man at the centre of that maelstrom is as mercurial and interesting as any in the media world, Sherman says. Ailes is \u201ca world-historical figure\u201d whose harsh perspective came to define American conservatism in his 20 years running the most-viewed cable news network in America. \u201cI think he\u2019s kind of a historical icon, very much on the level of a J Edgar Hoover; someone who will define their age,\u201d Sherman says. \u201cHe transcends the medium of television.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, Sherman believes Ailes accomplished that transcendence by using Fox News not as a means to advance a particular established brand of conservatism, but as his personal megaphone. \u201cHe has sort of contradictory positions that are not necessarily completely in sync with the [rightwing thinktanks] Cato Institute or the Heritage Foundation; classically conservative institutions in America. He\u2019s very populist, he\u2019s nationalist, he\u2019s not for open borders. I reported in my book that one of his immigration plans was to dispatch Navy Seals to the Mexico border with orders to shoot to kill anyone crossing. That\u2019s not a very nuanced immigration position. At least Donald Trump only wants to build a wall; Roger Ailes wants to kill people.\u201d</p> <p>That minor point of difference aside, in many ways Trump himself is the avatar of Ailes\u2019s philosophy, and now Ailes is his advisor. Trump swept the US Republican primaries not by virtue of his political acumen or even basic competence, but on a wave of populist rage beloved of Fox News viewers but anathema to moneyed conservatives. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump has really repelled a lot of mainstream and conservative Republicans,\u201d Sherman observes. \u201cSo that\u2019s really one of Roger Ailes\u2019s legacies: reshaping the Republican party as a populist, blue-collar, white nativist party. The Washington elites and the conservative intellectuals, because of Ailes\u2019s power, had to kind of hold their noses and graft themselves onto it. Without question, I don\u2019t think Roger Ailes is a conservative in the mould of a Bill Buckley. He\u2019s unique to Roger Ailes.\u201d</p> <p>Sherman has the New York media world at home as well as at work. His wife Jennifer Stahl has worked at ProPublica and the New Yorker, and his father, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, has written the occasional op-ed. His career is a stark contrast to Ailes\u2019s own: the Fox News executive worked nearly every job in television during his ascendancy; Sherman has stretched his professional legs occasionally, but he\u2019s written about media since 2003.</p> <p>The writer has interviewed 20 women alleging sexual harassment by Ailes; he says their stories are disturbingly similar. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I found these stories so credible,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are women who live all over the country and the time period spans from the 1960s to the mid-2000s and what\u2019s remarkable over that 40- to 50-year period is that the pattern is exactly the same.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/22/roger-ailes-fox-news-sexual-assault-allegations\">How one lawsuit unleashed a cascade of allegations against Roger Ailes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was surprised, however, by how cavalier Ailes appeared to be during those encounters. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable to me is that for a man as paranoid as he is, that Roger Ailes would be so reckless in his personal behaviour,\u201d Sherman says. \u201cBecause while I knew that he had sexually harassed women in the past, I just couldn\u2019t imagine that so many women had experienced it and he\u2019d be able to keep it a secret for so long.\u201d</p> <p>Now Ailes has lost his perch in television \u2013 Sherman says he understands that the former executive\u2019s non-compete clause bars him from re-entering the media world until he\u2019s 80 years old. The consequences of his absence from TV will be major, Sherman predicts.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see conservative media splintered across the ideological spectrum,\u201d Sherman says, and already sees attention shifting to outlets such as Breitbart, the Conservative site that is also avowedly pro-Trump. \u201cThat\u2019ll be really interesting because Fox was this amazing unifier of all the strands of conservatism together. Ailes used his ruthlessness to kind of keep everyone in line. Now that he\u2019s out of the picture, one of my Fox sources joked that inside Fox News it\u2019s kind of a Lord of the Flies situation where everyone\u2019s trying to kill each other.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe could see that transposed to the conservative media landscape as a whole.\u201d</p>",

The difference is that while women wearing niqabs are in theory liable to a \u20ac150 fine, men obliging them to do so face fines of \u20ac30,000 and a year in jail; with burkinis, liability rests with the woman.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/nice-becomes-latest-french-city-to-impose-burkini-ban\">Nice becomes latest French city to impose burkini ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Valls came to Marseille last week to say that burkinis were \u201cexpressions of an archaic vision of women in public places \u2026 The burkini is not a new swimwear fashion; it\u2019s the transmission of a political project, against society, founded notably upon the subjection of women.

The Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) challenged the ban in court, and won. When Wisson reinstated the ban, the CCIF successfully challenged it a second time.</p> <p>Then came the Islamist onslaught against France, beginning with the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January 2015, up to the slitting of a priest\u2019s throat in Normandy two days after the Nice atrocity. Most French people wonder how much more they can take \u2013 but brace themselves for more \u2013 while others argue that draconian measures in response encourage racism, isolate the Muslim community and radicalise it.</p> <p>The ironies are replete: it was on the same now breast-baring beach at Cannes that Brigitte Bardot famously appeared in a bikini during the 1953 film festival \u2013 when the garment was banned (for showing too much skin) in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and towns along the French Atlantic coast.</p> <p>Also on this beach, Amedy Coulibaly, the Isis-inspired killer of four people in a kosher supermarket last year, was pictured with his girlfriend, who wore an eye-catching two-piece swimsuit. Just along the coast, the Saudi King Salman has his palace and private beach access \u2013 there was little information to be had from there last week on the royal household\u2019s balance of bikinis to burkinis, if any.</p> <p>A \u201cburkini-only\u201d event was banned this year at a pool in the Bavarian town of Neutraubling. The issue was reignited in France after a swimming club called Sweet 13 advertised a women-and-children-only day at Speed Water aquapark near Marseille. Publicity for the event said that \u201cburkini/jiheb de bain\u201d should be worn. The Facebook page of Sweet 13 has now been taken down, but a screenshot shown to the <em>Observer</em> indicates interests beyond swimming \u2013 with inflammatory language about \u201cinfidels\u201d and \u201cunbelievers\u201d.</p> <p>The outcry was led by a Republican senator from Marseille, Valerie Boyet, who said it \u201craised issues of provocation and the rights of women\u201d, and the event was banned. Boyet has since claimed burkinis are \u201cpart of an encroachment by Islamist extremism in this area, along with frequent wearing of niqabs on our streets, against the law\u201d.</p> <p>After the ban at Cannes, which also cited \u201chygiene\u201d, the CCIF was joined by the League for Human Rights in a legal challenge through the administrative court in, of all places, Nice. This time \u2013 a measure of how things have shifted in France \u2013 the bans were upheld.

  "<p>In a crowded field, a new troll has established himself as the undisputed master of the art. To most people he\u2019s repugnant, but to his peers he\u2019s a formidable exemplar of a set of skills that have come to flourish in the era of online bile, useful only to those whose primary aim is destructive and reductive. He knows exactly the kind of incendiary comment that will bait his prey. And when the inevitable reaction comes, he basks in the reflected glory of his acolytes piling on, and turning a conversation into a battlefield. In so doing, he kills off any hope of a reasoned discussion, ensuring that name-calling, provocation and blatant hate take its place. This might not be good for the standards of public discourse, but it\u2019s good for his ego \u2013 and it distracts from his ignorance.</p> <p>Expert though he is, the new king differs from his predecessors in important ways. Usually trolls operate below the line; this one stands at a podium. Usually their ambitions are petty, but this one wants to be president of the United States. Usually trolls are anonymous, but everyone knows this one\u2019s name.

Trolling can often manifest as relatively innocuous sarcasm and pranks, but it frequently veers into outright harassment and illegal personal threats. Powazek says that ultimately trolling is a game whose reward is laughter. And Donald Trump is<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX9reO3QnUA\"> laughing</a>. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfect,\u201d says Powazek. \u201cHe is the king of taking troll behavior, born of Twitter, into the formerly genteel world of politics.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By playing the troll, Trump has masterfully dominated the news cycle and placed himself within reach of the Oval Office</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to Chuck Dueck, a senior vice-president at <a href=\"http://icuc.social/\">icuc.social</a>, a company that manages the online presence for hundreds of companies and organizations, trolls fall into four different categories: those who deliberately practice harassment, those who enjoy being outrageous and causing havoc, those who love to argue, and those too stupid to know they are trolls. Dueck believes Trump is most like the second and third. \u201cHe has a long career of making outrageous statements designed to get attention,\u201d Dueck says. \u201cHe now has the biggest stage to do it from.

Like all skilled trolls, Trump has proven masterful at inspiring his followers to do the bulk of his dirty work. According to West, the best trolls enter a conversation, make a comment or two, set off a fight, and step back as other trolls emerge to sling punches. Trolls aren\u2019t warriors, they\u2019re instigators.

Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz fell for this, reacting to Trump\u2019s name calling with sneers that only emboldened Trump. \u201cI worry about Elizabeth Warren,\u201d says Powazek, referring to the Democratic Massachusetts senator that Trump has insultingly called \u201cPochahontas\u201d, and who consistently fights with him<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/754327065810210816?ref_src=twsrc%25255Etfw\"> on Twitter</a>. \u201cShe\u2019s out there fighting fire with fire, but tactically it\u2019s a mistake, because it allows him to set the tone of the debate, and the debate is in the mud.

Bill Eddy says this is the most effective way for dealing with high-conflict personalities. \u201cRespond with information as assertively as the other side is responding aggressively.

Like crime, terrorism or pandemic diseases, once introduced into a community, trolls will always return. \u201cPolitics doesn\u2019t have the antibodies we\u2019ve developed online to deal with trolls,\u201d says Powazek.

More frequently however, her efforts were widely ridiculed. Besides voicing a character in 2006\u2019s family cartoon Arthur and the Invisibles and appearing opposite Lady Gaga on a Saturday Night Live skit, Madonna has laid her acting career to rest after enduring a weapons-grade trashing for her turn as a snooty socialite in then husband Guy Ritchie\u2019s 2002 romance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/oct/12/arts.filmnews\">Swept Away</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s therefore little wonder that Swept Away isn\u2019t included in <a href=\"http://metrograph.com/series/series/32/body-of-work-a-madonna-retrospective\">Body of Work: A Madonna Retrospective</a>, a season of films at New York\u2019s <a href=\"http://metrograph.com/\">Metrograph</a> purporting to showcase Madonna\u2019s \u201ccalculated, cohesive canon\u201d.

Released when she was in peak Like a Virgin mode, Madonna plays Susan, a free-spirited live wire whose identity gets usurped by a bored housewife (Rosanna Arquette). It capitalized on her edgy public persona; the role essentially required Madonna to be the same brassy pop starlet the world knew her as anyway. Susan\u2019s ragtag-chic wardrobe meant that she barely even had to get changed.</p> <p>Yes, she plays herself (in the non hip-hop sense) \u2013 but maybe that\u2019s not as easy as she makes it look.

And hats and everything else off to the opening scene, in which she rides her supposed victim like a bull \u2013 stark naked.</p> <p>In fact, Madonna is at her best in Body of Evidence when she\u2019s relying upon her body language to do the job rather than the atrocious dialogue. She also gets slapped across the face by Julianne Moore in a bathroom \u2013 so there\u2019s that.</p> <p>She\u2019s equally as unhinged \u2013 though clothed \u2013 in <a href=\"http://www.madonnarama.com/posts-en/2011/08/14/abel-ferrara-and-ken-kelsch-discuss-dangerous-game-and-madonna/\">Dangerous Game</a>, which came out the same year as Body of Evidence, though with considerably less fanfare.

Ferrara\u2019s untamed approach suits Madonna, who is emotionally raw in ways she only hinted at in her climactic Dick Tracy scene, where Breathless Mahoney desperately pleads for Dick Tracy\u2019s affection. Right through Dangerous Game, Madonna\u2019s on edge, reacting viscerally to the abuse hurled her way.

It\u2019s a shame, because the film proves that although Madonna is frequently heralded as the mother of reinvention, it\u2019s her ability to dig deep and connect emotionally with her audience which has made her records, if not her films, endure.</p> <p>Curiously, the Metrograph has opted not to showcase <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/madonna-possessed-by-evita\">Evita</a> (1996), in which Madonna proved her many detractors wrong with a full-blooded star turn as Eva Per\u00f3n.

  "<p>I\u2019ve thought hard about my role in the Labour leadership election. I considered staying neutral because, as mayor, I need to work with everyone to get the best deal for London. But I\u2019ve been asked how I\u2019ll vote by many of the Labour members and supporters who helped me throughout my campaign, and they deserve an answer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/20/ditch-jeremy-corbyn-before-too-late-sadiq-khan-tells-labour\">Ditch Jeremy Corbyn before it\u2019s too late, Sadiq Khan tells Labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I played no part in the Labour turmoil earlier this summer. I\u2019ve had the honour of being elected as a Labour councillor, MP and mayor, thanks to the hard work of Labour members, and I believe that the will of our membership should be respected. I value loyalty, and believe that internal disagreements shouldn\u2019t be voiced in the media \u2013 because divided parties lose elections. But there is now an open and democratic contest for the leadership, and Labour members deserve to know how I intend to vote.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn is a principled Labour man. I\u2019ve been disturbed by the nasty abuse that has been hurled in all directions over the last 12 months. There should be no place for this in our party. I nominated Jeremy for leader last year \u2013 but did not vote for him \u2013 and I do not regret nominating him because party members deserved that choice. His campaign last summer was a breath of fresh air and offered hope to many.</p> <p>I have little time for those who say that Jeremy is only leader because of \u201centryism\u201d. It is undoubtedly a good thing that our party membership is growing. Vibrant political parties are vital to the health of our democracy. Our new members, like all of us, are desperate for a Labour government to make Britain fairer.</p> <p>And that is why I have decided to vote for Owen Smith \u2013 because Labour party members, and the British people, need Labour to win the next general election.</p> <p>By every available measure, if Jeremy remains as leader, Labour is extremely unlikely to win the next general election. The hopes of the members who have joined our party would be dashed again. Jeremy has already proved that he is unable to organise an effective team, and has failed to win the trust and respect of the British people. We need to be honest and recognise that means it will be more likely that the NHS will come under even greater attack from the Tories. More likely that we will see even deeper Tory cuts. More likely that our industrial heartlands will continue to decline, and that zero-hours contracts and job insecurity will become the norm. Because the Tories will stay in power, and Labour will stay in opposition.</p> <p>Jeremy\u2019s personal ratings are the worst of any opposition leader on record \u2013 and the Labour party is suffering badly as a result. He has lost the confidence of more than 80% of Labour\u2019s MPs in parliament \u2013 and I am afraid we simply cannot afford to go on like this.</p> <p>This failure was most starkly demonstrated in a heartbreaking way throughout the EU referendum. Like most Labour activists, I campaigned hard for Britain to stay in the EU. Campaigners told me that Jeremy was failing to persuade Labour supporters outside London, so I went to campaign in Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. I was devastated by the result, and have spent every minute of the last two months trying to salvage the best possible outcome for London and our country \u2013 and reassuring EU citizens already living in Britain that they will remain welcome.</p> <p>Throughout the campaign and aftermath, Jeremy failed to show the leadership we desperately needed. His position on EU membership was never clear \u2013 and voters didn\u2019t believe him. A third of Labour voters said they didn\u2019t know where the party stood on the referendum just a week before polling day. And you can\u2019t just blame a \u201chostile media\u201d and let Jeremy and his team off the hook. I know from my own election \u2013 up against a nasty and divisive Tory campaign \u2013 that, if we are strong and clear enough in our convictions, the message will get through to the public. That\u2019s a test that Jeremy totally failed in the EU referendum. Why would things be different in a general election?</p> <p>To make matters worse, the next day I was astonished to see Jeremy on television calling for the government to immediately invoke article 50 and take Britain out of the EU. This would be devastating. It would cause economic chaos, a huge increase in unemployment, and would really hurt the most vulnerable people \u2013 as well as cause EU citizens in Britain terrible uncertainty over their future.</p> <p>I served with Owen Smith in the shadow cabinet and he has the strongest Labour values. We were both politicised in the 1980s. Throughout that decade an ineffective and split Labour party allowed a Tory government to do untold damage to our country. On the big issues Owen and I have been on the same side of the argument, including opposing the Iraq war. Owen led and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 won our fight against the Tories\u2019 unfair cuts to tax credits and disability allowances, which would have hurt the most disadvantaged people in our society. And poll after poll shows that Owen is far more popular with the public than Jeremy \u2013 and far more likely to win the next election.</p> <p>Simply opposing Tory policies will never be enough to help the people we exist to support. At best, you knock just the very sharpest edges off the Tory project. Winning elections is how you really make a difference. Only then are you in control \u2013 able to shape the agenda and implement Labour policies to create a fairer and more equal society. If we give up on winning, we give up on the very people who need us the most.</p> <p>On 24 September, no matter who wins the leadership contest, the Labour party must ultimately unite again, oppose this new Tory government and provide a vision to the British public of how a Labour government would improve their lives. Talk of a split or a new party is deeply irresponsible and would make it easier for the Tories to win again.</p> <p>We can\u2019t afford to spend another moment fighting each other. We need to put all our efforts into fighting for a Labour government at the next election, and I believe that Owen Smith is the best person to lead that fight.</p>",

  "<h2>Heston Blumenthal: leg of lamb, L\u2019Oustau de Baumani\u00e8re, Provence</h2> <p><strong><em>Chef owner, the Fat Duck, Bray, Berkshire</em></strong></p> <p>Memories are important to Heston Blumenthal. They are the raw material of his wildly imaginative creations at the Fat Duck, and the experience of eating there is designed to stir up powerful feelings of nostalgia, right down to the name of each dish. Current examples include, \u201c<a href=\"https://genuiness.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/the-fat-duck-bray-magical-heston/can-i-have-some-money-for-the-ice-cream-van/\">Can I have some money for the ice cream van?</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://genuiness.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/the-fat-duck-bray-magical-heston/then-we-went-rockpooling-4/\">Then we went rockpooling</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The pivotal memory for Blumenthal himself, the one that made him want to become a chef, is of a meal in Provence in 1982, at the two-Michelin-starred restaurant L\u2019Oustau de Baumani\u00e8re. His family usually holidayed in Cornwall, where Blumenthal remembers eating crayfish off Formica tables by the seaside. But that summer his dad, who ran an office equipment company, decided to mark a good year at work by taking the family to France.</p> <p>Blumenthal was 16 at the time but not yet a food lover. His mother was a good cook and he can remember getting excited about fish and chips at Micky\u2019s in Paddington and drinking jasmine tea at Lee Ho Fook in Chinatown, but he had \u201cnever eaten a lobster and certainly never been to a Michelin-starred restaurant\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/23/the-fat-duck-flies-again-heston-blumenthal\">Heston Blumenthal interview: the Fat Duck flies again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His recollection of that dinner in Provence is remarkably clear, as if it happened yesterday. \u201cThey park your car for you,\u201d he begins, \u201cand you walk up some steps and there\u2019s a farmhouse at the foot of bauxite cliffs. You know that warmth as the sun is setting, and you can hear the crickets starting and you get the smell of lavender? At the time I can\u2019t remember if I recognised it as lavender or not, but the smell was overwhelming. We sat out on the terrace. It was dark but all lit up \u2013 like an enchanted wood. I remember the chink of glasses and I have a very strong memory of the soft crunch of the waiting staff\u2019s feet on the gravel.\u201d</p> <p>Leg of lamb is the dish that is most imprinted on his memory. \u201cIt was wrapped in puff pastry and carved at the table. It came with some dauphinoise and green beans. We had a mullet dish with basil and tomato. Dessert was a cr\u00eape Baumani\u00e8re, baked with a souffl\u00e9 filling.\u201d</p> <p>The extraordinary food was just one element in a dizzying rush of sensory information. \u201cEverything seemed massive \u2013 because I was small, but also because certain details are magnified in your memory. The wine list seemed as big as a billboard, the cheese trolley was the size of a chariot.\u201d He sums up the experience in terms that anyone who\u2019s eaten at the Fat Duck or watched one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/20/sundays-best-tv-hestons-dinners-in-space-tribes-predators-me-the-night-manager\">Blumenthal\u2019s TV shows</a> will recognise: \u201cIt was as if I\u2019d fallen down this rabbit hole into a wonderland.\u201d</p> <p>The impact was immediate. \u201cBack home, I became absolutely obsessed with the great chefs of France and I would hoover up their cookbooks \u2013 I remember translating the Troisgros brothers\u2019 <em>Nouvelle Cuisine </em>into English word for word with a French-English dictionary.\u201d He cooked obsessively at home and when he started working odd jobs \u2013 photocopier salesman, debt collector \u2013 he would save up for six months and then blow all his money on eating out.</p> <p>When I ask how things might have panned out had he not eaten at L\u2019Oustau de Baumani\u00e8re, Blumenthal acknowledges that his life could have gone in a completely different direction. But he insists that even with that meal in Provence under his belt, the path towards the Fat Duck was a meandering one. He needed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2014/nov/03/chemistry-food-and-drink\">discover Harold McGee</a> and start questioning everything about cooking; he needed to stumble upon the recipe for parmesan ice-cream which inspired him to toy with preconceptions of food; he needed to take up kick-boxing, which gave him the discipline to see him through years of experimentation.</p> <p>Even the week-long stage at Raymond Blanc\u2019s Le Manoir which dissuaded him from working in other people\u2019s kitchens \u2013 \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want the creativity beaten out of me\u201d \u2013 was a factor.</p> <p>The size of the rundown pub in Bray that he converted into the Fat Duck in 1995 was important too. \u201cBecause the kitchen was so tiny and the kit was second-hand and rubbish, I had to find ways of getting my food to a level of precision.\u201d</p> <p>Blumenthal\u2019s interest in multi-sensory dining \u2013 using scented dry ice to intensify flavours, creating an audio soundtrack to add extra dimensions to a seafood dish \u2013 could also be explained in terms of the small size of the first Fat Duck and the scale of the memories he was trying to recreate. \u201cMy memory of L\u2019Oustau was growing but I had a pub with one door on the side of the road. I didn\u2019t have a mountain or a water fountain in the background or the crunching gravel or the lavender, I didn\u2019t have the valley of olive trees in Provence.

It was totally inappropriate, but that was the only reaction I could have, it was that good.\u201d</p> <p>Harris, whose north Kent pub the Sportsman won best restaurant at the National Restaurant Awards in June, was dining at Nico at Ninety on Park Lane. He was a financial adviser at the time but, despite a keen interest in cooking, admits: \u201cI don\u2019t think I really knew what a Michelin-starred restaurant was.\u201d</p> <p>It had been a good month in the office so Harris and two colleagues decided a celebratory lunch was in order. Then one of the best restaurants in London \u2013 chef-patron Nico Ladenis was striving towards his third Michelin star \u2013 Nico at Ninety was not the kind of place where you\u2019d hammer on the crockery or express approval with manic bursts of laughter. \u201cIt was very formal,\u201d he says. \u201cPosh, posh, posh.\u201d</p> <p>He immediately knew the meal would be special. \u201cTo start I had a ravioli of salmon with a chive velout\u00e9 that was so intense it rocked my whole body. The main course was a braised knuckle of veal with a mustard sauce and carrots cut into squares.\u201d But it was the dessert that tipped him over the edge. \u201cIt had a powerful lemon flavour, sweetened just enough to balance it. It came with a little tulip-shaped biscuit with a scoop of ice-cream in it and a pool of raspberry sauce. It was mind-blowing.\u201d</p> <p>If the lemon tart made Harris want to become a chef, the overall experience at Nico at Ninety triggered an idea that he would eventually realise at the Sportsman. \u201cI remember saying afterwards, \u2018Isn\u2019t it a shame only rich people eat like this. Why can\u2019t you get food this good without all the folderol?\u2019 Then I thought, hang on, if you take away the fancy location, the army of waiters, the expensive napery and crockery, and it\u2019s just a plate, a knife and a fork, I could serve food as good as this in a place where you wouldn\u2019t have to go through the whole drama. A lemon tart in itself isn\u2019t an expensive thing. It\u2019s labour-intensive and technically difficult, but if you crack the technique, that doesn\u2019t cost anything.

I would cook these dishes knowing what they were supposed to taste like: that was the big difference.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995, at the age of 33, he left his well-paid job in the city and became a commis chef on \u00a38,000 a year. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing it to learn how to cook,\u201d he says, \u201cI wanted to learn how restaurants ran.\u201d In November 1999 he took over a rundown pub outside Whitstable and set about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/02/terroir-food-local-sportsman-pub\">turning it into the best restaurant in the country</a>.</p> <p>If he were to relive that meal, would it have the same impact? \u201cI think it would,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d pay anything to go back and have that meal again.\u201d<br><a href=\"http://thesportsmanseasalter.co.uk/\"><em>thesportsmanseasalter.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>Asma Khan: dum biryani, Kolkata<br></h2> <p><strong><em>Cook, Darjeeling Express supper club</em></strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c60e98e7a3af15d91a3eb7c63c53ac8ac0252fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c60e98e7a3af15d91a3eb7c63c53ac8ac0252fc/0_1008_4912_6142/800.jpg\" alt=\"Asma Khan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asma Khan: \u2018I tasted it and thought, I\u2019m going to cook like this one day.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/Observer Food Monthly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asma Khan can trace her desire to cook back to her sister\u2019s wedding and the moment the main course failed to arrive on time. Rather than serve the groom\u2019s family first, as is the custom, the cooks at her grandfather\u2019s house in Kolkata made the mistake of sending out the dish to their employers. Horrified at the offence this might cause, Asma\u2019s mother sent her daughter into the kitchen to sort out the problem.</p> <p>Khan was 18 and had never so much as boiled an egg. \u201cI come from a royal family \u2013 Rajput on my father\u2019s side, Bengali on my mother\u2019s \u2013 where none of the women knew how to cook,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The troublesome dish was a Kolkata dum biryani: layers of rice, mutton, potatoes, saffron and spices covered with a dough seal and heated over a wood fire for 12 hours. When Khan \u2013 \u201cin all my finery, dressed head to toe in jewellery\u201d \u2013 rushed into the kitchen to help, the cooks were breaking the seal. \u201cI had never smelled it this close before,\u201d she says. \u201cBy the time it comes to the table, it has already lost a lot of the fragrance.\u201d She describes the moment in almost spiritual terms. \u201cThe aroma hit my soul. I was mesmerised. The chef put a grain of rice in my hand. I tasted it and thought, I\u2019m going to cook like this one day.\u201d</p> <p>It took a long time to realise that ambition. Khan married a few years later and in 1991 moved to Cambridge with her husband, an economics professor. \u201cHe told my family he knew how to cook,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cHe could only cook one chicken curry and, man, I never want to eat that again. After two miserable years I started to learn.\u201d The first recipe she picked up was the dum biryani from Haji, the chef who made it at the wedding.</p> <p>What she really wanted to do was cook professionally, but instead she completed a law degree in London, followed by a PhD, though she had no intention of practising. \u201cI just wanted to cook. My husband was horrified, but nothing made me happier. So on the day I did my viva [an oral exam], I started my food business.\u201d She was 43 and she felt liberated. \u201cIndian women spend their lives doing things to please other people. I was born with those chains, now I\u2019m not in chains.\u201d</p> <p>The first public dinner Khan hosted, at the German Institute in South Kensington in 2012, sold twice as many tickets as she hoped, inspiring her to start a supper club at her home. Word spread about her cooking, which she describes as \u201cold-fashioned food that you don\u2019t get unless you know an Indian family\u201d, and she ran a successful nine-month residency at The Sun &amp; 13 Cantons pub in Soho, awarded four stars by <em>Evening Standard</em> restaurant critic Fay Maschler. Now she\u2019s gathering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/01/cool-cuisine-heatwave-what-to-eat\">her most popular recipes</a> into a book while continuing to cook at venues around London. (A restaurant isn\u2019t on the cards right now because she has two sons, 11 and 16, to look after.)</p> <p>Khan says she has no regrets that her cooking ambitions took so long to realise: \u201cWhen it is my time, that\u2019s when it happens.\u201d About the biryani, which she still makes on special occasions, she is similarly philosophical. \u201cEvery time I make it, I feel nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is something emotional about it, because once the rice is sealed, your fate is sealed. With other dishes, you can tweak them, taste them. Here you can do nothing. You only know what\u2019s happened to it when you open it.\u201d<br><a href=\"http://www.darjeeling-express.com/supper-clubs\"><em>darjeeling-express.com/supper-clubs</em></a></p> <h2>Uyen Luu: Mum\u2019s caramelised sardines<br></h2> <p><strong><em>Cook and author</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1d287f3b2d2f352ce542a4ba9ff8ef5681fb55b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d287f3b2d2f352ce542a4ba9ff8ef5681fb55b/1067_591_5194_6490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Uyen Luu\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uyen Luu: \u2018I was like, \u201cReally?

This is what happened to the food writer Uyen Luu, who runs a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/16/uyen-luu-vietnamese-food-refugee-author\">popular Vietnamese supper club</a> in Hackney. Her mother wouldn\u2019t allow her to help in the kitchen at home, and when she went abroad aged 20 and started pining for home-cooked food, she hadn\u2019t the faintest idea how to make it.</p> <p>Luu had left her film and video course at Central St Martin\u2019s in the middle of term, travelling to New York with three friends to seek work experience on movie sets. They were on a tight budget and, she says, \u201cthere was only so many bagels with cream cheese I could eat. I missed Mum\u2019s cooking so much \u2013 until then I\u2019d taken it for granted.\u201d Unable to produce caramelised sardines or tomato soup with sea bass in their tiny East Village apartment, Luu phoned home.</p> <p>That longing for familiar food was something Luu\u2019s mother, Nga Le, felt when she arrived in London in 1982 with two young children. A refugee from Saigon, where her family were suffering under the communist regime, Nga found herself in a place \u2013 Highbury \u2013 which offered little to remind her of Vietnam. Nga had never learned how to cook until, craving the flavours she\u2019d left behind, she met other members of London\u2019s Vietnamese community and started absorbing their knowledge.</p> <p>Fifteen years later, Luu was amazed to discover that her mother\u2019s cooking wasn\u2019t as complicated as she\u2019d imagined. \u201cI called her for the caramelised sardines recipe. She told me to get a pot, fry the onions or shallots with a bit of sugar, brown off the fish, and then add coconut water and let it reduce. I was like, \u2018Really? Is that all?\u2019 It was so easy.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2012/oct/15/vietnamese-cooking-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3b2gg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1812742\"            data-video-name=\"Vietnamese cooking: Uyen Luu's home restaurant - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Crane tv\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/10/1349862612955/Vietnamese-cook---video-015.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-397487632\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/10/1349862612955/Vietnamese-cook---video-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/10/121009VietCrane-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/10/121009VietCrane_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/10/121009VietCrane-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/10/121009VietCrane_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121009VietCrane/121009VietCrane.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2012/oct/15/vietnamese-cooking-video\">Vietnamese cooking: Uyen Luu\u2019s home restaurant</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And how did it turn out?</p> <p>\u201cPretty good,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t have my mum\u2019s touch.\u201d</p> <p>Inspired, Luu began cooking in earnest. \u201cThere were great supermarkets nearby that opened late, and after a night of partying I\u2019d go out and buy things to cook at 2am \u2013 it was so exciting.\u201d Her interest continued to develop back in London but it didn\u2019t become professional until she was 32. \u201cWhen I moved into my current house in Hackney, I had lots of dinner parties.

  "<p>There are a few ways you might know Miles Teller, a 29-year-old actor who is pretty universally thought to be the future of Hollywood. For chin-stroking cineastes, he is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/whiplash-review\"><em>Whiplash</em></a> kid. That film, which tells the story of a virtuoso jazz drummer and his sadistic orchestra leader, was so out-of-the-blue brilliant that, after seeing it, it was hard not to become its personal publicist, imploring friends, even strangers to see it. Made in 19 days, for just $3 million, it won three Oscars, though not for Teller.</p> <p>For teenage readers, Teller is Peter, the much-needed comic relief in the wildly successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/21/divergent-ascendant-shailene-woodley-premiere-tv-movie\"><em>Divergent</em></a> series, or Mr Fantastic in the much less successful 2015 reboot of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/25/fantastic-four-critical-clobbering-sequel-pulled-schedules\"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a>.</p> <p>And then, for cruisers of the <em>Mail</em> <em>Online</em>\u2019s Sidebar of Shame, Teller is clickbait notorious as \u201ca dick\u201d. This suggestion came from an <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/interviews/a36894/miles-teller-interview-0915/\">American<em> Esquire</em> cover story</a> that went viral last August. The article mocked his swaggering confidence and the way he talked about the actors he had in his sights: Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Joaquin Phoenix. It was a savage, career-jarring take-down and \u2013 the modern world for you \u2013 was forwarded around to many more people than have ever seen <em>Whiplash</em>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwh9c_E3dJk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rwh9c_E3dJk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The question is: is Miles Teller the new Ryan Gosling or even the next De Niro or Pacino? Or is he, excuse the bluntness, a dick? On a Saturday afternoon in August, Teller strides into a swanky hotel suite on the 39th floor that\u2019s just about eye level with the clouds. He is in town to promote his new movie, <em>War Dogs</em>, directed by <em>The Hangover</em>\u2019s Todd Phillips, but he has shazzy blond hair from a film he\u2019s currently shooting with Josh Brolin and Jennifer Connelly, about firefighters tackling a wildfire that raged through Arizona in 2013.</p> <p>The Teller story really begins in the summer of 2007, when, as a 20-year-old Grateful Dead fan, he was travelling home to Florida from a Deadhead festival called Gathering of the Vibes. His friend was behind the wheel, another was in the back seat, every inch of space was jammed with camping equipment. Then, at 80mph, the car skidded, jumped three lanes of traffic and flipped eight times. Teller was knocked unconscious and woke up 30ft from the vehicle, his face covered in blood.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My best friend Nick was killed in a motorcycle crash, then, a month later, my buddy Beau died in a car accident</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe guy driving, he was fine, my buddy he was sleeping in the back,\u201d Teller recalls. \u201cI even had a bag of tomatoes that were fine. Everything was fine except for my face.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs, though not with much enthusiasm. At the hospital he was told he was actually pretty lucky: 99.9% of people ejected from a car at that speed would be dead. They fixed his broken wrist and put 20 staples in his shoulder; his face would require numerous laser surgeries, the kind also used for removing tattoos, to make the cuts, he says, \u201cmitigated in a certain way\u201d. The scars on his throat and chin still catch the eye and two rocks remain in his face, embedded deep in scar tissue.</p> <p>When Teller first went to acting school, he used to joke that if his dog died, that would be the most emotionally wrenching experience he\u2019d had to endure in his life. He comes from a stable, well-to-do family: his father was an engineer on a nuclear-power plant; his mother sold real estate. He grew up mostly in a small town in Florida with a modest claim to fame as the manatee capital of the world. He was effortlessly strong academically, and excelled at sports, especially baseball. He started acting because his drama teacher was \u201cpretty hot\u201d, and landed a place at New York University\u2019s prestigious Tisch School. Then the crash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f6f3d853f0e0bef0483f49f3c8c968457393c14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6f3d853f0e0bef0483f49f3c8c968457393c14/0_52_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Nicole Kidman in Rabbit Hole, his first big break.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Growing up on screen: with Nicole Kidman in Rabbit Hole, his first big break.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blossom Films/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI got in my car accident at 20, that was in August,\u201d says Teller, sucking on an e-cigarette. \u201cThen February that next year, I turned 21 and seven of my best friends from Florida flew up for my birthday. Then in June, one of those guys, Nick, passed away in a motorcycle accident: a car ran a stop sign and T-boned him. I was at the hospital, he was on life support, they pulled the plug the next day. A month after that, one my closest friends, my buddy Beau, passed away, again a car accident. And I was actually sitting next to Beau at Nick\u2019s funeral. So at my 21st birthday, seven of my buddies are there, five months later, two of them are gone.\u201d</p> <p>Teller recounts these experiences without histrionics, but the really incongruous part is that car crashes have subsequently been pivotal in five movies in his short career, perhaps most chillingly in <em>Whiplash</em>, where he is sideswiped, arrives late for a key rehearsal and then bleeds all over his drum kit. The run started with his break, 2010\u2019s <em>Rabbit Hole</em>, where he played a teenager who accidentally runs over and kills the son of a couple played by Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was first auditioning for projects, they\u2019d say, \u2018Miles is a good actor but it doesn\u2019t make sense for this character to have scars,\u2019\u201d says Teller. \u201cBut John Cameron Mitchell, the <em>Rabbit Hole</em> director, he loved it. He was like, \u2018It\u2019s your character\u2019s secret!\u2019 I remember him being like, \u2018Miles, I really need you to think about your buddy Beau right now.\u2019 And this is in the middle of a take, and you\u2019re already as nervous as shit because you\u2019re working with Nicole Kidman and it\u2019s your first movie and she\u2019s not talking to you because she\u2019s in character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9cddbb6f9f73af6a6ebd33fe89dd17a229d7cf7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cddbb6f9f73af6a6ebd33fe89dd17a229d7cf7a/0_0_2012_3000/671.jpg\" alt=\"With girlfriend Keleigh Sperry.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With girlfriend Keleigh Sperry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Gershoff/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isn\u2019t it traumatic to relive these experiences on camera? \u201cIt\u2019ll definitely impact on me for the rest of my life for sure,\u201d Teller replies. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with that shit. If I\u2019m in a movie and the guy\u2019s dealing with the death of his buddy when they were overseas at war, or I\u2019m dealing with a guy now who lost 19 of his friends all at once in this firefighter movie, it does give you a certain level of truth that, if you hadn\u2019t gone through it, you would have to imagine what it would be like. But obviously if you went through it, you are closer to it than somebody who hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Teller\u2019s early career, <em>Rabbit Hole</em> excepted, did not obviously herald future greatness. He tended to be cast as a friend of the lead character; the offbeat, cocky, fast-talking foil in mostly silly films like <em>21 &amp; Over</em> and <em>Two Night Stand</em>. But he showed uncommon depth in the superior 2013 romantic comedy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/29/sundance-the-spectacular-now-first-look-review\"><em>The Spectacular Now</em></a>, sharing the Special Jury Award for Acting at Sundance with his co-star, Shailene Woodley. Then came <em>Whiplash</em>. Teller had done some drumming at school, in a church choir and a band called the Mutes, but for once, no one could accuse him of playing a version of himself. Andrew, his character, was tortured and self-destructive, mercilessly hazed by a bullying teacher (JK Simmons, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor).</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a pretty light-hearted person,\u201d says Teller. \u201cSo how Andrew carried himself physically, how he related to people, his temperament, all those things couldn\u2019t be further from me. But what I liked about that kid was the fact that he was an underdog, you\u2019d look right past him, but he\u2019s got the heart and the perseverance as big as anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Teller\u2019s favourite scene was when Andrew charges from behind the drums to flatten his tormentor. \u201cJK cracked a rib,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it, but after a guy\u2019s slapping you and yelling at you for three weeks straight, it\u2019s nice to finally\u2026 as a character, I\u2019m speaking! I always dug that scene because he just finally snaps.\u201d</p> <p>And at least Simmons can take comfort from his Academy Award. Teller exhales a plume of smoke, \u201cHe owes me one, for sure.\u201d</p> <p>The sense that Teller gets by on charm and wisecracks still pervades. Todd Phillips, his director in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005151/?ref_=nv_sr_1\"><em>War Dogs</em></a>, says, \u201cI think Miles is a world-class actor. It\u2019s almost as if he doesn\u2019t have to try. I don\u2019t mean that in a negative way; he\u2019s just naturally gifted. It\u2019s amazing to watch.\u201d</p> <p>When I read this compliment back to him, Teller squirms at the \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to try\u201d part. \u201cThat\u2019s frustrating!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when people say that because an actor\u2019s greatest tool is his preparation and I\u2019ve always felt like I do as much prep as anybody.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f2c11c876d0d8c305ad75ee987c11456d46977b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f2c11c876d0d8c305ad75ee987c11456d46977b/0_196_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Teller's award-winning performance in The Spectacular Now, with Brie Larson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">His award-winning performance in The Spectacular Now, with Brie Larson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>War Dogs</em>, though, is something of a departure for Teller. The film tells the jaw-dropping true story of two stoner 20-somethings from Florida who become arms suppliers for the US government. It is set in 2007, and as conflicts rumble on in Iraq and Afghanistan, the friends \u2013 one a high-school dropout, the other who not long before had been a massage therapist \u2013 win a $300m contract to kit out the Afghan National Army. The deal does not exactly go to plan, which makes it rich comic territory for Phillips, whose <em>Hangover</em> trilogy grossed more than $1.4 billion globally.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Miles is a world-class actor. It\u2019s almost as if he doesn\u2019t have to try. He\u2019s naturally gifted.

Like he plays guitar, I play guitar. I smoked a ton of pot, as did David. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have been able to go into meetings like David did. I did not do that shit when I was high. That was not my entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>With his languid delivery and sleepy eyes, it\u2019s not hard to imagine Teller as a caner. \u201cI was smoking multiple times a day every day \u2013 you\u2019re in theatre school in New York, do it!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cBut I slowed down on it and really stopped for a while because my career started going and I didn\u2019t want to mess it up when I was high. If someone sent me an email, I didn\u2019t want to respond and obviously you can\u2019t do that shit.\u201d</p> <p>But now things are going well, surely he can knock himself out? \u201cYeah,\u201d he smiles, \u201cI\u2019m kind of easing back into it.\u201d</p> <p>If Teller could have been forgiven for being crotchety with journalists, post-<em>Esquire</em>, he isn\u2019t \u2013 at least not today.

  "<p>As we celebrate the ambition, calibre, and achievements of champions competing at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, there is also the stark reality that malnutrition is compromising the survival, health and potential of billions of individuals globally.</p> <p>Malnutrition is often confused with hunger, but they are quite different. Hunger, which affects around 800 million people, is the physical experience of a lack of food. Malnutrition on the other hand, results from the consumption and absorption of either too little of the right kinds of food or too much of the wrong kind. </p> <p>Globally, one in three people suffer from malnutrition and according to the World Health Organisation over 3 million children die from it every year.

However, what materialised fell short of all expectations.

  "<p>To most of the world, the place where James Foley spent his childhood must look about as good as it gets: a clapboard house with a large garden in a small town next to a beautiful lake. Visualise the American dream and this is it, pretty much. Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where Foley grew up in a close-knit family of five siblings, is an affluent corner of a well-off state in the world\u2019s most advanced industrial economy. The worst thing you can say about the place is that it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/us/politics/for-wolfeboro-nh-its-not-just-another-romney-summer.html\" title=\"\">where Mitt Romney goes on&#xa0;holiday</a>.</p> <p>This was where James Foley started his life. And on 19 August 2014, the world found out where and how it ended via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/james-wright-foley-beheaded-isis-video\" title=\"\">a video posted on YouTube</a> entitled \u201cA Message to America\u201d. Foley, a 40-year-old freelance photojournalist who had been kidnapped in Syria two years earlier, was dressed in an orange jumpsuit and kneeling on the ground. With his hands tied behind his back, he&#xa0;recited what was obviously a prepared script that listed America\u2019s crimes. And then, we all know what happened next: a masked man with a distinctive British accent put a knife to his throat and decapitated him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw his image being used as propaganda, for political agendas, and for me as a friend, that was uncomfortable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At home in New Hampshire, Diane Foley, his mother, found out when she got a call from a journalist she didn\u2019t know who asked her for her \u201creaction\u201d.</p> <p>If you wanted to eviscerate the American dream, to disembowel it, and string it up from a lamp-post for all the world to see how vulnerable it really is, how easily vanquished, then murdering James Wright Foley on the internet in front of a global audience is not a bad place to start.</p> <p>Foley could have been the poster boy for the all-American way of life: a handsome, square-jawed idealist from a well-off family \u2013 his father, John, a doctor, his mother a pillar of the local Catholic church \u2013 who\u2019d had all the advantages that western life can confer: a loving environment, a good education, a childhood unmarked by war or famine or disaster. That he had elected to leave all that and go and cover the ongoing insurgency in Syria for a few hundred dollars a pop from whichever outlet he could get to take his footage was neither here nor there to his captors.</p> <p>His murder was the first of a series of videos of western hostages being executed and it presaged an new form of terror. It was the video that introduced the world to \u201cJihadi John\u201d, or Mohammed Emwazi as we now know he was called. We know quite a lot about him now \u2013 how he grew up in upmarket parts of London \u2013 Maida Vale and St John\u2019s Wood, how Foley\u2019s fellow prisoners named him and two fellow British jihadis \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, and how, in November 2015, he was killed by a US drone strike. But his victims have remained pale and shadowy in comparison. They\u2019ve been stranded, for ever, in orange jumpsuits, destined to end their days reading someone else\u2019s words.</p> <p>And this is what <em> Jim: The James Foley Story</em>, a new documentary about the life and last days of James Foley, seeks to rectify. It\u2019s an intimate, moving portrait \u2013 nominated this month for an Emmy \u2013 made through interviews with his family, friends and fellow hostages, though it\u2019s not until the very end of the film, when his brother, Michael, addresses the nameless person behind the camera, that you realise just how intimate it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d6b176a22e3df60b29fbb2d45777030b7ac76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d6b176a22e3df60b29fbb2d45777030b7ac76a/0_0_4000_2722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foley (left) in 1982 with his childhood friend Brian Oakes, director of Jim: The James Foley Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foley (left) in 1982 with his childhood friend Brian Oakes, director of Jim: The James Foley Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Brian Oakes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou know him as well as I do,\u201d Michael Foley says to the camera, talking about the video of his brother\u2019s death. \u201cHe would never have done those things if there wasn\u2019t someone else who would be harmed. He never cared for himself.\u201d Because the film-maker, Brian Oakes, did know him well, had known him, in fact, since he was seven years old, and grew up with him in the same small town of Wolfeboro. And the impetus for the film, he tells me from his home in New York, came from the desire to rescue his friend Jim, the boy he\u2019d grown up with, from the media creation and propaganda tool that he\u2019d become.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the original catalyst for me wanting to make this film \u2013 that image of Jim, of his death, his execution, which was seen throughout the world. I saw this image being used for a lot of different purposes. It was used as propaganda. It was used in politics, for political agendas and for me\u2026 as a friend and someone who knew him, that was really\u2026 made me uncomfortable. I just wanted to take on the responsibility to tell Jim\u2019s story.\u201d</p> <p>And he does. People have a habit of saying nice things about the dead but it\u2019s clear that Foley was a particularly special case. When I speak to Diane Foley on the phone at her home in New Hampshire, she calls the film \u201ca gift\u201d. She\u2019s known Oakes pretty much all his life, but hadn\u2019t wanted the family to take part initially. \u201cIt was very soon after Jim\u2019s death that he came and asked us and I was truly not ready for it. I loved Brian. He was a childhood best friend but I was reluctant, initially. It was his siblings who wanted to do it. They knew Brian best and they wanted people to know who Jim really was and why he put his life on the line.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all there, his life from childhood on, warts and all. His idealism and easy manner comes across but also a certain waywardness, a lack of desire to be pinned down by convention or loan repayment plans. But it\u2019s the interviews with his fellow hostages that are at the heart of the film. For two years, when his family didn\u2019t know whether he was alive or dead, he was sharing a tiny cell with a changing roster of other western hostages, not all of whom were murdered by Isis.</p> <p>\u201cThose interviews were the most intense of the entire film-making process,\u201d says Oakes. \u201cHere were men who were with Jim over the course of months, sometimes years, when we didn\u2019t know where he was. We didn\u2019t know if Jim was alive or dead or where he was, who had him. This was a huge black hole and for me to be able to sit down and talk to those who were with him and to unravel that mystery was very cathartic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7UTdyP2fmk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O7UTdyP2fmk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jim: The James Foley Story trailer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cMichael and Katie, James\u2019s siblings came too and it was very emotional and difficult but also quite amazing.\u201d</p> <p>One of the former hostages he talked to was Nicolas H\u00e9nin, a French freelance journalist who had spent a long time in the Middle East and who recounts how much he disliked, initially, James\u2019s habit of calling everyone \u201cbro\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI just do not use this kind of working-class colloquial language,\u201d H\u00e9nin tells me over the phone from France. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my style. I\u2019m like, \u2018I am not your brother!\u2019\u201d But Foley did become like a brother to him. \u201cWe invented a life during these months in captivity,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cAnd when you invent a life, you have to invent also a family.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone, at some stage, fell out with everyone else, he tells me. \u201cThere were sometimes a few dozen people in a tiny room. In such circumstances, it\u2019s normal that every single one of us struggled with every single other. Apart from Jim. He had these incredible social skills. It really stands out. He was the only one who didn\u2019t have any big dispute with anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>H\u00e9nin and Foley became close, not least because for one 10-day period, they were handcuffed to each another. And it was shattering to H\u00e9nin when he, like everyone else, learned via the internet of his friend\u2019s death. \u201cMy first reaction when I watched this film [the Islamic State video] was horror, but my second reaction was pride. I was just proud of my friend. I was truly impressed by his behaviour where so many others would just scream like babies. Even though I had been through a lot of things in common with him, I\u2019m not at all sure I would have found the courage to behave like that. His comportment, his language\u2026 he speaks strongly, he looks straight, he stands straight. He just acts like a man. His condition was like an animal but Jim was a man. And somehow, he just behaved as a free man.</p> <p>\u201cI shared his fate for months. We were comrades, for 10 months we shared everything except our passports. And that\u2019s what saved my life. And took his.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We invented a life during those months in captivity. And when you invent a life, you have to invent also a family</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because the fact that Nicolas H\u00e9nin is around to tell the tale is due to his nationality. The French and other Europeans negotiated to get their hostages free. The British and Americans did not. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/british-photographer-john-cantlie-appears-in-new-isis-video\" title=\"\">John Cantlie</a>, a British journalist who was captured with Foley, is still being held. And Foley and his fellow Americans and Brits are all dead. It\u2019s still a bitter pill for the Foleys to swallow.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just terrible,\u201d says Diane Foley. \u201cI was appalled at the way we were treated. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. We just felt so alone. For nearly two years, we didn\u2019t know if Jim was alive, and we had very few people who were with us on it.\u201d As a family, they were told by the government that the best chance of securing their son\u2019s release was to maintain a news blackout, a stipulation they eventually broke, and that they now feel didn\u2019t help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8f2c5e3a4943df18dceb6d365b6e461099bf757\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8f2c5e3a4943df18dceb6d365b6e461099bf757/0_0_900_666/500.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley (standing at back) with his four younger siblings.\" width=\"500\" height=\"370\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley (standing at back) with his four younger siblings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Foley family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe had no idea how to find James and how to get him home once he was found. We just went to everyone we could, begging for help. But at that time, there was nothing in place. I was appalled to find that there was nobody in our own government whose mission it was to help us. It\u2019s not like in Britain or France, which have a structure in place. People were sympathetic. They listened. I think individually they cared but it was just at the bottom of their list.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just appalling to us. It was really up to private individuals who were the most helpful to me \u2013 like David Bradley, the publisher of the <em>Atlantic</em> and Phil Balboni, [for whom Foley was working] of the GlobalPost<em> </em>in Boston.\u201d</p> <p>It was also, Nicolas H\u00e9nin, believes, a terrible miscalculation. He has gone on to write a book about the causes of the insurgency in Syria and Iraq \u2013 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/350500/\" title=\"\"><em>Jihad Academy: the rise of the Islamic State</em> </a>\u2013 and believes that the Americans underestimated the crisis from the beginning. \u201cThey thought we had been taken by dangerous amateurs. They didn\u2019t realise what was at stake. I don\u2019t actually know what was exchanged for myself, if it was money or something else. But even if a ransom had been paid for Jim, it would have been worth it, beyond any moral consideration. It would have been worth it from a security perspective because the propaganda impact was so very high.\u201d</p> <p>It was. The film does not contain footage from the video and states that fact, explicitly, at the start. \u201cI didn\u2019t include it for a number of reasons but one was because I believe that people have a choice whether to watch it or not,\u201d Brian Oakes tells me. He himself hadn\u2019t watched it until he came to make the film. \u201cAnd in fact, I still haven\u2019t to this day, not the unedited version. It was not something I choose to do. I don\u2019t want to see that kind of war pornography. To me, that video is just a piece of propaganda, a recruitment tool.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ffddad82c63e4e0223e68efa5dd6f2138ceb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ffddad82c63e4e0223e68efa5dd6f2138ceb68/0_451_3000_1931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicolas H\u00e9nin (left), former French hostage and journalist, is greeted by his family following his release in April 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicolas H\u00e9nin (left), former French hostage and journalist, is greeted by his family following his release in April 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That image \u2013 of Foley in an orange jumpsuit on his knees in the Syrian desert \u2013 marked a new chapter in the use of terror; it became a symbol of the strength and ingenuity of Isis and evidence of the weakness of the west in confronting a whole new type of enemy. Clare Morgana Gillis, fellow freelance journalist and friend of Foley\u2019s, states in the film that 94% of Americans are aware of Foley\u2019s death, making it the news event with the second highest recognition after 9/11. Nobody would have hated that more than him, she says. He went to Syria to try and tell the world about the atrocities that were going on there. \u201cAnd that was the takeaway?\u201d she asks. The death of a single American reaped more publicity than any other report on the country,&#xa0;ever.</p> <p>It was another freelance, Nicole Tung, who rang Diane Foley at home in New Hampshire when, in November 2012, Foley and John Cantlie failed to show up at an arranged meeting place at the Turkish border. Later, the family discovered that the two men had been spotted when they broke their journey to file their copy from an internet cafe; shortly afterwards, armed gunmen forced their car to stop just a few miles from the border.</p> <p>\u201cI was just incredulous that it had happened, to be honest,\u201d says Diane Foley. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it. That\u2019s how much denial I was in. I was so ill&#xa0;prepared.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c61ff8f4298362706d48c37c5e92c89421b9d00d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c61ff8f4298362706d48c37c5e92c89421b9d00d/0_0_960_720/500.jpg\" alt=\"The teenage Foley with two of his younger siblings on his back.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The teenage Foley with two of his younger siblings on his back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Brian Oakes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Denial because this wasn\u2019t the first time that James Foley had been kidnapped. He\u2019d hopped around in his 20s and early 30s, studying creative writing, becoming a teacher in an inner-city school in Arizona, and then he seemed to find the thing he\u2019d been looking for: journalism. \u201cSomething seemed to click,\u201d says Diane. It gave him a purpose, a mission. And when the revolution kicked off in Libya, he went.</p> <p>Libya was where Morgana Gillis met Foley for the first time, and the main attraction for them both was that it was exciting and it was cheap. \u201cIt was a Mad Max type war,\u201d said Foley when he returned in 2011. Photojournalist Nicole Tung, another friend of Foley\u2019s interviewed in the film, says, \u201cMany of us aren\u2019t old enough to remember journalism in its heyday. What we do is journalism on a shoestring budget.\u201d And with it came a blurring of boundaries. The easiest and cheapest way of getting to the frontline was to hitch a lift with the&#xa0;insurgents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'I made it too easy for him. I wanted to be supportive. I didn\u2019t say, \"Jim, you put us through hell\"</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Foley was with Morgana Gillis and a South African freelance, Anton Hammerl, when they got caught up in crossfire. Hammerl was shot and killed. Morgana Gillis and Foley were captured. For Diane Foley, it was the darkest time of her life: her son missing, the family not knowing if he was alive or dead. \u201cIt was absolutely horrific at the time,\u201d she says. And it\u2019s a measure of everything that the family has been through subsequently that she now adds: \u201cIn retrospect, it was nothing.\u201d</p> <p>After six terrible weeks, they had the Hollywood denouement. He was released, unharmed, and when he returned to his old school of journalism to tell them about his experience, he revealed how much he had learned. \u201cWe did a lot of mistakes that day. Conflict zones can be covered safely. But you have to be very experienced. You have to be very, very careful. We didn\u2019t follow a lot of those practices so it\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>The Q&amp;A session was videoed and Oakes includes a lot of it in his film and, in the light of what happened next, there\u2019s a terrible poignancy to the words that Foley spoke, and yet didn\u2019t seem to hear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2916576c958f8078c9b47f4eab2c962b0dd68493\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2916576c958f8078c9b47f4eab2c962b0dd68493/0_0_3000_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley\u2019s mother, Diane, at home in New Hampshire shortly after the execution was posted on YouTube, August 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley\u2019s mother, Diane, at home in New Hampshire shortly after the execution was posted on YouTube, August 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s pure luck that you didn\u2019t get killed there,\u201d he tells the audience. \u201cPure luck. And you need to either change your behaviour right there or you shouldn\u2019t be doing this. Because it\u2019s not worth your life. It\u2019s not worth seeing your mother, father, brother, and sister bawling. You\u2019re worrying about your grandmother dying because you\u2019re in prison. It\u2019s not worth these things. It\u2019s not worth your life, no matter what romantic ideal you have, no matter what ethic you think you have. It\u2019s never worth that. I\u2019m 37 years old, I should have known that a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>Oakes delves into the very human reactions that Foley\u2019s family had when he was kidnapped a second time. His younger brother, John Jr, who has served in the military, is at times bewildered and angry and ultimately, grudgingly respectful of James\u2019s decision to return to a conflict zone. But mostly, angry. \u201cYou just wanted to punch him in the face in a loving, brotherly way,\u201d he tells Oakes in the film. His father, John, still shakes his head in disbelief at the memory of it. And Diane tells me that she thinks she \u201cmade it too easy for him\u201d.</p> <p>What do you mean? \u201cI wanted to be supportive. I didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well, Jim, you put us through hell.\u2019 I was saying, \u2018I respect your decision to do this. And people need to know what is going on in Syria.\u2019 But, to be honest, I put it behind me much too easily. I felt, what are the chances of it happening again? I was really very clueless. Journalists who do this dangerous work need to have those difficult conversations with their families. They need to be prepared and we were not. I was in denial about it. We didn\u2019t have Jim\u2019s will or passwords or bank accounts or emails or things we really needed as a family.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to do now since James\u2019s death. The family set up the <a href=\"https://www.jamesfoleyfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">James Foley Foundation </a>and one of their missions has been to try to better prepare freelance journalists for the potential dangers out there. Shortly after James\u2019s death, President Obama called her to offer his condolences. \u201cHe thought you were coming to get him,\u201d she told him. A rescue attempt had been made, she found out, but it was too late. The hostages had already been moved to another location. Since then, though, she has worked with the government to get them to create a cross-department \u201cfusion cell\u201d, equipped to deal with another family during another hostage crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09c0d9db38d98ebfb2a3a44531cec412f6b01e1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c0d9db38d98ebfb2a3a44531cec412f6b01e1d/0_76_2000_1234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley with students at the Christa McAuliffe Regional Charter Public School in Framingham, Mass, who had worked for his release, June 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley with students at the Christa McAuliffe Regional Charter Public School in Framingham, Mass, who had worked for his release, June 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McGagh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The foundation is also lobbying news organisations to take responsibility for the freelances they employ. \u201cWe have a responsibility for the people willing to do this work,\u201d she says. \u201cWe must protect them. Otherwise, it becomes, as it was at the time Jim was there, very abusive. News organisations are just using these young independent journalists for whatever and giving them nothing back. They did not have their back.\u201d</p> <p>One of Oakes\u2019s explicit intentions for the film, he says, was to explore the issues around the use of freelance journalists in conflict zones. And what draws them back. Foley, according to Oakes, was \u201calways a kid who loved adventure. He would always take that extra step. When we were teenagers, he was always the one to do something just a little bit more crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Oakes speculates that Foley was suffering from some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder after his experience in Libya. He took a job in Boston but couldn\u2019t settle. He was lured back by what he calls in the film \u201cthe siren song\u201d of the frontline. Though it\u2019s not as straightforward as hero-journalists-tell-world-what-it-needs-to-hear, not least because most of the time the world wasn\u2019t listening. And they were taking huge personal risks to file news stories into a void.</p> <p>But what Foley wanted \u2013 for the world to pay attention to what was happening in Syria \u2013 did happen because of his death, I point out to Diane. \u201cYes. Thanks be to God. But whether Jim knew that, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought interviewing the former hostages would be so bad. Then to find out that the group had created this family\u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t over. That\u2019s what Nicolas H\u00e9nin impresses on me when I speak to him. He doesn\u2019t talk about the torture he endured, that Foley endured. They were, variously, beaten, starved, suspended upside down from the ceiling, waterboarded. But that wasn\u2019t what they talked about.</p> <p>\u201cWe were all optimists. It was a decision we all made. Some of us were more realistic but it was harder. You had no control whatsoever over your fate. You are not the one who decides anything. The only thing you can have control of is your morale.\u201d He tells me how during the time he was chained to Foley, he talked late into the night with one of their captors, who was later identified as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/22/brussels-bomber-najim-laachraoui-identified-isis-jailer-foreign-hostages\" title=\"\">one of the Brussels bombers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHe was obsessed with the movie <em>The Matrix.</em> He was telling us: \u2018You have left the matrix now. You are living in another matrix. You have left that world. We are creating another world.\u201d It was, he says, a \u201cpostmodern&#xa0;experience\u201d.</p> <p>What do you mean?</p> <p>\u201cI learned that Syria was just a background. It had nothing to do with Syria. We were western hostages held by western captors.\u201d And it\u2019s not over. John Cantlie is still a prisoner. \u201cI am still careful what I say because they are still holding a friend of mine. The story is not yet over. And normally, when you are a hostage in Nigeria, Afghanistan, you leave the country and you leave it behind. But my captors came back to my home town and they committed crimes here. In November at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\" title=\"\">Bataclan</a>, they were less than a kilometre from my home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a5d47f35e0ecd901e06b7d1e0e13da7abb50e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a5d47f35e0ecd901e06b7d1e0e13da7abb50e9/0_0_3200_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign seen in James Foley\u2019s hometown in Rochester, New Hampshire the day after his killing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign seen in James Foley\u2019s hometown in Rochester, New Hampshire the day after his killing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His captors, he believes, follow him on Twitter. And the media reporting of every terrorist atrocity further inflames the situation. \u201cYou British taught us resilience during the second world war and that is what we need now. That motto \u2013 Keep Calm and Carry On \u2013 is the one we should adopt here now. The media panic, and the politicians panic and overreact. We should think about what our attackers would love us to do. And then do the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Diane Foley and the Foley family have decided to find meaning and purpose in James Foley\u2019s death. For them, it wasn\u2019t a senseless bloodthirsty revenge killing. It has become a mission for them to help others. It proves, Diane tells me, that people aren\u2019t fundamentally bad. They\u2019re the opposite. \u201cPeople have been so good to us. So many people from all around the world have sent us buckets of mail, donations, prayers. To have good overcome, we need to stand together. That\u2019s why we set up the foundation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/feb/15/sign-up-to-the-media-briefing\">Sign up to the new-look Media Briefing: bigger, better, brighter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And Brian Oakes makes the same point. \u201cI went into those interviews with the former hostages thinking this is going to be horrible, it\u2019s going to be so bad. Every day was probably torture and beatings. And then to find out that this group of men had created this family and all worked together to survive and had made these games and given each other lectures, it was fascinating.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Jim was always like that. He was always this beacon of positivity. And to hear that he was like that even in those super-dark times was amazing. It helps to give him meaning, I hope.\u201d</p> <p>The film is certainly much less bleak than you\u2019d ever think possible. Oakes says that he deliberately set up the juxtaposition of the idyllic nature of the small town American childhood they shared with the horror that was to follow. \u201cI think those of us who live in a world where everything is peaceful end up taking that for granted. And, that\u2019s why Jim went to Syria, after all.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfeboro, New Hampshire is not Raqqa, Syria. It is the opposite of Raqqa. But still, even there, it seemed there was some small corner of the Islamic State that was forever Wolfeboro. Daniel Rye Ottosen, a Danish hostage who had also grown close to Foley, tells in the film how for Christmas, sitting in the dark, they gave each other compliments in place of gifts. And his present to Jim? \u201cI told him, \u2018You are the most honest person. You are pure good.\u2019 That was our Christmas night. And I really felt that I\u2019d had the best Christmas night in my&#xa0;life.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jim: The James Foley Story is in cinemas from 2 September. </em><a href=\"http://dogwoof.com/jimthejamesfoleystory\" title=\"\"><em>Preview Q&amp;A screenings</em></a><em> with Diane Foley and director Brian Oakes are being held on 31 August and 1 September </em></p>",

  "<p>The Labour mayor of London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sadiqkhan\" title=\"\">Sadiq Khan, </a>has issued a dramatic call to his party\u2019s members to dump Jeremy Corbyn, saying he has been a disastrous leader who must share a large part of the blame for Britain\u2019s forthcoming exit from the EU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/labour-cannot-win-jeremy-corbyn-im-voting-for-owen-smith-says-sadiq-khan\">We cannot win with Jeremy \u2026 so I will vote for Owen Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Khan, who secured the biggest win by any Labour politician against the Conservative party in more than a decade when he beat Zac Goldsmith to the mayoralty in May, throws his support behind the challenger Owen Smith, arguing that Labour faces all-but-certain defeat at the next general election without a change at the top.</p> <p>The brutal intervention by Khan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/labour-cannot-win-jeremy-corbyn-im-voting-for-owen-smith-says-sadiq-khan\" title=\"\">in an article for the <em>Observer</em></a> will give a huge boost to Smith\u2019s camp, and comes as the party prepares to send out ballot papers this week to more than half a million members who are eligible to vote in the leadership contest.</p> <p>Khan says that while Corbyn \u2013 still the clear favourite to win the contest \u2013 is a \u201cprincipled Labour man\u201d whose ideas have brought hope to many, his year in charge has shown he is not up to the job and is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d to lead the party back to power. Khan\u2019s message is that the party has a duty to oust Corbyn before it is too late.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy has already proved that he is unable to organise an effective team and has failed to win the trust and respect of the British people,\u201d Khan writes, adding: \u201cJeremy\u2019s personal ratings are the worst of any opposition leader on record and the Labour party is suffering badly as a result. He has lost the confidence of more than 80% of Labour\u2019s MPs in parliament \u2013 and I am afraid we simply cannot afford to go on like this.\u201d</p> <p>But it is his comments on what he regards as Corbyn\u2019s abject<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/26/corbyn-must-resign-inadequate-leader-betrayal\" title=\"\"> failure to rally his party behind a pro-EU </a>message before the referendum that will be seen as the most damaging. Khan, in effect, lays much of the blame for Brexit at Corbyn\u2019s door and that of his advisers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c46e99a9c9d386148555ac6a727bf1edb472564c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c46e99a9c9d386148555ac6a727bf1edb472564c/0_7_3736_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leadership hopefuls Jeremy Corbyn, left, and Owen Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leadership hopefuls Jeremy Corbyn, left, and Owen Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThroughout the campaign and aftermath, Jeremy failed to show the leadership we desperately needed. His position on EU membership was never clear \u2013 and voters didn\u2019t believe him. A third of Labour voters said they did not know where the party stood on the referendum just a week before polling day.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t just blame a \u2018hostile media\u2019 and let Jeremy and his team off the hook,\u201d he writes. \u201cI know from my own election \u2013 up against a nasty and divisive Tory campaign \u2013 that if we are strong and clear enough in our convictions, the message will get through to the public. That\u2019s a test that Jeremy totally failed in the EU referendum. Why would things be different in a general election?\u201d</p> <p>Smith said he was \u201chugely honoured\u201d to have Khan\u2019s support. \u201cSadiq ran a fantastic campaign to win power for Labour in London this year, securing a huge mandate from party members and the electorate,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHe showed that a vision of hope and optimism can win, if it\u2019s backed up with a credible plan to deliver real meaningful change for people\u2019s lives. Since that election we have seen what a difference Labour can make when we hold power.\u201d</p> <p>Khan\u2019s decision to go on the offensive represents a sudden change in approach by the mayor. Days earlier, in a BBC radio interview, he refused to be drawn on who he would vote for, saying that he preferred to stay out of current internal party arguments, including the debate over who should be leader. But his aides said he had come under growing pressure from supporters and friends in the party to declare his hand and felt it was his duty to make his position known.</p> <p>Khan lays heavy emphasis on his fear that another four years of Corbyn as leader will ensure another Tory government, leading to more cuts and damage being done to the country\u2019s industrial heartlands.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em> last weekend, Corbyn blamed any failure to get his messages on policy across on mutinous and disloyal MPs and others who had never accepted his leadership. \u201cWe have done our best to get our message out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been helped that prominent people in the Labour party \u2013 Labour MPs \u2013 have spent the last 10 months actively being unsupportive of our policies that have been generally agreed and supported. Now everyone agrees that anti-austerity is the right line to be taking.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn said he was using his second campaign for the leadership in 12 months as a dry run for a general election: \u201cSince the resignations in July and the leadership contest, then clearly the public mind has become focused on the leadership contest rather than the future. I\u2019m trying to turn this leadership campaign into a campaign of how we would run a general election. How we would win back those areas of Britain that have become disillusioned \u2013 left-behind Britain.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/19/corbyns-leadership-unprofessional-and-shoddy-says-heidi-alexander\">Jeremy Corbyn's leadership unprofessional and shoddy, says Heidi Alexander</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Corbyn still expected by most MPs to beat Smith and renew his mandate, many senior Labour figures are beginning to focus on how to bring the party together afterwards. Tom Watson, the deputy leader, will back efforts to restore a system of elections to the shadow cabinet, which will be considered by the party\u2019s national executive committee in September as a means to rebuild trust between the leader and MPs.</p> <p>Explaining his backing for Smith, who is the former shadow work and pensions secretary, Khan says: \u201cOn the big issues Owen and I have been on the same side of the argument, including opposing the Iraq war. Owen led and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 won our fight against the Tories\u2019 unfair cuts to tax credits and disability allowances, which would have hurt the most disadvantaged people in our society.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cSimply opposing Tory policies will never be enough to help the people we exist to support. At best, you knock off just the very sharpest edges of the Tory project. Winning elections is how you really make a difference. Only then are you in control \u2013 able to shape the agenda and implement Labour policies to create a fairer and more equal society.\u201d</p> <p><em>Comments will open on Sunday morning</em></p>",

  "<p>Being tickled is not funny. I write as a person who hasn\u2019t lifted their arms above 45 degrees in 30 years for fear of a rogue hand sneaking into my sleeve and wiggling.</p> <p>A new documentary, one of the standout films at this year\u2019s Sundance festival, confirms the dark side of tickling. New Zealand journalist David Farrier, a man who has made a career out of \u201clooking at the weird and bizarre side of life\u201d, noticed ads popping up in his timeline, asking: \u201cAre you ticklish?\u201d He followed them to a series of videos showing scenes of \u201ccompetitive endurance tickling\u201d. Young men in Adidas are restrained at the wrists and ankles, and tickled until they can\u2019t take it any more.</p> <p>When Farrier contacted Jane O\u2019Brien Media, the company behind the videos, who advertise for young athletes to compete (if successful, they\u2019re flown to LA and paid $1,500), he received <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152830735360715&amp;set=a.10150236294970715.365444.653190714&amp;type=3&amp;theater\" title=\"\">a Facebook message</a>. \u201cTo be brutally frank,\u201d it wrote, \u201cassociation with a homosexual journalist is not something that will [sic] embrace.\u201d They threatened him with legal consequences should he pursue his investigation. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/movies/tickled-review.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Tickling</a> was, they said, a \u201cpassionately and exclusively heterosexual athletic endurance activity\u201d. So Farrier bought a plane ticket.</p> <p>He followed the videos, in his attempts to find out more about Jane O\u2019Brien Media. <a href=\"http://janeobrienmedia.com/\" title=\"\">Their website</a> opens with a recruitment video of the type you\u2019d find when browsing LinkedIn for jobs in world domination and web design. Farrier went deep into the world of tickling. Side note: there is a world of tickling.</p> <p>He met men who reported being doxxed \u2013 threatened with online exposure \u2013 after saying they no longer wanted to participate in competitive tickling (some having been told the tickling videos were for the military to test tickling as a torture device). They alleged that Jane O\u2019Brien Media created websites containing their name and address, alongside videos of them tied up and breathless. Jane O\u2019Brien Media denies this. In the film all roads lead to a single wealthy man, shielded by cash and threats of litigation \u2013 an ex-teacher called David D\u2019Amato, <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/03/07/man-says-tickling-contest-film-defamed-him.htm\" title=\"\">a man who served time</a> in 2001 after committing cyber crimes as retaliation against a teenager who\u2019d ended their tickle video business relationship. D\u2019Amato went by the name Terri Tickle.</p> <p>Our most ticklish areas are also our weakest \u2013 neck, stomach \u2013 where we\u2019re soft and honest. I looked it up. In 2013, scientists in Germany investigated tickling, looking at MRIs of a brain when a person laughs at something they find funny, and then when they\u2019re tickled. They found that tickling activates the part of our brain that anticipates pain. When you tickle someone, you\u2019re stimulating the same nerves that make you want to run away from danger. Which is why you can\u2019t tickle yourself \u2013 your body knows there\u2019s nothing at stake.</p> <p>The film is one of those that ruins nice things for you. The lights go down on an audience that enjoys the intimacy of a sly tickle, that sees the laughter as pure and joyful. They leave with their balloons popped.</p> <p>I am a guilty tickler. I tickle our toddler with the love that comes from the very unlikeliness of having created a whole other human, one with their own voice and armpits. But like much of my new life, full of potential allergies and heatwaves, it often releases little bubbles of concern. Am I forcing her to laugh, is the pleasure only mine? It\u2019s no surprise that tickling has a sinister side \u2013 since we were children we\u2019ve known the torture of being caught. But this film plays it out to a painful conclusion, meaning all innocence is lost. In the film \u2013 which the company says contains numerous inaccuracies \u2013 tickling is revealed as a means of control and sadism, despite the participants\u2019 consent. The audience returns home, spoiled for ever. I haven\u2019t tickled my child since.</p> <p>Watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/no-laughing-matter-documentary-on-endurance-tickling-runs-into-legal-issues\" title=\"\">this film</a>, with its scenes of the restrained boy being videoed, its lawsuits and its use of societal homophobia as a weapon against participants, is a disquieting and frustrating experience. The worst thing though, is that watching people cracking up, even against this background of darkness and bullying, really makes you laugh. You can\u2019t help it. Like being tickled, perhaps, the danger bit of your brain clicks in and you hold your hand over your mouth and try to keep control. It\u2019s agony.</p> <p>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@EvaWiseman</a></p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s rather strange, swapping the craziness of the Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Mile at festival time for the preternatural quiet of the Scottish parliament in early August: like being thrown out of a party. But never mind. One star performer, at least, is in the vicinity, in the form of Ruth Davidson, the redoubtable leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party. Davidson has already had her break \u2013 in Spain, where she \u201cread a book a day, and drank lots of funny coloured drinks\u201d, but nevertheless checked her emails every two hours \u2013 and now she is back, bridling slightly at the very idea she might do anything other than work through the dog days of summer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a workaholic,\u201d she says, flashing me one of her startling megawatt smiles (bright as they are, they do not always connect to her eyes). \u201cPolitics is funny. It\u2019s quite a short life span. I\u2019m the third Conservative party leader [in Scotland] since devolution. The other two lasted between six and six and a half years each; I\u2019m already four and a half in. You do it at 100 miles an hour, but you don\u2019t do it for ever. You have to keep the forward momentum, or there\u2019s somebody at your heels looking for your job.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Lots of people are a bit annoyed at Sturgeon. Fair enough, she's a lifelong nationalist\u2026 but that was pretty cynical'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How far ahead can she see? \u201cWell, there are plenty of measurables: electoral cycles rather than years. We\u2019ve got lots of staging posts in Scotland. New powers in terms of taxation came in April, there\u2019ll be more next April, and more in 2018. Then there\u2019s Article 50 to be moved on Brexit, so we\u2019ve got a two-year clock on that.\u201d</p> <p>How does she feel, now, about Brexit? In particular, how does she view the current position of Scotland\u2019s first minister on it? (Nicola Sturgeon seems to be rowing back on her suggestion that Brexit increased the likelihood of another independence referendum, Scotland having voted to remain in the EU.) On the subject of the vote to leave itself, Davidson, for all that she made such a good case for Remain, is predictably bullish; 17 million people can\u2019t be ignored, and everyone must work to make best of the \u201copportunity\u201d that lies ahead. But naturally, she thinks it\u2019s wrong to suggest, as Sturgeon appeared to, that one referendum was just what she calls a \u201ccipher\u201d for the other, not least because \u2013 to take just one example \u2013 some 400,000 SNP supporters voted for Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of people, tens of thousands of them, who are actually a bit annoyed at the way in which Nicola Sturgeon has tried to use this,\u201d she says. \u201cWithin three and a half hours of the last vote being announced [after the EU referendum], <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/alex-salmond-second-scottish-independence-referendum-is-certain\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon stood up at Bute House</a> and said that she\u2019d already instructed Scottish government officials to draw up the legislation for a second independence referendum.\u201d She sniffs. \u201cI think people saw it for what it was. Fair enough, she is a lifelong nationalist. But this was the first minister of a country acting, not as a first minister, but as [first and foremost] the leader of her political party. That was pretty cynical.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cc929cd10726dba250a3e3321a1312d8539c52c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc929cd10726dba250a3e3321a1312d8539c52c/0_0_5295_3530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson, centre, with the Scottish Green party\u2019s Patrick Harvie, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon during the EU referendum campaign in Edinburgh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Davidson, centre, with the Scottish Green party\u2019s Patrick Harvie, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon during the EU referendum campaign in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Polling suggests that, post-Brexit, fewer people now want independence for Scotland. Why does Davidson think this is? \u201cPeople can see the issues Brexit raises. If you stub your toe, you don\u2019t then shoot yourself in the foot. You\u2019re not about to leave another union, which is worth four times more in terms of trade. The economic case for independence is worse now than it was a few years ago, and the case that the SNP tried to run \u2013 that you can have a big constitutional change without it having any large economic impact \u2013 has been blown out of the water. We\u2019ve just seen it with Brexit. That doesn\u2019t mean that the SNP isn\u2019t wanting to whip up nationalist fervour. But they know as well as anybody that if another referendum is held, and they lose it, then it\u2019s done. The only template we have is Quebec, where a second referendum was lost by only about a point, after which support for independence went off a cliff.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in London, there is a new prime minister to deal with \u2013 though for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t make the mistake of celebrating aloud the fact that another female politician is running things. (\u201cSome of us have been in charge for a while, and no one noticed,\u201d she says tartly, when I do this.) Davidson was a supporter of Theresa May, and knows her much better than she did David Cameron \u2013 \u201cDC\u201d, as she sometimes calls him \u2013 when she first became Scottish leader.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got, I think, a good relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cI really like her. I know her media persona is quite reserved, but she\u2019s got quite a quiet wit about her. I think she\u2019ll be a good prime minister. She takes everything very seriously, and will always do the right thing. To serve through Brexit is going to be a bloody tough shift, and I take my hat off to her that she wanted to take it on.\u201d Davidson was at No 10 the day before May became PM. \u201cI met with both the outgoing prime minister and the incoming one for some time. In between, he was giving Theresa a tour of her new flat. Yes, it felt quite historic. One of the interesting things was, knowing Theresa relatively well, I had expected that the weight of the office would make her quite tense about what was coming, as it would for any human being. But actually, this almost the most relaxed I\u2019ve seen her. There was a sense of serenity and calm about her, the idea that she knew exactly what she was going to do.\u201d</p> <p>Did she, though? What about (Leadsom! Johnson!) some of her wilder cabinet appointments? Or was that just a case of keeping your friends close, and your enemies even closer? Davidson thinks this is a mischaracterisation, one all too common in those outside the Tory party. \u201cEven using words like \u2018friends\u2019 and \u2018enemies\u2019\u2026 We all want what\u2019s best for the country. There is a sense of service and duty. We need to put in a proper shift.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dae53a2ee4c3fe5852a642806d7114b75aa18a20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae53a2ee4c3fe5852a642806d7114b75aa18a20/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davidson: \u2018I\u2019m not a shouter.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hmm. While this might well be true of May and, say, David Davis, most people would be wary of crediting Boris Johnson, the new foreign secretary, with a sense of service at this point. \u201cHe\u2019s an interesting study. I think he knows that if he\u2019s judged to be found wanting in this role, his political career is probably over. So there is a large personal as well as profession incentive for him to get his finger out.\u201d</p> <p>Will there be an early election? If I were May, in possession of a miniature majority and contemplating the omnishambles that is a Corbyn-led Labour party, I would be sorely tempted (and sod the law pertaining to fixed parliaments; that can be fixed). Davidson is \u2013 genuinely, I\u2019d say \u2013 conflicted. \u201cJohn Major came up to help during the referendum, and we had dinner, and he was talking about how draining it is to have a small majority in the Commons, how it gets you down dealing with your own side. He had a larger majority than Theresa, so I can see the temptation. She knows if people want to cause problems, they can do that quite quickly. I would like to think that the usual suspects might behave [now] in a different manner, but we shall see\u2026 However, it might be seen as opportunistic to hold a snap election less than two years after the last one. There is an aspect of her needing to get on with the job.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut I\u2019m torn. Why <em>not</em> get a mandate? Labour called for an election after she became prime minister, so they can\u2019t criticise her if that\u2019s what she does.\u201d Is she ready for an election? \u201cIf one is required, I will make sure the party\u2019s ready.\u201d Her voice is steely, completely without doubt. \u201cWe\u2019re organised. We will do well. We will increase our number of seats.\u201d</p> <p>I remember the precise moment I decided I wanted to interview Davidson. In a newspaper, I saw a photograph of her and George Osborne. They were visiting a Scottish farm, and each of them had a shovel, or perhaps a fork, in their hands, on the end of which there was balanced a mound of something brown and stinky-looking. The then chancellor was a little closer to the camera than her, and giving the world his regular wan I\u2019m-working-hard-to-keep-Britain-moving smile (an expression he usually wore with a high-vis jacket, though not on this occasion). Meanwhile, behind him, Davidson was pulling a much funnier face, her eyes wide, her grin on the edge of manic. It was like something out of a <em>Carry On</em> movie: if she wasn\u2019t sending up Osborne, then at the very least she seemed to be sending up the photo opportunity, in both the abstract and the particular. \u201cWe\u2019ve shovelled a lot worse, eh, George?\u201d someone captioned it, later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have \u2018punch the air\u2019 moments, and you have \u2018crying silently at night' moments\u2026 but you do it in your own time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was feed!\u201d she says now, in the small, sterile meeting room in which we talk. \u201cEveryone says it was shit, but it wasn\u2019t, I promise you.\u201d She laughs, wildly. When she stops, I ask if she knew she would be so good a party leader, by which I mean, mostly though not exclusively, that she somehow makes the vast majority of other politicians look even more weird and phoney than usual. \u201cWell, I\u2019m trying my hardest to be good at my job. But we\u2019re Presbyterian here. We don\u2019t talk about this sort of thing the way private schoolboys would.\u201d Until she decided to seek elected office, she worked as a journalist at the BBC. Much as she loved journalism, she was tired of being an onlooker; she wanted to be what she calls an agent of change. \u201c[I suppose] that is a type of arrogance or pride or self-regard. Whether that\u2019s an unattractive quality or not\u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> <p>OK, let\u2019s turn this around. Did she ever worry \u2013 she\u2019d only been an MSP for five seconds when she decided to throw her hat into the ring as party leader in 2011 \u2013 that she\u2019d be bad at the job?</p> <p>\u201cThere are times when you feel, oh shit, I wish I hadn\u2019t done that, and you beat yourself up about it; and there are times when you feel desperately, desperately alone because it doesn\u2019t feel like anyone\u2019s helping you with the task. You have \u2018punch the air\u2019 moments, and you have \u2018crying silently at night so as not to wake up the person next to you\u2019 moments. But I guess leadership is about doing that in your own time. It\u2019s about strength and tenacity and moral courage.\u201d</p> <p>Is she what she seems, though? How much of her jollity and relative straightforwardness is an act? \u201cI don\u2019t wear any masks. If I had, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have been able to keep them on for five years. I\u2019m in the media every day. I\u2019ve never been caught out. That tells you something. Folk aren\u2019t daft. They can tell you\u2019re not answering the question, or if you don\u2019t mean something.\u201d She says that she likes people; she enjoys talking to them. But she isn\u2019t sure about charming (my word) them. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people I\u2019ve rubbed up the wrong end, who\u2019ve felt the rough of my tongue.\u201d Has she got a temper? \u201cI\u2019m not a shouter or a thrower. I\u2019m not tossing mobile phones around as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/may/06/gordon-brown-printers\" title=\"\">previous prime ministers </a>are alleged to have done. I do quiet, steely, gimlet-eyed chat. But you know if I\u2019m fucked off with you.\u201d She looks at her aide, who is recording our encounter; he smiles, but he doesn\u2019t quite look back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a366dc1976b72103ebd348d04ba2a93a2f0f684\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a366dc1976b72103ebd348d04ba2a93a2f0f684/49_108_1493_2077/719.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson with George Osborne on the Remain campaign trail in June 2016 at a farm near Galashiels.\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Davidson with George Osborne on the Remain campaign trail in June 2016 at a farm near Galashiels: \u2018Everyone says it was shit but it wasn\u2019t, I promise!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The national press still marvels at her near unicorn-like status as a working-class, lesbian woman at the head of a bunch of Tories. (It used to go on about her passion for kickboxing, too, though she\u2019s long since given that up.) Is this irksome? It used to be. During the leadership race in 2011, she wanted very much not to be known only as the lesbian kickboxer (the other candidates were all defined by their jobs): \u201cIt seemed it was done to diminish me, and it was the only thing anyone knew about me.\u201d But when she was elected, everything changed. \u201cI got lots and lots of emails, mostly from young gay men, but from girls, too. They were really personal letters: \u2018I\u2019m not out to my parents or my school\u2019, or \u2018I am out but I found it really hard.\u2019 Some said: \u2018I always fancied politics, but I never thought I could, and it really matters to me that you got elected.\u2019\u201d This was a revelation. \u201cI\u2019d never signed up to the role model argument. If someone says I can\u2019t do something, it just makes me want to do it twice as much. I\u2019m cussed and dogged like that.\u201d</p> <p>She was touched. \u201cI made sure to reply personally, and I told them about my background, and I was really pleased that none of them ever went to the papers afterwards. After that, I promised myself that if I was ever asked [about her sexuality], I would never walk away from it. That wasn\u2019t for me. It was for other people.\u201d Does she feel good about that decision now? \u201cI do feel things have changed, though not because of me. I\u2019m 37. When I was born, homosexuality was still illegal in Scotland. Now the same couples who could have been prosecuted can get married, and we\u2019re a better country for that.\u201d (She and her partner, Jen Wilson, announced their engagement last May.) She got vile letters too, of course, and sometimes still does get abuse on Twitter, of which she is a big user: \u201cI have rules. I tend not to engage with people calling me all the bad names under the sun for party or policy or appearance or weight. But every month or so I do push back on homophobia. I do not have to take that, and nor does anyone.\u201d</p> <p>These days, then, she is more likely to be irritated by questions about her class than her sexuality (though I have to say, too, that she later pointedly refers to my voice as \u201cposh\u201d, so this cuts both ways). \u201cPeople outside Scotland think that if you come from an estate, it\u2019s either a council estate or a shooting estate,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m actually from neither of these. My parents are working-class Glaswegians, but my dad moved to the Borders [to work in a textile mill] before he had me, and when they [the mills] shut, he moved to Fife, where I lived in a normal kind of house, in a normal kind of village.\u201d Her school was in a socially disadvantaged area, and a high proportion of its students had free school meals, but her parents were keen on education: \u201cBooks were your friends. You didn\u2019t break their spines or rip their pages.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c9082e0dcb387c62af5228902c7edb980cfe606\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c9082e0dcb387c62af5228902c7edb980cfe606/0_0_3000_2009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson and partner Jen Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davidson with her partner, Jen Wilson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She had a serious accident as a small child \u2013 aged five, she was run over by a truck outside her house \u2013 and for a time, it was thought she might not survive; later, she had to learn to walk again.</p> <p>\u201cProbably, that [accounts for] part of my determination: being the only kid in primary school with a Zimmer frame.\u201d Looking back, she\u2019s amazed that she was allowed to climb trees, or play football with the boys. Given what they\u2019d been through, her parents must have longed to wrap her in cotton wool. \u201cBut what was always drummed into us [she has an older sister, who is a doctor] was that effort was more important than results. I remember one school report. I got a two for science for effort, and a one for my results, which was the best you could get, and I got a mini bollocking for that. My mum would have been much happier if it had been the other way round.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents were thrilled when she got a place to read English at Edinburgh university, and equally delighted when, having begun her career on local newspapers, she ended up at the BBC. But they were perhaps rather less pleased when she announced she was jacking in her job and the pension that went with it to try to get elected as a Tory, and in Glasgow of all places (she now represents Edinburgh Central).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She is a capable, competent, principled woman and I believe that respect is reciprocated. But we don\u2019t go out for pizza</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fault their logic,\u201d she says. It wasn\u2019t easy for her mother to see the word \u201clesbian\u201d in the headlines, though she\u2019d come out in her 20s (she won\u2019t say how her parents\u2019 received this news). \u201cI\u2019ve had to say on the phone to them: \u2018Please don\u2019t write to the <em>Herald</em>, Dad. I can fight my own battles.\u2019\u201d Davidson, however, knew that politics was her future, at least in the sense that she knew a referendum on independence was coming, and that she would have found it unendurable to stay silent as the future of her country was debated. I suppose this is another way in which she is a role model: she wasn\u2019t old when she went into politics, but nor had she devoted her 20s to it. \u201cI don\u2019t know how people like Charles Kennedy did it,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing elected at 21. How do you talk to someone about their housing benefit or school places when you\u2019re 21?\u201d For anybody reading this, she would like it to be known that \u201cthere is no law that says you have to be a bag carrier or special adviser [to go into politics], and people will think a lot more of you if you\u2019re not\u201d. Ambition didn\u2019t come into it. \u201cIf it had been about personal ambition, there was a really strong argument that said: don\u2019t try and lead a party that doesn\u2019t want you as leader; spend some time on the back benches.\u201d</p> <p>What about now? Is she ambitious \u2013 or, at any rate, woman enough to admit she is? (Men, as I tell her, seem to have no problem at all with the A-word.) \u201cThere are things I want to do.\u201d What things? Does she want to be prime minister, a job for which she was once tipped by the great sh\u2014, sorry, feed shoveller himself, George Osborne?</p> <p>\u201c<em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> is on the list,\u201d she says, confessing her deep envy of Ed Balls, one of this year\u2019s contestants. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to stop following me on Twitter once <em>Strictly</em> starts.\u201d But that\u2019s for the distant future, when \u2013 if \u2013 she\u2019s defenestrated. \u201cPeople keep asking me: do I want to go to Westminster? As if to say: why on earth would you want to stay in your <em>home</em>?\u201d So what, then, if not Westminster? At which point, it dawns on me. Does she want to be Scotland\u2019s first minister?</p> <p>\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t that outlandish?\u201d Actually, it is. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it will happen in five years. But I have more MSPs sitting behind me now [she has 31 to the SNP\u2019s 63, and Scottish Labour\u2019s 23] than the SNP had in 2003 [they then had 27] \u2013 and they became the government in 2007.\u201d She meets my eye, and holds it, as if daring me to laugh.</p> <p>How does she get on with the current first minister? Invited to so many of the same events, they see each other often. \u201cThere\u2019s always that opportunity to have a quiet word away from the cameras. I think she is a capable, competent woman who acts on the principles she holds, and who is a better leader than Alex Salmond, and I believe that respect is reciprocated. But we don\u2019t go out for pizza and beer; I\u2019m not round Bute House for tea, and nor do I want to be.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/22/ruth-davidson-not-your-typical-tory-video-profile\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4mfdj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2570095\"            data-video-name=\"Ruth Davidson: why she's 'not your typical Tory' \u2013 video profile\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-576aaa92e4b030d83eb49657\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/22/ruth-davidson-not-your-typical-tory-video-profile\">Ruth Davidson: why she\u2019s \u2018not your typical Tory\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Does she think women do things differently, or is that a sexist assumption? \u201cI think it would be nice if we got to the point where people stopped noticing and remarking on [the fact that] a woman has got a job.

We self-censure because it would put us all back, it would diminish who we are.\u201d Of course she\u2019s a feminist: \u201cThat just means believing that women can do everything men can but backwards in heels with a cherry on top.

  "<p>A central plank of the government\u2019s commitment to overhaul the criminal justice system has been postponed by the new justice secretary, Liz Truss, amid concerns that it would be seen as too soft on offenders.</p> <p>US-style \u201cproblem-solving\u201d courts, in which judges review the progress of convicted offenders to ensure that they comply with their rehabilitation programme in return for staying out of prison, were championed by the former justice secretary, Michael Gove.</p> <p>The initiative was hailed by prison reform groups as a sign that the government was committed to finding alternatives to locking up offenders and to ending stubbornly high recidivism rates. The courts, which tend to specialise in handling cases involving drug or alcohol addiction, hand down non-custodial punishments. They focus on identifying and dealing with an offender\u2019s underlying problems in a bid to prevent them reoffending. Those who fail to engage with rehabilitation efforts can then be sent to prison.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/21/new-york-problem-solving-courts-england-wales\" title=\"\">initiative was unveiled in May</a>, justice minister Caroline Dinenage said she hoped it would provide an alternative to prison for female offenders, who are considered to be particularly at risk behind bars. Gove was impressed by their impact on rehabilitation rates after a fact-finding mission to Texas last year. A pilot programme involving several courts was under development and is due to be formally launched later this year.</p> <p>But it is believed that Truss does not consider the initiative a priority. An internal email sent to key members of the criminal justice system by the Ministry of Justice on Friday is understood to spell out her commitment to other prison reform programmes. While key staff involved in the project have been told the initiative could still happen, MoJ insiders suggest it is effectively being abandoned.</p> <p>One insider speculated: \u201cIt appears that Liz Truss is sceptical. It looks too much like being nice to criminals and one of Michael Gove\u2019s \u2018lovely ideas\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Summerskill, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance, a coalition of 110 organisations committed to improving the criminal justice system, was dismayed by the decision. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s terribly sad that this element of the government\u2019s much-welcomed criminal justice reform agenda is being sidelined.

  "<p>Stefanie Posavec had quite a week. She said \u201cfuck\u201d 66 times, \u201casshole\u201d 12 times and let rip with \u201cshit\u201d on no fewer than 13 occasions. Not that I was counting. She was. And what\u2019s more, she plotted it on a postcard for all the world to see.</p> <p>Part of a project called <a href=\"http://www.dear-data.com/\">Dear Data</a>, the postcard is one of 104 sent between Posavec and fellow designer Giorgia Lupi over the course of a year, each mailing one a week. The aim, they tell me, was to explore whether it was possible to get to know someone through data alone.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know each other; before starting Dear Data we only met twice,\u201d says Lupi. While the pair were aware of each other\u2019s professional work, it was a chance meeting at a data and media art festival in Minneapolis in 2013 that threw them together. And it turned out that Lupi, an Italian living in New York, and Posavec, an American living in London, had plenty in common, besides their love of hand-crafted, information-based design. \u201cWe both switched continents, we are the same age [35] and we are both only children who have travelled far away from our families,\u201d says Lupi.</p> <p>The upshot, after a second meeting the following year, was an experiment: could they get to know each other by number-crunching their lives, one topic per week, with only a handful of coloured pens to bring their data to life?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"469a9355446817492c6d2be653bd7ea07b0ce464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/469a9355446817492c6d2be653bd7ea07b0ce464/109_262_2080_2754/755.jpg\" alt=\"Week 47, Lupi to Posavec on the theme of smells\u2026\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Week 47, Lupi to Posavec on the theme of smells\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giorgia Lupi/Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBoth the data collection and the way we decided to display<strong> </strong>the data reveal something about our personalities,\u201d says Lupi, adding that the data collection was largely made by quick jottings on paper or smartphone, with the exception of one week, in which the pair used an app to track their movements. \u201c[Using the app], it felt like we weren\u2019t really in control of our data, and that we weren\u2019t really engaging with it, so after that point we said, \u2018Let\u2019s focus on data that an app can\u2019t gather yet,\u2019\u201d says Posavec.</p> <p>Their obsession with collecting information seems almost de rigueur. The boom of big data, and the technology that makes its collection and analysis possible, has brought with it a global fascination with tracking every step, snooze and calorie. More broadly, every newspaper, advertising agency and campaign group appears to have embraced the trend for sleek graphics and ingenious visuals, while no app would be complete without a thumbnail chart to scrutinise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2014/sep/10/best-infographic-graphic-design\">The best of infographics: designers pick their favourites</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So it seems surprising that Lupi and Posavec have thumbed their noses at such digital sophistication. The data collection, they admit, was sometimes imperfect. It\u2019s depiction \u2013 using a ruler, pens and pencils \u2013 is amusing, even innocent.</p> <p>But, says Posavec, it has a point. It takes hours to make each postcard, hours that invite reflection. \u201cIt helps us better understand and be closer to the subject matter that we are dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>A look at the postcards, now collected in a book, also named <em>Dear Data</em>, and there\u2019s no mistaking Lupi and Posavec\u2019s different styles. While each week the pair agreed on a topic, ranging from the wildlife they had spotted to the scents they had noticed, the data they gathered and their colourful depictions of it are vastly different.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07a729777b5a22e1e626f112c4ac98d81330dee0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a729777b5a22e1e626f112c4ac98d81330dee0/103_278_2100_2734/768.jpg\" alt=\"Week 38, Lupi to Posavec on the theme of negative feelings\u2026\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Week 38, Lupi to Posavec on the theme of negative feelings\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giorgia Lupi/Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lupi\u2019s postcards are almost forensic: swaths of data encoded in painstakingly hand-drawn devices. In week 32 of the project, she charted the different noises she heard, each sound represented by a note bearing a different symbol, drawn on a colour-coded stave corresponding to where it was heard, with the length of each note relating to the prevalence of the sound. Posavec, by contrast, favours a looser, more intuitive approach \u2013 her postcard for week 32 boasts brightly coloured rectangles stacked up to chart the sounds she heard against the time of day in which she heard them.</p> <p>Both are mind-boggling intricate. The keys to each chart are minute, cypher-like instructions, peppered with anecdotes and asides. \u201cSorry mom and dad! Your daughter swears like a sailor,\u201d Posavec scribbled on the back of week 37, the week of the bad-language count, next to a colour-coded chart indicating whether each curse was in jest or not and exactly what had provoked it.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes time, both to crack a postcard like that and also to read a postcard like that, but I like to say that it was our way of spending time together,\u201d says Lupi. The postcards themselves, she adds, not only reveal something about the other person, but also foster a more conventional approach to friendship. \u201cWe would look at each other\u2019s postcards and then message the other person with questions about the data,\u201d adds Posavec \u201cThe entire year functions like a self-portrait of each of us, but it is a starting point to know more about each other.\u201d</p> <p>Not that the project was without its challenges.</p> <p>\u201cIt really forced both of us to invent new visual models and to extend ourselves as designers,\u201d says Lupi, confessing that on one occasion she spent seven hours creating her postcard for the week, drawing more than 700 tiny rectangles depicting the doors she\u2019d opened that week.</p> <p>Posavec agrees. \u201cA lot of information is meant to be crammed in there, it\u2019s meant to be really rich,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Dedicate the time and the information encoded in Lupi and Posavec\u2019s postcards is not only revealing, but poignant. As well as choosing topics around items, such as the contents of their wardrobes or the number of drinks they\u2019d had that week, the pair also scrutinised their behaviour. Week 38 threw the spotlight on negative thoughts.</p> <p>\u201c[That] was really challenging for me, because a lot of time I would feel a negative thought, something that wasn\u2019t quite OK, coming through my mind, but I wasn\u2019t really able to grasp it and to categorise it right away. Was it fear? Was it anxiety? Was it sadness?\u201d asks Lupi. \u201cIt really helped me spending a little time with these negative thoughts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0aaee9e5e07425b41633f7a11e497f457ea9ac8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0aaee9e5e07425b41633f7a11e497f457ea9ac8b/245_182_2037_2906/701.jpg\" alt=\"Week 26, Posavec to Lupi on the theme of workspaces\u2026\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Week 26, Posavec to Lupi on the theme of workspaces\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefanie Posavec/Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a week that also hit home for Posavec. \u201cI realised I had more negative thoughts about myself than about anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause, gathering data, you need to be as honest as possible \u2013 it forces you to look at the data and confront that as part of yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Other weeks were rather more experimental. \u201cWe started to gather data on something in order to force us to change our behaviour,\u201d says Posavec. The challenge? See how many times you can smile at strangers. \u201cI really hated that week \u2013 I hate smiling at people in London,\u201d she admits.</p> <p>She\u2019s not kidding. Looking up her postcard, I discover the last day of the week is shaded out. The key tells all. \u201cStopped smiling in protest to assholes!\u201d it says. \u201cI kind of went on strike,\u201d Posavec admits. But, she says, the experience was formative, too. \u201c[Following the experiment] I do actually try to smile more at people that I interact with.\u201d</p> <p>But is there not a hitch? Gathering, displaying and exchanging all this data may be fascinating, but releasing it in exhibitions and, now, a book seems a breach of everyday privacy. Did the pair have any qualms?</p> <p>Posavec says not. \u201cI thought as long as I am OK and I give permission for people to look at my data, then that is fine.\u201d</p> <p>Lupi, too, is relaxed about the idea. \u201cWe have never been scared of sharing with the other person \u2013 or with the world \u2013 our flaws, our obsessions, our bad habits in the form of data,\u201d she says, adding that revealing such matters not only helps when it comes to tackling those habits, but also helps others to relate to the work. \u201cThere is nothing shameful in admitting that I\u2019m envious of native English speakers, or of people who are more charming than I am, or that I have negative thoughts about the fact that I feel I\u2019m not enough \u2013 that is something that is part of me and it is good to put it out in the world,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While the year of Dear Data is over, its impact, says Lupi, is lasting. \u201cI feel so much more aware of what\u2019s happening around me,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to say that data collection can be a form of meditation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"871b4702023a6df919b67c03eda6fa2fe910660f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/871b4702023a6df919b67c03eda6fa2fe910660f/265_189_2020_2890/699.jpg\" alt=\"Week 43, Posavec to Lupi on the theme of breaking routine\u2026\" width=\"699\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Week 43, Posavec to Lupi on the theme of breaking routine\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefanie Posavec/Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Posavec hopes the project will also have a wider impact on the way we all view data. \u201cData doesn\u2019t need to be intimidating \u2013 there can be a human side to it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a fancy programme to work with it \u2013 you just need a pencil.\u201d</p> <p>But the question remains, did the two become closer from sharing data?</p> <p>\u201cI would say we are really close friends,\u201d says Posavec. \u201cI talk about things with her that I don\u2019t talk about with a lot of friends.\u201d</p> <p>She says the project has not only brought them closer but enabled them to examine each other\u2019s lives in new ways.</p> <p>\u201cI feel really lucky.

The modestly sized kitchen in the couple\u2019s flat in a purpose-built mansion block in Hackney has the smallest patch of workspace. But every shelf and cupboard is crammed with herbs, spices, and obscure condiments from around the world. There\u2019s banana ketchup from the Philippines; clam juice picked up in New York; packs of tiny marshmallows; yuzu; vermicelli noodles; chapatti flour; smoked garlic powder; vinegars; oils. This is Zee\u2019s culinary playground, where he begins his mornings at 6am, preparing a different dish each day.</p> <p>The couple have been together since March 2012. \u201cWe met in a club in City Road and I took Mark home straight away,\u201d says Zee.

I had just been to Holland and thought I\u2019d make him Dutch pancakes.\u201d</p> <p>Van Beek says it was \u201creally surreal\u201d. \u201cNormally when you meet someone, the first morning it\u2019s bye and out of the house. Or there\u2019s no food in the fridge.\u201d</p> <p>The following April they moved in together. Van Beek was working for Burberry designing the menswear collections. For six weeks, twice a year, Zee would hardly see him as he would work till two or three every morning in the lead-up to the catwalk show. So he started to make special breakfasts as it was their one opportunity to see each other before they both left for work. Friends would comment on the Instagram posts of their breakfast ritual so Zee started SymmetryBreakfast as a project. Three years and 600k followers later, Zee has quit his job as an education officer at the V&amp;A and his first book, <em>SymmetryBreakfast: </em><em>Cook Love Share</em> was published this month.</p> <p>But in true Zee style, this is not just a cookery book, it is a proposal of marriage. He has dedicated the book to his partner: \u201cMark without you there would be no symmetry, no one to make breakfast for and no reason to get out of bed. You are my best friend, my love. Will you marry me?\u201d he writes.</p> <p>You may be relieved to know he was planning to share the proposal with Van Beek before the book launch \u2013 but no doubt they will be sharing their wedding breakfast some time soon.</p> <h2>Shengjian mantou Shanghainese breakfast dumplings</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc9cb83fcd8064e380d29eae6681a105c3729098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc9cb83fcd8064e380d29eae6681a105c3729098/0_0_2126_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shanghainese breakfast dumplings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shanghainese breakfast dumplings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: symmetry breakfast</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I was a child, at weekends I would go into Liverpool city centre with my family. On Seel Street was a small Chinese bookshop that, surprisingly, sold steamed bao buns. Try doing that in Waterstones. I vividly remember the glass cabinets and huge steamers full of them. Sadly, all traces of the shop are now gone but for me it began a love affair with the bao bun that has never faded.</p> <p>Shengjian buns are a typical Shanghainese breakfast. You\u2019ll typically get four in a portion, thrown into a plastic bag on the go before work or school starts, to get you through the day.</p> <p>Makes 8 big buns</p> <p>For the filling<br><strong>shiitake mushrooms</strong> 3 dried<br><strong>Chinese leaf cabbage</strong> 100g (about 2 leaves)<br><strong>salt</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>pork mince</strong> 200g<br><strong>spring onion</strong> 100g, finely chopped<br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, minced<br><strong>cornflour</strong> 2 tsp<br><strong>Chinese rice wine</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>sesame oil</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>water</strong> 50ml<br><strong>light soy sauce</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>white pepper</strong> \u00bd tsp</p> <p>For the dough<br><strong>milk</strong> 125ml<br><strong>sugar</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>dried yeast</strong> 7g<br><strong>plain flour</strong> 200g<br><strong>cornflour</strong> 2 heaped tbsp<br><strong>baking powder</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>sunflower oil</strong> 2 tbsp</p> <p><strong>oil </strong>4 tbsp, for frying</p> <p>For the filling, soak the dried shiitake mushrooms in boiling water for 5 minutes until plump. Drain the liquid and chop finely.</p> <p>Finely shred the cabbage leaves and place them in a bowl. Sprinkle the salt over them and toss with your hands for one minute. Leave to stand for 15 minutes, then give them a good squeeze and drain off the excess water.</p> <p>Place the pork, cabbage, spring onion and garlic in a large bowl. Make your hand into a claw shape and, with a circular motion, stir everything together. Dissolve the cornflour with the rice wine and add, along with the oil, water, soy sauce, white pepper and chopped mushrooms, to the pork mix. Combine thoroughly (with the same claw) and set aside. You can prepare this a day ahead if you prefer.</p> <p>Moving on to the dough, warm the milk, ideally to 37C (99F), and add the sugar and yeast. Give it a stir and set aside for 10 minutes to become bubbly.</p> <p>Sieve the flour, cornflour and baking powder together into a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and add the yeast mix and 2 tbsp oil. Bring it together into a dough and knead until it is smooth. Depending on how strong you are, this could be 5-10 minutes. Leave the dough to rest for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Turn the dough out on to a clean surface and roll it into a sausage shape, 30cm long. Cut the dough into 8 even pieces and roll each into a smooth ball. Take one at a time and, using a rolling pin, flatten it into a circle 10\u201312cm across.</p> <p>Place 2\u20133 teaspoons of the pork filling in the centre of the dough and bring up the sides, pinching at the top to seal the dumpling tightly.</p> <p>If you\u2019re looking for inspiration, there are some fascinating videos on YouTube on all the different ways they can be sealed. Cover with a tea towel to rest for 10 minutes as you complete the remaining tasks.*</p> <p>Heat 4 tbsp of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Put the kettle on too. Place as many buns as you can fit into the pan without overcrowding and fry them for 3 minutes. Be careful that the heat isn\u2019t too high; it\u2019s better to take your time than to burn them.</p> <p>Pour 100ml of freshly boiled water over the buns and cover with a lid. Check after 5 minutes, then, once the water has been completely absorbed, remove the lid and cook for a further 3 minutes. Your dumplings should look fluffy white on top and dark golden brown underneath.</p> <p>Serve immediately with black rice vinegar, chopped spring onion and a cup of something like an oolong or a smoky lapsang souchong.</p> <p>*At this point you can freeze the buns \u2013 they won\u2019t take any longer to cook from frozen, either. Place them on a tray or plate lined with baking parchment with space between them, dust with some flour and freeze them. You should eat them within a fortnight.</p> <h2>Dutch puff</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48458c4ce79248bcd31d263116990f262202e2cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48458c4ce79248bcd31d263116990f262202e2cf/0_0_2126_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dutch puff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dutch puff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: symmetry breakfast</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mark finds the name of this pancake incredibly confusing.

A latterday bout of relative productivity has made the famously hermetic auteur\u2019s films seem less special, but that\u2019s a generous excuse to make for the dispiriting vacuity of <strong>Knight of Cups </strong>(Studiocanal, 15), the most actively esoteric but least soulful of his signature tone poems.</p> <p>Starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/christianbale\">Christian Bale</a> as a disaffected comic screenwriter \u2013 perhaps a rare glimmer of self-irony on Malick\u2019s part \u2013 wandering LA and Vegas in search of solace/inspiration/sex, the film applies a po-faced, tarot-reading structure to his metaphysical trials and personal entanglements.</p> <p>So far, so Malick; his finest work attains enough aesthetic and spiritual grace to justify its affected romanticism. In this case, the film\u2019s awed, whispery styling and ornate water lily structure succeed only in scribbling surface complications on a protagonist with no distinct inner life.

A summary-resistant, reach-for-the-sky work, it interweaves, with improbable elegance, a naturalist\u2019s study of the country\u2019s shimmering waterscapes, an anthropological history of the threatened indigenous peoples who subsisted on them and a burning political screed against the human rights abuses of Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship, many of whose victims were brutally consigned to the water.

Using the 1967 cartoon as its template more than Kipling\u2019s source tale (down to awkwardly incorporated updates of those infectious songs), the film goes all out to trump its predecessor for spectacle.

I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be the only one.</p> <p>\u201cWith all the things he will go on to do, I am very keen for him to carve out some space to help us develop the sport, and not only in an ambassadorial role.

That\u2019s the triple treble \u2013 100m, 200m and 4x100m in three successive Games \u2013 and, he says, the end of his Olympic career.</p> <p>A special note for pedantic readers (you\u2019re my favourites) \u2013 you\u2019ll see a lot of \u201ctriple triple\u201ds flying about, but I\u2019m sticking with \u201ctriple treble\u201d and the man himself confirms it:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/usainbolt/status/766815915291717633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Triple Treble&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/u2aOqaQC8y\">https://t.co/u2aOqaQC8y</a></p>&mdash; Usain St. Leo Bolt (@usainbolt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/usainbolt/status/766815915291717633\">August 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Japan\u2019s men zoomed into a surprising second place in that men\u2019s 4x100m, but the relays were dotted with disqualifications.

  "<p>Almost two months after the Brexit vote, Britain\u2019s economy remains in rude health. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\" title=\"\">Unemployment is at its lowest for 10 years</a>, inflation remains low and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\" title=\"\">consumer spending in July was strong</a>.</p> <p>The doom-mongers who predicted a panic in the aftermath of the referendum were wrong. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/16/uk-house-price-average-rose-17000-year-june-ons-figures-show\" title=\"\">house prices have continued to rise</a>, unaffected by the prospect of the UK being outside the EU in a couple of years\u2019 time.</p> <p>This is one way of looking at the recent economic data. Another is to point out that had Mark Carney and the Bank of England not recognised the danger signs, Britain would have been in dire trouble.</p> <p>Bank officials read the economic tea leaves and agreed that a shot of adrenaline was needed. Without extra monetary stimulus, redundancies were inevitable, the pound would tumble to parity with the dollar, sending inflation spiralling upwards, and investment was likely to plunge. House prices might have dropped by 20%, as the Treasury famously predicted, with wages slumping instead of rising sightly.</p> <p>Carney, a safe pair of hands as goalkeeper in his student ice hockey days, has become the ultimate economic backstop.</p> <p>Brexiters brush aside the counter-factual arguments, saying that the Bank\u2019s stimulus plan, which included a cut in interest rates and pumping and extra \u00a370bn into the economy, played second fiddle to the wisdom of the UK household, which has turned out to be more self-confident and far-sighted than City economists had assumed. Consumer confidence surveys were another plank of support for this view, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\" title=\"\">recording a rise this month</a> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/uk-sees-biggest-fall-in-consumer-confidence-for-26-years-after-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">plummeting earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>But what is more likely is that consumers were in a genuine panic until they heard that their central bank was priming its big guns. Soon after, though, they noticed the letter from their mortgage company highlighting the effect of the Carney interest rate cut on their monthly bills and felt much better about the world. Almost all economic activity these days seems to be predicated on zero interest rates, easy access to cheap credit and the Bank\u2019s promise that it will do anything to maintain growth.</p> <p>But next year could bring further trouble. Once Article 50 is triggered and the debate about our relationship with the EU begins in earnest, concerns about trading outside the free market will resurface.</p> <p>City economists have predicted a 350,000 increase in unemployment over the next four years and a growth rate consistently below 2% over the same period. We know this because the Treasury published its review of economic forecasts by the City\u2019s major banks. Investment, the lifeblood for improvements to productivity and higher wages, is expected to leach away, and not just to the EU.</p> <p>Why, finance companies will ask themselves, should they stay in a post-Brexit London when they could be in Singapore or Hong Kong? Likewise, Ford and other manufacturers will accelerate the process \u2013 under way for years now \u2013 of taking their factories to the more compliant, low-cost destinations such as Turkey.</p> <p>Unable to attract investment on the basis of being connected umbilically to the EU in key areas such as carmaking, pharmaceuticals and creative digital industries, the government will turn to tax cuts and other incentives that will undermine its ability to fund welfare, healthcare and education.</p> <p>Donald Trump is considered by many to be the biggest threat to the global economy. This threat remains theoretical and, if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-campaign-terrible-week-paul-ryan-khan\" title=\"\">latest polls</a> are to be believed, unlikely. Brexit is just around the corner and involves the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy leaving the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. Such a seismic event cannot avoid creating a shock and some painful after-effects.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope Theresa May is as good as her word and provides a clear plan of industrial support to mitigate the worst effects of leaving the EU. Without that, Carney may be called upon to give an ailing economy another stimulus shot.</p> <h2>At last, a real tax evasion crackdown</h2> <p>\u2018\u2018We need to talk about tax,\u201d said Theresa May when making her pitch for Conservative leader. She promised a crackdown on both avoidance and evasion. Empty words? It seems not. Last week the Treasury published an eye-catching proposal to fine the enablers of tax avoidance. Accountants, solicitors, banks and financial advisers whose tax schemes are successfully challenged by HMRC could find themselves paying the equivalent of 100% of the tax owed.</p> <p>Pressure groups have been arguing for such a measure for years, as a deterrent to those who dream up schemes and collect the fees, while their clients pick up the tab from the tax office.</p> <p>The big four accountancy firms will have little incentive to remain in the game of advising on avoidance. Smaller outfits may move offshore. Which brings us to another key piece of legislation, proposed but not yet passed.</p> <p>Last March, following revelations of HSBC helping clients hide money in Switzerland, George Osborne suggested a corporate offence of failure to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion \u2013 designed to tackle the difficulty in holding companies liable for the acts of their employees.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t really aimed at banks, though. After crackdowns by US and German regulators, attention has shifted to a lesser-known but growing sector \u2013 trust companies. They help set up the structures,and provide nominees who act as directors, shareholders or trustees, so the real owners can remain out of sight. As we learned from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a>, these services are popular \u2013 and lucrative. In 2012, private equity group Blackstone bought one such operator, Intertrust, for \u20ac675m. It floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange for \u20ac1.3bn last year.</p> <p>The mere threat of corporate liability is already having the desired effect. Reports suggest trust companies, many of which have UK offices, are combing their books for likely evaders. The government should pass both pieces of enabler legislation without delay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d45c290e733a43c8d184facf1a191110398fc40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d45c290e733a43c8d184facf1a191110398fc40/0_10_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rail ticket prices in Britain are just going to keep rising.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rail ticket prices in Britain are just going to keep rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>On the up and up: rail fares<br></h2> <p>Last week saw the annual rail fares revolt, as news that season ticket prices will rise by 1.9% was met with outrage from commuters, green campaigners and trade unions. Passengers, in particular, have a point. They provide the bulk of the industry\u2019s income now \u2013 \u00a38.8bn, compared with \u00a33.5bn from the state \u2013 but the railways cannot afford a fairer deal.</p> <p>Last year, the industry\u2019s costs rose 7% to \u00a3900m, outstripping the latest fare increase. The government, which sets the caps on fares, is thus unlikely to come to passengers\u2019 aid. The answer is not nationalisation of rail franchises, because the most expensive bit, tracks and stations, is already state-owned through Network Rail. The answer is lower costs. And that means building better relations with trade unions and reducing profligacy at Network Rail. In the meantime, there is no light at the end of the tunnel for commuters.</p> <h2>Sugar tax policy leaves a bad taste</h2> <p>The government\u2019s sugar tax and childhood obesity strategy has received a mixed reaction. Health experts believe it does not go far enough, while soft-drink makers believe the tax will simply hurt consumers and businesses rather than lower obesity levels.</p> <p>Targeting soft drinks when fruit juice, smoothies and coffees are all loaded with sugar is a mistake, they say.</p> <p>The most important reaction, however, was from supermarkets. They criticised the government\u2019s watered-down obesity strategy, saying that mandatory cuts to sugar levels in food were needed to ensure a level playing field and ensure genuine change.</p> <p>The supermarkets are often criticised for two-for-one promotions and selling snacks at the till, but they are correct here.</p> <p>The only way to make change happen quickly and effectively is for the government to step in. When it has done so previously, such as by pushing brands, shops and restaurants to publish nutritional information on their packaging, companies have stepped up to the mark.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the government has left its childhood obesity strategy vulnerable to the vagaries of capitalism and the free market. Even if responsible companies do take action, others may not, and so responsible companies will pay the price.</p>",
  "<p>You can record your heart rate manually by holding your wrist and counting your pulse, but this hasn\u2019t stopped technology companies producing devices to do the job with electronics. Most of these devices collect heart data all day long and record it on a smartphone app which builds up a richer set of data than you might get with a stopwatch and pencil. One of the most useful metrics they collect is your RHR (resting heart rate) a reading taken when you are relaxed, most typically first thing in the morning. In most cases a low RHR indicates a strong, healthy heart which has to beat fewer times to circulate blood around the body. However in older people a low RHR might indicate diseased heart muscle or overmedication. Some day-to-day variation in your RHR (or indeed in many of the metrics these devices measure) isn\u2019t something to be worried about, explains Dr Satpal Arri of the British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, King\u2019s College London, \u201cA certain amount of variability is normal, healthy in fact \u2013 as you get older variability tends to decrease.\u201d So by all means listen to your heart, but don\u2019t become obsessed.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/sports-recreation/running/forerunner-735xt/prod541225.html\"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 735XT</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Measures: RHR, HR, recovery time, V02 max, movement, sleep; \u00a3359</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3200135a914f632518c7da990ad9fbe6b9f3e69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3200135a914f632518c7da990ad9fbe6b9f3e69/0_339_7142_4286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin Forerunner 735XT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All photos by Linda Nylind for the Guardian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b2eb79416f5685a53eeb54ba9155fb6ef6eba1f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2eb79416f5685a53eeb54ba9155fb6ef6eba1f5/0_0_750_1334/562.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin heart rate app\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Data from the Garmin Forerunner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Garmin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garmin\u2019s latest exercise tracking watch records your runs, rides, steps and swims using GPS or an accelerator. The rear of the watch features an optical sensor that uses a light to measure blood flow, which is processed by an algorithm to create HR data. The watch displays HR and RHR but these are better displayed on Garmin\u2019s Connect smartphone app where you can see historical data. The watch also had a recovery adviser feature, which advises you how many hours you should wait before exercising again \u2013 for running the times seemed consistent but for cycling I found them to be a little haphazard \u2013 the software company says that power meter data is required for an accurate result. When running, the watch will also produce a V02 max (the maximum value of oxygen you can use) score, which they claim is 95% accurate when compared to lab tests. You\u2019ll need to purchase a power meter to generate a cycling V02 max figure.</p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> You need to wear the watch day and night to get an accurate RHR reading. Wearing it on and off, or only using it when exercising, will affect the averages the software calculates. For example, my RHR for one month when I only wore the watch on a couple of occasions was 10bpm, whereas days when I only wore it while running or cycling would push the average into the 60s. It\u2019s surprising that the algorithm can\u2019t recognise and remove these biases.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This is a powerful tool for tracking and improving your sporting performance \u2013 probably the best sports watch on the market \u2013 but for simple monitoring of your RHR you might be better off using a smartphone app such as <a href=\"http://www.azumio.com/s/instantheartrate/index.html\">Instant Heart Rate</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/uk/surge\"><strong>FitBit Surge</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Measures: RHR, HR, movement, sleep; \u00a3199</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e26baf31d36939984a33eca5e9fbf15db334aa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e26baf31d36939984a33eca5e9fbf15db334aa0/1279_807_4406_2643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FitBit Surge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cdc17b51f8bb802a66b9e432b027fa1abeab6075\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdc17b51f8bb802a66b9e432b027fa1abeab6075/0_0_750_1334/562.jpg\" alt=\"FitBit heart rate App\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The FitBit Surge app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FitBit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much like the Garmin, this unit will track exercise and steps, and collects HR data using an optical sensor. The interface is a little confusing, requiring a mix of buttons, presses and touchscreen swipes to operate it. The rubber wristband tended to cut into my wrist and felt sweaty.</p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Worn side by side, the FitBit and the Garmin record the same HR. However, the Surge\u2019s software does more to remove outliers when calculating a RHR \u2013 mine rarely varied by more than a BPM each day. That said, if you don\u2019t wear the watch the app will tell you that your RHR is the same as the last time you were wearing it \u2013 a big assumption. The app itself is easy to navigate and visualises your data clearly.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If you\u2019re mainly interested in monitoring your general health, ie your RHR, sleep and a bit of exercise, this is a good choice.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.withings.com/uk/en/products/body-cardio\"><strong>Withings Body Cardio Scale</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Measures: HR, pulse rate velocity, weight, fat mass, bone mass, muscle mass, water; \u00a3149</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93658d1c059c5fee9f22beb21989409ce1b2f37b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93658d1c059c5fee9f22beb21989409ce1b2f37b/0_282_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Withings Body Cardio Scale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"62fca1e304adeb2611a47d06e22beb7d8c09683b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62fca1e304adeb2611a47d06e22beb7d8c09683b/0_0_750_1334/562.jpg\" alt=\"Withings pulse wave velocity heart rate App\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Data from the Withings Body Cardio Scale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Withings</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This wireless-connected scale generates a slew of data to pore over. Integrating it into your morning routine is pretty simple \u2013 just stand on it for few seconds. The scale sends a small electrical current through the body, measures impedance and then, using sophisticated algorithms, generates body fat percentage, muscle mass and so on. The measurements are displayed briefly on the scale itself and then turned into graphs and the like on Withings Health Mate app.</p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> It\u2019s moot how useful the HR data collected by the scale is. A reading taken while standing isn\u2019t a RHR; anything you do between your bed and the scale, such as a bathroom visit, taking a shower, walking up stairs or even talking, will influence your HR. However, the scale\u2019s USP is that it takes a reading of your pulse wave velocity \u2013 a measure of how quickly blood is travelling along your arteries, and therefore how stiff or supple they are. A reading over 10 is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.</p> <p>\u201cPWV is a research tool, but not normally something we would measure in routine practice. However, it is a validated measure of risk,\u201d says Arri.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If you\u2019re looking for a device to monitor your cardiovascular health, you\u2019re probably better using this in combination with a blood pressure monitor or a device that measures your RHR.</p> <p>Read an in-depth of the Body Cardio <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/10/withings-body-cardio-review-stylish-scales-health-obsessives\">here</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.withings.com/uk/en/products/blood-pressure-monitor\"><strong>Withings Blood Pressure Monitor</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Measures: blood pressure, HR; \u00a3109</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1034da8d9e2a9ee17db9d5940dd51ba7a613d90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1034da8d9e2a9ee17db9d5940dd51ba7a613d90/0_265_6684_4011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Withings Blood Pressure Monitor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"20d078a18bca0d46efeec6fadc10addc9e4ce19a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20d078a18bca0d46efeec6fadc10addc9e4ce19a/0_0_750_1334/562.jpg\" alt=\"Withings Blood Pressure heart rate app\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Withings Blood Pressure Monitor app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Withings</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Easily the coolest looking blood pressure monitor you can own.

  "<p><strong>I thought I was dumb </strong>because I didn\u2019t go to college. I felt if you didn\u2019t have a degree you\u2019d never be respected or considered intelligent. Now I realise I\u2019m perfectly capable of doing lots of things.</p> <p><strong>My parents had me young</strong>. They were 18 and 19 and always really fun. My dad was in the military \u2013 we used to get up at 5am and he would eat kids\u2019 cereal and watch cartoons with my younger brother and I while ironing his clothes in just his underwear. They lived paycheck to paycheck, which made me never want to struggle.</p> <p><strong>Success in entertainment </strong>used to be purely financial for me. Once I was in my mid-20s and had achieved some degree of security, I started looking for something more substantive to focus on. Then when I got pregnant a few years later, I came up with the idea for my company [natural beauty line <a href=\"https://www.honest.com/\" title=\"\">The Honest Company</a>].</p> <p><strong>When I was young </strong>I didn\u2019t know how to speak up [at work] and say, \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d I wasn\u2019t that person [a sex symbol] people were portraying me as. I come from a pretty conservative background; I was a tomboy wearing baggy clothes. But you\u2019re being marketed in a movie to sell it \u2013 I understood it was the characters I was playing.</p> <p><strong>Strong relationships with other women </strong>are important, especially after you become a mum. It gives you a sense of self to be surrounded by a group of people who accept and support you beyond your family.</p> <p><strong>The Honest Company </strong>wasn\u2019t a slam-dunk. I wasn\u2019t saying, \u201cOh, let\u2019s license my name and sell a perfume.\u201d As a new mum, I found it challenging to find effective products without things like synthetic fragrances. I wanted to create a consumer goods company that stands for transparency and is actually profitable.</p> <p><strong>Hollywood can be hard </strong>for the faint of heart. People hustle to be successful and then that moment when they feel they\u2019ve made it, it disappears in an instant. I don\u2019t feel like my persona in entertainment defines me. I\u2019ve never put a whole lot of importance on it. When I was on every magazine cover and in all the new movies, I knew a lot of it would go away.</p> <p><strong>You learn discipline </strong>growing up on a military base. You learn that sometimes you have to do things that you don\u2019t want to and you just have to get through it.</p> <p><strong>I spend a lot more time on my business </strong>than acting. When I can find the time and it\u2019s entertainment, I\u2019ll do something. With this last movie, I thought it would be fun to kick some butts again. I just sort of missed it.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve always loved dressing up</strong>. I chose to do it for a living. I love that fantasy element of being able to transform yourself into a different person.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s really important people vote </strong>in the [US presidential] election.

  "<p>To the wider world he is becoming known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/22/loyle-carner-review-garage-london\">Loyle Carner</a>, a brilliant young rapper. But in a test kitchen near London\u2019s Old Street he is plain old Ben, a lively 21-year-old showing six teenagers with ADHD, and one with anxiety, how to make pasta with pesto. It\u2019s one of the hottest days of the year, and the fans whirring in each corner are not an optional extra.</p> <p>Ben rushes from station to station, chopping herbs, grating parmesan and smashing garlic. Along with slick knife skills that belie long years of practice, he has the easy enthusiasm of a born teacher and his charges are absorbed in their tasks. One of his students, Eric, offers up his bowl of green paste for Ben to taste. \u201cThat\u2019s sick,\u201d says Ben approvingly.

Ben has always known cooking could be therapeutic for those with ADHD, because he grew up with the condition himself.</p> <p>\u201cI was energetic and annoying and my mum would sometimes struggle to keep me in check,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I loved making dinner. By the time I was six or seven I got to the point where I could cook on my own. The first thing I made was a sweet chilli squid. I was fascinated by squid: I\u2019d gut it, slice it up and marinate it.

You shouldn't judge a fish by how it climbs a wall</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ben looks so at home in the kitchen that it is easy to forget he is also one of Britain\u2019s most hotly tipped young musicians, nominated for the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2016 and halfway through a string of high-profile festival performances. Songs like \u201cAin\u2019t Nothing Changed\u201d \u2013 a languid, jazzy paen to his London upbringing \u2013 are winning plaudits and ever-bigger crowds. He is unfailingly modest and polite \u2013 he runs up and down four flights of stairs seven times to fetch his pupils in person for interview \u2013 but in his good looks and easy charisma there is obvious star power.</p> <p>While studying at the Brit school in Croydon \u2013 <em>alma mater</em> of Amy Winehouse and Adele, among countless others \u2013 he thought about going to catering college but accepted a drama scholarship to university. His time there was cut short in 2013 by the death of his beloved stepfather. He moved back home to support his mother and stepbrother, and would cook the evening meal.</p> <p>He found his first intake of pupils through contacts of his mother\u2019s and by putting up a notice at his old school. With some reluctance he advertised on his own social media, because he wanted kids with ADHD rather than Loyle Carner fans. The course lasts a week, with the students learning a different dish each day before serving a meal to their parents at the end of the week. Ben\u2019s plan is that this is the first of many.</p> <p>\u201cThe worry is that people think I\u2019m just doing this for publicity, which is why I wanted to get it up and running \u2013 and hopefully able to stand on its own \u2013 before I get busy touring. I don\u2019t want it to look like I\u2019m some washed-up guy trying to stay relevant.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea if I\u2019m even going to be a rapper in six months\u2019 time. I could tank. I can\u2019t get away from music because I love it and it\u2019s going well, but if it wasn\u2019t for music I would be doing this. Working with these kids I feel unlike I ever have before. Writing is a release. You don\u2019t have to think about anything else while you\u2019re doing it. It just flows through you.

Then we would sit for hours in restaurants chewing over the event while consuming the locality\u2019s finest wines. Now we spend most of July sitting in a car watching France flash by, and the rest of the time watching the race on TV from plastic chairs.</p> <p>Plenty of sitting down, in other words, and over 25 years I\u2019ve always assumed that \u2013 let\u2019s put this delicately \u2013 a certain amount of posterior discomfort was the price that had to be paid for the privilege of following <em>La Grande Boucle</em>.</p> <p>This time, a week into the race, I realised that those familiar and unloved aches were missing, and the explanation was underneath and behind me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c56da41ca49b84ebc74a7602736c8c057ddbd6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c56da41ca49b84ebc74a7602736c8c057ddbd6b/587_754_3575_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New Ford Vignale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Built for comfort: the new Vignale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Vignale is what Ford terms a \u201cnew ownership experience\u201d, available across several other models as well as the Mondeo. It comes with all sorts of bells and whistles, including its own <a href=\"http://vignale.ford.co.uk/en-GB/\">website</a>, where a glamorous-looking lady stands outside a plush hotel with her scarf wafting in the breeze.</p> <p>The plan appears to be to take the Ford driving experience upmarket, although as a Mondeo Man of many years\u2019 standing, I must say the experience in the Mondeo is not bad at all. It is not high on adrenaline or sophistication but it does what it is meant to do: it swallows a lot of kit and takes you from A to B comfortably and economically. At the top of the range, the Zetec package is already far from basic.</p> <p>Still, the Vignale is more than just a marketing exercise. The customer service is much improved, and the Mondeo we took on the Tour went a long way further. The four-wheel-drive version had mountain handling which was utterly surefooted, particularly considering that this is not a compact vehicle, with nary a tyre squeal to delight the roadside fans, and ample zip. It simply devoured the Alps; the flipside however was that the fuel tank emptied with disconcerting speed, although an eco version is available.</p> <p>The interior was a delight, and active noise control made this a totally silent trip. But the clincher was the seats. \u201cQuilted leather with hexagonal design\u201d, the blurb said. Most days in July, you can\u2019t wait to get out of the Tour car.

  "<p><strong>The Good Egg, 93 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16 0AS (020 7682 2120). Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a390</strong></p> <p>Occasionally, restaurants bestow upon those of us charged with writing about them a gift, albeit unwittingly. So it is with The Good Egg in London\u2019s Stoke Newington, a restless, elbows-down joint which plays fast and loose with various Jewish culinary traditions from America\u2019s Atlantic East Coast to the eastern end of the Mediterranean. For this egg is not so much good as a curate\u2019s. It\u2019s good. In places it\u2019s very good. But only in parts. They serve dishes that linger in the memory. Sadly there are others I\u2019m trying to forget.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is one for what my mother used to call the k\u2019nossers \u2013 that\u2019s fake Yiddish for connoisseurs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even a brief glance at chef Joel Braham\u2019s menu will indicate a thoroughly on-trend interest in the flavours of the Sephardic Jews. Whoever got the contract to supply their tahini must be thrilled. The kitchen gets through handfuls of pine nuts and feta, glugs of pomegranate molasses and thick dollops of yogurt. But the look of the restaurant \u2013 the typography, the brightly lit, utilitarian room, the curving wooden banquettes \u2013 is rooted very much in the American delis of the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the use of the word \u201cappetizing\u201d in the menu letterhead, a reference to the now moribund description of a Jewish deli as an \u201cappetizing store\u201d, is arch, knowing and rather appealing.</p> <p>Braham says he is inspired most by the deli traditions of Montreal, where they dry-cure their pastrami before smoking for deeper flavour than wet-cured. This is one for what my mother used to call the k\u2019nossers (that\u2019s fake Yiddish for connoisseurs). I had close family in Montreal. One aunt was even in the deli business; I can perv endlessly over details like this. I\u2019m not sure, however, that they need detain many others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e18b55d45f9a937beff5cc3c09905ae02d992442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e18b55d45f9a937beff5cc3c09905ae02d992442/0_276_5320_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plate of colourful chunky slices of vegetables\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Serious and strident\u2019: the house pickles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The boats that steamed hard across the North Atlantic in the late 19th century carrying Jewish migrants on the run from pogroms went south for Ellis Island and New York and north for the Saint Lawrence river and Montreal. And yes, each community that developed as a result did have its own particular way of doing things. But the distinctions are for the most part subtle. Still, I admit that what drew me to The Good Egg was the launch of a new menu, listing a \u201cMontreal smoked Hereford short-rib pastrami\u201d, fully accessorised. They might as well have written: \u201cJay Rayner, this one\u2019s for you. No really, it is. Why haven\u2019t you ordered it already, so soon?\u201d, and left it at that.</p> <p>The good things at The Good Egg really are very good. Their house-pickled cucumbers, cauliflower and aubergine are serious and strident with crunch and bite. Hand-shaped flatbread comes bubbled and charred with a pool of lightly acidic thyme honey and soothing yogurt to dredge it through. A salad of taut-skinned tomatoes, capers and red onions in puddles of peppery olive oil with a big dollop of house-cured whitefish mayonnaise really does recall a classic New York deli plate. At <a href=\"http://www.russanddaughters.com/\">Russ and Daughters</a> in Lower Manhattan, home to some of the best smoked salmon plates in the city, they would nod approvingly.</p> <p>It\u2019s obvious in the inclusion on the menu of porchetta that the Jewish influences are only that; they pay no heed to the Hebraic God and his picky eating. It is seasoned with the airy high notes of cardamom rather than fennel seed, and served in a big, thick chunk for \u00a310, with sweet grilled apricots on the side. It is a reason for crossing town. The skin is by turns crisp and succulent. The meat tastes deeply of pig. It is a bravura piece of pork cookery. At the end of the meal, baked cheesecake New York-style is not the heavy, claggy thing it can become, but light and soft; likewise their squidgy pistachio cake pleases. If this had been dinner, The Good Egg would just have been good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d3364e4c36749602e5d6c63baafe515cabf8732\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d3364e4c36749602e5d6c63baafe515cabf8732/0_325_5316_3190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A salad of tomatoes, capers and red onions with a pink mayonnaise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A classic New York deli plate\u2019: white fish salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sadly it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m willing to see the Iranian baked butter beans in swimming pools of sharp, nagging pomegranate molasses as a matter of taste. They didn\u2019t suit mine. But when exactly the same flavours turned up with the roast cauliflower, it went beyond matters of taste to overkill. There are numerous takes on roast cauliflower at the moment. This was by far the worst. It had a baby-food texture, as if the vegetable had been boiled far beyond anything that could be defined as cruel and unusual punishment, before being grilled. Char marks do not an appetising vegetable make.</p> <p>And then the short rib, which looked fabulous. It was a dark, spiced curl of bronzed bone-in loveliness. The sourdough with it from the local <a href=\"http://www.thedustyknuckle.com/\">Dusty Knuckle bakery</a> was fine. Ditto more of the house pickles, the sauerkraut and the deli mustard mayo. But the short ribs themselves were a calamity. Usually pastrami is made from brisket. It\u2019s an unyielding cut which demands more than 10 hours in the smoker before it will surrender. On the upside it has little in the way of connective tissue. Short rib, on the other hand, is one sizable lozenge of meat held in place by an equally hefty strapping of fat and collagen. The meat may not have been tough; finding it was.</p> <p>But the real problem was that it had been completely overcured. It was so salty as to be inedible, and I say that as a man in training for the hypertension Olympiad. I sent it back. Braham told me later that he was getting it cured off-site, but to his recipe. Having tasted this one, he admitted it wasn\u2019t right. He took it off the bill and, that night at least, off the menu. It was a great shame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ffbf166b6c2f5799aef0b930a627f63b385c776\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ffbf166b6c2f5799aef0b930a627f63b385c776/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An oblong of green-ish cake with sprinkles of pistachio nut pieces on top\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Squidgy and pleasing\u2019: pistachio cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately so is the wine list, which is all \u201cnatural\u201d. I will not repeat my rant about the misuse of language. The first one we tried tasted, as so many do, like it had been filtered through a pig\u2019s rectum then back again. There was one that didn\u2019t taste like that without being actively nice. It\u2019s a bizarre decision not simply on aesthetic grounds \u2013 so many \u201cnatural\u201d wines are foul \u2013 but because they\u2019re bloody expensive. Most of the wines are over \u00a330, in a place where almost all the dishes are below a tenner, which suits the younger customer base. (The short rib was \u00a321, but was for two to share.)</p> <p>I refuse to be downhearted. I\u2019m certain they can get the pastrami right. Braham needs to take control of the cure. Rewriting the wine list would not be hard. It can be done. Sort those things out and this curate\u2019s egg would indeed become good.</p> <h2>Jay\u2019s news bites</h2> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Zelman Meats</strong> in London\u2019s Soho, from the team behind the steak restaurants Goodman and the Burger and Lobster chain, runs a short menu of slow-cooked animal.

There\u2019s no doubting his determination and ability. He put together a plan and executed it, forcing Diaz to give everything he had. It\u2019s difficult to argue against the judges call for a majority decision in McGregor\u2019s favor. The bout was that tight, and the action and output was furious. A third contest at 155 changes the game quite a lot. Diaz will get a chance to compete at a weight he most often fights at, and McGregor won\u2019t have to navigate a path to victory in a division he does not seem built for.

  "<p>The western financial crisis of 2007-8 was the worst since 1931, yet its immediate repercussions were surprisingly modest. The crisis challenged the foundation stones of the long-dominant neoliberal ideology but it seemed to emerge largely unscathed. The banks were bailed out; hardly any bankers on either side of the Atlantic were prosecuted for their crimes; and the price of their behaviour was duly paid by the taxpayer. Subsequent economic policy, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world, has relied overwhelmingly on monetary policy, especially quantitative easing. It has failed. The western economy has stagnated and is now approaching its lost decade, with no end in sight.</p> <p>After almost nine years, we are finally beginning to reap the political whirlwind of the financial crisis. But how did neoliberalism manage to survive virtually unscathed for so long? Although it failed the test of the real world, bequeathing the worst economic disaster for seven decades, politically and intellectually it remained the only show in town. Parties of the right, centre and left had all bought into its philosophy, New Labour a classic in point. They knew no other way of thinking or doing: it had become the common sense. It was, as Antonio Gramsci put it, hegemonic. But that hegemony cannot and will not survive the test of the real world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/political-third-parties-spoilers-abolitionists-movement\">Third parties aren't 'spoilers'.

It marked the beginnings of a wider political crisis.</p> <p>But the causes of this political crisis, glaringly evident on both sides of the Atlantic, are much deeper than simply the financial crisis and the virtually stillborn recovery of the last decade. They go to the heart of the neoliberal project that dates from the late 70s and the political rise of Reagan and Thatcher, and embraced at its core the idea of a global free market in goods, services and capital. The depression-era system of bank regulation was dismantled, in the US in the 1990s and in Britain in 1986, thereby creating the conditions for the 2008 crisis. Equality was scorned, the idea of trickle-down economics lauded, government condemned as a fetter on the market and duly downsized, immigration encouraged, regulation cut to a minimum, taxes reduced and a blind eye turned to corporate evasion.</p> <p>It should be noted that, by historical standards, the neoliberal era has not had a particularly good track record. The most dynamic period of postwar western growth was that between the end of the war and the early 70s, the era of welfare capitalism and Keynesianism, when the growth rate was double that of the neoliberal period from 1980 to the present.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9743d47492b73cc81f1f51d2d57e7f43c6dc0dc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9743d47492b73cc81f1f51d2d57e7f43c6dc0dc3/0_38_3546_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1984, ushered in the era of neoliberalism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1984, ushered in the era of neoliberalism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by far the most disastrous feature of the neoliberal period has been the huge growth in inequality. Until very recently, this had been virtually ignored. With extraordinary speed, however, it has emerged as one of, if not the most important political issue on both sides of the Atlantic, most dramatically in the US. It is, bar none, the issue that is driving the political discontent that is now engulfing the west. Given the statistical evidence, it is puzzling, shocking even, that it has been disregarded for so long; the explanation can only lie in the sheer extent of the hegemony of neoliberalism and its values.</p> <p>But now reality has upset the doctrinal apple cart. In the period 1948-1972, every section of the American population experienced very similar and sizable increases in their standard of living; between 1972-2013, the bottom 10% experienced falling real income while the top 10% did far better than everyone else. In the US, the median real income for full-time male workers is now lower than it was four decades ago: the income of the bottom 90% of the population has <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/globalization-new-discontents-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2016-08\">stagnated for over 30 years</a>.</p> <p>A not so dissimilar picture is true of the UK. And the problem has grown more serious since the financial crisis. On average, between <a href=\"http://\">65-70% of households in 25 high-income economies</a> experienced stagnant or falling real incomes between 2005 and 2014.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Large sections of the population in both the US and the UK are now in revolt against their lot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reasons are not difficult to explain. The hyper-globalisation era has been systematically stacked in favour of capital against labour: international trading agreements, drawn up in great secrecy, with business on the inside and the unions and citizens excluded, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32498715\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/what-is-ttip-controversial-trade-deal-explained\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> (TTIP) being but the latest examples; the politico-legal attack on the unions; <a href=\"http://\">the encouragement of large-scale immigration in both the US and Europe</a> that helped to undermine the bargaining power of the domestic workforce; and the failure to retrain displaced workers in any meaningful way.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/thomas-piketty\">Thomas Piketty</a> has shown, in the absence of countervailing pressures, capitalism naturally gravitates towards increasing inequality. In the period between 1945 and the late 70s, Cold War competition was arguably the biggest such constraint. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been none. As the popular backlash grows increasingly irresistible, however, such a winner-takes-all regime becomes politically unsustainable.</p> <p>Large sections of the population in both the US and the UK are now in revolt against their lot, as graphically illustrated by the support for Trump and Sanders in the US and the Brexit vote in the UK. This popular revolt is often described, in a somewhat denigratory and dismissive fashion, as populism. Or, as Francis Fukuyama writes in a recent excellent <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/american-political-decay-or-renewal\">essay in <em>Foreign Affairs</em></a>: \u201c\u2018Populism\u2019 is the label that political elites attach to policies supported by ordinary citizens that they don\u2019t like.\u201d Populism is a movement against the status quo. It represents the beginnings of something new, though it is generally much clearer about what it is against than what it is for. It can be progressive or reactionary, but more usually both.</p> <p>Brexit is a classic example of such populism. It has overturned a fundamental cornerstone of UK policy since the early 1970s. Though ostensibly about Europe, it was in fact about much more: a cri de coeur from those who feel they have lost out and been left behind, whose living standards have stagnated or worse since the 1980s, who feel dislocated by large-scale immigration over which they have no control and who face an increasingly insecure and casualised labour market. Their revolt has paralysed the governing elite, already claimed one prime minister, and left the latest one fumbling around in the dark looking for divine inspiration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b944b4b7daee014e9b8b352621988f74c6980c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b944b4b7daee014e9b8b352621988f74c6980c1/0_149_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit was the marker of a working-class revolt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brexit was the marker of a working-class revolt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wave of populism marks the return of class as a central agency in politics, both in the UK and the US. This is particularly remarkable in the US. For many decades, the idea of the \u201cworking class\u201d was marginal to American political discourse. Most Americans described themselves as middle class, a reflection of the aspirational pulse at the heart of American society. According to a Gallup poll, in 2000 only 33% of Americans called themselves working class; by 2015 the figure was 48%, almost half the population.</p> <p>Brexit, too, was primarily a working-class revolt. Hitherto, on both sides of the Atlantic, the agency of class has been in retreat in the face of the emergence of a new range of identities and issues from gender and race to sexual orientation and the environment. The return of class, because of its sheer reach, has the potential, like no other issue, to redefine the political landscape.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The working class belongs to no one: its orientation, far from predetermined, is a function of politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The re-emergence of class should not be confused with the labour movement. They are not synonymous: this is obvious in the US and increasingly the case in the UK. Indeed, over the last half-century, there has been a growing separation between the two in Britain. The re-emergence of the working class as a political voice in Britain, most notably in the Brexit vote, can best be described as an inchoate expression of resentment and protest, with only a very weak sense of belonging to the labour movement.</p> <p>Indeed, Ukip has been as important \u2013 in the form of immigration and Europe \u2013 in shaping its current attitudes as the Labour party. In the United States, both Trump and Sanders have given expression to the working-class revolt, the latter almost as much as the former. The working class belongs to no one: its orientation, far from predetermined, as the left liked to think, is a function of politics.</p> <p>The neoliberal era is being undermined from two directions. First, if its record of economic growth has never been particularly strong, it is now dismal. Europe is barely larger than it was on the eve of the financial crisis in 2007; the United States has done better but even its growth has been anaemic. Economists such as Larry Summers believe that the prospect for the future is most likely one of <a href=\"http://larrysummers.com/category/secular-stagnation/\">secular stagnation</a>.</p> <p>Worse, because the recovery has been so weak and fragile, there is a widespread belief that another financial crisis may well beckon. In other words, the neoliberal era has delivered the west back into the kind of crisis-ridden world that we last experienced in the 1930s. With this background, it is hardly surprising that a majority in the west now believe their children will be worse off than they were. Second, those who have lost out in the neoliberal era are no longer prepared to acquiesce in their fate \u2013 they are increasingly in open revolt. We are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era. It is not dead, but it is in its early death throes, just as the social-democratic era was during the 1970s.</p> <p>A sure sign of the declining influence of neoliberalism is the rising chorus of intellectual voices raised against it. From the mid-70s through the 80s, the economic debate was increasingly dominated by monetarists and free marketeers. But since the western financial crisis, the centre of gravity of the intellectual debate has shifted profoundly. This is most obvious in the United States, with economists such as Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, Dani Rodrik and Jeffrey Sachs becoming increasingly influential. Thomas Piketty\u2019s <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> has been a massive seller. His work and that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/15/nobel-prize-for-economics-runners-riders\">Tony Atkinson and Angus Deaton</a> have pushed the question of the inequality to the top of the political agenda. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hajoonchang\">Ha-Joon Chang</a>, for long isolated within the economics profession, has gained a following far greater than those who think economics is a branch of mathematics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8de8c75d289f1f1c95c1e82e49c98672aff35e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8de8c75d289f1f1c95c1e82e49c98672aff35e7/0_4_4267_2561/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019, pictured at a rally in north London last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019, pictured at rally in north London last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, some of those who were previously strong advocates of a neoliberal approach, such as Larry Summers and the <em>Financial Times</em>\u2019s Martin Wolf, have become extremely critical. The wind is in the sails of the critics of neoliberalism; the neoliberals and monetarists are in retreat. In the UK, the media and political worlds are well behind the curve. Few recognise that we are at the end of an era. Old attitudes and assumptions still predominate, whether on the BBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, in the rightwing press or the parliamentary Labour party.</p> <p>Following Ed Miliband\u2019s resignation as Labour leader, virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn in the subsequent leadership election. The assumption had been more of the same, a Blairite or a halfway house like Miliband, certainly not anyone like Corbyn. But the zeitgeist had changed. The membership, especially the young who had joined the party on an unprecedented scale, wanted a complete break with New Labour. One of the reasons why the left has failed to emerge as the leader of the new mood of working-class disillusionment is that most social democratic parties became, in varying degrees, disciples of neoliberalism and uber-globalisation. The most extreme forms of this phenomenon were New Labour and the Democrats, who in the late 90s and 00s became its advance guard, personified by Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, triangulation and the third way.</p> <p>But as David Marquand observed in a review for the <em>New Statesman</em>, what is the point of a social democratic party if it doesn\u2019t represent the less fortunate, the underprivileged and the losers? New Labour deserted those who needed them, who historically they were supposed to represent. Is it surprising that large sections have now deserted the party who deserted them? Blair, in his reincarnation as a money-obsessed consultant to a shady bunch of presidents and dictators, is a fitting testament to the demise of New Labour.</p> <p>The rival contenders \u2013 Burnham, Cooper and Kendall \u2013 represented continuity. They were swept away by Corbyn, who won nearly 60% of the votes. New Labour was over, as dead as Monty Python\u2019s parrot. Few grasped the meaning of what had happened. A <em>Guardian</em> leader welcomed the surge in membership and then, lo and behold, urged support for Yvette Cooper, the very antithesis of the reason for the enthusiasm. The PLP refused to accept the result and ever since has tried with might and main to remove Corbyn.</p> <p>Just as the Labour party took far too long to come to terms with the rise of Thatcherism and the birth of a new era at the end of the 70s, now it could not grasp that the Thatcherite paradigm, which they eventually came to embrace in the form of New Labour, had finally run its course. Labour, like everyone else, is obliged to think anew. The membership in their antipathy to New Labour turned to someone who had never accepted the latter, who was the polar opposite in almost every respect of Blair, and embodying an authenticity and decency which Blair patently did not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour may be in intensive care, but the condition of the Conservatives is not a great deal better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Corbyn is not a product of the new times, he is a throwback to the late 70s and early 80s. That is both his strength and also his weakness. He is uncontaminated by the New Labour legacy because he has never accepted it. But nor, it would seem, does he understand the nature of the new era. The danger is that he is possessed of feet of clay in what is a highly fluid and unpredictable political environment, devoid of any certainties of almost any kind, in which Labour finds itself dangerously divided and weakened.</p> <p>Labour may be in intensive care, but the condition of the Conservatives is not a great deal better. David Cameron was guilty of a huge and irresponsible miscalculation over Brexit. He was forced to resign in the most ignominious of circumstances. The party is hopelessly divided. It has no idea in which direction to move after Brexit. The Brexiters painted an optimistic picture of turning away from the declining European market and embracing the expanding markets of the world, albeit barely mentioning by name which countries it had in mind. It looks as if the new prime minister may have an anachronistic hostility towards China and a willingness to undo the good work of George Osborne. If the government turns its back on China, by far the fastest growing market in the world, where are they going to turn?</p> <p>Brexit has left the country fragmented and deeply divided, with the very real prospect that Scotland might choose independence. Meanwhile, the Conservatives seem to have little understanding that the neoliberal era is in its death throes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a66e9b7acb68ce994770540486f274728d20d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a66e9b7acb68ce994770540486f274728d20d3/0_140_4658_2796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Put America first\u2019: Donald Trump in Cleveland last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Put America first\u2019: Donald Trump in Cleveland last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dramatic as events have been in the UK, they cannot compare with those in the United States. Almost from nowhere, Donald Trump rose to capture the Republican nomination and confound virtually all the pundits and not least his own party. His message was straightforwardly anti-globalisation. He believes that the interests of the working class have been sacrificed in favour of the big corporations that have been encouraged to invest around the world and thereby deprive American workers of their jobs. Further, he argues that large-scale immigration has weakened the bargaining power of American workers and served to lower their wages.</p> <p>He proposes that US corporations should be required to invest their cash reserves in the US. He believes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) has had the effect of exporting American jobs to Mexico. On similar grounds, he is opposed to the TPP and the TTIP. And he also accuses China of stealing American jobs, threatening to impose a 45% tariff on Chinese imports.</p> <p>To globalisation Trump counterposes economic nationalism: \u201cPut America first\u201d. His appeal, above all, is to the white working class who, until Trump\u2019s (and Bernie Sander\u2019s) arrival on the political scene, had been ignored and largely unrepresented since the 1980s. Given that their wages have been falling for most of the last 40 years, it is extraordinary how their interests have been neglected by the political class. Increasingly, they have voted Republican, but the Republicans have long been captured by the super-rich and Wall Street, whose interests, as hyper-globalisers, have run directly counter to those of the white working class. With the arrival of Trump they finally found a representative: they won Trump the Republican nomination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump believes that America\u2019s pursuit of great power status has squandered the nation\u2019s resources</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The economic nationalist argument has also been vigorously pursued by Bernie Sanders, who ran Hillary Clinton extremely close for the Democratic nomination and would probably have won but for more than 700 so-called super-delegates, who were effectively chosen by the Democratic machine and overwhelmingly supported Clinton. As in the case of the Republicans, the Democrats have long supported a neoliberal, pro-globalisation strategy, notwithstanding the concerns of its trade union base. Both the Republicans and the Democrats now find themselves deeply polarised between the pro- and anti-globalisers, an entirely new development not witnessed since the shift towards neoliberalism under Reagan almost 40 years ago.</p> <p>Another plank of Trump\u2019s nationalist appeal \u2013 \u201cMake America great again\u201d \u2013 is his position on foreign policy. He believes that America\u2019s pursuit of great power status has squandered the nation\u2019s resources. He argues that the country\u2019s alliance system is unfair, with America bearing most of the cost and its allies contributing far too little. He points to Japan and South Korea, and Nato\u2019s European members as prime examples.He seeks to rebalance these relationships and, failing that, to exit from them.</p> <p>As a country in decline, he argues that America can no longer afford to carry this kind of financial burden. Rather than putting the world to rights, he believes the money should be invested at home, pointing to the dilapidated state of America\u2019s infrastructure. <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-foreign-policy-speech\">Trump\u2019s position</a> represents a major critique of America as the world\u2019s hegemon. His arguments mark a radical break with the neoliberal, hyper-globalisation ideology that has reigned since the early 1980s and with the foreign policy orthodoxy of most of the postwar period. These arguments must be taken seriously. They should not be lightly dismissed just because of their authorship. But Trump is no man of the left. He is a populist of the right. He has launched a racist and xenophobic attack on Muslims and on Mexicans. Trump\u2019s appeal is to a white working class that feels it has been cheated by the big corporations, undermined by Hispanic immigration, and often resentful towards African-Americans who for long too many have viewed as their inferior.</p> <p>A Trump America would mark a descent into authoritarianism characterised by abuse, scapegoating, discrimination, racism, arbitrariness and violence; America would become a deeply polarised and divided society. His threat to impose <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-navarro-trump-trade-china-tariffs-20160721-snap-story.html\">45% tariffs on China</a>, if implemented, would certainly provoke retaliation by the Chinese and herald the beginnings of a new era of protectionism.</p> <p>Trump may well lose the presidential election just as Sanders failed in his bid for the Democrat nomination. But this does not mean that the forces opposed to hyper-globalisation \u2013 unrestricted immigration, TPP and TTIP, the free movement of capital and much else \u2013 will have lost the argument and are set to decline. In little more than 12 months, Trump and Sanders have transformed the nature and terms of the argument. Far from being on the wane, the arguments of the critics of hyper-globalisation are steadily gaining ground. Roughly two-thirds of Americans agree that \u201cwe should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems\u201d. And, above all else, what will continue to drive opposition to the hyper-globalisers is inequality.</p>",

It might even harden the resolve of those possessing nuclear weapons not to reduce their arsenals.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade <a href=\"http://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/non-proliferation-disarmament-arms-control/nuclear-weapons/Pages/australias-nuclear-non-proliferation-and-disarmament-policy.aspx\">said on its website</a> that it opposed a ban on nuclear weapons because although it \u201cmight seem to be a straightforward and emotionally appealing way to de-legitimise and eradicate nuclear weapons,\u201d it would actually \u201cdivert attention from the sustained, practical steps needed for effective disarmament\u201d.<br></p> <p>But in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/australia-isolated-in-its-hesitation-to-sign-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons\">documents obtained under Freedom of Information</a> revealed Australia opposed the ban on nuclear weapons, since it believed it relied on US nuclear weapons as a deterrent.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs long as the threat of nuclear attack or coercion exists, and countries like the DPRK [North Korea] seek these weapons and threaten others, Australia and many other countries will continue to rely on US extended nuclear deterrence,\u201d said one of the briefing notes for government ministers.<br></p> <p>The documents revealed however that Australia and the US were worried about the momentum gathering behind the Austrian-led push for a ban nuclear weapons, which diplomats said was \u201cfast becoming a galvanising focus for those pushing the ban treaty option\u201d.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s ambassador to the UN conference on disarmament expressed disappointment that a vote was required.</p> <p>\u201cWe are deeply concerned that the adoption by voting will further divide the international disarmament community and undermine the momentum of nuclear disarmament for the international community as a whole,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Tim Wright, Asia-Pacific director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), said it was thought that Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, instructed her diplomats to disrupt the international gathering late on Friday afternoon by forcing a vote. While others then joined Australia to vote against the report, Australia was alone in forcing the vote to happen.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is resisting the tide of history. A majority of nations believe that nuclear weapons are unacceptable and must be prohibited. And now they are ready to negotiate a ban,\u201d Wright said.</p> <p> \u201cAustralia\u2019s attempt to derail these important disarmament talks was shameful and outrageous. It provoked strong criticism from some of our nearest neighbours in Asia and the Pacific, who believe that the world should be rid of all weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The acceptance of the report was seen as a major milestone by anti-nuclear campaigners.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a significant moment in the seven\u00ad-decade\u00ad-long global struggle to rid the world of the worst weapons of mass destruction,\u201d said Beatrice Fihn, executive director Ican. \u201cThe UN working group achieved a breakthrough today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere can be no doubt that a majority of UN members intend to pursue negotiations next year on a treaty banning nuclear weapons,\u201d said Fihn.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect that, based on the recommendations of the working group, the UN general assembly will adopt a resolution this autumn to establish the mandate for negotiations on a ban on nuclear weapons in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman said: \u201cAustralia called for a vote on the report as it was the most effective way to register our opposition to a recommendation to start negotiations on a ban treaty. A consensus report was not possible in the circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cOur efforts must be directed to strengthening the NPT and implementing what countries have already agreed to under its various review conference documents including the 2010 action plan. </p> <p>\u201cBan treaty negotiations will not reduce nuclear weapons, and have the potential to divert focus and further divide countries on disarmament. Proceeding with ban treaty negotiations without states which possess nuclear weapons will not further nuclear disarmament.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>With storylines, dialogues and physical gags cannibalised from the beloved 1970s TV show, Fawlty Towers Live is little more than a sophisticated form of merchandise \u2013 a commercialised machine raking in dollars with its high ticket prices and the opportunity to buy a branded bathrobe ($80) at interval.</p> <p>John Cleese and director Caroline Jay Ranger (Monty Python Live at the O2) have taken three Fawlty Towers episodes and reworked them for the stage: series one\u2019s The Hotel Inspectors and The Germans, and series two\u2019s Communication Problems. They are woven together \u2013 quite solidly \u2013 into one story, using so much dialogue and structure and conversation from the original series that a writing credit for the show is also given to Cleese\u2019s writing partner and fellow actor on the show, Connie Booth, to whom he was once married. A few elements from other episodes \u2013 like Easter eggs for fans \u2013 crop up during the course of the mayhem.</p> <p>It\u2019s the elements of Communication Problems that work best on stage, earning the most laughs as Mrs Richards (the wonderful Deborah Kennedy) harangues Basil Fawlty (Stephen Hall), Polly (Aimee Horne) and the rest of the staff for a litany of reasons while refusing to turn on her hearing aid. This plot seems like the true heart of the action, even as hotel inspectors lurk in the background throughout and, as their anticipated German guests arrive, Basil cautions his staff not to mention the war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a159314ecc5dc973d340b40edb56db717ae19622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a159314ecc5dc973d340b40edb56db717ae19622/0_170_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exemplary cast: Polly (Aimee Horne) and Manuel (Syd Brisbane) star in the world premiere of Fawlty Towers Live.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exemplary cast: Polly (Aimee Horne) and Manuel (Syd Brisbane) star in the world premiere of Fawlty Towers Live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James D Morgan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/17/john-cleeses-attack-fawlty-towers-tribute-show-about-publicity-alison-pollard-mansergh\">John Cleese's attack on Fawlty Towers tribute was about publicity, says creator</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cast are exemplary, proven early in to be impressive impressionists.

Horne\u2019s Polly is so like Connie Booth it\u2019s both comforting and eerie. And Syd Brisbane\u2019s Manuel captures his eagerness and unfortunate ineptitude with genuine warmth \u2013 although all the violence and disparagement he receives really isn\u2019t funny any more.</p> <p>But for the most part, the production is such an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/13/robots-human-uncanny-valley\">uncanny valley</a>\u201d adaptation from screen to stage that it feels largely pointless, and almost boring (especially if the Fawlty material is still fresh in mind \u2013 it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that we\u2019ve all been here before). New material for the stage is perhaps a riskier proposition, but would have been more exciting for the audience: a new Fawlty story, unavailable anywhere else?

  "<p>The years and opponents might change, but for Mo Farah some things remain ever present: that feeling of accelerating through the gears, the thrill of leaving his rivals clutching at his slipstream, the joy of kissing the track knowing another gold medal is in the bag.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/20/rio-2016-olympics-day-15-mo-farah-relays-tom-daley-nicola-adams-football-live\">Rio 2016 Olympics: Mo Farah takes 5,000m gold and Semenya wins 800m  \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This victory over 5,000m was his fourth Olympic title, and it was achieved in much the same way as his other three: accelerating hard on the final lap before kicking away in the final 100 metres. Farah ran his final lap in 52.83sec \u2013 an astonishing display of speed, quicker than even his last lap at London 2012 \u2013 to win in 13:03.30. Just behind in second was Paul Chelimo, who works for the US army and broke his personal best by 15 seconds, while Hagos Gebrhiwet was third.</p> <p>Shortly after the race, Chelimo was disqualified for a lane infringement, but after a long appeal he was reinstated. The second Briton in the race, Andrew Butchart, finished sixth having run 13:08.61 \u2013 smashing his personal best by nearly five seconds.</p> <p>As usual, Farah was content to sit at the back at the start, biding his time while he waited for the race to develop. But as the Ethiopians began to push the pace, taking turns to lead, Farah eased through the field to monitor them in sixth before he moved to the front with four laps to go, his team-mate Butchart in second, protecting him. The pace was fast but not excessive. At the bell Farah was leading but he had six athletes on his tail. With 250 to go, Gebrhiwet headed him but Farah soon headed him \u2013 and heading towards history.</p> <p>Afterwards, Farah admitted he hadn\u2019t expected the Ethiopians to push it so hard from the gun.</p> <p>\u201cI was surprised by the first lap,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was going to be a slow race. They had a plan, they wanted to take the sting out of me but when I hit the front, I wasn\u2019t letting anyone past me.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. My legs were a bit tired after the 10k \u2013 I don\u2019t know how I recovered. People were bringing me food in my hotel room. But I hate to lose. Even in PE, I hated losing. I have that drive \u2013 it\u2019s just me. I can\u2019t quite believe it. I wished for just one medal as a junior. It has been a long journey, but if you dream of something, have ambitions and are willing to work hard, then you can get your dreams.\u201d</p> <p>As Farah stood on the start line he was acutely aware of the prize that awaited him. Victory would make him only the second athlete, after Lasse Viren, to win the 5,000m and 10,000m at two Olympic Games, matching the Flying Finn\u2019s achievement of 1972 and 1976. It would also take Farah\u2019s tally of Olympic and world medals to nine \u2013 far ahead of the next British athlete on the list, Jessica Ennis-Hill, with five. If he was nervous he masked it like an actor. Instead, he glared at his rivals, eyeing them up. And then, when his name was introduced, started throwing punches like a boxer.</p> <p>What goes through his mind at times like this? He has never deeply discussed it. But last year, British Athletics\u2019 performance director, Neil Black, shed a rare and fascinating light on Farah\u2019s mentality before a major race, when the adrenaline is raging through his veins. As Black told an audience of sports scientists and the Observer, Farah always tries to \u201cown the start line\u201d before he competes.</p> <p>As Black explained: \u201cThe critical bit of information that you need to know is that when Mo stands on the start line, he believes he can run faster than anyone else in that race. He believes he can run the last 400m faster than anyone in that race. He believes he could run the last kilometre faster than anyone in that race. He believes he could lift any weight in the gym that anyone wanted to \u2013 as a comparison with anyone on the start line \u2013 better, faster and heavier. He believes that if he had to fight anyone there he could kick the shit out of them. That\u2019s what owning the start line is.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2011, when Farah won his first world title over 5,000m in Daegu, there has been little to make him believe he is vulnerable on the track. The fact that there were no Kenyans in the 5,000m final, for the first time since the Rome Games, would have only added to his confidence.</p> <p>Instead, his biggest threats on paper came instead from Ethiopia: Muktar Edris and Dejen Gebremeskel, who have run under 13 minutes this year, and Gebrhiwet, who took world championship bronze in Beijing in 2015.</p> <p>Yet despite being overwhelming favourite, Farah still needed to answer how he would respond to the challenge of running three races \u2013 the 10,000m, then the 5,000m heats and the final \u2013 in seven days. On Friday, the Ethiopian Almaz Ayana, who had set the women\u2019s 10,000m world record a week ago, had blown up in the final. At 33, might Farah\u2019s age finally catch up with him? Might he falter too?</p> <p>There was also the issue of how questions about the extent of his relationship with the controversial coach Jama Aden, who was arrested by Spanish police in June on charges of administering and distributing doping substances and endangering public health, would affect him. As Farah put it bluntly to the media corps after his 10,000m victory: \u201cSometimes I feel you guys hate me\u201d.</p> <p>In reality there is no hate towards Farah. But while the large British contingent in the stadium cheered him on, his links with Aden and the vociferously denied allegations against his coach Alberto Salazar have eating away at the unconditional love Farah was afforded in London 2012.</p> <p>Not that any of these pressures bothered him when the race started. Farah had already dedicated his previous three Olympic gold medals to his twins, Amani and Aisha, and his eldest daughter Rihanna. Before this final he had promised one for his young son Hussein too. As usual he delivered.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows I didn\u2019t just fluke it in London. To do it again is incredible,\u201d he said, the emotion flooding his body. \u201cI just want to see my kids and hang this medal around their necks.\u201d</p>"
