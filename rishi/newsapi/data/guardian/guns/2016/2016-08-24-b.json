  "<p>Science degrees have copped more than their fair share of criticism in recent weeks. The Grattan Institute\u2019s <a href=\"https://grattan.edu.au/report/mapping-australian-higher-education-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mapping Australia\u2019s higher education 2016 report</a> argues that Australia has too many science graduates. What\u2019s striking about this finding is that it fails to acknowledge the broad-based value of a scientific education. </p> <p>PhD candidate <a href=\"http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/graduate-programs/sjd/student-profiles/alexandra-phelan.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alexandra Phelan</a> studied for a dual bachelor of biomedical science and a bachelor of law, and is now completing a doctorate in international health law at Georgetown University in Washington as a <a href=\"http://johnmonash.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Monash scholar</a>. In 2014, when the Ebola outbreak hit west Africa, Phelan consulted on the epidemic for both the World Health Organisation and the countries affected. </p> <p>Phelan is continuing to provide advice on how global law can be used in international epidemics to reduce the spread of the Zika virus. But if we are to take note of the Grattan Institute report on education, Phelan would be lamented as falling among the many science graduates who are not working as scientists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/19/music-with-a-message-engineering-industry-tackles-shortage-of-female-students\">Music with a message: engineering industry tackles shortage of female students</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Grattan Institute report makes the narrow assumption that science is a vocational degree that trains people to be scientists, and is concerned that \u201cscience graduates are pushing into a general labour market in which they must compete with graduates from other fields\u201d. This conclusion is based on a misconception: that science graduates are limited to a career in science. A science degree teaches skills that are important in any workplace: it is a foundational degree that develops numeracy and challenges students to value the critical lessons learned in the process of discovery: creativity, patience and attention to detail. Phelan is a perfect exemplar of the value a science degree holds to other fields.</p> <p>Every year General Sir John Monash scholars are selected from all fields of endeavour in a highly competitive process, with the goal of identifying and funding individuals who will lead Australia in the future. More than half of these have undergraduate science degrees (including science, maths, engineering, IT and biomedical science, commonly grouped as Stem degrees, but excluding medical undergraduate degrees). It is striking that in an open selection process, with selection panels largely composed of non-scientists, science graduates are over-represented among individuals identified as Australia\u2019s future leaders. The key attributes fostered by a science degree are an inquiring mind, facility with data and technology, an analytical approach to problem solving and a sense of curiosity and inquiry. These are attributes that are of vital importance to Australia\u2019s future leaders.</p> <p>There are broader lessons here. Almost all of Australia\u2019s industries \u2013 including mining, banking and retail \u2013 are, and will continue to be, subject to technology-driven disruption and will need technology-literate people to counter such disruption with innovation. </p> <p>Moreover, most jobs of the future will exist in industries we cannot yet predict but that will require creativity, analytical ability and a comfort with technology. The Grattan Institute report, in fact, acknowledges that \u201cStem employers report that their employees with Stem qualifications are better at problem solving and critical thinking than are employees without Stem qualifications\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/11/time-for-men-to-sign-up-to-female-dominated-caring-and-sharing-jobs\">Time for men to sign up to female-dominated caring and sharing jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/afr-innovation-summit-alan-finkel-urges-smart-regulation-strategic-investment-20160816-gqtvx8\" rel=\"nofollow\">observed this month</a>: \u201cIf you want a worker who can solve a problem in a short time, with resources strung out to the nth degree, hire someone with a science doctorate.\u201d </p> <p>Hugh Evans, the founder of the Oaktree foundation and another John Monash scholar, illustrates Finkel\u2019s point. Evans heads up the Global Poverty project, a global human rights organisation that aims to eradicate world poverty. The problem-solving skills of his undergraduate science degree from Monash are used every day and have an impact on millions of people in need around the world. </p> <p>The Grattan Institute\u2019s recommendation that we need fewer science graduates is potentially very damaging to Australia. We believe that more science grads are needed, not fewer. We need to encourage an understanding among educators, students and the wider community that an undergraduate science degree can be applied to many different contexts, jobs, industries and situations. Government and business should get behind our science students and encourage future ones. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",
  "<p>White, male and better-off graduates continue to dominate the professional classes more than three years after leaving university, even after quality of qualifications and other factors are taken into account, according to data compiled from universities in England.</p> <p>The study by the <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/\">Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> (Hefce) found that professional employment rates of students graduating in 2011 were as much as nine percentage points lower for black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani graduates than for white graduates.</p> <p>The analysis found smaller but persistent gaps between male and female graduates, with 79% of men in professional occupations or study, compared with 74% of women, even though more women were in jobs overall.</p> <p>Substantial gaps were also seen among graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds compared with those from better-off areas, suggesting that an effort to widen access to professional occupations such as law and accounting still has a long way to go.</p> <p>The single minority ethnic group that saw its prospects brighten was that of ethnic Chinese graduates, whose professional employment rates improved compared with a similar survey in 2009, and whose 2011 cohort enjoyed employment rates similar to those of their white peers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/nov/23/most-senior-judges-top-qcs-still-privately-educated-figures-show\">Most senior judges and top QCs still privately educated, figures show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prof Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education watchdog, said the Hefce report \u201chighlights the shocking gaps in outcomes for various groups of students \u2026 We know that students from most black and minority ethnic groups and those from disadvantaged areas face [the] worst outcomes,\u201d Ebdon said. \u201cThis remains the case even when accounting for factors such as entry qualifications, which might affect your future prospects.\u201d</p> <p>Forty months after graduation, the total proportion of graduates who were employed or in further study was more than 95%, and for both cohorts 69% were in white-collar professional roles.</p> <p>While the differences in overall employment rates between white graduates and those from minority groups narrowed between 2009 and 2011, the gaps in rates of professional employment did not improve. </p> <p>Hefce\u2019s analysis also made predictions of professional employment based on qualifications, and found that black and ethnic Pakistani graduates had the biggest gap between forecast employment rates and outcome.</p> <p>\u201cThe report supports previous Hefce analysis in demonstrating that there continues to be serious challenges to achieving equality of outcomes for graduates from ethnic minority groups, graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds and women, particularly in terms of securing professional employment,\u201d said Christopher Millward, Hefce\u2019s director of policy.</p> <p>\u201cHigher education can be a powerful force for social mobility but this requires not just access to and success within university. It also requires successful transition into rewarding careers. This report demonstrates the imperative for higher education providers to work with employers to address this.\u201d</p> <p>Hefce\u2019s new report updates previous analysis by examining the employment outcomes of UK-based students who qualified from a full-time first degree course at an English university in 2011. </p> <p>Ebdon said universities were trying to address what he described as \u201cunexplained outcomes gaps,\u201d with universities pledged to use \u00a355m from tuition fee income next year to support disadvantaged students for life after graduation.</p> <p>\u201cUniversities, government and employers should continue to work together to tackle these problems,\u201d Ebdon said.</p>",

  "<p>The Israeli military has cleared its forces of wrongdoing in a string of deadly incidents that took place during the 2014 Gaza war \u2013 including an airstrike that killed 15 members of a single family and the bombing of a United Nations school.<br></p> <p>Israel\u2019s investigative process is at the heart of a Palestinian case to press for war crimes charges against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jan/16/icc-possible-war-crimes-palestinian-territories\">Israel at the International Criminal Court in the Hague</a>. The Palestinians say that Israel has a poor record of prosecuting wrongdoing in its ranks.</p> <p>In a statement on Wednesday, the military said it had closed a total of seven investigations without filing charges after a special team collected testimony from Gaza residents and Israeli officers.</p> <p>The deadliest incident involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/israel-bombards-rafah-soldier-disappears-gaza-ceasefire-collapse\">an airstrike in the southern Gaza town of Rafah</a> on 1 August 2014, that killed 15 members of the Zoroub family.</p> <p>The army said the building was used by Hamas as a command and control centre. While its statement suggested that the civilian casualties were higher than expected, it said the airstrike was in line with international law, which can allow attacks on homes used for military purposes. It said that among the dead was Nazmi Zoroub, whom it identified as a senior Hamas commander.</p> <p>\u201cThe attack complied with the principle of proportionality, as at the time the decision to attack was taken it was considered that the collateral damage expected to arise as a result of the attack would not be excessive in relation to the military advantage anticipated from it,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Adel Zoroub, whose sister\u2019s home was destroyed, rejected the army\u2019s findings. He said Nazmi Zoroub was wounded in a different Israeli attack and was not in the building.</p> <p>The army also said it would not file charges over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/israel-air-strike-un-school-gaza-rafah\">the shelling of a United Nations school in the southern Gaza town of Rafah</a> in which 10 people died. The attack was strongly condemned by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, while the United States called it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.</p> <p>The military report said that shortly before the incident three Palestinian fighters were spotted riding a motorcycle in Rafah. A decision was made to make an airstrike on them using a low-explosive missile to minimise damage to surroundings and after a sweep of the area showed no civilians in harm\u2019s way.</p> <p>It said that after the missile was launched the men unexpectedly headed off a roundabout with multiple exits, toward the school gate.</p> <p>The report said the Military Advocate General\u2019s examination concluded that proper procedures were followed.</p> <p>The army also said it found no wrongdoing in a 21 July 2014, incident that left 12 members of the Siyam family in Rafah dead. It said it could not find evidence to back claims that they were killed by an Israeli airstrike and that they had in fact been killed by mortar shells misfired by Palestinian militants.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The army also found no wrongdoing in an airstrike a day earlier that killed seven members of the Ziyadeh family in the Bureij refugee camp. It said the building had been used as a command and control center by Hamas and that several militants, including three members of the family and a top Hamas military leader, were among the dead.</p> <p>The Ziyadeh family declined to comment and Siyam family members could not immediately be reached.</p> <p>Israel launched the war in response to weeks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/08/israel-steps-up-offensive-against-gaza-live-updates\">heavy rocket fire by Palestinian militants</a> in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. During 50 days of fighting, more than 2,200 Palestinians were killed, and 73 people on the Israeli side were killed. More than 1,400 Palestinian civilians were among the dead, according to UN figures.</p> <p>Israel says Hamas is responsible for the high civilian death toll, saying the group used the local population as human shields while firing rockets from residential areas.</p> <p>A 2015 UN investigation found evidence of war crimes by both sides, saying Israel appeared to have used disproportionate force and endangered civilians. It also criticised Hamas for firing rockets indiscriminately toward civilian areas in Israel.</p> <p>The international criminal court has opened a preliminary examination of Israeli conduct in the war, but issued no conclusions. The court can intervene in cases where a country is deemed incapable of conducting a proper investigation.</p> <p>The military says it looked into some 360 complaints connected to the war. It has found enough evidence to launch around 31 criminal investigations. At least 13 of those probes have been closed, with indictments in only three cases of alleged looting by soldiers.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cEvery time an ethnic person comes on screen, 50,000 people change the channel.\u201d<br></p> <p>I was relatively new to the world of television when I heard an executive say that in a meeting. I was both stunned and acutely aware that I held the least amount of power in the room. </p> <p>Later a colleague explained to me the concept of minute-by-minute ratings, which pinpoint the exact moment viewers change the channel or turn off their TV.

I\u2019ve experienced an entire culture of resistance when it comes to diversity on-screen. I remember a production meeting on a different show later in my career, when I pointed out to the crew present that casting the only Asian actor in an entire series to play a criminal would be problematic. My solution was to cast another Asian actor in a positive role \u2013 at that stage a few police officers were up for grabs. </p> <p>Unfortunately, nobody else shared my view \u2013 or if they did, they chose not to vocalise it. You could argue that the resistance was less to diversity than it was to a mouthy young writer who hadn\u2019t earned the right to offer opinions on casting; television can be very territorial like that. Either way, there was a palpable reaction to the challenging of the status quo, and another Asian actor got to add \u201ccriminal\u201d to their IMDB page. (And no, I didn\u2019t succeed in getting another Asian character in the mix.)</p> <p>In television as in most industries, the higher you are in the ranks, the more weight is given to your opinion. If you\u2019re just starting out and push for a more inclusive industry, the people above you will tend to just hear you calling them prejudiced. And in my experience, their first response will be to deny that a problem exists: Australian television <em>does </em>accurately reflect our society, and if you think otherwise, that\u2019s <em>your </em>problem. </p> <p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/24/indigenous-well-represented-on-australian-tv-but-diversity-has-long-way-to-go-report\">research released this week by Screen Australia</a>, which I consulted on, this fingers-in-the-ears argument has been officially decommissioned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/sa/newsroom/news/2016/mr-160824-study-of-diversity-on-tv-released?platform=hootsuite\">Seeing Ourselves: Reflections on Diversity in TV Drama</a> is the first analysis in 14 years into diversity on Australian scripted television. The results confirm that a gulf exists between the diversity we see in our day to day lives, and what is depicted on-screen. Our television is not progressing at the same rate as Australia is diversifying, with non-European minorities \u2013 including from Indian, Asian and Middle Eastern backgrounds \u2013 accounting for only 6% of on-screen characters, despite making up 17% of the Australian population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"452992ae79a804a166e880702940347bca24d329\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/452992ae79a804a166e880702940347bca24d329/0_0_3988_1938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graph from Screen Australia\u2019s 2016 report on diversity in Australian TV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"486\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The biggest disparity from population to screen befell people with a disability. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 18% of Australians reported having a disability in 2012, but only 4% of the main characters in Australian TV dramas broadcast between 2011 and 2015 were identifiably characters with a disability. The report shows that we are also still lacking when it comes to LGBTQI representation.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s not all bad news: Indigenous Australians make up 3% of the population and are represented at 5% on screen, a success which the head of the Indigenous department at Screen Australia, Penny Smallacombe, said came down to having more Indigenous decision-makers behind the scenes, and government and funding initiatives supporting them.</p> <p>This brings us to an interesting point. While the Screen Australia study did not attempt to capture the diversity of people behind the scenes in the television industry, according to 2011 census data 73% of people in the screen industries are from Anglo-Celtic backgrounds compared with 67% among other industries. The Screen Australia report says \u201ca diversity of backgrounds among decision-makers as well as producers, directors and writers\u201d will facilitate diversity in content. </p> <p>The benefits go beyond simply social inclusion; there is growing research to support the idea of the \u201cdiversity dividend\u201d. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters\">McKinsey research from 2015</a>, companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to outperform their respective national industry medians. Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http://www.bunchecenter.ucla.edu/index.php/2016/02/new-2016-hollywood-diversity-report-business-as-usual/\">UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report</a> found that TV shows with culturally diverse casts rate better than shows without.</p> <p>We\u2019ve all intuitively felt that our screens were underperforming on diversity. Still, as someone who has fought for diversity from the inside \u2013 sometimes unsuccessfully \u2013 I can\u2019t overstate how important it is to have official data from our federal screen funding agency to help me make my case.

The ABC, our tax-funded broadcaster, could set a diversity target: increasing the current 18% of characters from non-Anglo-Celtic backgrounds to match the population of 32% by 2020, for instance. </p> <p>We have seen the massive <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/cinema-culture-richer-after-rise-of-indigenous-voices-20130604-2no4e.html\">gains</a> made in Indigenous screen content thanks to targeted state and federal funding and commitment from training institutions, production companies and broadcasters. Our guilds and production companies could <a href=\"http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/funding-and-support/industry-audience-development/production/enterprise-industry\">apply for funding</a> to create behind-the-scenes placements for people from diverse backgrounds. </p> <p>Or here\u2019s one that wouldn\u2019t cost a cent: imagine if Screen Australia didn\u2019t fund any project where the keys creatives hadn\u2019t undertaken <a href=\"http://www.dga.org/events/2015/june2015/diversity_bias0415.aspx\">subconscious bias training</a>.

  "<p>Baltimore police on Wednesday acknowledged for the first time that city residents had been subject to aerial surveillance, after a Bloomberg Businessweek story <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-baltimore-secret-surveillance/\">revealed</a> that airborne cameras had snapped continuous photos in cooperation with the police since January.</p> <p>Police spokesman TJ Smith insisted that the privately funded agreement between Persistent Surveillance Systems and city police \u201cwas not a secret surveillance program\u201d. Before Wednesday, not even the mayor, city council, and board of estimates had been told about the program.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no conspiracy not to disclose it,\u201d Smith said.</p> <p>Many officials and activists thought otherwise. The office of the public defender issued a statement saying that the \u201csecrecy of the program has precluded any oversight of the technology\u2019s use\u201d and warned of \u201cabuses that are ripe from its use\u201d.</p> <p>American Civil Liberties Union senior policy analyst Jay Stanley said it was \u201cstunning that American police forces feel that they can use deeply radical and controversial surveillance systems\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/baltimore-police-secretly-running-aerial-mass-surveillance-eye-sky\">in a blogpost</a>.</p> <p>Persistent Surveillance Systems began working in Baltimore in January, as first reported by Bloomberg Businessweek. The Ohio-based company provides data gleaned from its aerial surveillance to police as they investigate crimes in the city. </p> <p>It works, according to founder Ross McNutt, like \u201cGoogle Earth with Tivo\u201d: megapixel cameras on a Cessna aircraft continuously photograph the city. </p> <p>The wide-area imagery used by the program allows the the department to film 32 square miles of the city in a fashion that allows investigators to move back and forth in time, following suspects. Ross McNutt, the founder of Persistent Surveillance, which owns and operates the technology, said that his company had provided the police with 102 \u201cinvestigation briefs\u201d but not all of those led to arrest.</p> <p>The program, according to Smith, was in use for 100 hours between January and February and another 200 hours over the summer. The small plane will continue to surveil the city for a few more weeks, when the department will begin to evaluate whether to enter into a permanent agreement.</p> <p>\u201cThis effectively is a mobile CitiWatch camera,\u201d Smith said, referring to the system of nearly 700 manually operated surveillance cameras spread throughout the city. \u201cBut we see a larger area than what we see with the CitiWatch camera, but what we lose is the clarity ... This is so far in the sky where the person on the ground becomes unidentifiable at this point.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the near real-time ability to follow up on a situation after a 911 call is made,\u201d said Smith. </p> <p>He provided the example of a February case in which an elderly brother and sister were shot in the area of Walbrook Junction. </p> <p>\u201cThe information that we gleaned from that data assisted our investigators in identifying that suspect,\u201d he said. </p> <p>McNutt says that two supreme court cases in the 1980s legally justify the program.</p> <p>The company says the imagery data, which is stored for 45 days unless it is part of investigation, can only be accessed by the company\u2019s analysts, who in turn provide information to \u201cdetectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys and the courts\u201d.</p> <p>Government surveillance expert Jake Laperruque said the surveillance currently practiced by Baltimore police is in unclear legal standing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s currently being litigated in a number of areas,\u201d said Laperruque, a privacy fellow at the Constitution Project thinktank. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case to be made, based on what the supreme court has said in the past, that there is a constitutional right to be free from pervasive location tracking without court authorization.\u201d</p> <p>He added that, absent answers from the Baltimore police about when and how the surveillance technology is used, there \u201cdefinitely is potential for serious abuse\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to say that the Baltimore police couldn\u2019t zoom in on a protest, on a religious ceremony, on an abortion clinic, or just to track people in an arbitrary or improper manner?,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>This is not the first time that McNutt\u2019s company has contracted with domestic law enforcement, or even the first time the company has worked with Baltimore. McNutt <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bal-fbi-admits-providing-air-support-to-baltimore-police-during-freddie-gray-unrest-20150506-story.html\">told the Baltimore Sun</a> last year that his company has previously operated in the city for a brief period in 2008. McNutt\u2019s company also surveilled Compton, California, for the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s department and Dayton, Ohio, in previous trial programs.<br></p> <p>Like the Baltimore program, the trial in Compton was launched with no disclosure by authorities. </p> <p>Stanley, of the ACLU, nodded to all this history and his organization\u2019s own requests for more information on these programs.</p> <p>\u201cDespite all the public questioning and statements of concern by us and others, and our freedom-of-information requests, and the extensive <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/surveillance-planes-spotted-in-the-sky-for-days-after-west-baltimore-rioting/2015/05/05/c57c53b6-f352-11e4-84a6-6d7c67c50db0_story.html\">press</a> <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4b3f220e33b64123a3909c60845da045/fbi-behind-mysterious-surveillance-aircraft-over-us-cities\">coverage</a> the FBI\u2019s Baltimore flights received, the Baltimore police did not see fit to ask the public\u2019s permission to use this startling new technology on the city\u2019s population,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump may be struggling to capture a majority of voters in the heartland of America, but there is one eastern European precinct he would likely carry in a landslide \u2013 if only they were allowed to vote in US elections. </p> <p>The town of Veles, Macedonia (population 44,000), is the unlikely home for dozens of avowedly pro-Trump political news sites, featuring headlines like Hillary\u2019s Illegal Email Just Killed Its First American Spy and This is How Liberals Destroyed America, This Is Why We Need Trump in the White House.</p> <p>The Guardian has identified more than 150 domains registered to people claiming addresses in Veles, though not all of those are associated with active websites. </p> <p>Some claim to garner millions of page views per month. Most others are relatively obscure. All of them exist primarily for one reason \u2013 to cash in on the seemingly endless appetite for news about Donald Trump. And they\u2019re getting a big boost from Facebook. </p> <h2><strong>Fake names and death threats</strong></h2> <p>The creator of a popular Macedonian site, \u201cAlex\u201d claims that he was one of the first of his countrymen to write about US politics. (Alex is not his real name, and he spoke on condition of anonymity.) He claims his neighbors copied his idea and have capitalized on the Trump wave. According to Alex, his site gets more than 1m visits a month, roughly half of them driven by his Facebook page. </p> <p>\u201cWe are an independent news magazine with [our] primary goal to influence American policy, especially politics,\u201d says Alex, who originally favored Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries. \u201cThen my city fellows saw what I was doing and started to copy my work. They are just looking to earn money from ad networks.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, these foreign sites probably wouldn\u2019t exist without their domestic counterparts, from whom they crib many of their stories. (Alex admits he started out by copying and pasting stories from conservative US news sites but says he\u2019s recently hired a half-dozen US-based writers to produce original content.)</p> <p>There are hundreds of relatively obscure political sites registered on this side of the Atlantic that grab news from mainstream outlets, rewrite the headlines to be click-friendly, and blast them out to their readers using Facebook. </p> <p>Many of these sites are registered privately, and the author names that appear on their pages are often fictitious or nonexistent. Using the search engines provided by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.domaintools.com/\">Domain Tools</a>, the Guardian was able to comb through historical domain name records and contact the owners of some of these sites. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Writing a clickbaity headline and dashing off 400 words in 15 minutes is not a skill they teach in journalism school</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At <a href=\"http://bipartisanreport.com/\">Bipartisan Report</a>, a left-leaning news site, about two-thirds of the authors use pseudonyms, says publisher Justin Brotman.

The ability to write a clickbaity headline, toss in some user-generated video found on YouTube, and dash off a 400-word post in 15 to 30 minutes is a skill they don\u2019t teach in journalism school, says Wade, who graduated from the University of Tennessee with a degree in advertising. </p> <p>Three months after launching the site, Liberty Writers News gets up to 700,000 visitors a day, a number that has been doubling every month. Again, though, they owe nearly all of that growth to Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cAbout 95% of our traffic is coming from Facebook,\u201d Wade says. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LibertyWritersNews/\">Liberty Writers News page</a> has about 150,000 likes, but by sharing stories with other like-minded Facebook pages, they can extend their reach to as many as 7m or 8m viewers, he adds. </p> <p>They spend around $3,000 a month paying Facebook to promote the page. Once they started doing that, their traffic doubled, says Wade.</p> <p>They also end some stories with enthusiastic cries to \u201c*** Share this right now! Let\u2019s beat the liberal media to it. Share, share, share it all over Facebook.\u201d </p> <p>But what Facebook gives, it also takes away, Goldman adds. If one of their stories gets shared too quickly, Facebook assumes it is spam and throttles it for a period of time, which reduces the number of people who can see it in their news feed. That doesn\u2019t happen to mainstream sites such as the New York Times or Washington Post, he adds.</p> <p>Those sites feature a blue check mark on their Facebook pages, certifying they are authentic brands. That\u2019s one of the reasons the pair are talking to the press \u2013 to establish their credentials as a legitimate news organization so Facebook will stop throttling them. </p> <p>\u201cWe want that blue check mark,\u201d Wade says. </p> <p>The US presidential election will be over in less than three months. Regardless of the outcome, Trump fever is likely to subside, possibly leaving many of these sites without their biggest source of traffic. Goldman and Wade say they\u2019ll just transition to covering other news about politics or celebrities. \u201cPeople love stories about celebrities,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Even Alex the Macedonian publisher is not worried. \u201cI think my traffic will be fine if Trump doesn\u2019t win,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are too many haters on the net, and all of my audience hates Hillary.\u201d</p>",

There were nine wickets down at the time and Davidson led the last wicket partnership to give Australia a winning lead. I was 9, watching a black and white telly, sickeningly gripped.

  "<p>Extra time was beckoning and the murmurings of discontent were becoming audible when, with one imperious swipe of his right foot, Adnan Januzaj dispersed the growing Wearside gloom.</p> <p>The Manchester United loanee\u2019s glorious turn and shot into the top corner from outside the area not only gave David Moyes his first win as Sunderland\u2019s manager but also offered reasonable compensation for a horribly laboured home performance from an extremely young side.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed,\u201d said Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury\u2019s manager who saw the substitute George Waring miss a presentable headed chance at the death. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my players. The only difference was that, in one moment, Januzaj showed why he\u2019s worth millions.\u201d Moyes, whose side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/24/northampton-town-manchester-united-efl-cup-third-round-draw\" title=\"\">visit QPR in the third round</a>, body-swerved the post-match press conference.</p> <p>Until Januzaj\u2019s intervention, a sub-14,000 crowd had been seriously underwhelmed by Sunderland\u2019s failure to outmanoeuvre League One opposition. In mitigation, a lengthy casualty list dictated Moyes\u2019s central midfield was again staffed by non-specialists.</p> <p>In the rested Jermain Defoe\u2019s absence Joel Asoro enjoyed his first senior start. Strong and speedy, the 17-year-old Swedish striker quickly caught the eye but it seems Sunderland\u2019s manager is far from his only fan. Indeed Paris Saint-Germain are reputedly monitoring the progress of a forward eventually hoping to follow in the footsteps of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/david-moyes-lamine-kone-sunderland\">David Moyes keen to keep Lamine Kon\u00e9 but rues Sunderland budget restraints</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moyes sees Asoro more as \u201ca young Defoe\u201d and hopes he can add goals to some slick link-up play. If the youngster failed to trouble Shrewsbury\u2019s goalkeeper, Jayson Leutwiler, all that much, his change of pace did swiftly see Gary Deegan booked for crudely flattening him. Moreover, Leutwiler made an important block to deny Patrick van Aanholt following Asoro\u2019s clever swivel and flick and, then, much later, the teenager should have had a penalty after being upended by Adam El-Abd.</p> <p>That little cameo temporarily lifted a decidedly flat atmosphere in which shirt-sleeved supporters who had spent the day basking in warm sunshine soon started shivering as a damp, chill mist began rolling in off the North Sea.</p> <p>With the unsettled Lamine Kon\u00e9 still absent from the teamsheet, Moyes once again deployed Jack Rodwell at centre-half and finally found a place for Wahbi Khazri wide on the left.</p> <p>Khazri had an early headed chance but directed it wide after connecting with Donald Love\u2019s cross. R<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/11/sunderland-sign-manchester-united-pair-paddy-mcnair-donald-love\" title=\"\">ecently arrived from Manchester United</a>, Love had some uneasy moments at right-back but with the former Liverpool loan signing Javier Manquillo undergoing a medical on Wednesday night after agreeing to swap Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for Sunderland, he could soon be given time to properly find his feet.</p> <p>Moyes\u2019s players \u2013 who could soon also be joined by Vicente Iborra, the Sevilla defensive midfielder \u2013 were dominating possession without really hurting Shrewsbury.</p> <p>If Januzaj\u2019s wing play invariably delighted, his final ball, initially at least, had an unfortunate habit of letting him down. Similarly when an inviting chance fell to Steven Pienaar, the South African\u2019s shot flew over the bar in the wake of a surging, exhilarating, advance.</p> <p>Defensively intelligent and well organised, Mellon\u2019s side were unambitious in the attacking sense, with Jordan Pickford in the Sunderland goal coping easily enough with Louis Dodds\u2019s early header. Later Ivan Toney, on loan from Newcastle United and impressing here, forced Pickford into a fine diversion of his dangerously swerving right foot shot.</p> <p>Moyes, meanwhile, could have done with Asoro scoring rather than shooting straight at Leutwiler after meeting Januzaj\u2019s inviting cross but the latter would soon save his night. Sure enough, seven minutes from time Duncan Watmore and Khazri cued up the Belgian for his evening-changing moment and, finally, Sunderland\u2019s manager had something to smile about.</p>",
  "<p>If this is to prove Joe Hart\u2019s swansong he was given a stylish send-off by Manchester City fans who left Pep Guardiola with zero doubt regarding their affection for the 29-year-old. On 65 minutes the support sang \u201cStand up if you love Joe Hart\u201d and the Etihad Stadium rose to create a moment that was touching and one the under-pressure goalkeeper may never forget.</p> <p>It was that kind of night throughout. The actual game was academic given the 5-0 lead City held over Steaua Bucharest from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/steaua-bucharest-manchester-city-champions-league-play-off-match-report\">last week\u2019s opening leg</a> in Romania. Hart had finally been selected by the manager for the side\u2019s fourth match of the season, and asked to help seal a place for City in Thursday\u2019s Champions League group stage draw.</p> <p>This they duly did, and Guardiola\u2019s choice of captain was classy. Hart wore the armband as Yaya Tour\u00e9 also made a first appearance of the season. The Ivorian lined up in an XI that showed eight changes from Saturday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/stoke-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">4-1 dismantling of Stoke City</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/24/joe-hart-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-steaua-bucharest\">Joe Hart enjoys \u2018special night\u2019 but Pep Guardiola stands by demotion decision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The evening began with Hart offering a thumbs-up to applauding fans following his warm-up and cheers from them when his first touch with a boot proved a sure-footed pass.</p> <p>As a super-sized banner was unfurled bearing the legend \u201cTHIS IS YOUR CITY\u201d with a picture of Guardiola over a streetscape of Manchester landmarks, the Catalan\u2019s full-backs were again adopting a tactic first spotted on opening day here. This featured Ga\u00ebl Clichy and the 19-year-old Spaniard Pablo Maffeo, a right-back on debut, moving infield to become de facto midfielders when City attacked.</p> <p>Also notable was the near-constant conversation Guardiola had with John Stones in the opening part of the half. The central defender took instructions on where and when to pass and was told as vehemently to relay similar instructions to defensive colleagues. Stones was also a main channel via which much of City\u2019s play began, stroking long and short passes around in the manner for which he was bought.</p> <p>After 25 minutes there had been scant action in either goalmouth. Nolito managed one volley on the turn, though it was hit weakly at Valentin Cojocaru in the visiting goal. Later Fabian Delph, who partnered Fernando in midfield, found space and fired a low shot but again it failed to trouble the goalkeeper.</p> <p>Hart did not deal as smoothly with a Steaua corner. When it was delivered he rose to punch the ball away only to be left flapping as Tour\u00e9 beat him to it. This was the closest Laurentiu Reghecampf\u2019s team had come to clawing back one of the five unanswered goals they required to take this tie into extra time. Three minutes before the interval Hart mis-controlled a regulation backpass, hardly helping to support the idea Guardiola is unfairly maligning him for a clumsy touch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c60094fa5d0a7e68b7cf4d6e086b57e89621d823\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c60094fa5d0a7e68b7cf4d6e086b57e89621d823/0_66_1956_1174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Hart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Hart saluted the crowd following a second half in which a string of songs rang from the stands in appreciation of the Manchester City goalkeeper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Catalan\u2019s drive for perfection meant he would demand a step up in quality for the second half. As Hart wandered to the goal before the south stand he was regaled with \u201cCity\u2019s No1\u201d and, wryly, \u201cHe\u2019ll pass when he wants\u201d. There did indeed follow some deft control and an offload with his right boot, and he watched as seconds later Stones rose in Steaua\u2019s area. The former Everton man\u2019s header was wide of Cojocaru\u2019s right post, however.</p> <p>Eight minutes after the interval Reghecampf made a move, taking off Adnan Aganovic and Ovidiu Popescu for Adrian Popa and Nicolae Stanciu, the latter a player who is interesting Premier League clubs. It did not help Steaua as City promptly roved towards Cojocaru\u2019s goal and opened the scoring. This was regulation stuff as Jes\u00fas Navas stood the ball up and Delph headed expertly past the keeper. It was the midfielder\u2019s third goal for the club and took City to a 6\u20110 aggregate lead.</p> <p>It also meant Guardiola could make his own substitutions and rest two key men. Off came Nolito for the 19-year-old Jos\u00e9 Tasende \u2013 also known as Angeli\u00f1o \u2013 and Stones for Tosin Adarabioyo, 18 \u2013 both were making their bows in the competition.</p> <p>The City manager stopped Stones as he strode past to have yet another word regarding tactics and in-game strategy, during what was now a glorified training session. There was also chat with Aleksandar Kolarov about similar matters during a stop in play moments later.</p> <p>Then came the home faithful taking to their feet to applaud Hart, the keeper appearing to touch the City crest and showing understandable emotion. Hart\u2019s concentration held still, though, as at one point he, fresh from a vote of confidence from England manager Sam Allardyce, raced out to hoof the ball to safety, and in another ensured his defence marshalled a rare Steaua attack.</p> <p>A late injury to Kelechi Iheanacho \u2013 he pulled up when chasing a ball down, and Guardiola later said he does not know how serious the problem is \u2013 was the only sour note. Unless you are Hart, of course, who acknowledged the stands at length after the final whistle. Despite the sentiment, deep down he will be hurting.</p>",

Or not. Steaua Bucharest are hoping to pull off something unprecedented, as no team has ever won a tie after losing the first leg 5-0 (or even 4-0), so the Romanian champions are out to defy the course of history as well as of financial tyranny. It can\u2019t be ruled out completely because City, despite Chelsea\u2019s attempt last season, remain the only English champions to be relegated the year after winning the title (in 1938, when they managed to go down despite being top scorers in the league). Cititis is a very real ailment and still lurks somewhere in the club\u2019s DNA. Still and all, tonight\u2019s underdogs look exceptionally scrawny in comparison to a City side that Pep Guardiola is striving to transform into a properly mean beast. They have already hinted at newfound ruthlessness under the Catalan even if they let Steaua off somewhat in the first leg, missing two penalties and a bevy of other chances en route to their 5-0 victory. Back in 1980 Ajax lost 4-0 to Omonia Nicosia after winning the first leg 10-0 (gifting commentators a long-awaited opportunity to declare \u201cthat\u2019s a big 10-4 good buddy\u201d) but Guardiola is unlikely to stand for any such carelessness tonight. He\u2019ll be demanding blood from what should be a dead rubber. </p> <p>Another sign of Guardiola\u2019s ruthlessness \u2013 or of his coherent planning if you want to be less dramatic about it \u2013 is his apparent willingness to discard Joe Hart. But the manager is not totally devoid of sentiment and has given the keeper a start and even the captains armband tonight. It\u2019s a chance, perhaps, to make a farewell appearance. At this point only the callous of heart would crack a joke about waving haplessly at crosses. Wonder if Yaya Tour\u00e9 has been included tonight for similar reasons? And who knows what Pablo Maffeo\u2019s role in Guardiola\u2019s plans is: the 19-year-old right-back makes his senior debut tonight for the club he\u2019s been at for a several years. He was on loan in his native Spain last season and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how he takes to Guardiola\u2019s ambitious fullback-cum-playmaker wheeze. Better than Bacary Sagna, quite possibly.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T18:03:35.385Z\">at 7.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57bd7b77e4b0fe30498a44a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T10:51:10.245Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TEAMS:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>City</strong>: Hart; Maffeo, Stones, Kolarov, Clichy; Fernando, Tour\u00e9, Delph; Nolito, Navas; Iheanacho </p> <p><strong>Subs</strong>: Gunn, Adarabioyo, Angelino, Fernandinho, Silva, Sterling, Aguero</p> <p><strong>Steaua</strong>: Cojocaru; Aganovic, Tamas, Mitrea, Momolovic; Bourceanu; Enache, Sulley, Popescu, Hamroun; Tudorie</p> <p><strong>Subs</strong>: Nita, Simion, Stanciu, Calceanu, Achim, Popescu, Popa</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T18:02:52.930Z\">at 7.02pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Located in suburban Massachusetts, the small, private liberal arts school is already unique in its admissions and curriculum, with no SAT or ACT tests required for admission \u2013 and its orientation stands out as well. Throughout the week, students are grouped by topics of first-year seminar courses they choose, such as Syria and the Refugee Crisis or Black Protest Traditions in African American Dance. Once orientation ends, students in the groups become classmates in the corresponding courses. They can then attend optional, student-designed programs such as veganism 101, an introduction to game development or zine making \u2013 scissors, glue sticks, paper, collage materials, and a typewriter provided.</p> <p>Hampshire student and orientation leader Grusha Prasad will host a session called \u201cGet washed over by brainwave awesomeness!\u201d, in which she and another student will measure the freshmen\u2019s brainwaves. A senior studying linguistics, neuroscience and computer science, Prasad planned the event herself in hopes of introducing students to the school\u2019s cognitive science department. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s cool to see their brainwaves but can get intimidated by neuroscience,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a586a7ce98a534b2c4c839701b260ea2c823a855\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a586a7ce98a534b2c4c839701b260ea2c823a855/0_120_2000_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hampshire College, Massachusetts - move in day and orientation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orientations offer varying strategies to reach the same goal: making students film welcome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Schwengel/Hampshire College</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the last two years, Prasad has held Quidditch matches, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/22/quidditch-leaves-harry-potter-behind-as-real-world-cup-fever-grows\">increasingly popular sport</a> (especially on college campuses) based on the Harry Potter series. Students make their own brooms and bond over which Hogwarts houses they would want to be sorted into.<br></p> <p>Joyce Holl, executive director of the National Orientation Directors Association, said experiences that provide connection and engagement during orientation are vital to student retention. \u201cOrientation is not just about registering for classes. It\u2019s important, but the big piece is students having connections and being able to feel like they\u2019re welcomed and that this is the place for them.\u201d</p> <p>A number of colleges use outdoor orientations \u2013 such as hiking or camping in the wilderness \u2013 to welcome students to college life. A <a href=\"http://jee.sagepub.com/content/37/1/31.abstract\">2014 study</a> in the Journal of Experiential Education found that there were nearly 200 in the US and Canada. </p> <p>At the College of the Atlantic in Maine, orientation begins with a weeklong outdoor trip with a small group of about 10 students and two student leaders. The college of 350 students has only one major, human ecology, in which students choose their own curriculum.</p> <p>Students can choose trips with a variety of difficulties, from canoeing down the Allagash river or sea kayaking around Frenchman Bay to rock climbing in Acadia national park. Senior Julie Bowser said it was a weeklong bonding experience. \u201cEvery trip will come back with their own social code or inside jokes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>When Bowser was a freshman, she chose sea kayaking. One morning, she and her group got up at 4am to pack up camp and kayak out for the day so they could go out with the tide. \u201cAt that time of day, the ocean looks like a lake \u2013 it\u2019s glassy and calm,\u201d Bowser said. Over the campfire that night, it was all anyone could talk about.</p> <p>\u201cI think that some of the college craziness that happens at other orientations at other schools, like, oh, we stayed up drinking until 4am \u2013 well, we can provide a different type of experience. We also did something crazy. We just got into kayaks at 4am under starlight.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Hendrix College Arkansas\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BJbT2pPgUwH/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;{ White River Canoeing } Orientation week is ending but life at Hendrix is just kicking off. #hendrixcollege&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Emelia M.

  "<p>Huge built-in delays in the processing of universal credit benefit claims have turned the government\u2019s flagship welfare reform into a \u201crecruiting sergeant for food banks\u201d, according to Labour MP Frank Field.</p> <p>Field, the chair of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said the minimum six-week payment period faced by new UC claimants led to reliance on emergency food parcels, triggered debt and rent arrears, and caused health problems.</p> <p>Field has written to the work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, asking him to cut the lengthy and stressful wait for payments faced by penniless claimants.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an unbelievably long time for people at the bottom to survive with no money, and I have received evidence to suggest people have been exposed to hunger and homelessness during this 42-day period,\u201d he wrote.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/18/flaws-universal-credit-system-vulnerable-people-penniless-citizens-advice-study\">lengthy wait for UC payments</a> was reported as the main cause of referral for one in nine of the 79 cases presenting at a food bank in his local Birkenhead, Merseyside, constituency in recent weeks, the veteran poverty campaigner said.</p> <p>The Department for Work and Pensions responded that it was misleading of Field to draw wider conclusions \u201cfrom the anecdotal evidence of just eight people\u201d. It said: \u201cThe reasons people use food banks are complex.\u201d</p> <p>However, Chris Mould, the chair of the Trussell trust food bank network, said the charity\u2019s local managers were reporting UC payment delays as a big cause of hardship for claimants: \u201cFor someone with no income the lengthy 42-day wait will leave them struggling to afford to eat and, for those without friends, family or other support networks to help, it can leave them desperate. </p> <p>\u201cWe wholeheartedly support the recommendation that this waiting time be reduced.\u201d</p> <p>A DWP spokesman added: \u201cUniversal credit is designed to mirror the world of work and give people control over their own finances. The vast majority of UC claimants are confident in managing their money and we provide budgeting support as well as benefit advances for people waiting for their first payment.\u201d</p> <p>The DWP has in the past argued that a 42-day wait is fair because people who lose their job can normally expect a final month\u2019s salary to fall back on. However Field said research by the House of Commons library showed 40% of claimants did not get a month\u2019s salary when they left employment.<br></p> <p>He called on Green to shorten the wait for benefits faced by new claimants, award the first month\u2019s claim up front, or make it easier for people to get an advance payment on reasonable repayment terms.</p> <p>In the letter seen by the Guardian, Field says problems brought to his attention which relate to the lengthy UC processing period include:</p> <p>\u2022 A 56-year old man in Oxfordshire who needed three charity food parcels and ran up rent arrears of \u00a3529 while waiting for his first UC payment;</p> <p>\u2022 A mother of four young children who was forced to live on \u00a31.50 a day while her UC claim was processed. Health issues attributed by Field to her not eating properly and failing to heat her home caused her to be hospitalised with lung and chest problems.</p> <p>Field said the waits were compounded by administrative delays caused by the failure of the DWP to swiftly notify local authorities of new UC claims. Until councils are notified, claimants cannot access locally administered benefits such as free school meals or council tax relief. In Liverpool, claim notifications lagged three to four weeks behind the official target, Field said.</p> <p>Although some UC claimants received benefit advances to help tide them over the 42-day wait, in some cases this merely deferred hardship because hefty deductions were made from the first few UC payments. In one instance cited by Field a claimant resorted to money lenders to help her through the four-month repayment period.</p> <p>\u201cI am much concerned that the combination of these issues ... is turning universal credit into a recruiting sergeant for food banks,\u201d Field said in the letter.</p> <p>The UC wait comprises a regular assessment period of one month (which determines how much the claimant should be paid), followed by a further week (or longer if there are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/19/welfare-system-failing-thousands-vulnerable-claimants-mps-long-waits-payments\">administrative problems</a>) for the payment to go through. In 2013 the former chancellor George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/26/osborne-jobseekers-allowance-seven-day-wait\">extended the wait even further</a> by introducing an additional seven-day period before a claim could be made. </p> <p>The all-party work and pensions select committee concluded in a<a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmworpen/372/37206.htm#_idTextAnchor033\"> report on benefit delivery</a> published last December that it was too early to assess the impact of the 42-day wait, but added that it was \u201cconcerned the DWP has not properly considered households who have no savings or a final paycheque to fall back on\u201d.</p> <p>Since then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/jul/22/no-money-for-over-a-month-how-benefit-delays-lead-to-hunger\">food banks</a>, <a href=\"http://file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/NFA%20%20ARCH%20Welfare%20Reform%20Survey%202016.pdf\">housing associations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/jun/09/debt-and-food-banks-the-legacy-of-universal-credits-long-hello\">welfare advisers</a> have reported that as universal credit is rolled out across the country, they are seeing growing evidence of claimants hit detrimentally by payment delays.</p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign team believe his public spat with Virgin trains boss Sir Richard Branson has boosted his chances in the Labour leadership race.</p> <p>Sam Tarry, the Labour leader\u2019s campaign director, told the Guardian that \u201cfrom the point of view of the people we want to mobilise, Richard Branson\u2019s done us a favour\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s already fractious leadership campaign had become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/23/jeremy-corbyn-virgin-trains-disputes-claim-over-lack-of-seats\">dominated in the last two days by the controversy</a>. </p> <p>Corbyn himself reacted angrily on Wednesday after being repeatedly asked about the row by journalists.</p> <p>But Tarry, a Labour councillor in Barking and Dagenham with links to the TSSA transport union, insisted the public spat had helped Corbyn, by highlighting his pledge to re-nationalise the railways. Tarry had earlier described Branson as a \u201ctax exile\u201d who was \u201claughing all the way to the bank\u201d.</p> <p>Corbyn faced several questions over his account of sitting on the floor of a \u201cram-packed\u201d Virgin service at an event on Wednesday, held to launch Labour\u2019s health policies in London.</p> <p>The rail operator disputed his story of being forced to sit on the floor of a crowded train, releasing CCTV footage of him apparently walking past free seats.</p> <p>Confronted about the row, Corbyn repeated the explanation his camp gave on Tuesday night, saying: \u201cI boarded a crowded train with a group of colleagues; we journeyed through the train looking for places; there wasn\u2019t a place for all of us to sit down, and so for 40 minutes or so we remained on the floor of the train, in the vestibule.\u201d He explained that a sympathetic train manager later found seats for him and his team, including his wife, by upgrading other passengers.</p> <p>Asked about the issue again by a Sky journalist later in the press conference, Corbyn initially refused to answer. \u201cCan we have an NHS question?\u201d he asked. But he went on to say: \u201cYes, I did look for two empty seats together to sit with my wife, so I could talk to her.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn added that he hoped Branson was \u201cwell aware of our policy, which is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/24/owen-smith-cctv-shows-jeremy-corbyn-chose-to-sit-on-train-floor\">train operating companies should become part of the public realm</a>, not the private sector\u201d.</p> <p>Inside Corbyn\u2019s team, key advisers were scrambling to understand how the row had run out of control on Tuesday, with some in the leaders\u2019 office \u2013 which is run separately to the campaign \u2013 complaining of too much freelancing.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s leadership team are said to have become increasingly frustrated at aggressive briefings in the press, including against the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and general secretary, Iain McNicol, and suggestions that Corbyn could launch a \u201cpurge\u201d of party figures if he wins the leadership election in September.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/24/jeremy-corbyn-clashes-with-journalist-over-train-row-questions-virgin-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x5gq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2680991\"            data-video-name=\"Corbyn clashes with journalist over train row questions \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bd77fce4b0568600c03d38\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/24/160823Corbyntrain_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/24/160823Corbyntrain.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/24/160823Corbyntrain_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/24/jeremy-corbyn-clashes-with-journalist-over-train-row-questions-virgin-video\">Corbyn clashes with journalist over train row questions \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One Labour source compared the campaign\u2019s chaotic approach to that of a \u201cpound shop Malcolm Tucker\u201d \u2014 referring to the foul-mouthed spin doctor in political satire The Thick of It. Another complained that the leader was impossible to reach for some time on Tuesday because he was making jam.</p> <p>Corbyn was speaking alongside the shadow health secretary, Diane Abbott, at the health policy launch. The pair announced a series of measures, including a pledge to restore nurses\u2019 bursaries and to attempt to buy hospitals out of costly private finance initiative contracts.</p> <p>Student nurse Danielle, introducing Corbyn, said: \u201cTo take away the bursary will not only deter students, it is one of the most insulting things I have seen this government do since they came to office.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn also said he would support a private members\u2019 bill tabled by Labour backbencher Margaret Greenwood aimed at unpicking the internal market in the NHS. </p> <p>That approach received support from David Owen, former Labour health secretary and one of the founders of the Social Democratic party. \u201cFor the first time in 14 years we have the leader of the Labour party today unequivocally committing the party to reversing the legislation which has created in England a broken down market-based healthcare system,\u201d Lord Owen said.</p> <p>\u201cSurely now the whole Labour movement can combine together, left, right and centre to make this official party policy at this year\u2019s autumn conference.\u201d</p> <p>However, there is still an open question over whether the conference will proceed, with the issue over what firm will provide security still unresolved, after the national executive committee voted to boycott longstanding provider G4S.</p> <p>Key Labour-supporting unions Unite and the GMB are at loggerheads over the issue. The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, in a letter to the GMB\u2019s Tim Roache, seen by the Guardian, said it was clear the conference would not go ahead following a GMB boycott.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the responsibility of the general secretary of the Labour party, Iain McNicol, to implement decisions or to deal with any problems that may arise,\u201d McCluskey wrote. \u201cI am astonished that we are only four to five weeks to conference and that he has not done so.</p> <p>\u201cIt is quite evident that in the event of a GMB boycott of conference, it simply won\u2019t proceed and the blame would lay squarely at the feet of Iain McNicol.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, it emerged that Virgin Trains faces an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/virgin-trains-faces-data-protection-inquiry-over-corbyn-cctv-footage\">investigation by the data protection watchdog over its release of the CCTV footage</a>.</p> <p>Officials at the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office are making inquiries over whether the train operator, owned by Branson, broke the rules of the Data Protection Act, which governs the release of such data.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 August 2016.

  "<p>From my house overlooking Managua, the city at night looks like an amusement park \u2013 more Walt Disney fantasy than the capital of the poorest country in the American continent. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-nicaragua-trees-20150524-story.html\">Gigantic metal trees</a>, each studded with hundreds of colored lights have been installed all over town. A few might have been fine, but 130 of them in our small city are overwhelming and kitsch. </p> <p>This makeover is the work of our eccentric first lady and future vice-president, Rosario Murillo: her way of imprinting herself in our lives. </p> <p>Considering what is going on in Nicaragua, I often feel I am immersed in a twisted, magical-realist novel. Everything that was not supposed to happen again in my country is coming back. </p> <p>We are reliving all that I thought had been eradicated when we, the Sandinista rebels, entered Managua on 19 July 1979 and ended 45 years of Somoza dynasty. </p> <p>What hurts the most, is to see the past return in the figure of our old comrade-in-arms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-ortega\">Daniel Ortega</a>. He and his wife have carefully woven a sticky web to trap Nicaraguans in a net of illusory progress.</p> <p>Ortega ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990and in 2007, he ran for re-election. </p> <p>I campaigned against him, certain that if he was re-elected, he would stay in power at all costs. </p> <p>Friends tried to convince me Nicaragua was no longer the same. After experiencing 16 years of budding democracy, people would reject his authoritarian tendencies, they said. </p> <p>But Ortega \u2013 aided by his wife \u2013 managed to sell himself to the Nicaraguan people as a democratic revolutionary.</p> <p>Murillo designed a campaign that promised peace and love. She covered the John Lennon song Give Peace a Chance and used it with her own lyrics as a campaign theme. </p> <p>Ortega and Murillo made amends with the Catholic church, and \u2013 after 25 years of living together \u2013 they were married by Managua\u2019s cardinal and former nemesis, Miguel Obando y Bravo. </p> <p>Miraculously, the couple went from dangerous atheists to fervent Christians from one day to the next. The illusion worked. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/08/1\">He got elected</a>. </p> <p>A hard-working, determined woman, with a quasi-superstitious belief in her mission as savior of the people, Murillo has been key in strengthening Ortega\u2019s hold on power. </p> <p>She defended her husband even when her daughter from her first marriage accused Ortega of sexually abusing her. Her loyalty paid off, and she obtained a great deal of power. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Ortega set about exerting absolute control over state institutions such as the electoral council, the supreme court, the national assembly, the army and the police.</p> <p>Then he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-second-terms\">reformed the constitution</a> to allow for indefinite re-elections. Most recently, in a coup de grace to any semblance of democracy, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/nicaragua-opposition-daniel-ortega-presidential-election\">took away</a> the legal representation of the only opposition force capable of challenging him in the 2016 elections, which he then assigned to sycophants guaranteed to do his bidding. </p> <p> </p> <p>Ortega had already announced in a speech that he would not accept international observers for the 6 November elections. \u201cShameless,\u201d he called them, \u201cthey should observe their governments, not us.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, Murillo began to appear more visibly in their political propaganda. While Ortega has not given one single press conference to the national media since 2007, every day at midday Murillo addresses the people on radio and TV, exalting the Christian, socialist and solidaristic nature of their political model.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/daniel-ortega-nicaraguan-sandinista-president-rosario-murillo\">Ortega named his running mate</a>: Rosario Murillo. </p> <p>The US and the European Union have expressed their concern, but Ortega has his anti-imperialist rhetoric at the ready and seems to relish the prospect of another round of defiance. For him, this is the second coming of the Sandinista revolution. </p> <p>So far, the Nicaraguan people have mostly been passive. Ortega and Murillo have used billions from Venezuela to give bonuses to state employees and farmers, to distribute roofing materials in poor neighborhoods and to finance a variety of social programs. </p> <p>Scared by the possibility of another bloody struggle, Nicaraguans have opted to take what they can and keep their opinions to themselves. </p> <p>Somoza had two sons to continue his dynasty, Ortega and Murillo have five sons and two daughters. </p> <p>Though they might feel very strong, we have seen this before. Nothing is for ever.</p>",

We hesitated going back into the house, and at about 4.30am there was an aftershock, a little less intense and shorter in time.</p> <p>We kept feeling minor shakes until the early morning. Most of the people have gone back inside, but decided to sleep on the ground floors rather than their usual first floor bedrooms, so that they could escape quickly if another strong quake happened. </p> <p>Some neighbours are looking for tents to sleep outside tonight, as there will probably be other aftershocks in the next few hours.

Eventually the tension builds up, and is released as the plates slide over one another.</p> <p>In this case, as has been reported, the first main quake was significant, being measured at magnitude 6.2. </p> <p>It\u2019s the largest there since April 2009 when a magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit the same region, killing at least 295, injuring more than 1,000 and leaving at least 55,000 homeless. It resulted in significant landsliding in the local area, and was also followed by a vigorous aftershock sequence, including five other events of magnitude 5.0 or larger.</p> <p>According to the US Geological Survey, the largest quake recorded in the area, of magnitude 6.7, took place on 13 January 1915, 68km to the south-southwest near Avezzano.

By then, the area had been hit by 400 tremors over a period of four months and a local researcher had warned of the risk of a major earthquake, largely on the basis of abnormal radon emissions.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T05:52:26.903Z\">at 6.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57bd2a8ce4b0fe30498a435d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T05:03:12.701Z\">6.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AFP is now reporting there has been a third confirmed death.

The railways should be owned by British people, not foreigners, she said. All our industry now is owned by foreigners, she asserted. And she has a point \u2013 under privatisation state-owned rail operators from the continent are able to buy up and operate rail franchises in the UK in a way that, since the break-up of British Rail, we can\u2019t do. <br></p> <p>By contrast, I spoke to Adam Pacitti in Coach B, who was fully in favour of nationalisation. A Labour supporter, who said he liked Corbyn, was concerned that press coverage had drummed home the idea that Corbyn was unelectable. The railway issue was a classic example of this. He said that on more than one occasion he had been forced to sit on the floor on a journey between London and Newcastle because the train has been overcrowded. He uses the route fortnightly, and had plenty of horror stories about broken heating or air-conditioning causing discomfort on the journeys.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Another passenger, Sef Townsend, was fully in favour of nationalisation. \u201cThere seems to be a dogma that privatised services work better.

He didn\u2019t do it too often, he said. He wasn\u2019t in favour of nationalisation, but he would like to see more central control and accountability so that train operating companies were responsible for \u201cthe promises they\u2019ve made\u201d.<br></p> <p>The Virgin Trains staff were understandably reluctant to go on the record after Richard Branson had publicly involved himself in a row with the Labour leader over train over-crowding, but speaking to them it was obvious who they thought was more likely to be painting a truer picture of the 11am service.<br></p> <p>On a sample walk-through of the 78 seat carriage E in standard class, a few minutes after departure, there were 19 unoccupied seats with tickets indicating reservations on them, 6 completely empty seats, and 5 seats where you could conceivably ask someone to move their bag and budge up a bit.</p> <p>When I get my ticket inspected I tried to engage the ticket inspector in conversation without mentioning that I\u2019m a journalist. \u201cPlenty of spare seats today \u2026 \u201d I said. \u201cAye, even enough for Mr Corbyn\u201d came the reply.<br></p> <p>Another member of the train crew said: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what this train is like.

Her customer experience of the railway franchise system was frustrating for her. She said it was difficult to buy tickets to make long journeys across the country and frustrating that different rail companies have different rules about tickets. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t go back to British Rail,\u201d she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>So this is what liberation looks like: four armed officers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-police-make-woman-remove-burkini-on-nice-beach?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">ordering a woman to undress in public</a>. France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has backed the mayors ordering \u201cburkini bans\u201d on their beaches by arguing, among other things, that the garment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/french-pm-supports-local-bans-burkinis\" title=\"\">is part of the enslavement of women</a>. The photos from Nice, in which a Muslim woman removes her tunic under duress, show that claim of upholding women\u2019s rights to be as erroneous as the others advanced in support of the measures \u2013 variously, that covering up for religious reasons while at the seaside or while swimming is unhygienic, or a \u201cprovocation\u201d, or contrary to French values. The images are preposterous as well as ugly, highlighting the profound mismatch between stated ideals and their consequence; and an imagined threat to the national community and the means used to subdue it, with multiple gun-toting policemen required to confront one sunbathing woman. Which French values are being defended is unclear. Not liberation; nor equality; nor fraternity \u2013 since women who wish to wear the burkini (or, it seems, the hijab and loose-fitting clothes) are confronted with a choice between dressing as they feel fit or removing themselves from a public space.</p> <p>The text of the Cannes ban refers to those who wear \u201costentatiously\u201d religious dress as disrespectful of good manners and la\u00efcit\u00e9, the French concept of secularism founded on freedom of conscience, a strict separation between religion and the state, and the freedom to exercise any faith. That reflects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/pork-school-dinners-france-secularism-children-religious-intolerance\" title=\"\">a deepening battle over the true meaning of the philosophy</a> and, in particular, an attempt by the right to clothe its xenophobia and Islamophobia more respectably. France is becoming increasingly politically polarised in the run-up to this November\u2019s rightwing primaries and next year\u2019s presidential election, the electoral calendar meshing alarmingly with the fallout from terrorist atrocities. The rise of Marine Le Pen and her party has encouraged others to buy into her rhetoric. Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s announcement this week that he would run again for top office came with a message clearly aimed at far-right voters. He promised to extend the ban on the hijab in schools to universities, to restrict access to benefits for women who repeatedly violate the existing burqa ban, and to scrap a law authorising immigrants to be reunited with their families. He has denounced \u201cthe tyranny of minorities\u201d.</p> <p>The Nice ban refers specifically to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/lorry-rams-bastille-day-crowd-in-nice-killing-at-least-70\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s Bastille Day attack in the city,</a> without mentioning that several of the 84 victims were Muslim, while the mayor of Cannes has described burkinis as referring to an allegiance to terrorist groups. Others have described them improbably as a provocation by Islamists (as if such groups were likely to urge women to bathe in form-fitting outfits on mixed-sex public beaches). It is hard to see the logical correlation. What can be said is that obsessing about the burkini is a good way to distract attention from the many social and economic reasons why young second and third generation immigrants may feel disenfranchised and harbour grievances against the republic \u2013 making some vulnerable to recruitment by extremists \u2013 and&#xa0;that it is likely to alienate more of them.</p> <p>Some politicians have cited the risk of public disorder and seem concerned primarily that growing distrust between parts of society could lead to violent clashes \u2013 such as a recent brawl in Corsica \u2013 particularly since the head of the domestic intelligence service has <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cea72c12-685a-11e6-a0b1-d87a9fea034f.html#axzz4IG3YQwNM\" title=\"\">warned that the far right is looking for confrontation</a>. They see the rules, perhaps, as pragmatic; they are, in fact, deeply unfair because they put the onus on Muslim women to prevent other people\u2019s criminality and avoid evoking their prejudice. Tomorrow France\u2019s highest administrative court will consider the legality of the bans. Though the political backdrop is complex, the issue remains simple. Women\u2019s right to dress as they feel comfortable and fitting should be defended against those coercing them into either covering or uncovering. Their bodies are their business.</p>",

The hysterical media coverage and the self-righteous and self-congratulatory attitude of comedians and commentators has been unbelievable and shameful.</p> <p>The sky didn\u2019t fall in. We are rid of George Osborne and his promise of yet more austerity and a threatened recession. As Larry Elliott says, if nothing else it has forced the government to take a long hard look at the British economy, something that would not have happened without the shock administered by the referendum.</p> <p>Of course there will be challenges and difficulties, but there would have been if we had stayed in an increasingly free-market Europe which has delivered high unemployment and austerity to so many of its citizens. The European project was a noble concept which has become increasingly dysfunctional. You can love Europe (and I do) without endorsing the EU, which is a political organisation.<br><strong>Jill Rooney</strong><br><em>Ashtead, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott\u2019s depiction of our economy entering into some post-Brexit sunlit uplands defies belief. Equally absurd is his criticism of the EU for moving in a more free-market direction. It is the EU that has tried to mitigate the ravages of the free market so assiduously promoted by recent British governments. Does he really believe that Britain under Theresa May is going to enhance these rights and protections?</p> <p>More disturbing is his bald statement that the European project has failed. Has it? It was set up to secure peace in Europe after half a century of terrible wars, and it has made and continues to make a vital contribution to peace. Now, as we face new threats from Isis and from Putin\u2019s Russia, the EU is more necessary than ever before. Britain\u2019s exit has profoundly weakened one of the main institutions providing peace and security in Europe.</p> <p>Most disturbing of all, however, is Elliott\u2019s desire to shake things up. Brexit&#xa0;has certainly done that. The rise in racism, xenophobia and fear have indeed shaken things up for millions of people in this country. In addition our country now faces the real risk of breaking up. But no doubt peace and security, racism and xenophobia and the breakup of the UK are a price worth paying for shaking things up.<br><strong>Dr Shane O\u2019Rourke</strong><br><em>Department of history, University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 The impact on savers is not mentioned in Larry Elliott\u2019s rosy post-Brexit analysis. The Bank of England has had to lower interest rates, and more may come in the autumn. Pensioners relying on savings to supplement their pension will certainly feel that the sky has fallen in as they pay the price of sorting out the mess.<br><strong>Ivan Laud</strong><br><em>Ashbourne, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Please can we have a full two-page debate between Larry Elliott and William Keegan (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/21/leavers-brexit-ashamed-harm-yet-to-come\" title=\"\">Leavers should be ashamed of the harm that is yet to come</a>, The Observer, 21 August).<br><strong>Professor Mike Elliott</strong><br><em>Leven, East Riding of Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Economists, politicians and journalists on both sides of the Brexit debate should know better and refrain from claiming the moral high ground each time a data point seems to give weight to their side of the argument. A Nobel prize in economics is not necessary to know that the consequences of Brexit will be unknown for many years to come, and until then everything should be considered aleatory \u201cnoise\u201d.</p> <p>There will only be one undeniable reality with Brexit: the UK and the EU will at the same time become trading partners and economic competitors (for&#xa0;future foreign investment).</p> <p>Once the new rules of engagement are finalised, it will require years of trials and tribulations to observe if the Brexit gamble pays off or not, the same way as it took decades to observe the relative economic decline of postwar Britain until, ironically, it joined the EU in 1973, with accession ratified in 1975 via referendum (please note the two-thirds majority) and oddly a majority of Conservatives favouring membership, a very split Labour party and an SNP totally against it.</p> <p>Maybe 2057 will be the year when future generations decide that their ancestors\u2019 \u201cnearly-no-skin-in-the-game\u201d gamble has not paid off (may they RIP), try to negotiate new terms for&#xa0;EU accession which will most likely be worse than the current ones from the early 1970s, and hold a referendum to WE-join the EU (assuming Scotland and Northern Ireland go their separate EU&#xa0;ways)?</p> <p>As the saying goes, history tends to repeat itself. Will it once more?<br><strong>Antero Touchard</strong><br><em>Madrid, Spain</em></p> <p>\u2022 As an ironic joke I proposed the launch of Brexit TV following the 23 June referendum result, which would only show reruns of sitcoms and Carry On films from before the UK joined the EU. Little did I realise that the BBC would really take us back to the 1970s, with Porridge and Are You Being Served? returning to our screens (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/23/keeping-up-appearances-are-you-being-served-porridge-till-death-us-do-part-return-bbc-sitcom-season\" title=\"\">New gags for old lags and plenty of jokes about a certain pet cat \u2013 the BBC goes back to the 70s</a>, 23&#xa0;August).<br><strong>Dr Alan Bullion</strong><br><em>Tunbridge Wells, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 In recent months the Guardian has referred repeatedly, and incorrectly, to \u201carticle 50 of the Lisbon treaty\u201d, most recently this week (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\" title=\"\">Two months on, EU exit is still a long way off</a>, 22 August). Let\u2019s be clear: there is no such article. The <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:FULL&amp;from=EN\" title=\"\">Treaty of Lisbon has only seven articles</a>. There is, however, Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This is the provision \u2013 inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon \u2013 that governs withdrawal. It would be useful if we all make sure we\u2019re reading and citing the right treaties.<br><strong>David Phinnemore</strong><br><em>Professor of European politics, Queen\u2019s&#xa0;University Belfast</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>That Britain\u2019s \u201cdivorce\u201d from the EU will take time, as discussed in Jennifer Rankin\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/brexit-trade-deals-gruelling-challenge-taking-back-control\" title=\"\">\u2018An unimaginably hard task\u2019: experts say divorcing EU will take 10 years</a>, 17 August), is undisputed, but the government should not be allowed to establish trading relations with the rest of the world that would merely mirror those of the European Union. Many people voted to leave because they were opposed to treaties being made with third countries that had less to do with trade and more to do with the hegemony of transnational corporations in the shaping of the global economy. Institutions such as the IMF and the OECD supported the opposite view because they correctly understood that the EU was a cornerstone of the neoliberal status quo and would be weakened by Britain\u2019s departure.</p> <p>So steeped have we become in neoliberal ideology that we cannot envisage a trading system that is not predicated upon free trade agreements and the rules of the World Trade Organisation. However, and contrary to the views expressed in your article, there is no need for British trade officials to \u201cpreserve UK ties to the 65 countries that have a trade agreement with the EU\u201d. Nor is there any compulsion to calculate what percentage of EU meat imports from South America accrue to the UK, or any other product for that matter. It is quite feasible to have international trade without prescriptive treaties.</p> <p>Once it has extricated itself from the tentacles of the European commission\u2019s trade mandate, Britain, as one of the world\u2019s largest economies, has a unique opportunity to trade with the rest of the world on a less exploitative and more equitable basis. Making this happen represents a huge challenge to those of us who have campaigned for too long against the worst aspects of EU free trade deals, only to see them replicated in a post-Brexit UK. <br><strong>Bert Schouwenburg</strong><br><em>International officer, GMB</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jennifer Rankin points out that at the moment we have no idea what Brexit means and that our negotiations face formidable obstacles, especially in new trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-conservative-leadership-bid-brexit-means-brexit-video\" title=\"\">Theresa May tells us \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d</a>, what she means is that the referendum verdict is final and irreversible. Indeed there is a widespread assumption that we are now bound to leave.</p> <p>But there is nothing sacrosanct about a referendum vote. If circumstances change dramatically before the date of our departure, which is at least three years away \u2013 if, for example, there is a massive change of public opinion in favour of remain \u2013 there would be every justification for a second referendum. And there is a strong likelihood that opinion will change.</p> <p>Most economists forecast a recession, and there are good reasons for pessimism. We are unlikely to follow Norway and remain members of the single market, as we would have to continue payments into the EU budget, could not regain control of our own borders, and would still be bound by EU regulations and directives, but without any say in their formulation.</p> <p>As it becomes clear that we will be excluded from the single market, more and more companies are likely to relocate to the continent. Uncertainty about future trade agreements will be bad for business investment and for the value of the pound. Perhaps most seriously, our huge trade deficit is financed by foreign capital, which may well flow out if the pound weakens further. We could face a serious recession, and more severe austerity.</p> <p>Leave campaigners promised us a glorious future outside the EU, with lots of extra money for the NHS. Before long, they may well feel they were sold a pup.<br><strong>Dick Taverne</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrats, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Larry Elliott blames \u201cproject fear\u201d, not Brexit, for undermining confidence. He is right that economists were nearly unanimous in opposing Brexit and he admits that it is still early days, but he is far too optimistic.</p> <p>How many economists believed there would be an immediate disaster before we even knew when or how Brexit would take place (or even if it will take place, given that negotiations might yet prove so complicated that the next general election comes first)? Most economists believed that there would be long-term costs and that whether they were large or small would depend on the deal that was negotiated. (A Norway-type deal might not have much effect, but immediate exit before negotiating any trade deals would be disaster.) So far we simply do not know what those long-term costs are going to be because we do not know what the government will do or how the negotiations will go.</p> <p>Larry Elliott picks out some seemingly good economic news. He omits the fact that, if it is not reversed (and it is not clear why it should be), the fall in the value of sterling has reduced our living standards permanently. The eventual cost could be much higher.</p> <p>As for the short term, if \u201cCity economists\u201d were forecasting immediate Armageddon, perhaps the lesson is that journalists should pay less attention to them and should listen more to academic economists. There were academic economists pointing out that short-term movements, which depend heavily on expectations, are hard to forecast. Maybe economists should have forecast a U-turn in policy towards the deficit (after six years when people who questioned the importance of reducing the deficit were ridiculed), that a sharp fall in the exchange rate would cause consumers to buy imported goods before prices rose, or that Olympic success would induce a feelgood factor, though it might be better to leave such speculations to City economists, concerned as much with day-to-day fluctuations in financial markets as with long-term prosperity.<br><strong>Roger Backhouse</strong><br><em>Professor of the history and philosophy of economics, University of Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 For the last decade, I\u2019ve worked on economic and foreign policy issues related to South Korea, and prior to that studied for my MPhil at LSE. As a result, I\u2019ve had a fondness for both South Korea and the United Kingdom. Over the years, as I\u2019ve focused on South Korea professionally, I\u2019ve often wondered why South Korea couldn\u2019t be more like the UK. Needless to say, I was somewhat surprised by Christian Spurrier\u2019s suggestion that the UK should look to South Korea for inspiration on how to prosper post-Brexit (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/south-korea-economy-britain-brexit\" title=\"\">Want proof that Britain can thrive after Brexit? Look at South Korea</a>, 22 August).</p> <p>For developing nations around the world, South Korea should be an inspiration. Turning a war-torn, resourceless country into one of the world\u2019s most developed economies in a generation\u2019s lifetime is one of the most significant achievements of the second half of the 20th century. Seoul\u2019s success is demonstrable proof that countries can chart a better future, but it\u2019s less clear that it offers lessons for advanced economies like the UK.</p> <p>South Korea aspires to be everything most took for granted about the UK before Brexit. It is moving towards becoming more multicultural and is actively seeking to attract the world\u2019s best and brightest. Immigration is a necessity for South Korea. It wants to connect to the Eurasian continent and has pursued free trade agreements with the US and the EU for the very reason of injecting reforms into its economy to help boost it to the heights of an economy like the UK\u2019s. If Spurrier wants South Korea to be the model for the post-Brexit UK, perhaps he needs only to look to the pre-Brexit UK for the way forward.<br><strong>Troy Stangarone</strong><br><em>Senior director, congressional affairs and trade, Korea Economic Institute</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

  "<p>In Hawaii, women make up half of their current congressional delegation, with one senator and one representative \u2013 both women of color. There, women make <a href=\"http://statusofwomendata.org/app/uploads/2015/08/Hawaii-Fact-Sheet.pdf\">about 83 cents</a> on the dollar compared to white men \u2013 a few cents above the national average of <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.org/initiatives/pay-equity-and-discrimination\">79 cents</a>. The state was also deemed the best state to live in for women\u2019s equality, according to a recent <a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-states-for-women-equality/5835/#virginia-sapiro\">WalletHub study</a>.<br></p> <p>Hawaii was found to be No 1 in the three categories examined: workplace environment, education and political empowerment. Alaska ranked second overall and did especially well in educational attainment, while Arkansas and Mississippi tied Hawaii for first in the category of education.</p> <p>Analysts at WalletHub, a financial information site, calculated scores for each state based on 15 metrics that assessed the gender gap in pay, political representation, and educational attainment.<strong> </strong> </p> <p>States with female senators did well overall, taking 10 out of the top 11 spots overall. Aside from Michigan, which was ranked 28th, each of the 17 states with female senators was in the top 25.</p> <p>Utah earned last place on the ranking. It ranked poorest in terms of workplace and education, while Louisiana placed last for political participation. The state has no female representatives in Congress.</p> <p>WalletHub has put out <a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-states-for-women/10728/#inderpal-grewal\">similar rankings</a> before, including one from earlier this year that looked at the best and worst states for women overall. Organizations such as the <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/\">National Women\u2019s Law Center</a> or the <a href=\"http://statusofwomendata.org/national-trends/best-worst-states/\">Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research</a> have compiled their own research on gender equality by state in the past. In its ranking, <a href=\"http://statusofwomendata.org/national-trends/best-worst-states/\">IWPR found</a> that Minnesota was the best state for women, with Hawaii tied for the No 5 spot with California, Maryland and Oregon. They found that Minnesota did especially well for women\u2019s health and wellbeing and political participation. The worst state in its study was Alabama.</p> <p>Fatima Goss Graves, senior vice-president for program at the NWLC, said what stood out to her about the data was how interrelated it is. \u201cEducational attainment is tied to workplace or to political power and participation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see some states that are faring poorly on two of the three if not all three spots.\u201d</p> <p>The common denominator that \u201creflects\u201d these other disparities, she said, is the gender pay gap. \u201cThe pay gap undermines the ability to do a wide range of things, including furthering education or running for office,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Julie Anderson, a research associate with IWPR, said that work-family support is a huge factor in the inequality issue, especially when more women are becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/19/gender-equality-women-working-men-homemakers-responsibility\">breadwinners</a> in their families. States lacking supportive policies, she said, can result in women dropping out of the workforce for caregiving responsibilities and causing lost wages or promotions.</p> <p>Goss Graves estimated that some differences between the states stem from changes made to equal pay laws or minimum wage laws, as well as states that allow for paid sick or medical leave or pre-kindergarten and childcare programs. \u201cThose are going to make a real big difference in whether its a state that\u2019s good for women\u2019s equality or whether it\u2019s a state that\u2019s working against women\u2019s equality,\u201d she said. </p> <p>However, she noted that there has been progress in passing laws that are more family-friendly. \u201cWe\u2019re in a moment where states are moving forward a number of policies that they think will make a difference,\u201d she said. Earlier this month, Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/massachusetts-equal-pay-law-women-salary-history\">signed a law</a> that will make it illegal for employers to inquire about salary or wage history.</p> <p>The study itself called the nationwide response to closing the gender gap \u201cdisappointing\u201d. The US was ranked 28th on the World Economic Foundation\u2019s 2015 <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/rankings/\">Global Gender Inequality Index</a>.</p> <p>Timed for the same week as Women\u2019s Equality Day, which commemorates women getting the right to vote, the study was published on Black Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day \u2013 the day that black women finally earned the same amount as white men did in the previous year. Equal Pay Day \u2013 based on the national average, without accounting for racial disparities \u2013 was last April.</p> <p>While being ranked high on the list of states might seem like a reason to celebrate, Goss Graves noted that even the states at the top have more work to do, especially to represent all groups of women. Some states do well for women as a whole but not for specific groups; California was ranked fourth overall by WalletHub but \u201chas one of the largest pay gaps for Hispanic women\u201d, according to Goss Graves. \u201cThere are about six states where the pay gap for black women, if you look at lifetime earnings, they lose out over $1m,\u201d Goss Graves said. </p> <p>Both Goss Graves and Anderson hope that the frequent highlighting of the pay gap will eventually help make a difference. \u201cWe hope shining more light, putting out more facts, revealing the same thing in a different way, it becomes more and more known and perceived as the problem that it is,\u201d Anderson said.</p>",

  "<p>The US has warned the European commission that it will consider retaliating if Brussels goes ahead with plans to demand billions of dollars in unpaid taxes from Apple and other US multinational companies.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Obama administration warned the EU on Wednesday that its investigations into alleged tax avoidance by US firms, including Apple, Amazon and Starbucks, could \u201ccreate an unfortunate international tax policy precedent\u201d. </p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/White-Paper-State-Aid.pdf\">a white paper commissioned by US Treasury secretary Jack Lew</a>, the US warned that Brussels was overstepping its powers and becoming a \u201csupranational tax authority\u201d. </p> <p>The US warned that if Brussels pushes ahead with threatened plans to demand as much as $19bn (\u00a314.4bn) from Apple for alleged unpaid taxes as a result of so-called sweetheart deals with Ireland the US Treasury will \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d. </p> <p>The EU has been investigating whether Apple\u2019s tax deals with Ireland, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/ireland-defends-tax-dealings-with-apple\">allowed the company to pay very little tax</a> on income earned throughout Europe, amounted to state aid. The commission is expected next month to rule on the case, the biggest single corporate tax avoidance investigation.</p> <p>Investment bank JP Morgan has warned that if the commission requires Apple to retroactively pay the Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5% on the pre-tax profits it collected via Ireland it could cost the company as much as $19bn. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/20/apple-accused-tax-avoidance-billions-scheme\">A US Senate investigation in 2013</a> found that Apple paid little or no tax on profits of at least $74bn over four years by exploiting gaps in the Irish and American tax code. The investigation found no evidence of illegal activity and both Apple and Ireland deny any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has called the investigations \u201cpolitical crap\u201d. \u201cThere is no truth behind it,\u201d he said. \u201cApple pays every tax dollar we owe.\u201d</p> <p>In its final warning to the EU before the expected ruling, the US Treasury accused Brussels of a \u201cshift in approach [that] appears to expand the role of the Commission beyond enforcement of competition and State aid law ... into that of a supranational tax authority that reviews member state transfer price determinations\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe US Treasury Department continues to consider potential responses should the Commission continue its present course,\u201d the white paper warned in the US\u2019s strongest language to date. \u201cA strongly preferred and mutually beneficial outcome would be a return to the system and practice of international tax cooperation that has long fostered cross-border investment between the United States and EU member states.\u201d<br></p> <p>The threat that the US may retaliate against the EU comes shortly after Lew flew to Brussels for talks with the EU\u2019s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager on \u201ctransatlantic cooperation\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/vestager/status/753260736072257536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very good meeting with Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew on the European economy and transatlantic cooperation. <a href=\"https://t.co/XiQBa6STAg\">pic.twitter.com/XiQBa6STAg</a></p>&mdash; Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vestager/status/753260736072257536\">July 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Vestager has already <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-taxavoidance-idUSKCN0SF0US20151021\">demanded</a> \u20ac20m-\u20ac30m<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-taxavoidance-idUSKCN0SF0US20151021\"> in<strong> </strong>back taxes from Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler</a> after ruling the firms struck illegal tax deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The commission is also pursuing a similar investigation against Amazon.</p> <p>Lew has accused the commission of \u201ctargeting US companies disproportionately\u201d. The commission denied this on Wednesday, saying its investigation \u201capplies to all companies operating in Europe \u2013 there is no bias against US companies\u201d.</p> <p>The EU estimates that corporate tax avoidance costs member states \u20ac50m-\u20ac70bn a year in lost taxes.</p> <p>The US Treasury warned that American taxpayers could end up footing the bill if the commission goes ahead and demands back taxes from Apple and other US companies as the firms may be able to offset the EU-demand taxes against US tax payments. It described this potential outcome as \u201cdeeply troubling, as it would effectively constitute a transfer of revenue to the EU from the US government and its taxpayers\u201d.</p> <p>The white paper said the commission\u2019s demand for retroactive tax payments \u201csets an undesirable precedent that could lead to other tax authorities, particularly those in developing countries that look to the EU as a model, to seek large and punitive retroactive recoveries from both US and EU companies\u201d. <br></p> <p>Cook has said Apple will \u201cobviously appeal\u201d the commission\u2019s ruling if the company doesn\u2019t get a fair hearing. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the EU is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that. The structure we have was applicable to everybody \u2013 it wasn\u2019t something that was done unique to Apple. It was their law,\u201d Cook <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/classic-apps/stepping-out-of-steve-jobss-shadow-tim-cook-champions-the-promise-of-apple/2016/08/12/fadb6c26-59cd-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html\">told the Washington Post</a> earlier this month. <br></p> <p>\u201cAnd the basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren\u2019t arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They\u2019re arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there\u2019s a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This is what happens to my skin in the sun. After a few minutes, it goes a mottled pink. Give it an hour or so, and it goes the colour of a ripe tomato. Shortly after that, it burns really badly, and the next day I develop full-body dandruff. Not a good look.</p> <p>So I go to the beach well equipped. I wear sunscreen, of course. But also a hat, a scarf to cover my neck and my head as well if it\u2019s too windy for the hat, a long-sleeved tunic, and light trousers to pull on somewhere between the mottled pink and tomato stage. I long ago accepted that I am never going to go brown, so I cover up, and I\u2019m comfortable that way.

In 1907, record-breaking Australian swimmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2013/nov/08/heroes-swimming-annette-kellerman\">Annette Kellerman</a> was arrested on Revere beach in Boston for wearing a sleeveless one-piece swimming outfit remarkably similar to the burkini.

A body is at its most beautiful when there is one beautiful, unbroken line.\u201d</p> <p>The Pope also condemned the two-piece, although for rather different reasons. It was banned in Italy, Spain and Portugal and, despite Brigitte Bardot posing on a Cannes beach in a bikini in 1953 and Ursula Andress emerging from the sea in an iconic white bikini in Dr No in 1962, it took a surprising amount of time to catch on. But now, it seems, it is our civic and moral duty to display as much bare flesh as possible while sunbathing, and it is hard to find a women\u2019s magazine in spring that isn\u2019t hectoring us to get \u201cbikini-ready\u201d, to starve, wax, salon tan and exercise our bodies into the desired condition.</p> <p>To the French minister for women\u2019s rights, Laurence Rossignol, wearing as little as possible on the beach has now somehow become a feminist issue. \u201c[The burkini] has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/burkini-ban-defended-as-french-mayors-urged-to-cool-local-tensions\">the same logic as the burqa</a>: hide women\u2019s bodies in order to control them,\u201d she has said, seemingly unaware of the contradiction of forcing women to show their bodies instead. \u201cIt is not just the business of those women who wear it, because it is the symbol of a political project that is hostile to diversity and women\u2019s emancipation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66fecd7672513d57dbc3d5621fc26d60eb205876\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66fecd7672513d57dbc3d5621fc26d60eb205876/0_0_2391_2576/928.jpg\" alt=\"Brigitte Bardot is photographed in a bikini at Cannes in 1953\" width=\"928\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brigitte Bardot is photographed in a bikini at Cannes in 1953.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet, if we go back 170 years or so, what was then known as \u201cTurkish dress\u201d was controversial for exactly the opposite reason. Inspired by Muslim dress and pioneered by the British actor, writer and anti-slavery campaigner <a href=\"https://www.univie.ac.at/Anglistik/easyrider/data/kemble.htm\">Fanny Kemble</a>, the wearing of long, loose pantaloons under a relatively light, short dress was hugely liberating for European women previously restricted by long, heavy dresses, layers of equally heavy petticoats and body-distorting corsets. After US sufferage and temperance activist Amelia Bloomer espoused the look in her magazine, the Lily, in 1851, it turned into a craze on both sides of the Atlantic, and became known as \u201cBloomer dress\u201d, then simply \u201cbloomers\u201d. The backlash from church, media and state was predictable, but their complaint was not that this \u201coriental dress\u201d style was too modest, but that it was too racy, a sign that women were encroaching dangerously on male territory.</p> <p>This comes as no surprise. Fashion has always been a reliable barometer of social change, and almost every attempt to prohibit a trend hides a far deeper fear. To pull on the shifting threads of gender, race and class, all we have to do is follow the popular anxieties about what we wear. Or rather, what other people are wearing to upset us.</p> <p>In his brilliant book Hooligan: A History of Respectable Fears, Geoffrey Pearson looks back over more than a century of media fears, examining our tendency to always believe there was a golden age of safety and peace, usually about 20 years before our own age. It wasn\u2019t until the 1890s, when mass-produced clothes were becoming more affordable and working-class youths were starting to earn money of their own, that these fears got tangled up with fashion.</p> <p>The fear then was hooligans, violent gangs of young men with seemingly no respect for authority or the police. They had different names around the country \u2013 Peaky Blinders or Sloggers in Birmingham, Scuttlers, or later Ikeys, in Manchester \u2013 but they dressed in a remarkably similar fashion.</p> <p>\u201cThe boys affect a kind of uniform,\u201d claimed the Daily Graphic newspaper in a November 1900 article titled Real Hooligans. \u201cNo hat, collar, or tie is to be seen. All of them have a peculiar muffler twisted round the neck, a cap set rakishly forward, well over the eyes, and trousers very tight at the knee and loose at the foot. The most characteristic part of their uniform is the substantial leather belt heavily mounted with metal. It is not ornamental, but then it is not intended for ornament.\u201d</p> <p>In Manchester, one gang fight in 1890 apparently involved a pitched battle of 500-600 youths, with shopkeepers barricading themselves into their stores to prevent damage and looting, and police powerless to intervene. Accounts of this incident even include an enticing mention of female scuttlers, dressed in \u201cclogs and shawl and a skirt with vertical stripes\u201d, but in the main, newspapers of the time were obsessed with the dress style of male gang members, which they found absurdly troubling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a8aa9e617ad6df0e757b8d9e67f5b8e86c6f6bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a8aa9e617ad6df0e757b8d9e67f5b8e86c6f6bd/0_0_4110_4260/965.jpg\" alt=\"Flappers, with their girlish skirts, bobbed hair and heavy makeup, appeared after the first world war\" width=\"965\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flappers, with their girlish skirts, bobbed hair and heavy makeup, appeared after the first world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Kirn/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the turbulent, heady period of change following the first world war, the short, girlish skirts of the flappers, their bobbed hair, heavy makeup, love of jazz music and freer attitudes towards sex were terrifying, a sign of a world that was changing rapidly, and becoming more connected. There was little that could be done about the import of American music or shifting morals, but many workplaces began imposing strict dress codes for women, banning patterned fabrics, short sleeves and excessive makeup, as well as imposing longer hemlines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96a3e67782f4374c142e0d3f2641896d255c5336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a3e67782f4374c142e0d3f2641896d255c5336/0_361_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men under arrest en route to court during the Los Angeles \u201czoot suit riots\u201d in June 1943\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men under arrest en route to court during the Los Angeles \u201czoot suit riots\u201d in June 1943.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those hemlines rose again during the second world war because of cloth shortages, and, of course, women wore trousers to work on farms and factories. In the US, the fashion for baggy zoot suits among black and Hispanic men especially was deemed wasteful in wartime, and led to the \u201czoot suit riots\u201d, in which white servicemen beat up men wearing oversized suits in Los Angeles. No one now reading accounts of the brutal and humiliating beatings of the men, or the crowing media praise of the \u201ccleansing effect\u201d of the riots, could doubt that the main issue here was not fashion choice, but race, fear and power.</p> <p>After the war, it was deemed important to force women back into the home and Christian Dior\u2019s New Look epitomised the mood: longer, full skirts celebrated the end of cloth rationing, but the new hourglass silhouette with its clinched, corsetted waist also signalled a more traditionally feminine and restricted role for women. The zoot suit travelled to Britain, too, modified into Teddy Boy outfits, and the anxieties about race \u2013 and about the growing economic power of the young \u2013 can be clearly seen in the press coverage of the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll music that the Teddy Boys loved.</p> <p>\u201cIt is deplorable. It is tribal. And it is from America,\u201d thundered the Daily Mail in September 1956. \u201cIt follows ragtime, blues, Dixie, jazz, hot cha-cha and the boogie-woogie, which surely originated in the jungle.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"649f68adf82826598aa21e0dccb4051188dfc244\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/649f68adf82826598aa21e0dccb4051188dfc244/0_0_1744_1252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of Teddy Boys on the front at Lowestoft in 1962\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of Teddy Boys on the front at Lowestoft in 1962.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But teenagers were here to stay, along with their music and fashions. By the 1960s, the economy was booming, young women were back in the workplace with money of their own, and hemlines began rising dramatically. Mary Quant was the first to show the miniskirt on the catwalk, in 1964, but she has often said that she didn\u2019t invent it: credit for that goes to young Londoners who didn\u2019t want to wear the same styles as their mothers. \u201cIt all started in Chelsea, really. There was this sort of mood; rules were there to be broken.\u201d</p> <p>She recalls businessmen banging on the windows of her shop, shouting at how obscene and disgusting her dresses were, and in 1967, four young French women wearing miniskirts were apparently stripped by a mob while walking through Paris. Le Parisien newspaper was in no doubt who was to blame: \u201cThey provoked the butchers of Les Halles,\u201d screamed the headline (accompanied, of course, by a photograph of four women in short skirts, presumably to provoke male readers into further attacks).</p> <p>But young women refused to be deterred. When Christian Dior tried to assert the status quo by showing below-the-knee designs in his 1966 autumn/winter collection, a small group calling themselves the British Society for the Advancement of the Miniskirt protested outside his London HQ, holding placards defending their right to show a leg.</p> <p>Ever since, anxieties about clothing tend to be about what is being concealed, rather than shown. From the burkini on the beach to the banning of hoodies in shopping centres, our fear now is what lurks beneath. Mostly, it is just a woman taking her kids to the seaside, or a teenage boy out to meet his mates in baggy hip-hop clothing, and nothing more. It may not feel that way, but we are safer than we have ever been as we go about our daily lives, and appalling though every act of terrorism is \u2013 and, indeed, every violent crime \u2013 the odds of any of us experiencing either is very low. But we feel scared. And we feel powerless. So we blame the EU, refugees, the burkini. And we look back to what now seems a safer, happier time, when all we had to worry about was hemlines.</p>",

A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/several-dead-in-suspected-terrorist-blast-at-wedding-in-turkey\">bombing of a wedding in Gaziantep</a> over the weekend killed more than 50 people, many of them children, and Isis-linked militants have carried out attacks in Ankara and Istanbul, including one at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/29/istanbul-ataturk-airport-attack-turkey-declares-day-of-mourning\">Atat\u00fcrk airport</a>.</p> <p>It also billed it as an operation that would stem the flow of foreign fighters, who make up a significant contingent of Isis\u2019s militants, and the flight of refugees from Syria amid worsening fighting.</p> <p>The Turkish interior minister, Efkan Ala, said the response was Turkey\u2019s \u201cmost legitimate right\u201d and that his country could not be a \u201cmere spectator\u201d amid the intensifying threat by terrorist groups in Syria.</p> <p>The airstrikes were the first by Turkey, a Nato member, in Syria since its fighter jets last November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/turkey-shoots-down-jet-near-border-with-syria\">shot down a Russian warplane</a> that had strayed into Turkish airspace, leading to a collapse in relations with Moscow that lasted until a rapprochement in July. Last week, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, said his country would take a more \u201cactive\u201d role in the war in Syria, which has driven more than 2 million refugees into Turkey.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s endorsement of the campaign, which is backed by the US-led coalition against Isis, comes amid strains in relations between the two allies since an attempted coup last month that aimed to overthrow Erdo\u011fan, who accuses a US-based cleric, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/23/turkey-fethullah-gulen-extradition-request-joe-biden-ergodan\">Fethullah G\u00fclen</a>, of masterminding the plot and is seeking his extradition.</p> <p>Taking control of Jarablus will limit the westward expansion of the Kurdish autonomous zone, which Ankara also says poses a threat to Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s latest campaign is a development that underscores the complexity and the stakes involved in Syria\u2019s war, which has laid much of the country to waste and forced a reshifting of longstanding alliances. While defeating Isis has long been the paramount American obsession in Syria, Turkey sees the departure of Assad as a necessary condition for peace talks, and rejects the idea of a Kurdish statelet on its borders.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cIf you go back down there, I\u2019m gonna get up and kill you myself!\u201d That was one of many hilarious lines the ebullient crowd shouted during a preview screening of Don\u2019t Breathe for notoriously tough-to-please New Yorkers. Normally I\u2019d tsk movie talkers, but Fede Alvarez\u2019s simple housebound horror show is practically dialogue-free. These spaces beg to be filled with interaction, and by the end even I (the so-called \u201cprofessional\u201d) joined with yelps, whoops and even an \u201cOh, God, not that, that\u2019s so gross!\u201d</p> <p>Importantly, the type of \u201cgross\u201d found in Don\u2019t Breathe is of the \u201cI\u2019m laughing and shouting ewwww!\u201d kind, not the brutal torture porn that, despite the R rating, this movie rejects. Don\u2019t Breathe is a master class in tension, and while its script could have been written on the back of an envelope, its editing and use of sound design is a triumph for film theorists. Admittedly, students of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/31/artsfeatures1\">Lev Kuleshov</a> hardly buy tickets en masse, but the simple pleasures in this film (the bad guy is right there, you idiot, run!) can be felt without much introspection.</p> <p>The first 30 minutes of Don\u2019t Breathe aren\u2019t too special. Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Daniel Zovatto) and Money (Dylan Minette) are three young burglars in Detroit. They are not bad people (well, Rocky and Alex aren\u2019t \u2013 Money is a bit of a dick). They are just broke, desperate and have no prospects. Rocky is given a bit of extra motivation in the form of a younger sister. Staying with their lowlife mother and her dirtbag boyfriend isn\u2019t much of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9-builder. If she were to find one big score, it would be enough to get her to California, which, at least, is warm.</p> <p>Money has his eyes on an old house in a deserted part of town that is probably holding hundreds of thousands of dollars. Its owner, a veteran blinded in the first gulf war (Stephen Lang), won a settlement when his daughter was killed in a hit-and-run by a rich girl. Money and Rocky are ready to hit the house, but they need the timid and thoughtful third member of the team. Alex\u2019s father owns a security company and has passcodes and gadgets that can get the group past alarm systems.</p> <p>Alex is also the one who knows just how much loot they can take while ensuring the charges against them don\u2019t tick over into felonies with higher sentences. But all bets are off on this one. Money brings a gun (\u201csome chrome\u201d, he douchily calls it), and maybe he needed it \u2013 or maybe that\u2019s what sends the Blind Man (name as per the credits) to take the defense of his home to the extreme.</p> <p>The Blind Man (and his ferocious pooch) don\u2019t succumb to soporifics as expected, and once our gang is trapped inside the house thanks to locked doors and barred windows, Alvarez is free to go nuts. Every remaining moment in the film is ripped from nightmares, in which safety is just a stretch away, but unforeseen obstacles snap you back into doom.</p> <p>Alvarez doesn\u2019t rely on jump-scares; it\u2019s the slow roll of dread that works far better. (But as with a drummer working the ride cymbal, an occasional crash does spice things up a bit.) Each sequence is cleverer than the last, especially in how Alvarez ensures that we in the audience know what is going to happen (a cracking window pane, for example) before our characters do. This makes for an \u201coh, no!\u201d type of engagement, far less than an \u201cack, that scared me!\u201d one. The latter is what\u2019s glutting up our horror cinema today, and what Alvarez (under the wing of his producer, the brilliant Sam Raimi) mostly ignores.</p> <p> The three kids and their very wide pupils are all good enough, but brutal, hulking Lang in his undershirt makes for a terrific villain. (How is someone protecting their home from robbery a villain? You\u2019ll see.) What\u2019s best about Don\u2019t Breathe is that just when I was thinking: \u201cThis is an extremely well-crafted exercise, bravo, I bet we\u2019re wrapping up soon,\u201d the final reel came in for the kill. Anyone who spoils the ending for you should be locked in a house with an angry man trained in special forces combat. Suffice to say you\u2019ll never see it coming, and when you do, you will be equal parts revolted and entertained. </p>",
  "<p>Has life gained a foothold on a planet that orbits our nearest star? The question, a variation on one of the greatest mysteries humans have pondered, is now front and centre in astronomers\u2019 minds. The short answer, of course, is nobody knows. But over the coming months, years and decades, scientists will throw every instrument and clever technique they have at Proxima b, an Earth-sized planet warmed by a small, cool star in Centaurus, to find out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/24/earth-like-planet-found-orbiting-our-suns-nearest-star-raises-hopes-for-life-proxima-b\">Discovery of potentially Earth-like planet Proxima b raises hopes for life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The newfound world has the compelling label of lurking in the \u201chabitable zone\u201d. But planets in this Goldilocks region of space where the heat from their host star makes them neither too hot nor too cold to sustain liquid water, are not necessarily habitable or inhabited. Proxima b may have no flowing water, a prerequisite for life as we know it. On Earth, life flourished with help from an atmosphere and a magnetic field, the latter of which shields us from the worst of space radiation. No one knows if Proxima b has either of these.<br></p> <p>And so begins the effort to learn more. Ignas Snellen, a professor of astronomy at the Leiden Observatory calls Proxima b the most important planet found beyond the solar system since the first, 51 Pegasi b, was spotted by Didier Queloz and Michel Mayor in 1995. \u201cThis is the discovery of the year and possibly of the decade,\u201d Snellen says. Not only does it mean an Earth-sized planet orbits our nearest star, it implies that other such worlds are common. \u201cIt will be our prime laboratory for the search for extraterrestrial life for the decades ahead. We have no idea whether life could exist on this planet, but the circumstances are likely to be much more favourable than on Mars,\u201d he says.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/proxima-b/giv-31075LRHMg1Sz6tup\" data-alt=\"Proxima b - Earth\u2019s new neighbour\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/proxima-b/giv-31075LRHMg1Sz6tup\">Proxima b - Earth\u2019s new neighbour</a> </figure>  <p>The most immediate task is to check whether Proxima b crosses the face of its star as viewed from Earth. Since Proxima Centauri is comparatively small and dim, and thus far less dazzling than sun-like stars, such a transit would allow the Hubble Space Telescope to look for the telltale dip in starlight that the planet\u2019s atmosphere would produce. But the chances are more than 95% that Proxima b orbits in an unhelpful plane.<br></p> <p>Without a transit, hopes of finding and studying the planet\u2019s atmosphere fall to future instruments. Hubble\u2019s successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, which is due to launch in 2018, may be the first to peer at Proxima b\u2019s atmosphere. Next in line could be the European Extremely Large Telescope being readied for action in 2024. The goal then will be to spot telltale imbalances in the chemical composition of the atmosphere which are are the calling cards of life.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/aug/24/discovery-of-earth-like-exoplanet-proxima-b-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x6xx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2681290\"            data-video-name=\"Discovery of Earth-like exoplanet Proxima b close to our solar system \u2013\u00a0video report\"            data-video-provider=\"ESO|Nature|\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bd989ae4b048662988fadc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/24/160824planet2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/24/160824planet2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/24/160824planet2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/aug/24/discovery-of-earth-like-exoplanet-proxima-b-video-report\">Discovery of Earth-like exoplanet Proxima b close to our solar system \u2013 video report</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cPeople will use Proxima b as a test case.

I do think Corbyn is on weak ground and it does look like he sat on the floor principally to make a point, when he could clearly have sat. Reserved seats are only reserved between certain stations and not if the reservee fails to show, just as Corbyn's own seats on an earlier train would be valid for someone else to have sat in. So, clearly, Corbyn has used this to (clumsily) make a point about our railways. Arguably, right argument, wrong way to go about it. </p> <p>All said, personally, I'm not a great fan of Corbyn, but I can respect his mandate.

Some years ago I worked in Huddersfield 20 odd miles away. I didn\u2019t need a car at work so wanted to use the train. I used a local station that was the last stop on the line from York to Leeds. I then needed to change trains at Leeds. Frequently the train into Leeds was so full that I was unable to get on because the areas around the doors were full of passengers standing. It used to infuriate me that people would not move down the train so I and others could get on but the basis of the problem was no seats. Too frequently this caused me problems in terms of arriving at work on time and I reverted to driving. Train travel seems to me to be very expensive yet often overcrowded, uncomfortable and inefficient. France is a far bigger country with a similar population. My experience of using trains in France, a much bigger country, suggests they can run a far more effective better quality and cheaper service.

She says the only time people are standing in the corridors is to stay by their luggage, not because of a lack of seats.</p> <p>Also in coach C is <strong>Linda</strong>, who is taking her two sons, Robert and Jamie, to Newcastle. She says she always books 12 weeks in advance to get the best price. Susan, who is sitting at the same table, points out that not everybody has access to computers. There\u2019s a long debate about how unnecessarily complicated ticketing is. It\u2019s frustrating that different train companies have different rules, says Linda. But she adds: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go back to British Rail.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mentish</strong> is on the train travelling for business. I plonked myself down next to him and interrupted him analysing a folder of documents. He says he doesn\u2019t travel that regularly by train but would be in favour of stronger regulation. He wouldn\u2019t support out-and-out nationalisation but would like to see more central control and \u201caccountability\u201d so that train companies are \u201cheld responsible for the promises they make\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bd7ca9e4b0568600c03d58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T10:55:24.807Z\">11.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019ve just had my ticket inspected.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempt to highlight overcrowding on the rail network by sitting down on a Virgin service from London to Newcastle has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/23/jeremy-corbyn-virgin-trains-disputes-claim-over-lack-of-seats\">erupted into a political storm</a>. The incident has raised a number of questions, including whether overcrowding is a genuine problem on Virgin services and whether the Labour leader\u2019s policy of nationalising train operators will make services less crowded and bring down fares. </p> <h2>1) How overcrowded are Virgin Trains services on a regular basis?</h2> <p>Virgin Trains operates two franchises \u2013 the west coast and the east coast. Virgin has run the west coast, which includes trains from London to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland since 1997. It took on the east coast \u2013 which runs trains from London to Newcastle, Leeds, York and Scotland \u2013 last year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/24/behind-traingate-we-retrace-corbyns-trip-to-see-reality-of-uk-rail-travel-live\">Virgin v Jeremy Corbyn: what rail passengers think of Traingate \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/24/behind-traingate-we-retrace-corbyns-trip-to-see-reality-of-uk-rail-travel-live\">Jeremy Corbyn was travelling on the east coast service from London King\u2019s Cross to Newcastle</a>. This service is not listed by the Department for Transport as one of the 10 most overcrowded train services in Britain. In fact, passengers on Virgin Trains are more satisfied with the space on their train than most other services. The latest survey by passenger group Transport Focus found that 80% of passengers rated the Virgin Trains as \u201csatisfied or good\u201d in terms of the room for passengers to sit and stand between London and the north east of England. Out of 78 routes in Britain, only 14 scored higher, with five of those being Virgin Trains services too. Overall customer satisfaction on the route was rated as 86% by Transport Focus.</p> <p>However, the government\u2019s Office of Rail and Road found Virgin Trains has the highest number of complaints per 100,000 journeys in the UK. The main complaint was the train\u2019s facilities, which the ORR said was due to the franchise covering longer distances than other services.</p> <p>Virgin Trains has announced plans to launch a new fleet of 65 Virgin Azuma trains from 2018, which the company says will increase capacity into London on the east coast line by 28% at peak times.</p> <h2>2) How does overcrowding on Virgin services compare with the rest of the network and what are the most overcrowded routes in Britain? </h2> <p>In contrast to Virgin Trains, just 47% of passengers on c2c\u2019s Tilbury line in Essex and TfL Rail in London rated the space to sit and stand as \u201csatisfied or good\u201d. Although the TfL Rail service is operated by MTR Corporation, a private company, it is controlled by a public authority - Transport for London.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/rush-hour-trains-london-third-passengers-standing\">Figures from the Department for Transport </a>show the 10 busiest train services are commuter services travelling through London or Manchester. Staggeringly, the two busiest services carry more than double than number of passengers they are supposed to. The busiest train in autumn 2015 was the 06.57 from Brighton to Bedford, which travels through London. At its busiest point at 08.20 at London Blackfriars, the Govia Thameslink service carries 960 standard class passengers, compared with a recommended load of 480. The second most crowded services in the 04.22 from Glasgow Central to Manchester Airport. When it reaches Manchester Airport at 08.22 it is carrying 410 passengers, compared with a recommended load of 191. </p> <h2>3) Will fare reform \u2013 such as the introduction of airline-style pricing \u2013 solve the problem and get Jeremy a seat?</h2> <p>The introduction of airline-style seat pricing would result in the lifting of caps \u2013 limits on annual increases in prices \u2013 on certain fares such as off-peak return tickets on long distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities. Season tickets are also capped, although allowing limitless increases on those would probably be politically untenable. </p> <p>So, would ramping up fares on popular off-peak services like the 11am from London to Newcastle ease overcrowding? In terms of discouraging all but urgent travel on that service, and diverting those who don\u2019t need to journey at that time on to different and cheaper services, then yes. But unless train operators pledge to make no more money from this new arrangement than they do currently, it leaves the door open to price gouging of, say, football fans or people who have to make urgent journeys for family reasons. Thus, higher profits for the likes of Virgin. This might pose political problems for the minister pushing this solution because the government sets rail fare policy. </p> <h2>4) Will nationalising the railways reduce overcrowding and make fares cheaper, as Corbyn claims?</h2> <p>Dividends paid to private train operators like Virgin reached \u00a3222m last year. Reclaim those for the public purse and it is a small contribution to the annual running costs of the railways of \u00a313.6bn. So kicking private companies off the railways does not seem a long-term answer in terms of buying more trains \u2013 a big order for a single commuter route costs at least \u00a31bn \u2013 or subsidising fare expenditure, which saw commuters shell out \u00a38.8bn in 2014-15. The easiest way to reduce that fare expenditure is to look at the other side of the rail funding equation: the state. The taxpayer puts in around \u00a33.5bn a year and if that is to increase as a Labour policy, Corbyn will need to find the money from somewhere. </p> <h2>5) What are the other potential solutions to overcrowding and expensive fares?</h2> <p>Reduce industry costs, which rose by 7%, or \u00a3900m, last year. The consequences of trying to pull that off are being played out on the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/southern-trains-crisis-seven-factors-that-threw-services-off-the-rails\">Southern commuter route</a> in London currently. Southern is introducing trains that don\u2019t need guards, which are cheaper to operate in the long run, and it has triggered a series of strikes. Better management of industrial relations is needed to pull off meaningful cost reductions. </p> <p>Secondly, costs need to fall at Network Rail, the state-owned company that operates the country\u2019s tracks and stations. It has debts of more than \u00a340bn and those need to be reduced. Cutting fare revenue would have to be balanced, potentially, by adding to that debt in order to make good the funding shortfall. </p> <h2>6) With the Southern dispute entering another month of strikes, are the railways in a bit of a mess?</h2> <p>The railways are in a much better state than they were at the peak of the Railtrack debacle in 2000, which ultimately saw the government take back control of the nation\u2019s tracks and stations through the creation of Network Rail. Since that lowpoint, rail safety and punctuality has improved and passenger use has rocketed, You could argue that overcrowding is a consequence of success as more and more people use a reliable service. </p> <h2>7) Why did Virgin Trains go public with its footage of Corbyn?</h2> <p>Corbyn\u2019s comments about overcrowding on Virgin Trains undoubtedly struck a raw nerve with Sir Richard Branson, who fiercely protects the reputation of his brands. Virgin Trains will soon be bidding to extend the west coast franchise, which ends in 2018, so will be anxious to correct any perceptions that its services are overcrowded and that customer satisfaction is falling. </p> <p>The Labour leader has described <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/24/owen-smith-cctv-shows-jeremy-corbyn-chose-to-sit-on-train-floor\">Branson as a \u201ctax exile\u201d and made it clear that he wants to nationalise the railways</a>, meaning Branson had an extra incentive to respond to Corbyn rather than let his comments pass. A cynic may also suggest that traingate helped to take some of the spotlight away from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/team-gb-return-rio-olympics-victorious-heathrow-champagn-honours\"> British Airways bringing Great Britain\u2019s Olympic athletes back from Rio de Janeiro</a>. BA is a bitter rival of Branson\u2019s airline Virgin Atlantic. It has taken Virgin Trains a week to respond to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/16/jeremy-corbyn-floor-overcrowded-train-video\">Corbyn\u2019s video.</a></p> <h2>8) How much has Virgin Trains benefited from privatisation?</h2> <p>Virgin Rail Group, which operates the West Coast, is 51% owned by Branson\u2019s Virgin Group and 49% by transport group Stagecoach. Virgin Trains East Coast is 90% owned by Stagecoach and 10% by Virgin.</p> <p>In the last 10 years, Virgin Rail Group has paid out dividends to its shareholders worth \u00a3414.9m. This works out as \u00a3211.6m for Virgin and \u00a3203.3m for Stagecoach.</p>",
  "<p>Maurice Walker\u2019s case is far from exceptional.</p> <p>Arrested on 3 September 2015 for public intoxication, Walker, a 54-year-old black man with a serious mental disorder that leaves him unable to work, was faced with two options: pay a $160 cash bond and leave jail that day, or remain in jail over a holiday weekend. Walker told officials that he couldn\u2019t afford the standard bond required by the city for the misdemeanor and wound up spending six days in jail, only being allowed out of his cell for an hour a day. Walker said he was also denied daily medication he took for his disorder.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not unique,\u201d said Alec Karakatsanis, one of the lawyers representing Walker in a federal suit. \u201cWhat makes this case so important is that the legal issues that it raises are representative of ones that are ubiquitous in the American criminal legal system.\u201d </p> <p>Of about 11 million jail admissions every year, the vast majority of detainees are held because they cannot afford their bail.</p> <p>But a few things have happened since Walker\u2019s lawsuit was filed that have made Walker\u2019s case potentially extraordinary, and leave it poised to represent a watershed moment in the fight against mass incarceration.</p> <p>Walker sued the city of Calhoun, Georgia, where he was detained, in a class action suit, alleging that the city routinely \u201cjails the poor because they cannot pay a small amount of money\u201d. </p> <p>Unlike in other similar lawsuits filed by Karakatsanis\u2019s organization, Equal Justice Under the Law, the city of Calhoun didn\u2019t settle and agree to reforms. </p> <p>Walker won his case. Then the city appealed the decision, elevating it to a federal appeals court and setting up a potentially precedent-setting legal battle on the question of when and how cities may continue to jail people for being poor.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a case gets up to a federal appellate court it makes it much more important,\u201d Karakatsanis said.</p> <p>And then, the US justice department intervened to say it was on Walker\u2019s side. </p> <p>\u201cIncarcerating individuals solely because of their inability to pay a fine or fee ... effectively denies equal protection to one class of people within the criminal justice system while also offending due process,\u201d the DoJ said in a a filing to the court.</p> <p>Karkatsanis said Obama\u2019s DoJ had offered similar support in other cases, but that the significance of it coming in a federal appeals quote shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. \u201cIt\u2019s a real and significant announcement of the government\u2019s position that has to go through the highest levels,\u201d Karkatsanis said. Principal deputy assistant attorney general Vanita Gupta, one of the highest ranking members of DoJ staff, is one of the names undersigned on the brief.</p> <p>The filing by the DoJ makes good on a warning letter sent earlier this year to cities across the country advising courts that they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warns-local-courts-about-unlawful-fines-and-fees/2016/03/13/c475df18-e939-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html\">cannot jail poor people</a> \u201csolely because they cannot afford to pay for their release\u201d.</p> <p>In the federal system, cash bail was largely eliminated decades ago when then attorney general Robert Kennedy said pretrial detention is unfairly \u201cdirectly influenced by how wealthy [a defendant] is\u201d. The move has been supported by several subsequent supreme court rulings which have all essentially come to the same conclusion that the court did in Walker\u2019s case:</p> <p>\u201cAny bail or bond scheme that mandates payment of pre-fixed amounts for different offenses to obtain pretrial release, without any consideration of indigence or other factors, violates the Equal Protection Clause\u201d of the 14th amendment, the court found.</p> <p>In 1964, Kennedy presented the example of a New York man, Daniel Walker, who was \u201carrested on suspicion of robbery and spent 55 days in jail for want of bail. Meanwhile, he lost his job, his car was repossessed, his credit destroyed, and his wife had to move in with her parents. Later, he was found to be the victim of mistaken identity and released.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>But more than a half century after Kennedy\u2019s law went into place, jurisdictions in all 50 states routinely engage in practices that would violate the act, which only applies to suspects in the federal court system and in Washington DC. This means that today, about two-thirds of the roughly 750,000 people in jail at any one time are unconvicted, and the majority are being held for nonviolent misdemeanors. </p> <p>The amicus filing by the DoJ is in line with what has been a priority of the department both under attorney general Eric Holder and now Loretta Lynch. In 2011, Holder assembled the first national symposium on pretrial justice since Robert Kennedy had done the same in 1964. The DoJ has since found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/01/data-driven-justice-initiative-obama-us-prison-population\">various ways to try to encourage local jurisdictions to reform cash bail for poor suspects,</a> and those efforts have been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/women-incarceration-rates-growth-study\">supplemented by private initiatives to urge the same.</a></p> <p>Cherise Burdeen, who heads the <a href=\"http://www.pretrial.org/\">Pretrial Justice Institute</a>, said that bail reform is one of the most critical battlefronts for activists trying to stem the tide of mass incarceration. \u201cMore people will sleep in jail this year for failure to pay a fine then are in any jail or prison on a conviction,\u201d Burdeen said.</p> <p>Burdeen said that beyond being unconstitutional, cash bail simply isn\u2019t effective, noting that the only legally acceptable purpose for the scheme is to ensure that a defendant appears for a court date, and studies show bail paid does not improve trial attendance. </p> <p>A recent paper from the University of Pennsylvania also found that cash bail may actually generate more crime, as the destabilizing effects that incarceration has on the lives of poor people, for example causing them to miss work or loose a job, can push them into more precarious situations where crime becomes more attractive. The report concludes that pretrial detention \u201cmay ultimately serve to compromise public safety\u201d.</p> <p>As it stands right now, Burdeen said, the system is \u201cdetaining people who are too poor and don\u2019t pose a threat while allowing this little trap door under the jail for people with money\u201d. Roughly half of suspects of violent crimes are able to get out on bail nationwide, while hundreds of thousands of people facing trial for minor crimes remain locked up.</p> <p>But Burdeen said the DoJ\u2019s brief, and the general climate around criminal justice nationwide is cause for hope. \u201cThere has never been a better time for this case to be happening. It is part of a tapestry of momentum in this county on criminal justice reform, and there\u2019s a lot of reasons for optimism.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s health has been under scrutiny in recent weeks, not by medical professionals but by politicians and supposed pundits playing doctor on TV. Clinton\u2019s personal physician, <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf\">Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said</a>: \u201cSecretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/clinton-responds-to-deranged-conspiracy-theories-about-her-health-746921539976\">conspiracy theories</a> about Clinton\u2019s supposed ill health have gone viral. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12505078/hillary-clinton-health-stroke-conspiracy-fake\">no evidence</a> these claims are true.</p> <p>I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor. I don\u2019t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I\u2019ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don\u2019t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness.</p> <p>But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear; in this case, Trump\u2019s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States.</p> <p>This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>What is different is that Trump gushes conspiracy theories like a fire hose. He was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/donald-trump-birther-obama.html\">one of the most vocal birthers</a>, those who claimed Barack Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim and thus ineligible to hold office (that was untrue). Trump later <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-hillary-clinton-started-the-birther-movement/\">claimed</a> that Clinton started the birther movement, not he. He t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">weeted</a>: \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T3uAp2ep3w\">said</a> \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks, implying they were Muslims. He <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/\">tweeted an allegation</a> that 81% of white homicide victims are killed by blacks. And he <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/09/16/donald_trump_suggested_vaccines_cause_autism_during_the_cnn_gop_debate_he.html\">suggested</a> that vaccines cause autism. The list goes on. None of these assertions are true.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost as if Trump is reading from a textbook on how to invent and disseminate conspiracy theories. First, target those who feel most alienated and disempowered. Then, identify a complex social or political threat to control, which might include stagnant wages, demographic changes or terrorism. Next, identify an outsider group such as China, Latino immigrants, blacks or Muslims who you can blame. Then tell a simple, black-and-white story of conflict between good versus evil, us versus the other. Finally, say the system is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-new-rigged-system-the-election-itself/2016/08/02/d9fb33b0-58c4-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html\">rigged</a>\u201d by the mainstream media or the elite.</p> <p>Trump is riding a rising tide of alienation and disempowerment, most notably among working class white men. They\u2019re his strongest supporters because uncertainty, anxiety and powerlessness <a href=\"http://www.michaelshermer.com/the-believing-brain/\">drive the need to reassert control</a>.

It should come as no surprise that he \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpdt7omPoa0\">loves the poorly educated</a>\u201d. They\u2019re most likely to buy into his conspiracy theories, and not because they\u2019re stupid. Researchers have found that <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12084/abstract\">having less education</a> \u2013 not sex, race, ideology or knowledge \u2013 is the most reliable predictor of whether someone will believe a conspiracy theory.

We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe.

  "<p>The gap between Scotland\u2019s public spending and tax revenues has widened, with the crash in global oil prices leading to a deficit of nearly \u00a315bn.</p> <p>The latest official data shows that Scotland\u2019s structural deficit was more than twice that of the UK last year, after its share of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/07/north-sea-oil-rigs-could-be-scrapped-in-10-years\">North Sea oil tax revenues collapsed</a>, falling from \u00a31.8bn in the previous year to \u00a360m. </p> <p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/08/2132\">government expenditure and revenue Scotland (Gers) figures</a> show that in 2015-16, Scottish tax receipts were \u00a3400 less than the UK average, at \u00a310,000, after several decades during which oil had pushed them above the UK level.</p> <p>The Scottish and UK governments spent \u00a31,200 a head more on public services in Scotland, and on Scotland\u2019s share of UK and overseas spending, while overall tax receipts fell by \u00a3400 a head. </p> <p>Compared with spending at UK level, that led to a gulf of \u00a31,600 a head between what was raised in taxes and spent in Scotland. Overall government spending as a share of the economy increased again to reach nearly 44% of Scotland\u2019s GDP, compared with 40% at UK level.</p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said the figures were very difficult and the plunge in oil prices meant that Scotland had \u201csuffered an economic shock, which has impact on our fiscal position\u201d.</p> <p>The Gers data presented a challenging picture for Scotland, she said, adding: \u201cIt is a challenge we have had for some time now \u2013 how to grow and diversify our onshore economy.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Senior economists warned that a budget deficit of this scale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/24/ifs-scotland-debts-three-times-greater-uk\">made Scottish independence effectively unaffordable</a>, unless Sturgeon made very tough choices on spending cuts or tax rises. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.strath.ac.uk/business/economics/fraserofallanderinstitute/\">The Fraser of Allander Institute</a>, an economics thinktank at Strathclyde University, directly challenged Sturgeon\u2019s statement on Wednesday that \u201cthe route to closing the deficit is fundamentally on the revenue growth side\u201d.</p> <p>Closing a 21% structural deficit would need rates of economic growth for Scotland not seen in current lifetimes, the FAI said. As Sturgeon had pointed out on Tuesday, the Brexit vote was likely to make those efforts even more difficult. </p> <p>\u201cIt is simply not possible to operate under independence with a deficit at this scale \u2013 full stop,\u201d the FAI said. \u201cThe Scottish government needs to set out the tough choices that it would make alongside a detailed and comprehensive plan for how it would manage the public finances under independence. This won\u2019t be easy, but is essential.\u201d</p> <p>The data put Scotland\u2019s net fiscal deficit last year at \u00a314.8bn, including North Sea receipts, \u00a3522m higher than the previous year. That was equivalent to 9.5% of Scotland\u2019s GDP. The UK\u2019s estimated deficit for the same period was 4% of GDP.</p> <p>Asked how an independent Scotland could meet the EU\u2019s requirements for an <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/index_en.htm\">annual spending deficit to be lower than 3%</a>, Sturgeon said independence would change Scotland\u2019s overall financial position. \u201cI accept Scotland faces, whatever our constitutional arrangements, a very challenging fiscal position, [but] the fundamentals of our economy are strong,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s tax revenues were estimated at \u00a353.7bn, but the Scottish and UK governments spent \u00a368.6bn on public services in Scotland, and on Scotland\u2019s share of UK and overseas spending.</p> <p>Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said the figures \u201cshould act as a reality check for those calling for another independence referendum\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cDuring the independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon personally promised a second oil boom. Her own government\u2019s figures show she misled people and that is unforgivable,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThe SNP\u2019s own figures confirm independence would mean severe cuts over and above those already being imposed by the Tories, at exactly the time when our public services need more investment.\u201d</p> <p>David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said: \u201cScotland weathered a dramatic slump in oil revenues last year because we are part of a United Kingdom that has at its heart a system for pooling and sharing resources across the country as a whole.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact public spending was \u00a31,200 per head higher in Scotland than the UK as a whole also demonstrates that the United Kingdom, not the European Union, is the vital union for Scotland\u2019s prosperity.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon denied that this meant the country was being subsidised by the rest of the UK, saying Scotland had paid in a higher rate of tax revenues than the UK on average in recent decades. </p> <p>That position ignores the far higher levels of public spending in Scotland, which needed in effect an injection of \u00a315bn last year from the UK treasury. </p> <p>Sturgeon denied that closing the gap would require spending cuts or tax rises. \u201cWhat I say is growing revenue is the priority. Public spending in Scotland is higher than the rest of the UK for some very good and in many respects unavoidable reasons, such as its rurality. It costs more to deliver health services to island communities,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sturgeon insisted that the data offered cause for some optimism. It showed that taxes from the onshore economy, excluding North Sea revenues, had grown by \u00a31.9bn. At 36.5% of Scotland\u2019s GDP, this was the best figure since the financial crisis and more than offset the \u00a31.7bn lost from the decline in oil and gas taxes.</p> <p>But she said the overall figures underlined her anxieties about the damage that leaving the EU could do to the Scottish economy. \u201cLeaving the EU will leave the task of growing the onshore economy so much harder than it might be,\u201d Sturgeon said.</p> <p>Prof John McLaren, an independent economist at Scottish Trends, said future oil revenues were never likely to recover enough to significantly cut the deficit.

  "<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy5cKX4jBkQ\">Born to Make You Happy</a></h2> <p>The title alone is uncomfortable to contemplate, and the song as a whole can only be described as a determined erasure of the autonomous self. Is the most disturbing line the one in which Britney apologises to her absent ex for crying over the split? Like most of her real relationships, this one doesn\u2019t seem as if it was ever that healthy. Forget the idea that Britney\u2019s job was to set any sort of example; calls for pop stars to be role models, especially in their music, are moralistic cant. Born to Make You Happy is horrifying as text and irresistible as pop, and the two are inextricable. The sugar-sweet melody \u2013 unlike her other early singles, this one required no modern production tricks \u2013 and that magnificent key change pull you in despite the horror; the song invites you to willingly, ecstatically, be swept into its darkness. The horror is not only that a sweetly smiling teenager is giving voice to disturbing emotions, but that this penchant for self-degradation and co-dependency is within us as well: she\u2019s tapped into it and forced us to enjoy it.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJWtLf4-WWs\">Stronger</a></h2> <p>Of Britney\u2019s first five Max Martin-produced singles, four are variations on a theme sonically and lyrically, and form a narrative. If Britney begins in a position of powerlessness, so in thrall to her emotions that she sings about craving love as though she\u2019s begging for her life on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4\">\u2026 Baby One More Time</a>, this swiftly gives way to a giddy mania on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4VK9_CfOLQ\">(You Drive Me) Crazy</a>. It\u2019s unclear whether she ever got the boy, but she\u2019s by no means prostrate. Full liberation from romantic myths came on her second album, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CduA0TULnow\">Oops! \u2026 I Did It Again</a>, with the title track\u2019s sarcastic rejection of the ultimate 90s fairytale, Titanic, when Britney isn\u2019t at all bothered about her lover rescuing the necklace dropped into the sea in the film. It was exorcised completely on Stronger, with its callback to Britney\u2019s debut. \u201cMy loneliness ain\u2019t killing me no more,\u201d she declared, and \u2013 as it would so many times over her career \u2013 freedom from dysfunctional emotion meant going deeper into the machine. Martin\u2019s formula for these singles is instantly familiar \u2013 the hard-edged crunch of his heavy-metal background recalibrated for pneumatic, kinetic pop beats. But each is harder-edged than its predecessor, as though Martin was testing to see how abrasive he could make pop radio: (You Drive Me) Crazy throws ringing percussion into the mix, Oops! pounds where \u2026 Baby One More Time pouted. Stronger is the toughest of the four. The three-note \u2026 Baby intro has morphed into a gnarly industrial stab of sound; the song gives way to a jacked-up <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/janet-jackson-superproducers-jimmy-jam-and-terry-lewis\">Jam &amp; Lewis </a>breakdown; and for the first but by no means last time, Britney embraces the inhuman qualities of her strange, hiccupping voice with vocals distorted and ground up against the beat.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuHi2hHZg6g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OuHi2hHZg6g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkcLGts7lsw\">Anticipating</a></h2> <p>With Britney\u2019s third album came a move into grownup territory that was heavily telegraphed but no less effective, as she was paired with the Neptunes production team in their prime. The lead single, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzybwwf2HoQ\">I\u2019m a Slave 4 U</a>, was one of the most radical sonic statements in the chart at a time \u2013 autumn 2001 \u2013 when sonic radicalism could score well on the charts. Counterintuitively, one of the best songs on its parent album turned out to be one of the fluffiest, complexity-free tracks of her career. Uncomplicated joy has rarely been a hallmark of Britney\u2019s discography, but Anticipating nails it. There\u2019s some guy Britney\u2019s beckoning over, but the core of her pleasure is the DJ\u2019s sound and the song he\u2019s playing. With those swooping, gliding disco strings \u2013 check the momentary weightlessness at the start of the second verse, when they cradle Britney\u2019s voice when everything else drops out \u2013 who could blame her? Points, too, for bridging Britney to French house, courtesy of the gem that is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOCjphUxys\">the Alan Braxe remix</a>.</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beUj66P2GqA\">Before the Goodbye</a></h2> <p>Some of the best pop captures a feeling that lasts a fraction of a second and stretches it out over three minutes. Before the Goodbye, a collaboration with 90s trance producer BT which was initially \u2013 inexplicably \u2013 only released on the Japanese edition of Britney\u2019s third album, zeroes in on the momentary foreshadowing of loneliness and loss that flits across the mind despite the comforting presence of a lover. It\u2019s a brief feeling, a passing shadow, but Britney mines every aspect of it: the donning of emotional armour, the defensive pre-emptive apology, the fear of the impotency of loneliness. The beat stutters, stumbles and doesn\u2019t quite explode in the first chorus; we\u2019re almost halfway through before a pounding house rhythm emerges. It\u2019s a room with many doors, from uncertainty to release, and one of the best framings of Britney\u2019s voice to date. </p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YzabSdk7ZA\">Everytime</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YzabSdk7ZA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8YzabSdk7ZA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of Britney\u2019s oddest curveballs was following the gleaming banger <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU\">Toxic</a>, a song that resurrected her ailing career, with its polar opposite. Everytime is a small, lost piano ballad that fed into the tabloid drama of Britney and her ex, Justin Timberlake (it played out as a response to Timberlake\u2019s magnificent Cry Me a River, released the previous year). Its video all but depicted the singer killing herself in a bathtub (implying also that the paparazzi are as much to blame as her breakup). Its fragility is disarming. Despite its sparseness, Everytime still has production tricks up its sleeve (courtesy of Bj\u00f6rk collaborator Guy Sigsworth): strange clicks and swells, burbling beneath the piano line, create a womb-like atmosphere. It\u2019s a rare pop hit that seizes attention by shrinking further away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Britney\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aguardianmusic%3Aplaylist%3A1Fr4AP5FzOqMKomsw5XVsM\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wjH3e4wdKg\">Breathe on Me</a></h2> <p>Britney could never be described as a virtuoso vocalist, but her voice isn\u2019t a limitation so much as an oddity. It\u2019s doubtless one of the most distinctive, immediately recognisable sounds in the past two decades of pop, even if it has often sounded more robotic than human. It has also clearly been a producer\u2019s dream in its elasticity \u2013 but while many have found the most mileage in highlighting its alien qualities through distortion, Breathe on Me is a rare example of a producer (the otherwise unknown Mark Taylor) drawing out its latent beauty. Britney\u2019s breathiness might not be technically good singing, but paired here with a burbling house track, it\u2019s as sensual as she\u2019s ever been. The wordless exhalation that rises out of the whispered bridge is simply gorgeous.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4FF6MpcsRw\">Piece of Me</a></h2> <p>\u201cDo you want a piece of me?\u201d snarls Britney, as though she\u2019s simultaneously coming on to her audience, wearily resigning herself to what the public wants of her and squaring up for a fight. The 2007 album <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/26/popandrock.shopping\">Blackout</a> is her masterpiece, a defiant statement of self that was released at the singer\u2019s most public nadir. The year leading up to the album had seen Britney shave her head, physically attack paparazzi and lose custody of her children. Three months after its release, worldwide audiences gawped in real time as she was stretchered from her house to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, sectioned and placed under the conservatorship of her father \u2013 a setup that is still ongoing nearly a decade later. The production and songwriting personnel on Blackout, from Bloodshy &amp; Avant to Danja to Keri Hilson, seemed to take Britney\u2019s public persona as a muse of sorts. Astounding production \u2013 abrasive, distorted, fragmented, pitch-shifted \u2013 combines with lyrics that veer from meta commentary to giving-the-finger hedonism. The result is to capture the character of a woman on the edge of her sanity. But Blackout is not a tragedy; it\u2019s the culmination of the story Britney started telling seven years earlier on Lucky. If that poignant-in-retrospect single was a hand reaching for help through the fourth wall, then Blackout \u2013 and particularly Piece of Me, probably its most representative cut \u2013 is a fist punching through it. \u201cI\u2019m Mrs Most Likely to Get on TV for Stripping on the Streets,\u201d Britney offers, over degraded bass, chicken squawks and finally a carefree whistle breakdown. Her head was a mess in 2007, but her message on Blackout was clear: this is what we did to her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4FF6MpcsRw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u4FF6MpcsRw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp30_RrIWWg\">Hot As Ice</a></h2> <p>Blackout overflows with ridiculous aural confections, but Hot As Ice might be the strangest. It\u2019s a hallucinatory dance through a demented fairground of manically grinning ooh-aah-aah backing vocals that segue seamlessly into skewed gospel chants. Synth organs oscillate as Britney conveys the physical state of being unable to properly regulate your body temperature when under the influence.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzU9OrZlKb8\">Till the World Ends</a></h2> <p>Britney rarely gets the credit for introducing dubstep to mainstream American pop with the wobble bass of 2007\u2019s Freakshow. So her embrace of its EDMed-up iteration brostep on 2011\u2019s Femme Fatale was less about trend-jacking and more about picking up where she left off. Post-Blackout, Britney has occupied a strange, nostalgic place in pop culture. Her ultra-manufactured style of pop stardom feels anachronistic in an era when fans demand at least a facade of authenticity from their artists, and it\u2019s arguable that this is a reaction to seeing what the industry did to stars like Britney in the first place. As for Britney, simply hearing her sounding blithe is always a relief, even when she\u2019s yearning for apocalypse. Till the World Ends was part of a mini-wave of memento mori club songs around this time that conflated the certainty of approaching death with the necessity of partying hard (think also Pitbull\u2019s Give Me Everything and Nicki Minaj\u2019s Starships). Even better is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAyLPNLxB9U\">the Femme Fatale remix</a> \u2013 sadly not on Spotify \u2013 on which Britney is so thoroughly streamlined into the song\u2019s gleaming bass that it\u2019s up to Ke$ha and Minaj to ramp up the hedonism. They\u2019re both at their most wilfully obnoxious: Ke$ha leans even further into her then trademark Auto-Tune with a vocal that comes as close to capturing the spirit of vomiting into a club toilet as any; Minaj shrieks about poultry and mimes sniffing coke, but most satisfyingly becomes the first rapper to rhyme \u201cBritney\u201d with \u201cpickney\u201d since Dizzee Rascal eight years previously on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tVNnABm5gI\">Seems 2 Be</a>.

On the one hand, it\u2019s a very silly RuPaul-goes-EDM banger that\u2019s at its most functional in the gym. But it\u2019s impossible to hear her exhortations to labour as separate from the system that created Britney Spears, the wealthy celebrity, the cautionary tale, the woman with a tortured relationship to autonomy. \u201cYou wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion? Party in France? You better work, bitch,\u201d she snaps, dishing out capitalist advice from the inside. But Britney is simultaneously the star, the product and the victim of this brutal credo, and if there\u2019s a whip being cracked, it\u2019s the one that\u2019s been on her back for 17 years. One thing Work B**ch isn\u2019t: an office soundtrack. How to subvert a capitalist ethos that seems all-encompassing? Transform it into a club anthem, to be played somewhere where the only work happening is the dancing variety.</p>",

I got back into the cab and waited for the others. One of my team-mates told me that a man with a gun was standing outside the cab. The man with the gun spoke with the cab driver, who got out of the cab. We then got out of the cab and I paid the driver the fare.

This was the first time I have ever had a gun pointed at me and I was terrified.</p> <p>\u201cI put my hands up and sat down on the curb. It became apparent that the man with the gun was telling us to pay, and I was unsure if they were affiliated with the gas station. Gunnar Bentz and I gave the man some money.

  "<p>You have to admire the ambition of Adam Brace. In his 2009 play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/mar/10/theatre\">Stovepipe</a>, he looked at the use of private security companies in Iraq. Now he tackles the vast question of how we come to terms with what is happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/12/lampedusa-soho-theatre-london-review\">Anders Lustgarten</a>, Brace is one of the few British dramatists to think internationally, and although this play is overloaded and overlong, it poses disturbing questions.</p> <p> The focus is on Stef, a guilt-ridden Cambridge graduate who has seen Congolese violence first-hand but is determined to show the country\u2019s positive side. Her big idea is to create a British festival called Congo Voice that will include a rumba band, dancers and poets. Stef is adamant that one third of her committee will be Congolese, but she runs into difficulties. There are divisions in the Congolese diaspora \u2013 above all, the active hostility of a group called Les Combattants de Londres, which is dedicated to creating a free Congo. Stef is faced with death threats, defections and the inherent contradiction of creating a depoliticised jamboree.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/178007458\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/178007458\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/178007458\">Watch the trailer for They Drink It in the Congo</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Behind the play lurks the big question of how we represent what is happening in distant countries and cultures. Brace begins by having a Congolese campaigner mocking our own fitful interest in foreign affairs and predicting yet another evening of \u201cwhite words from black mouths\u201d. He answers that in several ways. One is by showing Stef, who has suppressed her memories of a Congolese atrocity, learning to acknowledge it. Another is by having the Congolese characters periodically resort to their native tongue. We hear nothing but English spoken on stage, but know when they are doing so because, in an ironic reversal of the usual process, we see surtitles where their dialogue is translated into Lingala. Brace hits us hardest when he reminds us of British complicity with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/06/congo-sanctions-president-joseph-kabila\">DRC president, Joseph Kabila</a>, and our parasitic dependence on the country\u2019s mineral resources.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c48940aefc0eda5a61bda3021887a32921d4ee15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c48940aefc0eda5a61bda3021887a32921d4ee15/1792_138_2764_3455/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Iyiola.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joan Iyiola.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Even though the play is laced with jokes reminding us of Brace\u2019s work in standup comedy, it has obvious flaws. One is the problem of providing background information. At one point, Stef\u2019s sidekick is offered a potted history of the Congo that I doubt anyone in the audience can digest. He also creates a puzzling choric figure in Oudry (strongly played by Sule Rimi), who shifts from being the dapper voice of digital technology to a victimised Congolese father. But for all its faults, Brace\u2019s play urgently addresses the paradox of celebrating a country\u2019s culture while ignoring the political realities.</p> <p> Michael Longhurst\u2019s production and Jon Bausor\u2019s design actively embrace the play\u2019s multiplicity of styles, which range from dialectical debate to graphic violence, and the piece is vividly acted. Fiona Button as Stef is the epitome of passionate \u2013 if misplaced \u2013 idealism and Richard Goulding is quietly funny as her supportive ex-lover. There is outstanding work, meanwhile, from Richie Campbell as a militant leader of the Combattants and Anna-Maria Nabirye as a more pacific Congolese campaigner. It\u2019s a far from perfect play, but Brace\u2019s great achievement is to have raised awareness of the Congo while charting Stef\u2019s failure to accomplish the same end.</p> <p> \u2022 At the <a href=\"https://www.almeida.co.uk/whats-on/they-drink-it-in-the-congo/12-aug-2016-1-oct-2016\">Almeida</a>, London, until 10 October.

In 2011, the department was revealed to have unconstitutionally infiltrated Muslim student groups, mosques, religious bookstores, hookah bars and other predominantly Muslim areas to spy on people.</p> <p>The demographics unit, which was responsible for the program, was dismantled in 2014. </p> <p>The original surveillance program sparked a series of lawsuits, one of which concluded earlier this year. In the settlement of the case of Raza v The City of New York \u2013 which is still subject to court approval \u2013 the NYPD agreed to several reforms including: requiring facts before an investigations is launched, limiting the use of informants and undercovers, and prohibiting investigations in which race, religion or ethnicity is a substantial motivating factor.</p> <p>Naz Ahmad, a staff attorney for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability &amp; Responsibility (Clear) Project, which represented the plaintiffs in the case, welcomed the inspector general\u2019s findings. </p> <p>\u201cWe welcome the inspector general\u2019s report confirming what our clients have long known: that the NYPD\u2019s surveillance of American Muslims operated without oversight and often in violation of the rules,\u201d Ahmad said.</p> <p>The use of informants and undercover police, known as human sources, came under scrutiny in the report. Of the requests for human sources reviewed, none contained any details about the anticipated role of that source. It also criticized the use of \u201cboilerplate\u201d language when providing reasons for extending the use of informants. </p> <p>Preliminary inquiries, which allow the police to gather information even when no law has been been broken, were allowed to continue indefinitely, and 100% of the extensions reviewed by the office of the inspector general contained no reason for the extension. </p> <p>The report found the NYPD\u2019s intelligence unit would also routinely continue investigations even after legal authority had expired, which amounted to months of time over the course of investigations. </p> <p>The NYPD did not have any qualms with the findings of the report.</p> <p>\u201cI am very pleased the inspector general\u2019s audit has independently confirmed this to be true, and I thank the IG\u2019s office for its work on this audit and report,\u201d said outgoing police commissioner William J Bratton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/768146780940804096\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Inspector General\u2019s Audit Commends NYPD\u2019s Efforts To Protect New York City From Terrorism <a href=\"https://t.co/GBrti8XI3s\">https://t.co/GBrti8XI3s</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rLPETTcdRm\">pic.twitter.com/rLPETTcdRm</a></p>&mdash; NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/768146780940804096\">August 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Fahd Ahmed, the executive director of Desis Rising Up &amp; Moving (Drum), said the report confirms their suspicions and evidence.

  "<p>A team of US academics has revealed that reading literary fiction improves our understanding of other people\u2019s emotions but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/23/literary-fiction-readers-understand-others-emotions-better-study-finds\">genre fiction does not</a>. It\u2019s a piece of research that seems to me to have more holes than the plot of Midsomer Murders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/23/literary-fiction-readers-understand-others-emotions-better-study-finds\">Literary fiction readers understand others' emotions better, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, they showed 1,000 people a list of names that included authors identified as literary, authors identified as genre, and random names of non-authors. In a subsequent test (I\u2019ll come back to this in a moment) the ones who identified more literary writers scored better in the \u201c<a href=\"http://socialintelligence.labinthewild.org/\">reading the mind in the eyes test</a>\u201d, which correlates social intelligence with the ability to \u201cread\u201d closeups of people\u2019s eyes.<br></p> <p>Now, if you pay any attention to news items about books and writers, you\u2019ll regularly see the names of high-profile literary writers. Even if you never read anything but Mills and Boon, you\u2019d struggle to avoid stories about Salman Rushdie, Harper Lee and Jeanette Winterson. So inevitably, those are names people pick up on.<br></p> <p>Right away, there\u2019s a significant problem of bias in the sample. Recognition, in terms of this research, has nothing to do with what someone reads (or claims to read) \u2013 only that they remember names they\u2019ve read or heard in the media.<br></p> <p>I did the \u201creading the mind in the eyes\u201d test (she said, rolling her eyes). I did very well at it. I scored 33 out of 36. That\u2019s significantly better than average.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s not because I\u2019m totally immersed in literary fiction and don\u2019t waste my brain on genre. There are two reasons. One is that I\u2019ve spent a lifetime in close observation of people so I can write convincing characters.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pitting Salman Rushdie against Clive Cussler - there is no universe in which that is not comparing apples and onions.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second is that I\u2019ve done a lot of quizzes over the years and I recognise the mechanics of a multiple choice that gives you four options, three of which are broadly similar and one of which is different. Whenever I was uncertain of the answer, I went down that route, and I hit the bullseye every time.<br></p> <p>So it seems that this research demonstrates fairly conclusively that people who pay attention to what they read and hear are also pretty savvy when it comes to doing quizzes. Hold the front page.<br></p> <p>I have been saving my spleen for last.<br></p> <p>In recent years, most readers and critics have acknowledged the blurring of the outdated and misguided distinction between literary fiction and other genres.<br></p> <p>There is no doubt that, historically, there was a valid distinction. Nobody would attempt to suggest that there is an equivalence between Agatha Christie and Virginia Woolf. (Let\u2019s face it, Woolf couldn\u2019t plot for toffee.) Those days are long gone. Novels that undeniably have generic elements also often have powerful literary elements. They\u2019re well-written, they have strongly-drawn characters and they deal with thought-provoking themes in challenging ways.<br></p> <p>Kazuo Ishiguro is as much a sci-fi writer as China Mi\u00e9ville, Margaret Atwood as Ursula K Le Guin. Kate Atkinson and Marlon James are writing crime fiction that stands shoulder to shoulder with Laura Lippman and Malcolm Mackay. The much-missed Iain Banks and Booker winner John Banville demonstrate that it\u2019s possible to write with equal style and depth on either side of the theoretical divide.<br></p> <p>But these academics haven\u2019t noticed that the world has moved on. Their study sets Toni Morrison against Danielle Steel, Salman Rushdie against Clive Cussler. There is no universe in which that is not comparing apples and onions.<br></p> <p>To take the lowest common denominator genre fiction and set it against the very best of literary fiction is an entirely pointless opposition. I\u2019d cite Sturgeon\u2019s Law (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law\">Theodore, not Nicola</a>) that \u201c90% of everything is crap\u201d. That\u2019s as true of literary fiction as it is of any other genre. Ask a books page editor.<br></p> <p>Most of us don\u2019t read to improve ourselves. We read for pleasure. I love reading. In the past few months, I\u2019ve read crime fiction, science fiction, literary fiction, historical fiction. The ones I enjoyed, regardless of genre, were the ones where I engaged most strongly with the characters.<br></p> <p>Good books make us care. It really doesn\u2019t matter whether they include murderers, aliens, philosophers or kings.<br></p>",

John attended the grammar school there, where his liking for practical jokes, alongside the meticulous precision of his illustrated diaries, foreshadowed an ability to balance humour and seriousness.</p> <p>He graduated with a business degree from <a href=\"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Manchester University</a>, then went to study English at Cambridge, which was more to his liking. He was taken on by the student newspaper, <a href=\"http://www.varsity.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Varsity</a>, as a cartoonist, and became editor, promising that \u201cserious comment will vie with zany flippancy\u201d. His journalistic career began as a reporter on the Daily Mail in Manchester. Transferred to Belfast in 1966 as the Troubles were beginning, he had three difficult years; at one point he was trapped on a roof with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bernadette-devlin-mcaliskey\" title=\"\">Bernadette Devlin McAliskey</a>, the civil rights activist, while petrol bombs exploded around them.</p> <p>His stint in Ulster took its toll, and by the time he was transferred to London he was drinking heavily and was, in his own words, \u201cstressed and belligerent\u201d. He took redundancy, using the proceeds to buy a ramshackle house in Hackney, north London. He later worked as a reporter for the Guardian.</p> <p>John\u2019s delight in the quirky meant that when his younger brother Peter took up transcendental meditation, which had been made fashionable by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\" title=\"\">the Beatles</a> and their guru, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/07/india.music\" title=\"\">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>, he resolved to test it out. To his surprise he discovered \u201cgreater clarity of mind and freedom from stress\u201d. He wrote a feature on TM for the Guardian in 1973, which attracted new adherents, as well as an invitation from the Maharishi to his headquarters in Switzerland. He stayed there for two years and then converted his house in Hackney into a meditation centre.</p> <p>A compulsive hoarder whose collections included prints, pottery and even <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/money/the-winners-enclosure-barbed-wire-won-the-west-for-americas-farmers-now-collectors-will-pay-up-to-1417812.html\" title=\"\">barbed wire</a>, he continued his journalism with a weekly column in the Independent called Finds, covering such collectible and affordable items as saucy postcards, spy radios and quill pens.</p> <p>John\u2019s humour and idiosyncrasies made him a popular TM lecturer: he took morning sessions in a dressing gown so tattered that one class clubbed together to buy him a new one. In 1992, when the Maharishi proposed that his adherents stand for parliament, John garnered 178 votes in the Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency for the Natural Law party.</p> <p>He left London for another gaunt house in Southwold, Suffolk, which was soon bulging with collectibles.

But by calling it an \u201cinvention\u201d, Juncker went a step further. Borders in his view are not just bad. They are fictitious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I crossed the Croatian-Serbian border last year, there was nothing to mark where Serbia stopped and Croatia started</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For this oddly timed intervention, Juncker has been presented as a renegade. But his argument is in fact an old one. Anthropologists and historians of a certain political disposition have long maintained that borders and nationhood are relatively new constructs. In his book, Imagined Communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/01/benedict-anderson\">Benedict Anderson</a> argues that the concept of a nation developed only after the invention of the printing press in the 15th century. Printed material led to a standardisation of language, Anderson writes, and encouraged readers to see themselves as part of a common national culture.</p> <p>Some scholars argue that the contemporary concept of nations constrained by borders began to crystallise only in 1648. It was then that Europe\u2019s major powers agreed to end the thirty years\u2019 war by signing the peace of Westphalia \u2013 an agreement that saw the signatories agree to respect each others\u2019 territorial sovereignty, a new concept that has become known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty\">the Westphalian system</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5c3e94519c96c766dd93101285f313b0ec36ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5c3e94519c96c766dd93101285f313b0ec36ef1/0_85_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands of migrants across the border between Croatia into Slovenia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands of migrants across the border between Croatia into Slovenia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even then, as William Maley writes in <a href=\"http://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/what-is-a-refugee/\">his new book, What is a Refugee?</a>, \u201cBorders except as formalistic markers of jurisdiction typically did not register prominently in the thinking of princes, not least because until the advent of modern systems of regulatory bureaucracy, rigorous border control was simply beyond the capacity of rulers.\u201d According to the deal, Maley continues, Europeans could still migrate from place to place. </p> <p>Tellingly, it would be centuries before the creation of many of the countries we now consider as immutable concepts. Germany and Italy only became united entities in the second half of the 19th century. Hungary, now one of Europe\u2019s keenest proponents of border protection, was less than a century ago part of a polyglot, multinational commonwealth, the Austro-Hungarian empire. Poland sits roughly 100 miles west of where it did 70 years ago. If an American says her ancestors are Polish, there\u2019s every chance they were born in what is now Lithuania. Meanwhile, one of the creators of the Westphalian system \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire\">the Holy Roman empire</a> \u2013 ironically no longer exists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/britain-failing-child-refugees-europe-help-them-fast\">Britain is still failing child refugees in Europe. We must help them \u2013 and fast | Alf Dubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even today, borders often exist only as a concept, rather than the robust entities that politicians present them as. When I crossed the Croatian-Serbian border last autumn, a few hours before Mohammad the biomedical engineer, there was nothing that marked where Serbia stopped and Croatia started. On either side, there were identical fields of stubble. It was only when I looked on my GPS map \u2013 and saw how the blue dot showing my position had moved west of a slim black line \u2013 that I realised I\u2019d crossed into Croatia.</p> <p>Many borders also exist only in certain contexts \u2013 blocking the passage of people but not things. The majority of humans \u2013 or at least those of us born in the developing world \u2013 cannot legally cross most borders. But all of us can circumvent those same barriers by sending products, money, information, insults, emails, photographs, and ideas to almost any country on the planet.</p> <p>Are borders \u201cthe worst\u201d? That\u2019s a subjective debate. But objectively speaking, borders are definitely an invention.

First we focused on what academics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/oct/28/why-peer-review-needs-a-good-going-over\">would like to see change</a> in the process. Now we\u2019ve examined how new reviewers feel about embarking on reviewing, and it seems clear that many would like significantly more guidance on how to get it right. </p> <p>Alongside issues of transparency, much of the criticism of peer review revolves around the quality of individual reviews \u2013 from the \u201cshort and snitty\u201d (as one researcher put it in a focus group we held) to those that may be biased by the reviewer\u2019s personal views. </p> <p>The majority of reviewers learn on the job, plunged into assessing their peers\u2019 work as a natural progression of their academic career. This will need fixing if everyone\u2019s overall experience of the peer review process is to improve. Here are some of the key findings from our research on the topic: </p> <h2>New academics want to review but don\u2019t know how to start</h2> <p><a href=\"http://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Peer-review-supplement-motivations-and-support.pdf\">Research we conducted</a> with more than 6,300 authors of journal articles, peer reviewers and journal editors revealed that over two-thirds of researchers who have never peer reviewed a paper would like to. Of that group (drawn from the full range of subject areas) more than 60% said they would like the option to attend a workshop or formal training on peer reviewing. At the same time, over two-thirds of journal editors told us that it is difficult to find reviewers.<br></p> <h2>Guidance is not always available</h2> <p>For those who are already reviewing papers, the most common source of support they received was journal editor guidelines. Just under half of respondents \u2013 45% in science, technology and medicine (STM) and 49% in the humanities and social sciences (HSS) \u2013 said they had received these. Guidelines issued by the publisher came second, with 41% of reviewers receiving them in STM, and 35% in HSS. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/sep/27/peer-review-10-tips-research-paper\">Peer review: how to get it right \u2013 10 tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Only one in 10 of reviewers had been to a workshop or formal training but 55% of sciences researchers and 51% of humanities and social science researchers said they would like this opportunity. And that is despite the fact that two-thirds of reviewers rated their confidence in reviewing at eight or above out of 10. </p> <h2>What can editors do?</h2> <p>Editors are trying to recruit and retain good reviewers. But views were split as to the best way to achieve this. Some 46% of editors in STM wanted to offer formal training or workshops but 44% said they didn\u2019t want to. In the humanities and social sciences, just 38% wanted to offer this option, with 56% saying they wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>In terms of what help they were offering, they listed (in the following order): offering their own guidelines and advice, signposting to publisher guidelines, encouraging supervisor involvement, and, for a small number, workshops or formal training. </p> <p>From this research, there seems to be a discrepancy between the support those doing the reviewing wish for and what those overseeing the process are prepared to offer. However, the lack of enthusiasm for offering workshops or formal training has made me wonder whether this may have been more popular had we made it explicit in our question that this training could be delivered by someone other than journal editors.</p> <h2>Why researchers want to review</h2> <p>Playing a part as a member of the academic community, reciprocating the benefit, and enjoying being able to help improve papers were the top three motivations for doing a peer review. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jun/08/scientists-arent-superheroes-failure-is-a-valid-result\">Scientists aren't superheroes \u2013 failure is a valid result</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We also looked at this data across the age groups, expecting to see some differences in this order, particularly for those at the start of their career who might have been more motivated to take the job for career reasons. But, no matter what the age group, playing a part as a member of the academic community scored highest.</p> <p>Understandably, those aged between 20 and 29 gave the highest score compared to other groups in the \u201cenhancing your reputation or furthering your career\u201d category. However, this still came fifth out of the eight possible responses for those in their twenties. And in terms of whether academics should receive payment for doing reviews, those in the youngest age group (20-29) were most in favour, while those who were over 60 were the most resistant. Whether this is due to the financial pressures for those starting out, or a possible shift in attitude towards payment for reviewers, is yet to be seen.</p> <p>With peer review remaining so central to the research process, despite its flaws, understanding the motivations to publish in peer reviewed journals and to review another academic\u2019s work is crucial. Addressing what training is needed is even more important. There\u2019s a clear desire from the academic community to see effective support put in place, so now is the time for action.</p> <p><em></em><strong>Join the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/higher-education-network#https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/?CMP=dis_57\">higher education network</a> for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

  "<p>Yellowstone national park is finding new ways to manage tourism after visits <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/\">jumped</a> by almost 600,000 between 2014 and 2015. After 15 years of steady growth, last year\u2019s 4m visits was a tipping point, says park ranger Charissa Reid.</p> <p>The park expects the number to rise in 2016. July is likely to be the first million-visit month in the park\u2019s 144-year history.</p> <p>However, extra visitors have increased accidents between humans, animals, and the park\u2019s flora and fauna.</p> <p>Park rangers issued more than 52,000 resource violations last year. People broke thermal features, interacted with protected wildlife and relieved themselves in the park. DUIs and domestic violence inside the park also increased.</p> <p>The number of full-time staff at Yellowstone has remained static for over a decade, adding to problems. The NPS employed only 330 permanent and 406 seasonal Yellowstone staff last year.</p> <p>Some<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/16032.htm\"> incidents</a> have made headline news \u2013 a man who strayed 225 yards off a designated path and fell to his death in Yellowstone\u2019s Norris geyser basin and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.yellowstonepark.com/teen-gored-bison\">five people were gored</a> by bison. However, dying in Yellowstone is unlikely.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you consider we had 4 million visitors, I think we\u2019re doing pretty good,\u201d says Reid.</p> <p>Managing human behavior to maintain safety, prevent staff exhaustion and keep visitors happy is a daily challenge.</p> <p>A common disruptive human behavior at Yellowstone is an \u201canimal jam\u201d. This happens when people see a bear or a buffalo, or any other animal, and come to a full stop to jump from their cars.</p> <p>\u201cWe can always tell the difference between a bison jam and a bear jam, because at a bear jam doors are flung open,\u201d says Reid. \u201cPeople kind of lose it over bears in the park.\u201d</p> <p>Yellowstone needs better understanding of visitor behavior to help with management, says Reid. </p> <p>Animal biologists, law enforcement and printers in Yellowstone\u2019s sign shop are all involved in visitor management. \u201cWe are trying to engage everyone to find solutions,\u201d says Reid.</p> <p>Yellowstone has also hired a social scientist to study humans. He researches how visitors enter and exit through the park, and how they interact with park attractions.</p> <p>\u201cOur superintendent often says visitors are the least studied mammal in Yellowstone,\u201d says Reid. \u201cWe know more about bison biology than we know about park visitors.\u201d</p> <p>Increasing international visitors, use of social media and varied cultural expectations among visitors have all caused problems. </p> <p>The park has hired Mandarin-speaking park rangers to communicate with the increasing number of Chinese visitors. Animal warnings have been translated into 10 languages and more toilets have been installed. New barriers and signs stop tourists from wandering, and protections outside wolf and wildlife dens keep them safe.</p> <p>Reid acknowledges these are short-term solutions. Effective long-term solutions remain beyond park management\u2019s immediate control, buried in budgets, and stored in as yet unmined visitor data.</p> <p>In the meantime, visitors are part of the solution.</p> <p>Reid wants people to stay on paths and to refrain from taking selfies with animals. Bison may seem harmless from a distance, but they injure more people annually than any other animal in the park.</p> <p>Visitors need to heed warnings to keep 25 yards away from buffalo and other wildlife, and 100 yards away from wolves and bears. The park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">issues pamphlets</a> asking visitors to use pullouts to view wildlife. </p> <p>Literature suggests visiting during non-peak hours, before 9am and after 3pm. It also encourages people to explore the many alternative federal lands surrounding Yellowstone.</p> <p>Reid, who grew up in Yellowstone, says she knows why the wild and awe-inspiring park keeps visitors coming back. </p> <p>\u201cYou can still see predator and prey activity here,\u201d says Reid. \u201cWildfires still rage. These big processes \u2013 predation, wildfires, migration \u2013 are still active in Yellowstone. Sure, there are places to buy an ice cream cone in Yellowstone. But there are many more places, just 200 or 300 yards into the wilderness, where you very quickly realize you\u2019re a guest in a grizzly bear\u2019s house.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Apple\u2019s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus appear to be vulnerable to so-called \u201ctouch disease\u201d, a hardware problem that is crippling phones, according to reports from users and third-party repairers.</p> <p>The issue, which has been observed in iPhone 6s since the beginning of the year, seems to affect the touchscreen controller chips, resulting in problems for the high-end smartphones in responding to touch input. </p> <p>Badly affected phones become next to useless. First the status bar becomes grey and flickers and the touchscreen becomes unresponsive, with <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/search.jspa?q=iphone+6+touchscreen\">users unable to control</a> or use the smartphones without the touchscreen working.</p> <p>On the eve of Apple\u2019s unveiling of its next version of the iPhone, an extensive report by third-party repair resource iFixit has suggested the issue is widespread.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ifixit.org/blog/8309/iphone-6-plus-gray-flicker-touch-death/\">iFixit repair advocate Julia Bluff said</a>: \u201cOf course, there\u2019s no way to tell exactly how many phones are afflicted with what we\u2019re calling Touch Disease, but every repair tech we spoke to told us that the problem is incredibly common.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis issue is widespread enough that I feel like almost every iPhone 6 or 6 Plus has a touch of it (no pun intended) and are like ticking bombs just waiting to act up,\u201d Jason Villmer, owner of repair shop STS Telecom, told iFixit.</p> <p>A fix for the issue is possible, requiring the broken chips within the iPhones to be carefully replaced by workshops capable of performing so-called microsoldering \u2013 the use of microscopes and very fine soldering irons to remove and replace tiny chips on the main boards of the iPhones.</p> <p>The microsoldering repair specialist <a href=\"http://mendonipadrehab.com/entries/general/the-epidemic-of-iphone-6-6-touch-ic-failure-explained-apples-continues-to-pull-the-wool-over-the-consumer-s-eyes\">Jessa Jones puts the fault down</a> to the same reason the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/24/iphone-6-plus-bend-pockets-complain\">suffered from bending issues</a>. Their thin, wide bodies flex more than previous Apple smartphones and the flex point appears to be around where the touchscreen controllers sit within the smartphones. Apple has since strengthened the structure of its iPhones to correct the issue with 2015\u2019s iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.</p> <p>Jones said: \u201cOver time, normal daily use of the large, thin phone will eventually create a small crack or separation in one of the balls that underlie either of the [touchscreen control] chips on the board. At first, there may be no defect at all. Later you might notice that the screen is sometimes unresponsive, but it is quick to come back with a hard reset. As the crack deepens into a full separation of the chip/board bond, the periods of no touch function become more frequent. This is exacerbated by any drop.\u201d</p> <p>Pressure on the screen or twisting of the phone can work as a temporary fix, as can so-called reflowing of the chip, where it is heated up to try and reform broken bonds, reconnecting the chip to the board beneath it. But the problem will get worse over time, eventually rendering the touchscreen unresponsive.</p> <p>Jones explained that the only solution is to replace both touchscreen control chip, cleaning the board underneath, which should cost about the same as a screen replacement or a quarter of the cost of Apple\u2019s out-of-warranty refurbished phone replacement offer.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s in-store support are not capable of doing so, leaving those out of warranty with little recourse but to buy a new or refurbished smartphone, according to <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/message/30107739#30107739\">users of Apple\u2019s support forums</a>.</p> <p>While Apple store staff have reportedly told users affected by the issue that it is a known problem, the company has not officially acknowledged the issue.</p> <p>Apple did not respond to request for comment.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/error-53-apple-issues-fix-bricked-iphones\"><strong>Apple apologises over Error 53 and issues fix for bricked iPhones</strong></a></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Halle Berry won an Oscar once. That\u2019s worth bearing in mind when you watch the trailer for her new, twice-delayed movie Kidnap. This is an Oscar-winner you\u2019re watching.

I mean, she evidently doesn\u2019t love him enough to keep her eyes on the road, but that\u2019s beside the point. The film\u2019s called Kidnap, after all, not Vehicular Homicide Due to Parental Negligence. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d892c81d3cf3bbebd58e1daa8efcb46fe0c42d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d892c81d3cf3bbebd58e1daa8efcb46fe0c42d2/0_0_857_354/500.jpg\" alt=\"Halle Berry in Kidnap\" width=\"500\" height=\"207\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Berry has taken her son to the world\u2019s least realistic park.

This is just a wild hunch here, and forgive me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think he might have been kidnapped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71ef94cd85d52141fadccdfdc68490a0b8a896d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71ef94cd85d52141fadccdfdc68490a0b8a896d6/0_0_855_359/500.jpg\" alt=\"Halle Berry in Kidnap\" width=\"500\" height=\"210\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yep, there he is, being kidnapped. Fortunately, this is the year 2016 and Halle Berry has a clear view of the kidnapper, so all she needs to do is call the police with the licence-plate number and model of his car and they\u2019ll be able to track it with helicopters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c62aa3e23ec643b4ca76a1bbea799a48332f44ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c62aa3e23ec643b4ca76a1bbea799a48332f44ce/0_0_850_351/500.jpg\" alt=\"Halle Berry in Kidnap\" width=\"500\" height=\"206\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>She can\u2019t do that, though, because her phone fell out of her handbag during all the panic. Still, at least she looks like a sensible woman. I see no real reason why she can\u2019t just methodically utilise the services of the local law-enforcement agency to find her son in a manner that doesn\u2019t exploit the very real horror of child abduction for cheap kicks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3162839015dbd412ca52b1d0241eeb6577e67800\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3162839015dbd412ca52b1d0241eeb6577e67800/0_0_823_370/500.jpg\" alt=\"Halle Berry in Kidnap\" width=\"500\" height=\"225\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Oh right.

Finally seeing sense, Halle Berry goes to the police station to report her missing child. An officer tells her to wait and file a report, and that\u2019s when Berry sees all the posters for missing children. She has an epiphany. \u201cThat\u2019s what all these people did,\u201d she whispers in a piece of real dialogue that someone actually wrote. \u201cThey waited.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s right, all you idiots with abducted kids. That\u2019s why you never got your child back. It\u2019s because you took the time to file a police report instead of haphazardly driving around town crashing into things and screaming. If only you were as much of a badass as Halle Berry, perhaps you\u2019d have found your kid by now. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7273bd794b1ee8e878010b29c8c7bd32b51855f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7273bd794b1ee8e878010b29c8c7bd32b51855f3/0_0_852_355/500.jpg\" alt=\"Halle Berry in Kidnap\" width=\"500\" height=\"208\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So Berry leaps into her car and attempts to hunt down the kidnapper. She also causes a number of spectacular car crashes along the way. Probably fatal ones, too. It\u2019s safe to assume that Halle Berry is now responsible for the deaths of dozens of innocent people, but that probably doesn\u2019t matter. After all, what are the police going to do? Their jobs?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e9af6d46ba555a072138f62c09db80aee83a4f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e9af6d46ba555a072138f62c09db80aee83a4f9/0_0_836_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"Halle Berry in Kidnap\" width=\"500\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The trailer ends with Berry staring down her son\u2019s kidnapper and growling: \u201cYou took the wrong kid.\u201d Not \u201cabducting children is wrong, so please stop doing it\u201d. Not \u201cthe police will be here in a minute\u201d. \u201cYou took the wrong kid.\u201d This is basically a film about a terrifying vigilante who kills innocent people and then chides her son\u2019s abductor for not performing due diligence during the research phase of his kidnapping. Let that be a lesson to any aspiring child abductors out there: you should only kidnap the children of anyone who looks like they don\u2019t love their kid as much as Halle Berry. Not that it matters, of course, because as soon as she\u2019s reunited with her son, she\u2019s getting sent to prison for murder.

  "<p>A federal court has ordered the payment of more than $3m in compensation to traditional owners over damage to sacred sites in one of the most significant rulings about native title since the Mabo decision 24 years ago. </p> <p>The compensation case, brought on behalf of the Ngaliwurru and Nungali people in the township of Timber Creek, sought damages for the extinguishment of native title in the area through acts attributable to the Northern Territory and commonwealth governments in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>Their victory in Darwin on Wednesday was expected to set a significant precedent in such compensation cases, leaving state, territory and federal governments exposed to future compensation and drawing comparisons with the <a href=\"http://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/articles/mabo-case\">historic Mabo ruling</a> in 1992 which recognised native title for the first time.</p> <p>The Ngaliwurru and Nungali groups won native title for the land, near the West Australian border of the Northern Territory, in 2006 after a seven-year battle, but not for every area of land they claimed.</p> <p>The groups sought compensation for a number of acts, including the construction of public works, on their land which extinguished native title and impacted their ability to conduct spiritual and ceremonial activity.</p> <p>Federal court judge John Mansfield ordered compensation of $3,300,261, including $512,000 for the economic value of the extinguished rights, more than $1.48m in interest, and another $1.3m for pain and suffering. </p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s judgment sets an extraordinary precedent and methodology for measuring the value of extinguished native title, and is predicted to leave state and territory governments liable for huge payouts in forthcoming and future compensation claims. More than 2.3m square kilometres of land is currently designated native title. </p> <p>Mansfield preferenced the higher valuations made by the commonwealth\u2019s expert valuer, Copland, rather than the expert relied on by the Timber Creek applicants.</p> <p>In February <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-08/historic-native-title-case-heard-in-timber-creek/7150428\">the federal court convened at Timber Creek</a> so Mansfield and lawyers could hear from the traditional owners about how they valued native title.<br></p> <p>Among his findings, Mansfield said the loss to the Ngaliwurru and Nungali peoples was \u201cevident\u201d but it was clear they had not wholly lost their connection to country, and that some developments in Timber Creek had been acceptable under Indigenous law.</p> <p>Each government encroachment had \u201cto some degree diminished the geographical area\u201d that the Ngaliwurru and Nungali could exercise native title rights over, he said, and \u201cin an imprecise way\u201d had adversely affected their spiritual connection with the particular areas and their country generally. </p> <p>Mansfield noted the construction of water tanks on the path of the Indigenous people\u2019s dingo Dreaming \u201chas caused clearly identified distress and concern\u201d, and had impacted their capacity to conduct ceremonial and spiritual activities.</p> <p>Speaking outside the court, the chief executive of the Northern Land Council, Joe Morrison, said they were \u201cbuoyed\u201d by the court\u2019s decision. Allowing the case to proceed had been an \u201cimmense opportunity for traditional owners right around the country who wanted to seek compensation for extinguishment of native title\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/29/native-title-review-finds-process-slow-resource-intensive-and-inflexible\">Native title review finds process slow, resource intensive and inflexible</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrison said the amount of compensation after \u201cthe conquest of the British\u201d could always be argued but \u201cfor now the court has made a relevant and important decision to calculate the amount of comp, particularly in non-exclusive native title, and to award that cost\u201d.</p> <p>Distribution of the compensation payments will be made in accordance with the decision-making processes of the native title holders.</p> <p>Also in the federal court on Wednesday, another long-running dispute, brought by a powerful northeast Arnhem Land clan against the Northern Land Council, was dismissed.</p> <p>The case was centred the distribution of mining royalties by the NLC in north-east Arnhem Land, and the unsuccessful party said the decision left Indigenous landowners as \u201cwards of the state\u201d without equal rights of appeal.</p> <p>The complicated case, brought by the Rirratjingu Aboriginal corporation (RAC) and others against the NLC, began in 2014 after attempts to settle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/07/indigenous-leaders-call-feud-between-minister-and-land-council-chief-childish\">a dispute between RAC and the rival Gumatj clan</a> over royalties from t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/-sp-boom-to-dust-uncertain-future-for-town-run-by-rio-tinto\">he Gove bauxite mine and refinery</a> failed.</p> <p>The NLC had determined a split of 74% to 26% in favour of the Gumatj, while the RAC claimed they were entitled to 50%.</p> <p>Mansfield dismissed the RAC\u2019s case, and awarded some costs to the NLC. His decision essentially repeated an earlier judgment in the same proceeding.</p> <p>Mansfield said the RAC was free to reformulate a new case, but it could not appeal with the same arguments.</p> <p>The RAC has interpreted Mansfield\u2019s decision as finding Indigenous groups to be \u201cwards of the state\u201d and said the decision enforced a two-tier system which allowed greater rights of dispute resolution to non-Indigenous people.</p> <p>The RAC director, Witiyana Marika, told Guardian Australia his group would continue to fight for greater control and benefit from their land.</p> <p>\u201cIn the territory the land council is always denying our position. It is the traditional owners that should make the decision,\u201d Marika told Guardian Australia.<br></p> <p>He said the Rirratjingu were rightful landholders and entitled to the royalties, and dismissed the NLC as bureaucracts.</p> <p>\u201cIn this case, most Australians can appeal to the courts, where traditional owners must appeal to commonwealth bureaucracies \u2013 and our view is that this is not right,\u201d said RAC chairman, Bakamumu Marika.</p> <p>He said it allowed the NLC to do what it liked, including blocking development.</p> <p>\u201cThe judgment will say if you don\u2019t agree with land council decisions, you\u2019re pretty well stuck with them, which is problematic if you\u2019re in legal conflict with the land council, as we are.\u201d</p> <p>Djawa Yunupingu, senior elder of the Gumatj clan, said they had always been certain of their position as landowners on the Gove peninsula, and confident of the case\u2019s outcome.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/19/wave-hill-walk-off-anniversary-birth-of-indigenous-land-rights-battle\">Thousands commemorate Wave Hill walk-off, birth of Indigenous land rights battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis court case has been very expensive and has distracted us from our work at the community level where we are building businesses, creating jobs, and educating children,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope that from here common sense will prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison said the case reaffirmed the NLC\u2019s role in \u201cdetermining who traditional owners are and in determining how much money should be flowing from those agreements and activities on Aboriginal land\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a win for the land council, but also for traditional owners, all Rirratjingu and the clan members in north east Arnhem, and we\u2019re looking forward to working with all of those to ensure a prosperous future for Yolngu people\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>In two dramatic weeks, the backdrops of Corcovado and Copacabana served as visual soundtracks to the 31st Olympiad. Rio de Janeiro, the sixth most populated city in the Americas, played host to 207 nations, and welcomed athletic competitors from the first refugee team, South Sudan, and Kosovo.</p> <p>The United States of America, a nation built by immigrants, left the Games as a melting pot of multicultural glory. Every shade of America\u2019s skin was present and carrying the same message: don\u2019t ever give up, because the fight is not done.</p> <p>So it\u2019s only fair to commemorate the Latino athletes who stood on that podium, wearing red, white and blue while inspiring millions of viewers. We honor their achievements because they reflect our own sacrifices and the ones made by our parents and grandparents who risked so much to be here.</p> <p>Gracias to <strong>Maya Dirado</strong>. Her humble approach to competition makes her even more likeable \u2013 if that was even possible. When she stood on that podium after winning the 200m backstroke and out-touched the heavy favorite, Katinka Hosszu of Hungary, the tears of joy were a brief reminder of the hours of work that no one else sees.

The 20-year-old Mexican American light flyweight was the first male US fighter to claim a medal of any kind at the Games since 2008. After losing the semi-final bout and earning a bronze, Hernandez remained respectful and never complained, admitting his opponent was the better competitor.</p> <p>\u201cI know, win or lose, my supporters back home are proud of me either way,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/17286074/american-light-flyweight-nico-hernandez-eliminated-rio-olympics-hasanboy-dusmatov-uzbekistan\">he said after the fight.</a> He owes so much to his father, a truck mechanic who introduced him to the sport when he was nine. \u201cHe\u2019s been pushing me since I was little and helping me chase my dreams,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/nico-hernandez-ready-challenge\">he told NBC before the Games began.</a> No one gave him a shot in the first bout against Italy\u2019s Manuel Cappai, and now he\u2019s an Olympic bronze medallist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f5ed0c45a36d81fb580eb0a45edbb8c88b942d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f5ed0c45a36d81fb580eb0a45edbb8c88b942d6/0_65_3827_2296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nico Miguel Hernandez, left, fights Uzbekistan\u2019s Hasanboy Dusmatov in the semi-final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nico Miguel Hernandez, left, fights Uzbekistan\u2019s Hasanboy Dusmatov in the semi-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Franklin II/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking of opportunity, <strong>Danell Leyva</strong>, the Cuban American gymnast most definitely took his.

After helping Team USA win gold in the team all-around, the 16-year-old became the first and only Latina ever to win a medal on balance beam.

The Argentinian American showed a tremendous amount of grit as the greatest women\u2019s player ever scored 17 points in the final against Spain, propelling her team to a dominating win and making the case for the women\u2019s US team as the greatest Olympic squad ever. Between them, they have eight Olympic medals.</p> <p>Since we are discussing leadership, let\u2019s celebrate <strong>Maggie Steffens</strong>, captain and Olympics MVP of the women\u2019s water polo team, who achieved gold for a second consecutive time. She is the daughter of Carlos Steffens, who played for Puerto Rico\u2019s men\u2019s water polo team in three Pan-American Games and was a three-time all-American for UC Berkeley.

After a World Cup qualifier against Senegal last September, the Mali international told Valencia he\u2019d be staying at home to play in a friendly against Kenya. Upon his return, he revealed that he\u2019d played 48 minutes in a 1-0 win (he wasn\u2019t cheeky enough to claim the goal for himself, as that would be a bit <em>too</em> implausible), a declaration that turned out to be a big fib - he\u2019d actually been in Paris visiting his father, who was ill in hospital. When Claudio Ranieri, then manager of Valencia, discovered the deceit he saw the funny side and told Sissoko that the club would have happily given him the time off anyway.</p> <p>More recently, former France international Youri Djorkaeff found himself with some explaining to do for bunking off when he told club officials at New York Red Bulls that he had to return to France to attend to a serious family matter. The domestic crisis in question? Enthusiastically celebrating France\u2019s World Cup quarter-final win over Brazil in Frankfurt, Germany, where he was caught by TV cameras.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Stoke striker Sammy Bangoura ended an unexplained 37-day absence and returned to the club having missed pre-season training. Rumoured to have been at home in his native Guinea, Bangoura\u2019s absence infuriated the Potters so much that they stopped paying his wages while he was away. The 24-year-old striker - twice previously late returning to the club from Guinea - eventually reported for duty the day before Stoke\u2019s season opener at Southend, claiming that an immigration wrangle involving his five-month-old daughter had caused the delay.</p> <h2>...and a bonus Knowledge archive update!</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd timing that you returned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/football-teams-who-had-cigarette-brands-as-a-shirt-sponsor\">the most goals scored on a debut</a> a couple of weeks ago,\u201d begins Colin Carter.</p> <p>\u201cWhile bored at work, I was reading up on Vincent Janssen, and stumbled across the story of Johan Voskamp.

The county has added roughly one housing unit for every 10 new residents in recent years, according to county housing manager Julie Conway.</p> <p>At the same time, the top five occupations in the area are low-wage jobs in retail, food service and cleaning, paying between $9.06 and $11.30 an hour, according to 2015 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://workingfordignity.sites.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/192/2015/11/Working-For-Dignity-Final-Report.pdf\">research</a>.

Anyway, I for one enjoy all the lectures from people who like Olympic sports and athletes almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 enough to watch them more than once every four years.

The training montage frequently seems as important as the event itself. I am not sure the logical destination of all this is anywhere particularly aspirational. Consider NBC, who are so patronisingly obsessed with the idea of context that they didn\u2019t even show Rio\u2019s opening ceremony live. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2016/07/12/nbc-opening-ceremony-olympics-rio-delay-one-hour/87000530/\">They wanted to \u201ccurate\u201d it</a>. As their top sports executive explained: \u201cWe think it\u2019s important that we are able to put [it] in context for the viewer so that it\u2019s not just a flash of colour.\u201d</p> <p>There must and shall be takeout. And yet, I find myself rather against the idea that all of modern life must, in some way, teach us about some other aspect of modern life. When Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld were making Seinfeld, they shied away from this cosy didacticism that had historically characterised so many other American sitcoms. Their mantra was \u201cNo hugging, no learning\u201d, and they were so insistent upon it that they <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q-IuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT248&amp;lpg=PT248&amp;dq=seinfeld+no+hugging+no+learning+jackets&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M90AXT6a6X&amp;sig=jLm1jQr3odHi0JpJFg2O2b45Wok&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig_ODkmNfOAhXD1SwKHc7uBi8Q6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=seinfeld%20no%20hugging%20no%20learning%20jackets&amp;f=false\">even had jackets bearing the motto made up for staff</a>.</p> <p>These days, fewer and fewer sporting moments are permitted not to be a learning experience, as though enjoying them purely sportingly, and for their own sake, would be a waste of time or a lesser experience. There must be hugging. There must be learning. Post\u2011event interviewers are always effectively asking the person who has provided the sporting moment what we\u2019ve learned from it. We get the long view while the athlete is still out of breath. And we do that particularly as far as the Olympics is concerned, because the reality is a) the sports are often deeply niche and b) no one is going to be sticking around for the next three years and 49 weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/19/ryan-lochte-olympic-tale-gold-medals-white-privilege-rio\">Ryan Lochte: an Olympic tale of gold medals and white privilege | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Football is largely immune from this.

I love the Olympics, but that\u2019s quite enough hugging and learning for now.</p> <h2>Botham\u2019s Ashes and a bygone Britishness<br></h2> <p>Is there anything more nationally uplifting than out-of-shape politicians piggybacking on the success of Olympic athletes who totally disagree with them? The only possible answer is <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/06/are-politicians-too-dumb-to-understand-the-lyrics-to-born-in-the-usa.html\">hardline Republicans rocking out to Born in the USA</a>, as though its transparently despairing lyrics were as impenetrable as their wives.</p> <p>It began even before the athletes were home from Rio. Last week (<a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/team-gb-threatens-to-sue-leaveeu-over-olympic-video-10540692\">and to the fury of Team GB</a>) it was the turn of British Olympic gold medal winners to be co-opted by people whose idea of a training regime is a full English and some light bigotry. Leave.EU \u2013 the provisional wing of the Brexit campaign \u2013 released a video featuring pictures of all the British Olympic gold medal winners up to that moment, interspersed with text reading \u201cWe\u2019re too small \u2026\u201d and \u201cWe need to be in the EU \u2026\u201d They were being ironic, of course, with all of the gossamer touch we came to expect during the referendum campaign itself. The only sadness was that they hadn\u2019t thought of this a few hours earlier, then they wouldn\u2019t have had to include Mo Farah\u2019s first gold, and their video would have looked exactly the way they seem to like things.</p> <p>I say this advisedly. On the very last morning of the referendum campaign itself, I saw Nigel Farage take to a stage in Westminster for his final address, which began with a Leave.EU film about Britain narrated by his good self.</p> <p>In this, he quavered that Britain was \u201ca country of sporting greatness\u201d. Quite right \u2013 and yet, the only footage used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/leavers-take-control\">illustrate this was of Botham\u2019s Ashes</a>. Botham\u2019s Ashes! I mean really \u2026 what could be more <em>au courant</em> than Botham\u2019s Ashes? I hardly need remind you of the date of that undoubted triumph, but it did seem remarkable that nothing in the intervening three and a half decades of British sporting success was worthy of inclusion instead.</p> <p>Indeed, it made me wonder: what is it about so many of the sporting triumphs of the past 35 years that makes them somehow unsuitable for a Leave.EU video? You might have thought, say, that Super Saturday during the London Games might have provided a moment of total sporting Britishness. Then again, to the likes of Leave.EU, it didn\u2019t seem to.

It became international law in December 2014 and its annual Conference of States Parties brings together all the governments that have joined the treaty to debate its implementation and impact. The treaty brings some much-needed regulation to the $100bn global arms trade. The elephant in the room here is the fact that in Yemen civilians are dying every day because bombs, provided to Saudi Arabia by states sitting around the table, are being dropped on them.</p> <p>Earlier this year, campaign group <a href=\"http://controlarms.org/en/\" title=\"\">Control Arms</a> analysed arms transfers to Saudi Arabia in the context of the Yemen crisis. We found nine parties to the ATT issued licences or carried out arms exports to Saudi Arabia in 2015: France, Germany, Italy, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/23/british-cluster-bombs-yemen-cameron-killing-civilians-inquiry\" title=\"\">the UK</a>, as well as two signatories, Turkey and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/us-promoting-war-crimes-yemen-saudi-bombing-obama\" title=\"\">the US</a>. These sales and licences totalled more than US$25bn and included bombs, rockets and missiles \u2013 just like those falling on the people of Yemen.</p> <p>Some states, specifically the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden, have tightened up their export controls in response to the crisis in Yemen; but several, notably the UK, US and France, are continuing with business as usual, violating the treaty in plain sight. Whether for profit or diplomatic gain, this is appalling hypocrisy. It is also illegal. The UK, in a statement to the conference, confirmed its unerring commitment to the ATT, and chided those who might criticise treaty violators because \u201cthis could deter others joining\u201d. Perhaps not violating the treaty would be a better way to discourage criticism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/05/saudi-arabia-bombs-yemen-tories-human-rights\">Who\u2019s making sure the Saudi bombs keep falling on Yemen?

Reports from UN experts, human rights groups and news reports of bombings of schools, hospitals and mosques could not make this clearer.</p> <p>The arms trade has operated in the shadows for decades. With the ATT in force, arms deals may not be made covertly any more. Each state must submit an annual report that declares which transfers have been authorised. This week, states will also decide whether these reports should be made public or stay secret. There should be no question about this. They shouldn\u2019t even be given a choice. Reports must be made publicly available.</p> <p>Greater transparency can help stop illegal sales, reduce the risk of arms being diverted to terrorist groups and criminals; stop the flood of weapons to human rights abusers, and stop the arms that are being used to violate humanitarian law in too many communities on too many days. It\u2019s time to shine a light on this deadly trade.</p> <p>So this week, the stakes could not be higher. The arms trade is big business for many states \u2013 but for so many people around the world it\u2019s so much more. What happens in Geneva is a matter of life or death.</p>",
  "<p>As the old saying goes, \u201cLaughter is the best medicine.

In 2015, the capital accounted for 56% of all cases in England, with a 22% increase in diagnoses in the year 2014-15. Since 2010 the number of cases of syphilis in Londoners has increased by 163%, with a 22% increase in the year from 2014 to 2015. The borough of Lambeth has the highest rates, closely followed by the City of London and Southwark.</p> <p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) represented 90% of all syphilis cases in 2015, with a 232% increase in diagnosis over the last five years, said the report. More than half of the MSM diagnosed with syphilis in 2015 were also infected with HIV, and over half additionally tested positive for a separate STI. Rates in heterosexuals remain stable but are higher than ideal. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2016/jun/27/government-cuts-are-brewing-a-sexual-health-crisis\">Government cuts are brewing a sexual health crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s 2016. Safe sex campaigns and targeted prevention efforts are in place. Sexual health care is free and accessible to both high and low risk groups. So what is going on?</p> <p>The basic science can\u2019t be sugar coated. More condomless sex leads to higher rates of syphilis, (and gonorrhoea, chlamydia, HIV \u2026 the list goes on). Untreated syphilis means  the disease continues to be passed on and leads to potentially horrifying long-term medical complications. Action is needed now to address the reasons behind these patterns, particularly in MSM, the group most affected.</p> <p>In MSM, higher numbers of partners is a key reason behind the heavily inflated rates, compounded by the use of apps such as Grindr, venue based and group sex. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/08/chemsex-gay-men-drugs-health-risk-hiv-aids\">reported increased use of Chemsex</a> (recreational drugs used during sex) is also of concern, lowering sexual inhibitions and making the likelihood of using a condom less likely.</p> <p>Another worrying phenomenon is \u201csero-sorting\u201d \u2013 when men choose partners who have the same HIV status, in theory negating the need to use a condom. However, this puts both partners at high risk of contracting a plethora of STIs.</p> <p>So what to do? A wag of the finger and a warning to wear condoms is insufficient. While individuals do need to take responsibility for their personal health, adequate support and infrastructure is essential to achieve better sexual health in the UK and turn around these rising figures.</p> <p>Progress begins with knowledge, which in turn begins with education. Sex education in schools remains an optional curriculum, with countless young people, particularly teen MSMs, missing out on vital advice needed to keep them healthy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/mar/24/sex-education-uk-teenagers-pregnancy-sexually-transmitted-infections\">Sex education in the UK is letting our teenagers down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sexual health clinics manage the majority of syphilis testing and treatment and so attention must be paid to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2016/jun/27/government-cuts-are-brewing-a-sexual-health-crisis\">massive budget cuts</a> being faced by sexual health and MSM support services.

Only robust, accessible and adequately funded services will be able to maintain this level of care. Responsibility is now on the government to ensure the needs of some of its most vulnerable populations are being met.</p> <p>Further study is needed to look at the complex background to increasing rates of STIs in high risk groups.

The script\u2019s fumbling, intermittent attempts at humour barely qualify as half-hearted, which leaves only the gameplay as a source of redemption. Unfortunately, Ghostbusters is a blandly generic twin-stick shooter, where one joystick moves your character and the other directs their gunfire. You and three player- or AI-controlled compatriots walk around agonisingly slowly, shooting ghosts with a range of tiresomely conventional weapons, before occasionally whipping out proton packs and catching one. The action isn\u2019t unpleasant, but the fact that you see everything the game has to offer in its opening 15 minutes makes the rest of its 12-plus hours an exercise in repetitious futility that you should avoid at all costs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c59ef8c8a11de12c54ee271c9b824ed883eeef87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c59ef8c8a11de12c54ee271c9b824ed883eeef87/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Happy Few.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smile like you mean it...

The biggest shock was that the peppy opening scene of the trailer, a daytime TV-style news bulletin, rapidly gave way to a stark game of survival set in a dingy alternate-1960s Britain. The country has suffered a terrifying national trauma that everyone is legally obliged to forget by taking Joy, an anti-depressant/memory suppressant that renders the populace happily vacant. Your main job is, of course, staying alive.

Leah, a college student, is broke, high and in a state of shambolic collapse most of the time, but she is also a middle-class girl with certain expectations of the world, one of which is that if you get into trouble, you throw yourself at the nearest man who looks like your dad and everything gets better from there. That it doesn\u2019t work out in this case is less interesting to the film-maker than the meaning of that expectation itself.</p> <p>Wood, 33, is sitting opposite me in a cafe in downtown Manhattan, where she lives with her husband and two-year-old son, many miles from the New York neighbourhood in which the film is set. White Girl \u2013 the title is also slang for cocaine \u2013 draws heavily on Wood\u2019s experiences of moving to New York from Oklahoma 15 years ago, to take up a college place and do much of what Leah does in the movie: move to a crime-ridden Puerto Rican district where, the locals told her, they\u2019d \u201cnever seen a white girl, except for that one crackhead\u201d; set about partying herself into near oblivion, hanging out with small-time drug dealers and realising that, for the people living around her, the world worked completely differently \u2013 that is, without the \u201csafety net\u201d of racial advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49221fea835f0186dc6e5dbc7de6c8c98d3ed96f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49221fea835f0186dc6e5dbc7de6c8c98d3ed96f/113_121_1598_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018In many ways she\u2019s the bad guy\u2019 \u2026 Morgan Saylor with Brian Marc in White Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In many ways she\u2019s the bad guy\u2019 \u2026 Morgan Saylor with Brian Marc in White Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR image/PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film, which attracted attention at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundancefilmfestival\">Sundance</a>, asks a lot of good questions about race, class and gender discrimination, but if it causes a firestorm when it comes out on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a> later this year, it will be because of the sex scenes \u2013 there is a lot of teenage shagging in the backs of cars, up against walls and in club toilets. </p> <p>None of these scenes, for which the film has drawn inevitable comparisons to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/22/harmony-korine-kids-20th-anniversary\">Harmony Korine\u2019s Kids</a>, feel angled to shock, with the exception of a rape scene that is by necessity brutal. The reason for this, apart from the subtlety of the script, is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2838320/\">Morgan Saylor</a>, best known for her role as Dana Brody in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland\">Homeland</a>, who is spectacular as Leah, by turns silly, naive, infuriatingly childish, compassionate and brave. In a lesser film, she might have been a 2D vehicle for Wood\u2019s desire to tell off the world, but instead she\u2019s a complex figure: neither wholly exploiter nor victim. Her idiocy has dire consequences for her boyfriend, so that, says Wood, \u201cin many ways she\u2019s the bad guy\u201d. But the price she pays for it is so steep it is hard not to sympathise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXDr-mZkRTQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zXDr-mZkRTQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The male lead, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6891629/\">Brian Marc</a>, is a Puerto Rican singer who\u2019d barely acted before he won the role and plays the drug dealer, Blue, with a subtle and heartbreaking brilliance, while his buddy, played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6853061/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\">Anthony Ramos</a>, is currently wowing audiences nightly on stage in the Broadway hit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hamilton\">Hamilton</a>.

Instead, she is writing of the specific experience of coming to New York from the middle of the country and promptly losing one\u2019s head, a form of self-indulgence she understands well. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for kids who come from very stable backgrounds to take these risks than kids who grew up used to these things and don\u2019t see the allure.\u201d</p> <p>Wood\u2019s parents \u2013 father a psychologist, mother a speech therapist \u2013 are stalwart members of the Church of Christ, where her father is a minister. Wood relays this information with a smile that acknowledges the discomfort she has put them through, over the years. (When her parents saw the film for the first time at Sundance, Wood felt obliged to issue an advance warning: \u201cDad, about seven minutes in there\u2019s a blow job.\u201d) They have the advantage, she says, of having a good sense of humour and also being the most liberal people in the church. \u201cThey support everything I do and hug and smile and are my biggest cheerleaders. But still.\u201d</p> <p>A result of this stability in her background was to make her go even more crazy in her late teens and early 20s. In Wood\u2019s case, she did well at school but also partied hard so that, she says, \u201cmy mum was convinced I was not going to graduate from high school. I remember her saying, \u2018Life is not a party!\u2019 Then the next day I was valedictorian and gave a speech.

For Wood, in the early days in New York, this manifested as a certain detachment \u2013 the ability to live in an impoverished neighbourhood, safe in the knowledge she would have the option one day to move out. She regarded the scene with a gimlet eye. \u201cWhile it was happening, I was like, \u2018This is going to be my first movie.\u2019 I had the journal where I drew a picture of a scene out of the window, and I framed it and I always had it out of my desk.\u201d </p> <p>She may have looked lost at times, but for reasons both personal and structural she was a long way from being in any really irreversible trouble. As a result, she says, it was a fun time. \u201cIt really felt like a family neighbourhood. Everyone was always outside; there were barbecues and ice cream, and we were struggling students and we had this nice apartment.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m trying to examine my privilege, and this may leave a bad taste in people of colour\u2019s mouths</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wood hung out with the guys on the street and her then roommate, with whom she is still good friends, had a baby with the man she was then dating. Everything contrived to keep them apart, which Wood would later use in the film. \u201cThe judicial system, economic and family background, just logistics of how you can move around in this world. It\u2019s like Romeo and Juliet: there was no way these two people were going to be together, even if they wanted to be. There was no way these kids could figure it out.\u201d</p> <p>The rape scene, which was informed by the experience of a friend, is shot in such as way as to convey the rapist\u2019s corrupt logic: the rationale of, \u201cWe\u2019re wasted, we\u2019re partying, this is what we were going to do anyway.\u201d That idea \u2013 of flirtation being read as an unspoken invitation to have sex \u2013 is one that, says Wood, \u201cI know in my life has happened millions of times and it\u2019s the same for many women. \u2018I didn\u2019t think I was promising to sleep with you! I thought I was just having a good time! I thought I was in control of this situation!\u2019 But there are moments when you find yourself where you\u2019ve gotten too far.\u201d</p> <p>It is with dry amusement that Wood acknowledges the rape scene as yet another plot point in a film already overloaded with things that could \u201cgo wrong and offend people\u201d. For a first feature, she has picked a story that throws up just about every flashpoint, save for abortion, in US contemporary culture. The way Wood got around her anxiety about this was through prep and more prep. She had to be absolutely sure she knew what she was trying to say, before anyone else jumped aboard to accuse her of saying it wrong. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m trying to start a conversation, ask questions, I\u2019m trying to examine my privilege, and this may leave a bad taste in people of colour\u2019s mouths: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re trying to examine it? But that\u2019s our work, our shit to do.\u2019 They\u2019ve had to examine it their whole lives.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Yesterday, construction workers were harassing me, so I started filming them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before the film was even finished, the title was already causing problems. <strong>\u201c</strong>I had a teacher in grad school who told me I could never call my film that. She said these girls would never go into that neighbourhood and date these guys. She couldn\u2019t deal with it. One day in class I burst into tears and said, \u2018Actually this is a personal story.\u2019\u201d As for the title, she says: \u201cIt is bold like the film.\u201d</p> <p>In the years since college, Wood has moved and is now in Manhattan. But even now, she finds it useful to remove herself and see a scene from above. \u201cDo I do things for a story? I don\u2019t know. Maybe I just like excitement. Yesterday, construction workers were harassing me. They weren\u2019t being rude, but they were engaging with me, calling after me, and I started filming them, which I always do. It made them take a step back.\u201d </p> <p>Their cajoling didn\u2019t stop, but Wood\u2019s experience of it changed, because she knew she would put the scene to use afterwards. \u201cTelling our stories makes us feel powerful.\u201d</p>",

Although some are lucky enough to display them naturally, the majority of us have to work to develop them as best we can. But what if your episodes of productivity, creativity and energy signify an episode of mental ill-health? For many people with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/bipolar-disorder\" title=\"\">bipolar disorder</a>, this is precisely the case. Formerly referred to as \u201cmanic depression\u201d, bipolar disorder is characterised by fluctuations in mood. Episodes of depression \u2013 often marked by sadness, lethargy and hopelessness \u2013 can be followed by periods of elation.</p> <p>In the early stages, this elation is termed \u201chypomania\u201d, and this is often when a person is at their most inventive and sociable. If hypomania develops further, the person may be considered to be in the midst of a \u201cmanic\u201d episode. While sharp elevations in mood may sound appealing in principle, the reality is that mania can be associated with a range of impulsive behaviours, including substance use, promiscuity and excessive spending, all of which can have severe adverse consequences. It can be an exceptionally high price to pay for a relatively short spell of confidence and ingenuity.</p> <p>Although bipolar disorder \u2013 referring to the twin \u201cpoles\u201d of depression and mania \u2013 is cyclical, it\u2019s not necessarily the case that it results in continuously fluctuating moods; nor does everyone with the diagnosis experience oscillations of similar severity. Some people will experience mild elation but severe depressions; others will report hypomania and only mild depression. As with many mental health problems, two people with a similar diagnosis can exhibit very different symptoms. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3486639/\" title=\"\">Approximately 1-3% of people</a> will display symptoms indicative of bipolar disorder at some point in their lives, but many also present with other emotional difficulties, most notably anxiety disorders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most significant risk factor for developing bipolar may be environmental stress</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with many mental health problems, we\u2019re not sure exactly what causes bipolar disorder, although there is some evidence that having a parent with the condition increases your risk of developing it by a factor of eight (although the children of people with bipolar are actually more likely to develop unipolar depression, without episodes of mania). This suggests that, the possibility of inherited predisposition aside, the most significant risk factor for developing bipolar may be environmental stress. It\u2019s hardly surprising, of course \u2013 we know that stressful life events, particularly those experienced in childhood, are associated with <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341916/\" title=\"\">significantly higher rates</a> of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia. But, again, these are associations only \u2013 a substantial number of people experience multiple adverse life events, but not all will go on to be diagnosed with a severe and enduring mental illness. What appears critical is the way individuals cope with that adversity, and, interestingly, we might have rather less control over that than we like to think.</p> <p>We know that optimal wellbeing is dependent on a number of factors, one of the most important of which is the amount of social support we have. Put simply, the better the quality of your relationships, the more likely you are to be able to manage stressful situations. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136677?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" title=\"\">The association becomes even more marked</a> as the severity of the stress increases.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/23/bipolar-disorder-joy-10-things-you-should-never-say-to-someone-with-bipolar-disorder\">10 things you should never say to someone with bipolar disorder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This support will look different at different life stages, of course \u2013 the social network you are likely to have aged 10 is likely to bear little relationship to the network you have in middle age. But what if it is the people in that network \u2013 the people who should provide support \u2013 who are actually the cause of, or implicated in, your distress? If you come from a family in which violence is perpetrated, you may not learn that relationships can be safe and comforting, and, in that case, you could hardly be blamed for avoiding them later in life. Equally, if you have a diagnosis of a serious mental illness, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll find it much harder to maintain employment and to form intimate relationships.</p> <p>Given all that, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that people experiencing seemingly uncontrollable fluctuations in mood (and who may also be dealing with the after-effects of trauma and other adversity) might choose to try to regulate their emotions in any way they can \u2013 not infrequently with drugs or alcohol. And while these may be helpful in reducing the variations at that point, it\u2019s rarely sustainable, or without negative consequences.</p> <p>Most people who have a diagnosis of bipolar and who are in contact with mental health services will be prescribed medication. While some will take antidepressants and/or antipsychotics \u2013 to reduce the effects of the lows and the highs respectively \u2013 many are prescribed mood stabilisers such as lithium or sodium valproate, and though the research shows effectiveness, they may cause some side-effects. Overexposure to lithium, for example, can affect renal function.</p> <p>Psychological therapy has also been shown to augment pharmacological treatments and may be effective in helping people to reduce variations in mood, and to understand the triggers that can precipitate both depression and mania. Practically, this is often about monitoring your mood and reducing stress, or finding ways to cope with that stress more effectively. Cognitive therapy may also help to build people\u2019s confidence in managing their symptoms by challenging thoughts such as, \u201cI have no control over how I feel.\u201d Most therapies will ask that you complete \u201chomework\u201d between sessions, partly to practise the techniques discussed with your therapist and partly so their usefulness in \u201creal life\u201d can be evaluated.</p> <p>The difficulties associated with bipolar disorder will rarely affect only the person with the diagnosis, however: there is virtually always an impact on family members. While it doesn\u2019t target the symptoms directly, family therapy <a href=\"http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=207846\" title=\"\">has been shown</a> to be effective in helping to diminish bipolar-related symptoms and to reduce the risk of relapse.</p> <p>In short, a diagnosis of bipolar means much more than periodic \u201chighs\u201d, and, despite the perceived benefits of a slightly elevated mood, very few of the people I have come across with the diagnosis see it so positively. It is far from \u201cuntreatable\u201d, but the road to full functioning \u2013 if it can ever be achieved \u2013 is likely to be a difficult one.</p>",

But we have already built machines \u2013 vast data-processing networks \u2013 that can know our feelings better than we know them ourselves: that\u2019s intelligence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> \u2013 the search engine, not the company \u2013 doesn\u2019t have beliefs and desires of its own. It doesn\u2019t care what we search for and it won\u2019t feel hurt by our behaviour. But it can process our behaviour to know what we want before we know it ourselves. That fact has the potential to change what it means to be human.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/yuval-noah-harari\">Yuval Noah Harari</a>\u2019s previous book, the global bestseller <em>Sapiens</em>, laid out the last 75,000 years of human history to remind us that there is nothing special or essential about who we are. We are an accident. Homo sapiens is just one possible way of being human, an evolutionary contingency like every other creature on the planet. That book ended with the thought that the story of homo sapiens could be coming to an end. We are at the height of our power but we may also have reached its limit. <em>Homo Deus</em> makes good on this thought to explain how our unparalleled ability to control the world around us is turning us into something new.</p> <p>The evidence of our power is everywhere: we have not simply conquered nature but have also begun to defeat humanity\u2019s own worst enemies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/22/better-angels-steven-pinker-review\">War is increasingly obsolete</a>; famine is rare; disease is on the retreat around the world. We have achieved these triumphs by building ever more complex networks that treat human beings as units of information. Evolutionary science teaches us that, in one sense, we are nothing but data-processing machines: we too are algorithms. By manipulating the data we can exercise mastery over our fate. The trouble is that other algorithms \u2013 the ones that we have built \u2013 can do it far more efficiently than we can. That\u2019s what Harari means by the \u201cuncoupling\u201d of intelligence and consciousness. The project of modernity was built on the idea that individual human beings are the source of meaning as well as power. We are meant to be the ones who decide what happens to us: as voters, as consumers, as lovers. But that\u2019s not true any more. We are what gives networks their power: they use our ideas of meaning to determine what will happen to us.</p> <p>Not all of this is new. The modern state, which has been around for about 400 years, is really just another data-processing machine. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes, writing in 1651, called it an \u201cautomaton\u201d (or what we would call a robot). Its robotic quality is the source of its power and also its heartlessness: states don\u2019t have a conscience, which is what allows them sometimes to do the most fearful things. What\u2019s changed is that there are now processing machines that are far more efficient than states: as Harari points out, governments find it almost impossible to keep up with the pace of technological advance. It has also become much harder to sustain the belief \u2013 shared by Hobbes \u2013 that behind every state there are real flesh-and-blood human beings. The modern insistence on the autonomy of the individual goes along with a view that it should be possible to find the heart of this heartless world. Keep scratching at a faceless bureaucracy and you\u2019ll eventually uncover a civil servant with real feelings. But keep scratching at a search engine and all you\u2019ll find are data points.</p> <p>We are just at the start of this process of data-driven transformation and Harari says there is little we can do to stop it. <em>Homo Deus</em> is an \u201cend of history\u201d book, but not in the crude sense that he believes things have come to a stop. Rather the opposite: things are moving so fast that it\u2019s impossible to imagine what the future might hold. In 1800 it was possible to think meaningfully about what the world of 1900 would be like and how we might fit in. That\u2019s history: a sequence of events in which human beings play the leading part. But the world of 2100 is at present almost unimaginable. We have no idea where we\u2019ll fit in, if at all. We may have built a world that has no place for us.</p> <p>Given what an alarming thought this is, and since we aren\u2019t there yet, why can\u2019t we do more to stop it from happening? Harari thinks the modern belief that individuals are in charge of their fate was never much more than a leap of faith. Real power always resided with networks. Individual human beings are relatively powerless creatures, no match for lions or bears. It\u2019s what they can do as groups that has enabled them to take over the planet. These groupings \u2013 corporations, religions, states \u2013 are now part of a vast network of interconnected information flows. Finding points of resistance, where smaller units can stand up to the waves of information washing around the globe, is becoming harder all the time.</p> <p>Some people have given up the fight. In place of the founding tenets of modernity \u2013 liberalism, democracy and personal autonomy \u2013 there is a new religion: Dataism. Its followers \u2013 many of whom reside in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley\">Bay Area</a> of California \u2013 put their faith in information by encouraging us to see it as the only true source of value. We are what we contribute to data processing. There is potentially a huge upside to this: it means we will face fewer and fewer obstacles to getting what we want, because the information needed to supply us will be instantly accessible. Our likes and our experiences will merge. Our lifespans could also be hugely extended: Dataists believe that immortality is the next frontier to be crossed. But the downside is obvious, too. Who will \u201cwe\u201d be any more? Nothing more than an accumulation of information points. Twentieth-century political dystopias sought to stamp on individuals with the power of the state. That won\u2019t be necessary in the coming century. As Harari says: \u201cThe individual will not be crushed by Big Brother; it will disintegrate from within.\u201d</p> <p>Corporations and governments will continue to pay homage to our individuality and unique needs, but in order to service them they will need to \u201cbreak us up into biochemical subsystems\u201d, all of them permanently monitored by powerful algorithms. There is a dystopian political aspect to this, too: the early adopters \u2013 the individuals who sign up first to the Dataist project \u2013 will be the only ones with any real power left and it will be relatively unchallenged. Gaining entry into this new super-elite will be incredibly hard. You\u2019ll need heroic levels of education plus zero squeamishness about marrying your personal identity with intelligent machines. Then you can become one of the new \u201cgods\u201d. It\u2019s a grim prospect: a small priestly caste of seers with access to the ultimate source of knowledge, and the rest of humanity simply tools in their vast schemes. The future could be a digitally supercharged version of the distant past: ancient Egypt multiplied by the power of Facebook.</p> <p>Harari is careful not to predict that these outlandish visions will come to pass. The future is unknowable, after all. He reserves his strongest opinions for what all this should mean for the current state of relations between humans and animals. If intelligence and consciousness are coming apart then this puts most human beings in the same situation as other animals: capable of suffering at the hands of the possessors of superior intelligence. Harari does not seem too worried about the prospect of robots treating us like we treat flies, with violent indifference. Rather, he wants us to think about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/25/industrial-farming-one-worst-crimes-history-ethical-question\">how we are treating animals in our vast industrialised farming systems</a>. Pigs unquestionably suffer when living in cramped conditions or forcibly separated from their young. If we think this suffering doesn\u2019t count because it is not allied to a higher intelligence, then we are building a rod for our own backs. Soon the same will be true of us. And what price our suffering then?</p> <p>This is a very intelligent book, full of sharp insights and mordant wit. But as Harari would probably be the first to admit, it\u2019s only intelligent by human standards, which are nothing special. By the standards of the smartest machines it\u2019s woolly and speculative. The datasets are pretty limited. Its real power comes from the sense of a distinctive consciousness behind it. It is a quirky and cool book, with a sliver of ice at its heart. Harari cares about the fate of animals in a human world but he writes about the prospects for homo sapiens in a data-driven world with a lofty insouciance. I have to admit I found this deeply appealing, but that may be because of who I am (apart from anything else, a man). Not everyone will find it so. But it is hard to imagine anyone could read this book without getting an occasional, vertiginous thrill. Nietzsche once wrote that humanity is about to set sail on an open sea, now that we have finally left Christian morality behind. <em>Homo Deus</em> makes it feel as if we are standing at the edge of a cliff after a long and arduous journey. The journey doesn\u2019t seem so important any more. We are about to step into thin air.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em> is published by Harvill Secker.

  "<p>When I worked for Women\u2019s Aid I met a mother who had escaped war in Sudan. She\u2019d seen people killed and she had been raped. She came to the UK for safety \u2013 only to be forced to flee her home with her two children when her husband became abusive.</p> <p>The housing association said they couldn\u2019t evict her husband because they had a joint tenancy, so she was forced into a refuge. She had to take her children out of school and leave her job. Despite this, she was an incredibly strong, supportive presence for her children and the other women in the refuge. Her children always had a cooked meal and they had a tutor as well as tennis lessons. She was also very supportive of other women in the refuge, giving them a shoulder to cry on.</p> <p>Then one day she didn\u2019t come out of her room. I found her repeating weird statements and realised she\u2019d had a psychotic breakdown. Everything had boiled up inside her until she broke her.</p> <p>I had no choice but to have her sectioned. That was the worst moment in my professional and personal life. I still remember how she gripped my arm as I left her in the hospital. I felt I had betrayed her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a9067733a7917f532e80e8dd7039b0d7ca07c182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9067733a7917f532e80e8dd7039b0d7ca07c182/0_154_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aisha Sharif\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the biggest challenges for Aisha Sharif has been to change attitudes towards domestic abuse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Viridian Housing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I hoped I\u2019d never have to experience anything like it again, but sadly, I have seen similar things since. I was appointed Viridian Housing\u2019s first ever domestic abuse project officer in 2014, and I\u2019ve used experiences such as these to make vital changes to the way the housing association tackles domestic violence, including encouraging women to take single tenancies, even if they are moving into a property with a partner.</p> <h2>Changing procedure</h2> <p>Housing associations and other affiliated agencies have been letting down women who have experienced domestic violence. A lack of real understanding of domestic violence means women are sometimes interrogated in open spaces about traumatic experiences, even in front of their children. Others simply slip through the gaps and only surface when their situation has become high risk.</p> <p>Housing associations have an important role in the fight against domestic violence but they\u2019re often left out of the conversation. This doesn\u2019t make sense. Which other organisations get such unfettered access to a person\u2019s home? </p> <p>It doesn\u2019t only mean changing procedure \u2013 one of the biggest challenges for me has been to change attitudes. When I joined Viridian, I realised that a lack of real awareness among both colleagues and other residents meant that women affected weren\u2019t being identified early enough. </p> <p>When residents heard shouting they saw it purely as a nuisance and reported it as anti-social behaviour. Meanwhile, repeat repair requests weren\u2019t being connected to domestic violence (we later found that 95% of these cases were a direct consequence of violence in the home). Another issue was that some staff who did witness abusive behaviour weren\u2019t sure what to do. There was often still a pervading feeling that domestic abuse was a private matter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Staff who did witness abusive behaviour weren't sure what to do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To solve this, Viridian\u2019s domestic abuse service became integrated with multiple departments within the association \u2013 including housing officers, maintenance and financial inclusion. All those with direct customer contact were trained to spot the signs of domestic abuse. Issues such as rent arrears, noise nuisance and repeat repairs are now all flagged to the anti-social behaviour team to investigate. </p> <h2>Changing perceptions of domestic violence</h2> <p>When I joined Viridian two years ago, only 25% of the domestic violence cases we tackled were first reported from within the organisation; today, it\u2019s 75%. The dramatic increase has come from getting people to look at the situation in a different way.</p> <p>I remember one young woman who was well known to Viridian. She was 22, with two very young children, and in a long-term relationship with a known gang member. When he visited the house, he caused havoc. Her case had initially been treated as anti-social behaviour, as neighbours complained of loud music and shouting.</p> <p>Many had found her difficult to deal with because she was forthright and argumentative. When I met her I realised she was actually an intelligent woman who was terrified of having her children taken away. She had been entrenched in an abusive relationship for years and had played loud music so the neighbours wouldn\u2019t hear the physical violence.</p> <p>The key was to work with her to find a solution. It meant getting the right people around the table, including the police, health visitor and the neighbours. A protection order was put in place to give police the power to arrest her partner if he came to the house. The neighbours\u2019 attitudes changed \u2013 now many called the police when they saw him coming, instead of complaining about the noise. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/mar/17/women-domestic-abuse-social-housing-association\">The women who escape domestic abuse but lose their social housing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We also worked to secure the property and damage caused by the abuse was quickly repaired. The young woman was given a device that calls the police when shaken.</p> <p>The best solution would have been to move her, but many women who have experienced domestic violence find thisdifficult. It\u2019s about building confidence and trust; initially, they can\u2019t trust anyone \u2013 even themselves. Eventually we were able to move the woman and her children from the home because she believed it was the right thing to do.</p> <h2>Coping with a surge in need</h2> <p>We also launched a year-long domestic violence awareness campaign, which included open days, and we added information about support to rent statements and to articles in a residents\u2019 magazine. We have subsequently seen a 300% surge in cases <strong> </strong>\u2013 but no victim has gone homeless. We have also managed to reduce the time it takes to tackle the problem from 14 months, to an average of seven and a half weeks. </p> <p>We\u2019ve done this through a combination of rehousing using our own social housing stock, working with local authorities to exercise homelessness legislation to protect victims, and putting reciprocal arrangements in place with other housing providers. </p> <p>We have also made our existing properties safer by installing security devices and we are taking a stronger stance against the perpetrators of domestic violence \u2013 we have pursued restraining orders, non-molestation orders and imposed acceptable behaviour contracts.</p> <p>There are some incredibly rewarding moments when you work in domestic violence services, but there are low points, too. The lowest points come when you\u2019ve worked hard to get a victim to trust you, they\u2019re on the road to rebuilding their life, but they\u2019re let down by another agency in the chain. They become disillusioned and it\u2019s back to square one. But we\u2019re working to change this and we\u2019ll keep going. </p> <p>We all need to work better together, to educate and empower our colleagues to spot and act when they are faced with domestic abuse, and help people build better and safer lives.</p> <p><em>Aisha Sharif is the domestic abuse project officer for <a href=\"http://www.viridianhousing.org.uk/\">Viridian Housing</a>.<br></em></p> <p><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/register/\"><strong>Join the Guardian Housing Network </strong></a><strong>to read more pieces like this and follow us on Twitter </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHousing\">@GuardianHousing</a> </strong><strong>to keep up with the latest social housing insight and analysis.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Shows such as EastEnders and Coronation Street are to be monitored for diversity following the launch of a new system that measures the ethnic, gender and sexual orientation makeup of British television. </p> <p>The BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky are taking part in Project Diamond, which will gather data about the background of those working on all UK programmes.</p> <p>All key staff, from actors to sound technicians, will be asked about their gender, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation and gender identity via a confidential, encrypted computer system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/04/the-bbcs-diversity-strategy-is-not-good-enough\">The BBC's diversity strategy is not good enough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The organisation behind Diamond, the Creative Diversity Network, is also looking at making public how shows such as EastEnders measure up.</p> <p>CDN executive director Amanda Ariss said it is \u201cone of the things we are looking at at the moment\u201d. However, while it might be possible to monitor some of the most-watched programmes individually, she said the project does not have the resources to do it for all shows. </p> <p>Speaking ahead of the launch of Diamond at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, Ariss said it will help to \u201ccreate an accurate picture\u201d of the makeup of television today: \u201cThis is a big tool to help us speed up diversity and do it better. Everyone agrees the more detailed the data is the stronger the driver for action is.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole point of Diamond is about transparency. It\u2019s unprecedented the amount of details that will be in the public domain \u2013 it\u2019s far more than for any other industry.\u201d</p> <p>As soon as a show is commissioned then Diamond is triggered, with its workforce emailed the diversity questions. If their details are already on the system they are automatically updated. </p> <p>Project Diamond was created in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/18/lenny-henry-black-asian-television\">Lenny Henry\u2019s rallying call two years ago</a> for an improvement in the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic people on-screen and behind the camera. </p> <p>Early results are due to be unveiled in around six months, depending on how quickly a sizeable amount of data has been collected. In the first stage, drama, entertainment and factual shows will be monitored, with news and sport covered from next year. </p> <p>The technology behind Diamond has taken months to create in order for it to be secure enough to ensure people are happy to reveal personal information such as their sexual orientation. </p> <p>Some actors had been unsure about Diamond as they did not want casting directors to be able to get hold of some personal information.</p> <p>Aries said that although some producers and union Bectu wanted the makeup of all programmes revealed, as \u201cwe\u2019re going to be monitoring pretty much every UK programme for all the channels who are UK broadcasters \u2026 we think it will be very difficult to report at programme level with other than a very small selection\u201d without great expense. </p> <p>New minister for digital and culture Matt Hancock<strong> </strong>said<strong>: </strong>\u201cWhilst BAME representation in the UK\u2019s creative industries is increasing twice as fast as the rest of the UK workplace, we want to see greater social mobility and diversity across this and across the arts sector.</p> <p>\u201cThe launch of project Diamond is a clear example of how the UK\u2019s broadcasting industry is leading the way. Together with industry we want to see diversity continuing to improve both on and off screen, and this world-first initiative is a step forward to achieving that.\u201d</p> <p>If the project proves a success, other countries have said they may buy the technology. CDN chair John McVay, who is also chief executive of producers\u2019 alliance Pact, said \u201cDiamond is an incredibly ambitious project \u2013 as far as we know no other broadcasting industry anywhere in the world has developed a cross-industry data collection and publishing process like it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>At the Paris climate talks last December, governments agreed to work towards limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the topic of financing developing countries to help them adapt to climate change and transition to clean energy became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">a sticking point</a> during the negotiations.</p> <p>We recently brought together a panel of experts to debate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/live/2016/jul/21/renewable-energy-investment-climate-change-developing-countries-sdg\">how developing countries can reach 100% renewables</a>. Here\u2019s what we learned:</p> <h2>1 Off-grid renewables are becoming more accessible</h2> <p>The falling cost of technologies such as solar PV means renewables have become cost-effective in many parts of the developing world, said Henning Wuester, director of the International Renewable Energy Agency\u2019s Knowledge, Policy and Finance Centre. This is particularly the case in rural areas away from the electricity grid, where people are otherwise using relatively expensive, inefficient diesel generators and kerosene lamps.</p> <p>Despite this, the upfront cost of small-scale solar systems to power a few lights or charge a mobile phone can present a significant barrier to widespread adoption, said Aly-Khan Jamal, a partner at Dalberg Global Development Advisors. However, he said there have been \u201cexciting breakthroughs\u201d in addressing such challenges:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Businesses providing these systems are using pay-as-you-go approaches that allow households and businesses to pay a small amount each month. Some allow you to eventually buy and fully own the system; others have a \u2018perpetual lease\u2019 where it is somewhat like paying for a utility.</p> </blockquote> <h2>2 Mobile money is critical ...</h2> <p>Mobile money payment systems make these pay-as-you-go models feasible, said Jamal, as they give businesses the ability to monitor and control electricity provision remotely, and make collecting payments very efficient \u2013 in turn significantly reducing costs. </p> <p>Wuester added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mobile payment schemes have been critical in driving the roll-out of off-grid solutions. This has enabled more than 300,000 households [across East Africa] to get access to electricity, including about 30% of the Kenyan population, 40,000 in Uganda and 20,000 in Tanzania. These numbers are growing rapidly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Maite Pina, renewable energy specialist at social investor Oikocredit International, gave the example of M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer system introduced in Kenya in 2007. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/africa-calling-mobile-phone-broadband-revolution-transform-democracies\">Seven in 10 adults</a> in Kenya now use the cash alternative, making 9m transactions daily. Pina said that Oikocredit \u2013 together with London-based solar systems provider <a href=\"http://www.bboxx.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBoxx</a> \u2013 uses M-Pesa to collect monthly payments from solar system users in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <h2>3 ... but it has limits</h2> <p>Jamal pointed out, however, that mobile money penetration isn\u2019t even across all countries, so different approaches need to be used depending on the market. What\u2019s more, he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the most remote and low income communities, mobile networks don\u2019t invest in telecoms infrastructure (it\u2019s not worth it for them) so relying on mobile money to reach these really challenging communities may not be sufficient.</p> </blockquote> <h2>4 Pay-as-you-go could trap the poorest in debt</h2> <p>Social entrepreneur and investor Jamie Hartzell put the following question to the panel:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The boom in pay-as-you-go household solar in East Africa is very exciting. But it is all based on credit, and the companies have a view to selling other products like TVs. How big is the risk that boom will turn to bust and push the poorest of the poor into unpayable debt?</p> </blockquote> <p>Nico Tyabji, director of strategic partnerships at solar financier SunFunder, replied that while users might have a legally enforceable contract, \u201cthe reality is no one\u2019s going to come knocking\u201d \u2013 they just don\u2019t get the service any more. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/20/energy-renewables-climate-change-finance-investment-east-africa-india-off-grid-development\">Investors' neglect of small-scale renewables threatens universal energy access</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tyabji said that since cutting off access isn\u2019t in the companies\u2019 interest, they spend time thinking about how to make the process work best, for example by setting up payment models around harvest season so that users can pay when they have access to money rather than having to stick to a regular payment schedule. However, he added that as products and services get bigger and pricier, Hartzell\u2019s concerns could become an issue.</p> <h2>5 Credit must be responsible</h2> <p>Edward Hanrahan, CEO of ClimateCare, reiterated the need for caution in what he described as the \u201cmassive rush to [...] provide credit at levels unseen before to the lowest income populace\u201d. </p> <p>He cited the example of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/20/energy-renewables-climate-change-finance-investment-east-africa-india-off-grid-development\">Pamoja Life</a>, one of ClimateCare\u2019s investment projects in east Africa, which ensures that the overall monthly or weekly cost of the goods provided is lower than the goods it is displacing (for example, a solar unit costs less than equivalent kerosene). This means monthly outgoings are reduced rather than increased. </p> <p>Hanrahan added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, we are all now looking at providing \u2018add-on\u2019 products \u2013 fridges, internet access, TVs. It is crucial that we manage the ladder of credit in a very responsible manner</p> </blockquote> <h2>6 There\u2019s a big investment gap</h2> <p>\u201cThe world is not investing enough in renewables as a whole, not just off-grid solar, given the imperatives of climate change and sustainable development goals,\u201d said Jeremy Leggett, founder of Solarcentury and SolarAid, and chairman of Carbon Tracker.</p> <p>While investment in large, centralised energy systems is driven mainly by multilateral agencies and large developers who rely on long term power purchase agreements, there is still a funding gap for decentralised systems where the requirements are smaller and the risks are higher, said Pina. Despite a growing interest in off-grid developments and new debt structures, Pina believes there is still a need to develop new guarantee structures to attract investors.</p> <p>Tyabji said organisations such as SunFunder came into being to plug part of that investment gap:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a few exceptions, we haven\u2019t yet seen the levels of investment from development banks (let alone commercial banks) that other kinds of energy and infrastructure projects get. So it\u2019s still down to niche players like us.</p> </blockquote>",

Trump rolls out new immigration look, praises Obama</h2> <p>Speaking on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program on Fox News, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-election-news-campaign-live?page=with:block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b#block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b\">rolled out a new version of</a> his now-obscure position on immigration, telling the host that \u201cI just want to follow the law\u201d...</p> <p>\u201cI just want to follow the law,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-election-news-campaign-live?page=with:block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b#block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b\">said</a>. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is following the law ... Now the existing laws are very strong. The existing laws, the first thing we are going to do if and when I win, is we are going to get rid of all of the bad ones. ... As far as everybody else, we are going to go through the process. What people don\u2019t know is Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/768035137883873280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump actually said this: &quot;What people don&#39;t know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country.&quot;</p>&mdash; Rick Klein (@rickklein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/768035137883873280\">August 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2. Trump: \u2018war zones\u2019 safer than inner cities</h2> <p>Donald Trump veered off the teleprompter on Monday night to claim that \u201cinner cities run by the Democrats\u201d were more dangerous than countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.[...]</p> <p>\u201cYou can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats,\u201d Trump said. The Republican nominee also promised if elected, \u201cwe\u2019ll get rid of the crime. You\u2019ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/donald-trump-inner-city-crime-war-zone-hillary-clinton\">Trump: inner cities run by Democrats are more dangerous than war zones</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. Trump jacked rent at Trump Tower once donor money flowed</h2> <p>The Trump campaign rents office space in Trump Tower. When Donald Trump was mostly self-financing his campaign, the office space cost one thing. When Trump began accepting more donations from the public, the price quintupled, the Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-campaign-rent_us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at Trump Tower to $169,758 in July, when he was raising funds from donors, compared with March, when he was self-funding his campaign, according to a Huffington Post review of Federal Election Commission filings. The rent jumped even though he was paying fewer staff in July than he did in March. </p> <p>The Trump campaign paid Trump Tower Commercial LLC $35,458 in March \u2015 the same amount it had been paying since last summer \u2015 and had 197 paid employees and consultants. In July, it paid 172 employees and consultants. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MaxBoot/status/768049003841871872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Like Trump U, Trump campaign is a scam.

  "<p>Michael Gratton was cycling to work in Sydney when he was stopped in a recent police \u201ceducation and awareness\u201d blitz and fined $531 (\u00a3310). His offence? Not wearing a helmet, not having a bell and not having a working brake.</p> <p>\u201cThe bell fine of $106 is ridiculous,\u201d says the robotics researcher, who is challenging the third fine, as braking on his fixed-wheel bike is done through the pedals \u2013 and his bike has a front brake anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t ride on the footpath and a bell is useless against cars. It has been my experience in the past that if you ring a bell behind a person they are as likely to jump into your way as out of it. Pedestrians also see ringing a bell as an aggressive act. The fines are massively disproportionate.\u201d</p> <p>Gratton was one of many caught out by a huge increase in <a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/2016/04/what-impact-have-the-new-cycling-laws-had-in-new-south-wales/\">fines for cycling offences in New South Wales</a>. The fine for not wearing a helmet (which is compulsory across Australia) rose from $71 to $319; fines for cycling through a red light, riding negligently or not stopping at a pedestrian crossing were all raised from $71 to $425.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The value of cycling in Sydney has been undermined by hysterical claims</p> <footer> <cite>Clover Moore</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From March next year it will be compulsory for all cyclists in Sydney and elsewhere in the state to carry identification. This is going too far, says Ray Rice, chief executive of <a href=\"https://bicyclensw.org.au/\">Bicycle NSW</a>. \u201cThere has been no evidence provided that there was any real issue in identifying riders. Police have existing powers to do this. It will mean that riders will need to carry a driver\u2019s licence or photo card even when going to the local shops or down to the beach. This will be a disincentive to riding.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c9af8ea9fedca1961482bdd13d1d569b6dd28ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c9af8ea9fedca1961482bdd13d1d569b6dd28ee/0_81_3732_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling through Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclist injuries remain high in Sydney \u2013 but are fines the solution?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clover Moore \u2013 the mayor of Sydney since 2004 who is running for a fourth term \u2013 is a longtime supporter of cycling as a way of making cities more liveable, but her political rivals use that as a blunt instrument to attack her.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe value of cycling in Sydney has been undermined by hysterical claims that bike riding will cripple the city\u2019s economy, misleading stories that distort data to proclaim that less people are riding, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/25/sydney-australia-bike-lane-skeptic-cycling-duncan-gay-cycleways\">and wilful ignorance of good practice overseas,\u201d she told the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>An independent who leans to the left, Moore\u2019s main rival for mayor is Christine Forster, a member of the conservative Liberal party, and sister of former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott. Forster wants a moratorium on cycle lanes while a light rail system is built, and then a reassessment of the existing network.<strong> </strong>Moore says the Liberal-National New South Wales government passed legislation giving two votes to businesses against one to residents to help Forster \u2013 and the recent increase in fines for cycling offences could be seen as backing Forster\u2019s views over Moore\u2019s. </p> <p>But Duncan Gay, the NSW minister for roads, insists it is about safety and that cycling groups were consulted. \u201cWith cycling injuries remaining high in NSW, I had no choice but to look at tougher deterrents and increased enforcement to improve safety for cyclists and other road users like pedestrians,\u201d he said via email. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see another dollar in fine revenue but I do hope to see a reduction in cyclist injuries.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8beb783711ee8f23eb24cf4830ac9bbdb83317a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8beb783711ee8f23eb24cf4830ac9bbdb83317a7/0_0_3500_2255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists in Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All cyclists must wear helmets in Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s not how many cyclists see it \u2013 and Mark Ames, of consultancy <a href=\"mailto:@StrategicCities\">Strategic Cities</a>, says Sydney is going against the flow of other world cities.<strong> </strong>\u201cMaking your city efficient should be above party politics, cycling is not really a right versus left thing, yet here in Sydney it is kind of seen as being a lefty, hippie, latte-sipping city thing, not something important,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the leaders of other cities that are investing in cycling, they are conservative. In New York there was Michael Bloomberg, in Auckland it is the New Zealand prime minister John Key who led the charge on a $50m cycleway project.
