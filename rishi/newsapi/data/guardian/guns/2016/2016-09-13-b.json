  "<p>Maxine Peake is not automatic casting for the role of Blanche Dubois in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tennesseewilliams\">Tennessee Williams</a>\u2019s imperishable play. As she proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2015/mar/09/maxine-peake-as-hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be-video\">when she played Hamlet at the Royal Exchange</a>, Peake has a built-in bullshit detector whereas Blanche\u2019s tragedy is that she lives in a cloud of self-deception. But Peake is an actor of such shape-shifting skill that she fully persuades you she is Williams\u2019s disintegrating southern belle in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/01/sarah-frankcom-royal-exchange-manchester-maxine-peake\">Sarah Frankcom</a>\u2019s fine production.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2014/jul/16/gillian-anderson-streetcar-named-desire-young-vic-in-pictures\">From Maxine Peake to Vivien Leigh: Streetcar's Blanche Dubois \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It helps that Frankcom suggests Blanche is trapped in a living nightmare. On her arrival in New Orleans on her doomed visit to the Kowalskis \u2013 sister Stella and her husband, Stanley \u2013 Blanche is caught in the midst of a frightening swirl of activity. Peter Rice\u2019s sound design constantly fills the air with throbs, hums and the clang of distant streetcars, while Jack Knowles\u2019s lighting is full of sudden vibrating colour shifts. It is also typical of a phantasmagoric evening that Blanche is shadowed by not one but three figures all bedecked in death-haunted roses.</p> <p>It is, however, very much Peake\u2019s evening and she catches perfectly Blanche\u2019s reflex, desperate flirtatiousness. Peake buffs her nails and oils her skin before confronting her predatory Polish brother-in-law, skips girlishly and coyly in front of Mitch, the one man prepared to take her seriously, and puts on the airs and graces of a displaced southern aristo. She even feigns prudishness when her sister, Stella, freely boasts of Stanley\u2019s sexual prowess.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2016/sep/06/maxine-peake-streetcar-blanche-dubois-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xz73\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2694576\"            data-video-name=\"'I want magic': Maxine Peake performs as Streetcar's Blanche DuBois \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Royal Exchange theatre\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cd3870e4b0c2a396c06d74\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/05/160905StreetcarTrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/05/160905StreetcarTrailer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/05/160905StreetcarTrailer_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2016/sep/06/maxine-peake-streetcar-blanche-dubois-video\">\u2018I want magic\u2019: Maxine Peake performs as Streetcar\u2019s Blanche DuBois</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But the key to Peake\u2019s performance lies in the way she captures Blanche\u2019s limitless capacity for self-delusion. Offered a drink, she says \u201cone\u2019s my limit\u201d while avidly clasping the neck of the bottle. In one of the most ironic moments in American drama, she lectures Stella and tells her, in the manner of a southern schoolmarm \u201cto pull yourself together and face facts\u201d. That is the one thing Blanche can never do, and Peake superbly gives us the tragic spectacle of a woman who disintegrates into panic and hysteria as the net slowly closes around her and the truth of her condition becomes inescapable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e7c8eb4f518bd30d65259591b38336da48c1a11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e7c8eb4f518bd30d65259591b38336da48c1a11/0_185_5310_3186/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Stella and Maxine Peake as Blanche.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Stella and Maxine Peake as Blanche.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a breathtaking Blanche that follows a succession of fine interpretations by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/oct/09/theatre.artsfeatures1\">Glenn Close</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/29/review-streetcar-named-desire-donmar\">Rachel Weisz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/29/streetcar-named-desire-gillian-anderson-young-vic-review\">Gillian Anderson</a>. My only query about the production is that it is so much on Blanche\u2019s side that some of the play\u2019s ambiguity is sacrificed. In Ben Batt\u2019s very good performance, Stanley represents all that is ugly, cruel and unforgiving in a male-dominated culture: he not only behaves violently to Stella but rapes Blanche by brutally thrusting her against a glass partition. All that is in the play; but so too is Williams\u2019s emphasis on Blanche\u2019s snobbish condescension to Stanley and the character\u2019s instinctive earthy vitality.</p> <p>Even if the dice are here loaded against Stanley, there is a very good performance by Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Stella which conveys her willing surrender to her husband\u2019s ferocious sexual energy. Youssef Kerkour also conveys the stumbling, tongue-tied decency of Mitch, who finds an echo of his own loneliness in Blanche, and Michelle Butterly is striking as the upstairs neighbour well used to the Kowalskis\u2019 rough-house antics.</p> <p>In the end, what moves one about the play is Williams\u2019s portrait of naked desperation. And what most of us will remember from this production is Peake\u2019s Blanche for its portrayal of the character\u2019s vanity, vulnerability and desperate, immovable solitude.</p> <ul> <li>At the <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/\">Royal Exchange, Manchester</a>, until 15 October.

But six months later, the university has done nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Robinson, a pre-business student, said she was raped in an apartment on the campus athletic village on Valentine\u2019s Day of this year, when she was 18. </p> <p>The rape reportedly took place when Delaney was left alone with Artis after coming back to campus from a party with a group of friends. The UNC linebacker allegedly raped her while she was incapacitated.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I was drinking that night on Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m underage, and I take responsibility for that.

During the press conference, Branch also held up pictures of Robinson\u2019s bruised neck. </p> <p>After reporting the case, Robinson said campus police interrogated her like a suspect, questioning her sexual past and whether she led Artis on.

You never want someone accused unless there\u2019s proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<br></p> <p>Robinson requested \u201cself-sworn\u201d warrants from a magistrate for Artis to be arrested on charges of misdemeanor assault on a female and misdemeanor sexual battery. Under North Carolina law, a citizen may request a warrant from a judge, provided that they have probable cause that a crime was committed. The warrant was issued on Tuesday, Branch said. It is not known if Artis is in custody or has been arrested.<br></p> <p>The vice-chancellor of communications and public affairs at UNC, Joel Curran, said that the university could not discuss the case due to federal privacy laws.</p> <p>\u201cThese matters are complex and often involve multiple agencies including law enforcement.

The Cochrane committee said there was no evidence of serious side-effects from e-cigarette use over a two-year period. </p> <p>\u201cThe really good news that came out from this version of the review is that we found a lot more studies under way,\u201d said Hartmann-Boyce. \u201cIn the next few years hopefully there will be more evidence out there to strengthen our conclusions.\u201d</p> <p>The review coincides with the publication in the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4645\">British Medical Journal</a> of a study that suggests that e-cigarettes can increase success rates for smokers who are attempting to quit.</p> <p>The study looked at survey data from 170,490 individuals aged 16 and older in England between 2006 and 2015, 23% of whom had smoked in the past year, and 21% of whom were current smokers. The study also incorporated data on the use of NHS stop smoking services, which encompassed more than 8 million smokers. </p> <p>\u201cWe estimate for every 10,000 people who used an e-cigarette to quit, approximately 580 would have quit who wouldn\u2019t have quit otherwise,\u201d said Robert West, co-author of the study and Professor of Health Psychology at University College, London.</p> <p>The authors also estimate that in 2015 e-cigarettes alone may have helped about 18,000 smokers to quit who would not otherwise have quit. What\u2019s more, they say, the devices appear to be linked to a decrease in the use of nicotine replacement therapies on prescription.</p> <p>But, they add, there was no clear evidence that the devices were prompting more people to give up smoking, or that they had an impact on the use of nicotine replacement therapies bought over the counter, or stop smoking services \u2013 an area of interest given a recent decline in use of such services.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no evidence that it is making any difference to the rate at which people are trying to stop \u2013 it is increasing the rate at which they succeed,\u201d said West.</p> <p>John Britton, the director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham, said the trend towards a decreasing use of smoking cessation services was likely to be down to a number of factors, including cuts to mass media campaigns and the move of stop smoking services into local authority control. \u201cStop smoking services have been decimated with the changes to public health funding,\u201d he said. </p> <p>While Britton cautions that the trials incorporated in the Cochrane review are based on early generation e-cigarettes that deliver very little nicotine, he believes the latest models of e-cigarettes are likely to be much more effective when it comes to quitting. </p> <p>\u201cThe evidence is very clear, smoking kills,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t stop smoking, if you can switch to another form of nicotine and that lets you stop smoking then that is great.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is that any smoker who is still smoking tobacco should try an electronic cigarette and try to drop the tobacco completely and do so as quickly as possible.\u201d</p> <p> Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of health charity Action on Smoking and Health, said: \u201cTaken together, the Cochrane review and BMJ article provide further reassurance that e-cigarettes are not undermining quitting. Indeed, the evidence from England, where smoking prevalence is continuing to decline, is that e-cigarette use is associated with a higher rate of successful quit attempts by smokers.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The first serious hurdle since a ceasefire in Syria came into effect on Monday has emerged after the UN said the regime was not giving permission to allow 20 UN aid trucks into eastern Aleppo.</p> <p>UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/syrian-ceasefire-deal-the-guardian-briefing\">ceasefire agreement</a> signed last week clearly stated that the government should simply be notified of aid entering the city.</p> <p>As many as 20 trucks are ready to move and the agreed procedure is that the government is given details of the content of the trucks. Syrian government permission or inspections by its officials should not be required.</p> <p>De Mistura said \u201cthe trucks are not moving\u201d and implied the Syrian government was in breach of the agreement by refusing to allow unhindered access. \u201cWe need to do more homework,\u201d said de Mistura.</p> <p>He urged the eastern Aleppo council to drop any preconditions for the delivery of the aid. Nevertheless, he claimed the first 24 hours of the ceasefire had seen a significant drop in violence. \u201cCalm has prevailed,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/un-turkey-seek-security-guarantees-aid-convoy-enters-aleppo-syria\">UN and Turkey seek security guarantees before aid enters Aleppo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His remarks will be taken as a coded warning to the Russians to use their influence with the Syrian government to allow the aid trucks into eastern Aleppo on the terms agreed last week after marathon talks between Russia and the US in Geneva.<br></p> <p>De Mistura insisted the process for eastern Aleppo was different from the rest of Syria where formal letters of authorisation are required before aid can be delivered. For months, the UN has faced a daily battle to wrest such permissions from the government in a bid to lift the sieges of Syrian towns. </p> <p>In a statement, the Syrian government warned it would not allow Turkish humanitarian aid into the besieged city of Aleppo without its permission.</p> <p>At the same time, opposition groups objected to the Russian presence along the Castello Road, the main supply route into the divided city, where 250,000 people are desperate for food and fuel. Under the agreement, the Russians are supposed to take over some of the checkpoints on the Castello Road.</p> <p>De Mistura said the council should drop its preconditions for aid delivery.</p> <p>A senior US official said neither Syrian government nor Kurdish opposition forces had pulled back from the Castello Road route into eastern Aleppo and that Washington was doing all it could to ensure the UN convoy safe access. </p> <p>\u201cWe have spent much of today pressing the Russians and, through the Russians, pressing the regime. The UN wanted to make sure the trucks go through unhindered by the regime and unthreatened by the opposition. And we hope to get that done today,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf an opposition group decides it doesn\u2019t want to part of the cessation and wants to carry out attacks on the regime, then they take themselves out of the cessation of hostilities.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Russia claimed it was abiding by the ceasefire along with the Syrian government, but said the US government was not acting to rein in its client groups, citing 23 different violations of the terms of the ceasefire.<br></p> <p>\u201cSyrian government troops have completely stopped firing, with the exception of areas where Islamic State and Al-Nusra fighters are active,\u201d said senior Russian military officer Viktor Poznikhir in a televised briefing.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for armed units of the moderate opposition controlled by the US. After the start of the cessation of hostilities by this morning, 23 instances of firing on residential areas and government positions were registered.\u201d</p> <p>The ceasefire agreement for Syria, hammered out between Moscow and Washington, came into force on Monday evening. If it holds for seven days, it is designed to lead to unprecedented joint operations by Russia and the US against the twin targets of Islamic State and the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham terrorist group, formerly known as al-Nusra Front. The Syrian government air force would be grounded and debarred from attacking Al-Nusra, the US government insists.</p> <p>Seeking to address confusion over the role of the Syrian air force under the US-Russian deal, another senior US official said: \u201cFor the time being, until we get seven continuous days of reduced violence, the only legitimate targets for anyone\u2013 Syrian, Russia or the US \u2013 are Nusra and Isil [Islamic State]. After that seven days, when the joint implementation centre [JIC] has been established, the regime air force will no longer be able to hit Nusra Front or opposition areas.\u201d</p> <p>But he noted that the regime had previously conducted airstrikes against other opposition groups or civilians under the pretext of targeting the Nusra Front. \u201cWe do need seven days of reduced violence. If that happens again during this period, we will not get to the JIC.\u201d</p> <p>As many as 20 opposition groups have said they will not accept the ceasefire, claiming there is no clear mechanism for punishing breaches. Some are wary of breaking with the former al-Nusra group.</p> <p>But Anas al-Abdah, the president of the Syrian National Coalition, speaking in London, said he believed the ceasefire would be accepted by most rebel groups.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI think all our troops will go away from Nusra especially in seven days\u2019 time because then Russia and the US [will be] co-operating and Nusra becomes a target like Isis. So our advice to all the troops on the ground is that they make sure they stay away from Nusra as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>In televised briefings from various locations around war-torn Syria, Russian military observers said that rebel violations had taken place in the provinces around Aleppo, Latakia, Damascus, Hama, Idlib and Daraa.<br></p> <p>A Russian military officer said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/syria-seven-day-ceasefire-begins-violence\">\u201cnew violations\u201d </a>had also occurred around the ravaged city of Aleppo during the day.</p> <p>As the televised briefing cut to a military monitor by the key Castello Road into Aleppo, which has been under Syria regime control, gunfire broke out and the Russian officer dived for cover.</p>",

  "<p>In the summer of 2015, during last year\u2019s Burning Man, festival founder Larry Harvey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/04/burning-man-founder-larry-harvey-race-diversity-silicon-valley\">told me</a> that \u201cblack folks don\u2019t like to camp as much as white folks\u201d. That week, I interviewed about 30 black people and some other people of color at Burning Man (pretty much all the people of color I could find who would talk to me) about why they came to a festival that was so overwhelmingly white. According to the Black Rock City census, black people at Burning Man make up only <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/27/black-campers-burning-man-explain-why\">about 1%</a> of attendees.</p> <p>When I returned this year, there was a burning question on many people\u2019s minds: did I think there were more black people at Burning Man a year later?</p> <p>In a word: yes.</p> <p>But to qualify that: there still weren\u2019t nearly enough, and whiteness ran rampant. It\u2019s funny. When I asked Harvey about the lack of diversity last year, he bluntly said \u201cwe\u2019re not going to set racial quotas\u201d \u2013 and as an organization, Burning Man seems to be doing little creatively and systematically to address the lack of diversity. The funny thing is that you can see people go to the ends of the earth to address the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/\">Burning Man principle</a> of \u201cradical self-expression\u201d, while doing almost nothing to address its principle of \u201cradical inclusion\u201d. </p> <p>People say \u201cwell anyone can go to Burning Man\u201d, and anyone can try to buy tickets through the lottery. But it\u2019s really expensive, which segregates in one way, especially for people who haven\u2019t invested in all the camping infrastructure. </p> <p>Also, Burning Man distributes tickets to theme camps outside of the lottery to give preference to groups with a history with the festival. This is understandable. But those camps are almost all overwhelmingly white. So except for a handful of camps, Burning Man invests in the presence of hundreds of majority white theme camps, who will distribute their tickets almost exclusively to white people. And unless Burning Man consciously interrupts this, the population will just repeat itself \u2013 like any other ongoing segregated population. It would take a sense of radical, not passive, inclusion. </p> <p>My observations are anecdotal but not uncritical. In 2015, I was constantly looking out for black people, and kept seeing the same folks over and over again. This year, I saw new black faces all week. Sometimes when I\u2019d talk to black Burners, I\u2019d hear it was their first time, and they\u2019d tell me they\u2019d come because of our article. Also, several longtime black burners told me about their joy at seeing more black folks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Steven Thrasher\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKLZ1KZhtH4/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silky, Uncle Vern &amp;amp; I put our foot up in it cooking ribs for 35 in just 2 hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Steven Thrasher (@thrasherxy) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-10T14:07:33+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 10, 2016 at 7:07am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the camp I stayed in (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/05/burning-man-temple-project-death-mourning\">Que Viva</a>) was a racial and social justice camp, set up right next to the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/People-Of-Color-at-Burning-Man-586227634754548/\">People of Color Camp</a>. And people would come home to our camps after a day of exploring and say things like, \u201cIt\u2019s so white out there.\u201d And it was!

I decided to ask some other POC burners whether they thought there was more color this year at the blindingly white Burning Man. Here are some of our answers, edited from conversations by phone, email, Facebook message and text.</p> <h2>Vernon Andrews (AKA Uncle Vern)</h2> <p>Though I don\u2019t have census statistics to back me up (yet), my educated guess is the numbers might increase slightly this year for African American attendance at Burning Man. Before I became a member of the <a href=\"http://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/census-data/\">Black Rock Census</a> team two years ago, I\u2019d chase down every black person I saw on Playa for my research. In the past, that was doable. This year I was exhausted even counting visually the black folks I saw. No way I could have kept up my hydration and chased down my potential research subjects. I think numbers have gone up. Nice trend!</p> <h2>Jamila Reddy</h2> <p>I feel like I saw more people of color at Burning Man this year than I have the past three years, but it still doesn\u2019t feel like a space that genuinely champions diversity. Camping with a group of predominantly POC folk made the rest of Burning Man\u2019s overwhelming whiteness even more glaring. That said, Burning Man is an experience that has been really joyful and transformative for me, and I\u2019m excited to see more folks of color sharing in that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Steven on the playa\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BJoVgi7BnJC/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#BlackLivesMatter in Black Rock City #burningman2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Steven Thrasher (@thrasherxy) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-08-27T23:16:21+00:00&quot;&gt;Aug 27, 2016 at 4:16pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Nicholas Powers (aka Honey Shot)</h2> <p>Is it wishful thinking or did I truly see more people of color at Burning Man this year? Bicycling from camp to camp, I said hi, hugged, kissed, gave dap and the ever-useful keep-it-cool head nod to black Burners. It was like a racial relay race in the desert where we could pass glances back and forth, making a network of double consciousness across the city. </p> <p>Our presence was a degree above tokenism but far, far, far below the tipping point that would revitalize Burning Man. It helped that there were two camps dedicated to melanin. Que Viva camp, a powerful social justice camp, and my People of Color camp, where POC came by to enjoy the knowing ways of shared references, winks above smiles, laughter after pulling off the scab of racism, dancing late into the night \u2013 until our skin was black as space, filled with stars.</p> <h2>Lorenzo Herrera y Lozano</h2> <p>I walked away from my first burn in 2014 believing that Burning Man held great potential for people of color to explore, create and play. Three burns later, that belief became a conviction. Yet my experiences are not without context as this was also the first year I camped with Que Viva camp, which neighbored People of Color camp. Both camps, by virtue of their demographic composition and explicit social justice politics, language, and workshop and dialogue spaces, became black and brown oases for people of color and white allies seeking shelter from the heat and the disingenuously color-blind and selectively apolitical culture of white liberalism and libertarianism.</p> <p>Sadly, 2016 was not without white people walking around with native headdresses and dreadlocks, wealthy plug-and-play camps, or the proportionally dismal number of people of color Burning Man is known for. It was, however, where I had the rare opportunity to think, laugh, cry, play and create among people of color and white allies who are about creating a larger antiracist world where more of us can fit, a world that neither begins nor ends in Black Rock City. Thanks to the people and the content of the experiences we co-created, 2016 set a high bar for what a people-of-color and social justice\u2013centered burn can and should look like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Steven and Honey Shot get stuck into some sustenance\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKOXceVhy7N/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brother Nick and I engage in the ritual sacrifice of a watermelon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Steven Thrasher (@thrasherxy) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-11T17:44:25+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 11, 2016 at 10:44am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Marlon Williams</h2> <p>It definitely felt like there were black people this year. When I saw a person of color, it wasn\u2019t as novel or as freakish as it usually is. I usually do a count of black people. In the past, my count was in the low 70s, and in a high year it was 105. This year, I think being with a pregnant lady, my brain was in baby mode and I didn\u2019t do the count. But I did feel like there were more black folks, and that folks were more comfortable. </p> <p>I was a Black Rock Ranger this year [rangers <a href=\"http://rangers.burningman.org/\">are</a> \u201cparticipants who volunteer a portion of their time at Burning Man in service of the safety and well-being of the Burning Man community,\u201d who often mediate in situations before law enforcement gets involved]. When I went to my ranger training, there was a moment with the woman who managed us. She\u2019s a black woman, and most of the people in training were people of color, and there was this instant camaraderie between us. She said, \u201cWe want you to do great, because we want to have more people who look like us, particularly as we can occupy the space between the Burning Man community and law enforcement.\u201d And I had this idea. In this past year, we\u2019ve seen all these negative interactions between people of color and law enforcement. Of course people of color would flock \u2013 not to a law enforcement place, but to be protectors of a community \u2026 to say to ourselves, \u201cWhat can I do to be someone standing in this space between this community and the outside world?\u201d It was very healing.</p> <ul> <li>It you want to share your story of being a person of color at Burning Man, please email <a href=\"mailto:steven.thrasher@theguardian.com\">steven.thrasher@theguardian.com</a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Kadeena Cox was leaning on the British Cycling press officer as she walked around the velodrome after her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/kadeena-cox-sarah-storey-hannah-cockroft-rio-paralympics\" title=\"\">world-record ride in the C4-5 500m time trial on Saturday</a>. Having just become the first British Paralympian since Isabel Newstead in 1988 to win medals in two sports in the same Games, Cox was looking unsteady on her feet.</p> <p>It was a striking sight, a reminder of how challenging life can be for Paralympic athletes away from the glare of competition. It is two years since Cox was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after a stroke and her condition can leave her energy levels depleted, meaning she has to manage her training carefully.</p> <p>Her coaches wondered if she should do two sports. Her mother was worried that such physical exertion would worsen her daughter\u2019s condition. Many thought an athletics medal would be beyond Cox after the 25-year-old was moved from the T37 to T38 classification.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/kadeena-cox-sarah-storey-hannah-cockroft-rio-paralympics\">Kadeena Cox completes historic Paralympic double with time trial gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By now it is clear that she is an athlete who wants it all and Cox is back on the running track in Wednesday morning\u2019s T38 400m final. Newstead won discus gold and shooting bronze in Seoul. Cox is going for her third medal in her first&#xa0;Paralympics.</p> <p>\u201cMy message would be never give up,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t give up at any point even when my classification was changed. When people told me I couldn\u2019t do it I never gave up at any point and I\u2019m here proving if you work hard and you have a passion for something you can get there.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told I couldn\u2019t do it a billion times in the past few weeks but I\u2019m so happy I\u2019ve done the two-sport thing and proved you can do amazing things. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m standing here as a role model showing people you can achieve these things if you put the hard work in.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum was slightly stressed because she didn\u2019t want it to make my condition worse and it is a big risk factor with the stress. Exercise kind of exacerbated the condition but as long as they knew it wasn\u2019t going to make me worse they were happy.\u201d</p> <p>Cox, who has become an M62 motorway expert after splitting her training time between Manchester and Leeds, likes a little chaos in her life. Along with the 400m, she will be back on her bike in the C4-5 road race on Saturday. It is thought she might not be selected for the 4x100m relay because of her understandable lack of practice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with the cyclists but this has caused drama,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThe athletes keep saying I\u2019ve changed sides but it wasn\u2019t like that. It just worked out this way.\u201d</p> <p>Cox joked she had proved her coaches wrong. \u201cThey were both behind me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey knew I had the talent and the ability, it was just whether we could do it logistically. The teams wouldn\u2019t necessarily want me to do both because there\u2019s risk involved.</p> <p>\u201cBut we looked at it and realised it could be achievable if we managed it right and I\u2019ve got great support from the National Lottery, psychologists, physios and all the&#xa0;coaches.</p> <p>\u201cInitially it was a journey about one girl who wanted to go to the Paralympics but over the two years it has become something I was doing for everyone else. The reason I wanted to do it so badly was so I could stand here and show it can be done even if you have setbacks.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Newcastle United laid down a Championship marker as they blew away Queens Park Rangers on a sweltering night in west London in a victory so comprehensive that Rafael Ben\u00edtez was forced to warn against complacency.</p> <p>Two-nil up at half-time thanks to goals from Jonjo Shelvey and Ayoze P\u00e9rez, Newcastle went on to crush Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink\u2019s side in a result that matched their biggest league away win and QPR\u2019s biggest home defeat. Yet after the match Ben\u00edtez remained poker faced, surely aware that the Championship has the capability to stymie his side yet.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to make sure we concentrate for every game,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you get six goals, enjoy yourselves for a couple of days, sure, but then you have to focus on the next one. It\u2019s a very difficult competition.\u201d</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez was full of praise for his forward pairing of P\u00e9rez and Aleksandar Mitrovic, who ran a merry dance through QPR\u2019s disorganised defence and highlighted the wealth of Newcastle\u2019s attacking options. \u201cI\u2019m very, very happy with the strikers,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cToday was a difficult decision for me because Daryl Murphy was training very well and to play Mitrovic rather than Dwight Gayle was difficult but we have a good squad.\u201d</p> <p>Newcastle\u2019s early play was notable for its assertiveness and physicality. In a contrast to many pre-match expectations, they muscled the home side out of possession on several occasions. In the eighth minute one such turnover sent Mitrovic free behind the exposed QPR captain Nedum Onuoha. Outrunning Steven Caulker, his cut-back found Shelvey whose shot deflected over Alex Smithies and into the net.</p> <p>Time and again Newcastle laid waste to QPR\u2019s right flank and in the 30th minute the lead was doubled. This time Matt Ritchie provided the run, squaring up against Onuoha before fizzing a beautiful low ball across goal. P\u00e9rez was sharpest to the ball and while Smithies saved his shot, the keeper could only palm the ball back to the Spaniard who did not need another invitation.</p> <p>Within three minutes of the restart the game was over as P\u00e9rez was allowed to control a long ball on his chest and into the path of Shelvey. The England international was not in the Newcastle team at the start of this season but showed no doubts in his ability as he took a touch and curled a perfect 25-yard shot into the top corner.</p> <p>Newcastle then ran rampant. Ciaran Clark scored the fourth, heading in at the far post from a corner. Minutes later the substitute Christian Atsu\u2019s low shot was deflected into the path of Mitrovic who passed the ball into the net for his first goal of the season. The rout was completed by another sub, Grant Hanley, whose right-foot effort was again deflected past a beleaguered Smithies.</p> <p>Hasselbaink did his best to put a brave face on the result afterwards, claiming his team had \u201clost together\u201d and observing that his opponents had a \u201c\u00a3100m squad\u201d. But the Dutchman will not have been deluded that his team played well on the night and look in serious need of organisation. \u201cWe were very stretched and it was easy for them to counterattack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was easy for them to get in behind us even though we were quite deep. I might start looking at the videos tonight, because I know I\u2019m not going to sleep.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/09/agent-sunderland-newcastle-derby-fans-t-shirt\">Sunderland players talked out of provocative derby T-shirt, book claims</a> </p> </aside>",
  "<p>\u201cBetter teams than us have found it difficult,\u201d Brendan Rodgers said before this game, but even he cannot have imagined it would be quite this hard. Celtic\u2019s opening night in this season\u2019s Champions League was a long one, a goal coming inside the opening three minutes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/13/barcelona-celtic-champions-league-live\">another coming inside the closing three minutes </a>and five more between them. Three for Leo Messi, two for Luis Su\u00e1rez and one each for Neymar and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta completed a destruction, Celtic\u2019s worst ever defeat in this competition and Barcelona\u2019s best win. No European Cup-winning club has ever lost by more in this competition.</p> <p>For a manager who declared himself an \u201cadmirer of everything that Barcelona stand for\u201d, this was a painful demonstration of their qualities. Barcelona inflicted seven goals and a thousand cuts upon their visitors, not just playing the game in Celtic\u2019s half but playing much of it inside their own area. If the first half was impressive, the second was cruel. By the end, a Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 penalty saved by Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen was long forgotten, buried beneath the football that engulfed Celtic. Rodgers admitted he felt helpless as he watched from the touchline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/psg-arsenal-champions-league-match-report\">Arsenal behind after 42 seconds but Alexis S\u00e1nchez rescues point at PSG</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It started early from a corner, but not by the traditional route. Instead Neymar took it short to Jordi Alba, who gave it back to him out on the left touchline from where he cut back inside and, with the defence stepping out, turned the ball into the area for Messi to control and hit high into the top corner from the edge of the six-yard box. The clock showed 2:45; this looked like being a long night for Celtic.</p> <p>Kolo Tour\u00e9 smashed one off his own post; Messi slipped the ball through the legs of Nir Bitton to thump narrowly wide; and Su\u00e1rez slid in, inches from providing the finish to what was essentially a 40-yard one-two with Messi. A pattern seemed to have been set early: Barcelona had the ball while Celtic ran after it, usually arriving too late. And yet, it was Ter Stegen who arrived late, on 22 minutes and momentarily gave life to this game.</p> <p>Scott Sinclair\u2019s run began inside the centre circle and took him to the edge of the area, where he slipped the ball through to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Out came Ter Stegen, bringing him down for a penalty. As the striker stood over the spot, the German goalkeeper performed star jumps, a bright orange-pink figure with even brighter yellow extremities. Then, he dived to his right and pushed the penalty away two-handed. Rodgers lamented the opportunity lost and Barcelona soon raced out of sight.</p> <p>Rodgers had said Celtic\u2019s opponents could find space even if you parked two double-decker buses, and this was a good example. Messi, Neymar, Messi, Neymar, through tiny green and white gaps they went, back and forth, until Messi finished from barely a yard. Then Ivan Rakitic had one cleared off the line and Neymar was stopped by Dorus de Vries, although their pressing did occasionally allow an exit route and a neat combination released Kieran Tierney whose pass was finished by Sinclair, in an offside position.</p> <p>Three minutes into the second half, Barcelona had the third; the real destruction had begun, Neymar curling in a free-kick. If the score worried Rodgers the time probably did too: there was more of this to come.</p> <p>Neymar clipped in a cross for Iniesta, on as a substitute for Rakitic at half-time, to do something very unlike Iniesta: he absolutely smashed the volley into the net. It was four now; it would be five almost before they realised it. Barely 15 seconds passed between Celtic kicking off and the ball hitting their net.

  "<p>This was one of those occasions when what had initially appeared an unnecessarily risky team selection ended up feeling more like a masterstroke. Arsenal were overrun for long periods in Paris but still departed buoyed by the point pilfered from their trickiest tie of the section, and with David Ospina\u2019s reputation as enhanced as Edinson Cavani\u2019s was wrecked. The locals are growing used to their Uruguayan\u2019s profligacy. Ospina, in contrast, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/13/psg-v-arsenal-champions-league-live\">rarely asserted such a positive influence </a>on his own team\u2019s display.</p> <p>In the context of the flurry of opportunities thwarted by his goalkeeper late on, either choked, blocked or parried to safety, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger could justify his policy, apparently laid down in pre\u2011season, that the Colombian will begin in Champions League ties. He had done the same last year only for Arsenal to succumb to Dinamo Zagreb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/29/arsenal-olympiakos-champions-league\">and Olympiakos, where Ospina was culpable</a> as the team wilted. Petr Cech was duly recalled against Bayern Munich. Yet, at Parc des Princes in a potentially daunting contest, the 28-year-old was a man inspired.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/13/same-old-arsenal-but-arsene-wengers-team-in-transition-earn-a-useful-point\">Same old Arsenal, but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s team in transition earn a useful point | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He sprang from his line to smother at the feet of those Paris Saint-Germain players marauding into the penalty area, whether Cavani or Serge Aurier. There were fine touches to deflect aside efforts from \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, and even a willingness to charge from his box to nod away through-balls squeezed beyond Arsenal\u2019s backline. Ospina achieved all this despite conceding after 42 seconds as his team rather dithered from the outset. Cavani had planted his header emphatically into the corner from Aurier\u2019s glorious cross on the charge with Shkodran Mustafi apparently distracted by the presence of a second ball on the pitch, albeit on the distant touchline. The marking was more of an issue.</p> <p>For a few, tantalising minutes, Cavani, a player who had shivered for so long in the shadow of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, must have rejoiced in the belief this would be finally be his coming of age as PSG\u2019s central striker. He could certainly never have envisaged departing at the end haunted by the nightmarish memory of Ospina in his turquoise kit and that hellish flash of his fluorescent gloves. As Rio Ferdinand acknowledged in his role as a pundit, had Ibrahimovic featured in the Uruguayan\u2019s stead, \u201cArsenal would have been run out of town\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2aeb7e11b5bc0214d7d64b75634ee5c48b2d0784\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2aeb7e11b5bc0214d7d64b75634ee5c48b2d0784/0_101_5223_3133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edinson Cavani celebrates scoring the opening goal after 42 seconds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edinson Cavani celebrates scoring the opening goal after 42 seconds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sight of the ball continually falling to Cavani in front of goal almost felt cruel by the end. His best opportunity to exorcise his demons had come just after the half-hour mark as Nacho Monreal slid on to a Marco Verratti through-ball and succeeded only in prodding the ball away from Laurent Koscielny and into the striker\u2019s path. He edged round the goalkeeper, for one of the only times all night, but was off balance as the ball ran across him and could only skewer the shot into the side-netting with the goal gaping. His evening deteriorated entirely thereafter.

Whenever he had time to think, he panicked. The final miss, nine minutes from time, had the locals cursing wildly from the stands. Asked how he would rebuild the confidence of a player who finds himself in that position, Wenger said: \u201cI\u2019d tell him to keep looking for chances, and perhaps to relax a touch. He was actually good tonight, Cavani, and very effective in terms of his pressing. It would be interesting to see how much ground he covered and how many sprints he had.\u201d</p> <p>PSG needed more than mere industry. There is self-doubt at this club following the summer arrival of Unai Emery, and the departures of the charismatic Ibrahimovic and David Luiz. They had so yearned for a victory here to justify the manager\u2019s appointment \u2013 as a figure apparently likelier to deliver a European trophy \u2013 in succession to Laurent Blanc, though Emery finished as rattled and unnerved by his team\u2019s deficienciesas his players.</p> <p>Their dismal finishing was always likely to hurt them in the end and, when Mesut \u00d6zil conjured a clever pass \u2013 one of his few eye-catching contributions all night \u2013 to find the excellent Alex Iwobi 12 minutes from time, the French were undone. The youngster\u2019s shot was pushed away by Alphonse Areola but only as far as Alexis S\u00e1nchez, loitering ignored near the penalty shot. His finish was emphatic and Arsenal had their point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4a8e5445f1e7d050bccb9d8ab696a1f7b690fcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4a8e5445f1e7d050bccb9d8ab696a1f7b690fcd/551_328_1852_1111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis S\u00e1nchez celebrates his equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis S\u00e1nchez celebrates his equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The skirmishes became rather fractious from then on in, PSG irritated by Olivier Giroud\u2019s presence with tempers duly boiling over in stoppage time. Marquinhos and Verratti squabbled with Giroud near the touchline and, while the exchanges were more playground than truly spiteful, the Hungarian official flashed second yellow cards to the Arsenal substitute and the Italian midfielder.</p> <p>Both players appeared perplexed. Both will be absent for their team\u2019s next fixture when Arsenal, fitness permitting, will retain Ospina. It will seem less of a risk second time round.</p>",

He was lambasted at this stage last season for playing Opsina ahead of Cech against Olympiakos and he insisted back then, after an embarrassing defeat, that the criticism was unfair: Ospina made mistakes but, said Wenger, that could have happened to anyone and did not mean the decision to pick him was flawed. To prove his point, he\u2019s picked Ospina again here. Let\u2019s hope the Colombian does not suffer in Paris the way that Arsenal keepers (Seaman and Lehmann) have done previously. Otherwise the rage of Arsenal fans will break the internet. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d83cb7e4b067ad30087581\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T17:53:31.658Z\">6.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome. We are gathered here today to witness the start of the latest Champions League adventure of Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain and to look for signs that this one won\u2019t end the same way as all the others. These teams have never met in the tournament before but share a slightly similar relationship with it, insofar as both regular participants and serial flops. But let\u2019s not give up on them because they\u2019re both very entertaining, for the reason just mentioned as well as for their style of play.</p> <p> Mind you, neither sides\u2019 style of play has been particularly swish so far this season, as both have yet to hit a groove. Umai Emery, the manager whom PSG lured from Sevilla in the summer to replace Laurent Blanc, has endured a difficult start to his reign. The team have looked like they\u2019re caught between two stools (or like one big steaming stool, if you want to be harsh about it) and that\u2019s not acceptable for a team of their resources and ambitions, as Marco Verratti confirmed in yesterday\u2019s press conference when he said: \u201cI don\u2019t play for a club that does transitions\u201d. One big victory would do Emery and PSG a power of good right now. </p> <p> Pretty much the same thing, of course, goes for Arsenal. Win in Paris, their strongest rivals, and Arsenal will have raised hope that they are not about to repeat the mistakes of previous seasons and are ready and able to seize every opportunity rather than fritter it away. And Arsenal fans will be able to recall a trip to Paris for happier reasons than Nayim\u2019s lob and Jen Lehmann\u2019s foul. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d7bd9de4b07ac3d446bb14\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T08:49:34.694Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong> PSG</strong>: Areola; Aurier, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Maxwell; Verratti, Krychowiak, Rabiot; Di Maria, Cavani, Matuidi</p> <p><em> Subs: Trapp, Kimpembe, Moura, Motta, Pastore, Meunier, Jes\u00e9</em></p> <p><strong> Arsenal</strong>: Ospina; Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Cazorla, Coquelin; Iwobi, Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Sanchez </p> <p><em> Subs: Cech, Holding, Gibbs, Xhaka, Elneny, Lucas, Giroud</em></p> <p><strong> Referee</strong>: V Kassai (Hun)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T18:13:40.228Z\">at 7.13pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>Toby Roland-Jones embodies so much of what makes this Middlesex side, who took another step towards a first County Championship title in 23 years, such a tough nut to crack. He provides roistering lower-order runs, never drops a catch, while his seam bowling \u2013 ever more like that of his director of cricket, Angus Fraser, is naggingly threatening.</p> <p>It was Roland-Jones\u2019s bowling that wrestled control back Middlesex\u2019s way after a sloppy morning during which they lost their last seven wickets for 69 to be bowled out for 327, claiming just three batting points when they had designs on five.</p> <p>After lunch, he and Tim Murtagh were straight on their immaculate length with three maidens, then Roland-Jones found a beauty \u2013 lifting from a length and nipping away from its off-stump line \u2013 to dismiss Haseeb Hameed for the second duck of his first-class career. After Luke Procter edged Murtagh to gully, Roland-Jones dismissed Alviro Petersen, caught down the leg side, and Steven Croft, stumps splattered, in the same over to leave Lancashire eight for four.</p> <p>Jos Buttler briefly resisted, with two delicious cover drives, but was soon gone in the same fashion as Petersen, albeit to an even better catch from John Simpson: 32 for five, and Roland-Jones had four of them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/13/county-cricket-yorkshire-somerset-lancashire-middlesex-sussex-worcs-live\">County cricket: Yorkshire v Somerset, Lancashire v Middlesex and Sussex v Worcestershire \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the light worsened and forecast rain arrived \u2013 the players took an early tea at 2.50pm and were gone for good by 4.30pm, 28 overs down \u2013 the impressive Rob Jones, in his third Championship game, dug in in the company of Liam Livingstone, a likely Lions tourist this winter, to steady Lancashire\u2019s ship with a stoic and at times stylish stand of 70.</p> <p>Middlesex\u2019s bowling was again impressive but the light often dictated whether pace could be bowled and Lancashire \u2013 in very real need of points in a vicious relegation scrap \u2013 have plenty more battling to do, as they sit 225 behind. Jones, particularly, with a sound defence and an elegant drive, looks a batsman for a crisis.</p> <p>Middlesex\u2019s plan had been to bat once, and bat big, but the morning session had seen them forgo a match-shaping first\u2011innings total. As Dawid Malan became the fourth batsman to reach 50 and not kick on, they lost three for 10, and despite James Franklin trying to hold things together, Simon Kerrigan ended up with four for 80 as the tail nudged and nurdled.

If they were to do that, they may well view Roland-Jones\u2019s spell \u2013 just like Nick Gubbins\u2019s gritty 75 from the wreckage of none for three at Trent Bridge last week \u2013 as a defining moment.</p>",
  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull is marking his first year as prime minister. We take a look back at the major moments of the past 12 months.</p> <h2><strong>Advocacy: not slogans. Catharsis of the leadership change</strong></h2> <p>On September 14 2015, Malcolm Turnbull strode into a parliamentary courtyard and declared he was moving against Tony Abbott. The Coalition had been behind Labor in 30 consecutive Newspolls, a fact Turnbull noted in his rationale for the leadership change.</p> <p>His pitch was simple. Abbott had proved himself incapable of providing economic leadership. \u201cIt is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. Ultimately, the prime minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e89b5bc89d8238082ec315765d775db71606975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e89b5bc89d8238082ec315765d775db71606975/0_0_4900_3305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The morning newspapers in Sydney on 15 September 2015, the day after he ousted Tony Abbott in a snap party vote\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The morning newspapers in Sydney on 15 September 2015, the day after he ousted Tony Abbott in a snap party vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there was a promise of grown-up government. \u201cWe need a different style of leadership. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people\u2019s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.\u201d</p> <p>The effect was immediate. Turnbull\u2019s oft-repeated optimistic declaration that there had never been a more exciting time saw the Coalition recover in the polls. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/19/globetrotting-turnbull-stretches-his-wings-but-will-the-diehards-clip-them\">Turnbull changed the national tone instantly on issues like national security</a>, moved quickly to produce a science and innovation package as well as reopening a tax reform debate that had stalled under Abbott and Joe Hockey.<br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018If something isn\u2019t working as well as you want, chuck it out\u2019</strong></h2> <p>One month after taking the leadership, Turnbull did his first round of sit-down media interviews. He was keen to project a sense of pragmatism and compromise, to draw a contrast with the unrelenting conflict atmosphere promulgated by his predecessor. \u201cIf something isn\u2019t working as well as you want, chuck it out,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/23/the-malcolm-turnbull-interview-if-something-isnt-working-chuck-it-out\">Turnbull said during a conversation with Guardian Australia</a> on 23 October. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of people saying, it\u2019s a backdown, or a backflip.

Fairer is what is it all about</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull in October 2015</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turnbull during his opening gambit also acknowledged that the political conversation around budget repair needed to address equity \u2013 again an explicit point of contrast with the 2014 budget, which was a political disaster for Abbott. \u201cWe should never cease trying to make changes in the social welfare area fairer,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cFairer is what is it all about. Fairness has got to be the key priority.\u201d He gave his first signal about where the government would ultimately land with the controversial superannuation reforms it would unveil in the May 2016 budget. He suggested tax concessions for the wealthy had to be pared back as well as government spending programs primarily benefiting the lower paid.</p> <h2><strong>The first summit season</strong></h2> <p>Two months after the leadership change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/20/presidents-planes-and-paris-inside-the-whirlwind-of-malcolm-turnbulls-first-world-tour\">Malcolm embarked on his first summit season</a>. His first stop was Jakarta \u2013 an investment in improving the bilateral relationship with president Joko Widodo. The relationship with Jakarta had been battered and bruised over asylum boat turnbacks and also the revelation that Australia\u2019s spy agencies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/australia-tried-to-monitor-indonesian-presidents-phone\">had attempted to listen-in on the calls</a> of the previous Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and his inner circle.

He flew on to Turkey for the G20 gathering, which was dominated by the worsening security situation in Syria. Turnbull met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at the Antalya gathering \u2013 the first substantial contact between Canberra and Moscow since Tony Abbott had famously threatened to \u201cshirtfront\u201d the Russian president. Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/apec-summit-malcolm-turnbull-says-syria-solution-hinges-on-power-sharing\">noted a political solution in Syria would require the inclusion of Sunni groups</a> that had felt disenfranchised by the Assad regime and had consequently been left vulnerable to overtures from Islamic State. In Turkey he met the leaders of Japan, Singapore, the EU, India and China.</p> <p>Turnbull then winged his way to Manila and the Apec summit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/17/malcolm-turnbull-and-barack-obama-hold-first-meeting-and-promise-to-ramp-up-fight-against-isis\">where he had his first substantial bilateral with the US president, Barack Obama</a>. Obama invited Turnbull to visit Washington and courted Australia\u2019s support in the hotly disputed region of the South China Sea, where Australia had resolved to walk a middle course diplomatically, carefully balancing the relationship between most important strategic ally and largest trading partner.</p> <h2><strong>Early concessions to conservative enemies</strong></h2> <p> Turnbull lost the leadership of the Liberal party in 2009 for two reasons \u2013 he was seen by colleagues as dragging the Coalition in too progressive a direction and his leadership style was regarded as high-handed.</p> <p>Turnbull entered the leadership in 2015 determined to be more consultative and he vowed to restore good cabinet processes, which was partly an explicit apologia about his own mistakes in the past and a more contemporary acknowledgement that one of the things that had undone Abbott as prime minister was a \u201ccommand and control\u201d leadership style out of the prime minister\u2019s office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec2d0491efd887f50ba2c653c297e9e017a36f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec2d0491efd887f50ba2c653c297e9e017a36f7/0_108_5154_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull with the education minister, Simon Birmingham.

He also made it clear that there would be no change to the Coalition\u2019s climate change policy before a planned review in 2017, despite broad criticism about the effectiveness of the Direct Action scheme.</p> <p>After a brief backbench storm over the Safe Schools anti-bullying program in March, Turnbull and fellow moderate, the education minister Simon Birmingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/18/turnbull-government-unveils-dramatic-changes-to-safe-schools-program\">offered up a number of concessions</a>, such as requiring parental consent for student participation and requiring the agreement of parental bodies to decide whether, and how, a school will participate in the program.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The concessions to the conservative right set a definitive trend for Turnbull and they corroded his personal standing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the chief critics of the program, the LNP backbencher George Christensen, later declared victory. \u201cIt\u2019s all going,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cBoys in girls\u2019 school uniforms, girls and boys using the same toilets, classroom role plays where kids imagine they have no genitalia or they\u2019re gay ...

And if they don\u2019t, the funding will be cut.\u201d</p> <p>The concessions to the conservative right set a definitive trend for Turnbull and, progressively, they corroded his personal standing with voters. Voters had welcomed the leadership change, believing that Turnbull would be less ideological than his predecessor, would move the Coalition back to the political centre and was a politician prepared to sacrifice ambition for principle.</p> <h2><strong>Tax reform debate: the brief life of a GST hike, and competitive federalism</strong></h2> <p>Reopening the government\u2019s stalled tax reform debate was an early marker that the prime minister intended to prosecute a broad-ranging economic policy discussion. A possible rise in the GST had been, as Turnbull liked to say, \u201ckicked off into the long grass\u201d under Abbott. The new prime minister elected to put the GST back on the political agenda.</p> <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/24/gst-debate-scott-morrison-backs-need-for-option-to-raise-tax-as-part-of-reforms\">opened the political new year in 2016 by softening Australians up for an increase in the GST,</a> arguing that reform needed to be on the table if voters want personal income tax relief and a cut to corporate tax to boost economic growth. Two state premiers, Mike Baird in New South Wales, and Jay Weatherill, the Labor man in South Australia, were resolved to give Turnbull political cover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31d431cb281fb7ed1c3d0b69db237798625d2414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31d431cb281fb7ed1c3d0b69db237798625d2414/0_87_2758_1655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, during question time at Parliament House in Canberra early in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, during question time at Parliament House in Canberra early in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Labor had spent the summer working up a marginal seats campaign for the election year predicated around opposing the GST and that rattled the government backbench. While Morrison continued to roll forward, Turnbull began to roll back. It was the first sign that the relationship between prime minister and treasurer wasn\u2019t entirely harmonious.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/turnbull-rules-out-gst-change-election-policy/7172294\">A GST increase was dumped formally in February.</a> \u201cAfter you take into account all of the compensation that you would need to ensure the change was equitable, it simply is not justified in economic terms,\u201d the prime minister told reporters.</p> <p>A second phase of tax reform played out somewhat chaotically in the lead-up to a Council of Australian Governments meeting in late March 2016. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/29/states-offered-5bn-hospitals-funding-income-tax-raising-powers\">Turnbull floated the idea that state governments would be able to levy a portion of income tax</a> and service delivery would be devolved back to the states. The premiers shot the concept down in flames. Turnbull put the defeat more delicately. \u201cThere was not a consensus among the states and territories to support further consideration of the proposal that would enable states to levy income tax on their own behalf,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>A budget, Senate reform and a sprint to a double dissolution</strong></h2> <p>Having turned into an election year, and with political momentum clearly on the wane, Turnbull set about putting together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/19/senate-voting-reform-stirs-up-hornets-nest-between-likely-winners-and-losers\">reforms to the Senate voting system</a> that were designed to reduce the chances of micro-party candidates being elected on small percentages of the vote.

The budget was styled not merely as a budget but pitched rather more grandly as an \u201ceconomic plan\u201d for the nation, where cuts to business taxes would generate more economic growth and jobs (although the fine print on the tax cut made it clear the growth dividend was small and would take many years to arrive). Somewhat bravely for an election budget, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/budget-2016-jobs-and-growth-pitch-costs-wealthy-retirees-smokers-and-multinationals\">no goodies for people on average incomes</a> between $37,000 and $80,000.</p> <h2><strong>The winter of Malcolm\u2019s discontent</strong></h2> <p>By the conclusion of budget week, Malcolm Turnbull resolved Australians would go to the polls for a double-dissolution election on 2 July.

Arce begins her memoir, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Underground-American-Dream-Undocumented-Immigrant/dp/1455540242\">My (Underground) American Dream</a>, published on Tuesday, describing a panic attack that felt like a heart attack that could kill her. There were migraines and debilitating back pains. An ex-boyfriend threatened to report her to the authorities and she felt powerless to fly home to see her dying father. The book is a vivid reminder that beyond monolithic terms and sweeping categories such as \u201cillegal aliens\u201d there are inner lives as richly textured as any other.</p> <p>Finally, in 2009, Arce married a US citizen and secured a green card, and went on to become a naturalised US citizen. She quit Wall Street and is now an author, speaker and social justice advocate based in Los Angeles, the centre of the undocumented immigrant population. She has watched the ascent of Donald Trump, who has made anti-Mexican rhetoric a centrepiece of his presidential campaign, with horror.

The visa expired when she was 14, rendering her undocumented.</p> <p>When she graduated high school in 2001, a new law made it possible for undocumented Texas students to attend public universities and she was accepted at the University of Texas at Austin.</p> <p>Arce\u2019s parents moved back to Mexico in 2001. She took over their food cart business, which meant that every Friday she took a Greyhound bus 80 miles to San Antonio to sell funnel cakes with strawberries, whipped cream and cinnamon. But when the cart lost its place in a market square, Arce needed a new job to make ends meet. At 19, she bought a fake green card and social security number in \u201ca mundane transaction\u201d in a stranger\u2019s apartment for a few hundred dollars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At 19, she bought a fake green card and social security number in a stranger\u2019s apartment for a few hundred dollars</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She says: \u201cI was really nervous about it because you never know those papers are going to work. That literally was the only choice I had. I didn\u2019t give up on myself and I didn\u2019t give up on my aspirations and I didn\u2019t give up on the sacrifice my parents had already made and the sacrifice I had made. So to me, as difficult as the choice was, the choice was clear. I had to take the next step.\u201d</p> <p>With the help of Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, which recruits and trains outstanding minority students for summer internships, Arce got her foot in the door at Goldman Sachs. She impressed and was soon offered a full-time job as an analyst. But when the euphoria subsided, she realised she would have to show forms of government-issued ID to start on payroll. She writes: \u201cIn less than two weeks there was more than a good chance my secret would finally be exposed \u2013 that secret that could ruin my life, that could send me to jail, that could end my career before it ever began. The secret I\u2019d been forced to keep since I was 14 years old.\u201d<br></p> <p>One night in the summer of 2005 she felt a sharp pain in her chest, unable to breathe and a tingling that crept down her left arm.

And yet, when the moment came, she submitted her fake documents to Goldman Sachs and the alarm never sounded. Facing one of the most wealthy and ruthless companies in the world, she had got away with it. She believes that, perversely, her background worked to her advantage.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest reasons I learned I slipped through the cracks at Goldman Sachs and why I never got caught or deported is because we have this very narrow-minded view of who an undocumented immigrant is and what they do, and I didn\u2019t fit that stereotype, so when people were looking at my papers they were never questioning are these papers real or not?[\u2026]\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut the truth is there are millions of us who do not fit that stereotype and we\u2019re breaking down that stereotype all the time. So we do those jobs because we have to, those are the jobs that are available, we take them, we do them well, we work really hard at them because we want the next generation to do better and we aspire to bigger things than that.\u201d</p> <p>With a workaholic boss who was on the treadmill at 5.30am and at his desk by 7am, there was little respite. Just as Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street declared, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WsOzrnBTHA\">\u201cLunch is for wimps,\u201d</a> so meals were usually eaten at desks, with sandwiches delivered by cart so no one had to get up. Even the toilet was for wimps. \u201cIf you had to go pee, you literally were like running to the bathroom to pee and come back to your desk,\u201d Arce recalls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have this very narrow-minded view of who an undocumented immigrant is and what they do</p> <footer> <cite>Julissa Arce</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet she did not want to be anywhere else. Arce had the wide-eyed wonder that often eludes jaded locals. \u201cI used to walk around New York City and think, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is my life. I can\u2019t believe I live here.\u2019 People dream of one day seeing New York City \u2026 This is a place out of movies and here I am, I live here. I lived at 45 Wall Street, I lived on one of the most famous streets in the world, and I couldn\u2019t believe that sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, corroding from within was the knowledge that it could all be shattered in a moment by some misstep. \u201cThere were periods of time when I couldn\u2019t get it out of my mind. There were like two or three weeks where every single day I was in a panic about it, but in some ways having the kind of job that I had almost shielded me from it being consciously in my mind. I had to worry about my next promotion, my next trade, my next job assignment, my next raise. But it never really left me.\u201d</p> <p>Arce blames this stress for severe back pains that left her lying on the floor for hours as well as terrible migraines and stomach problems, all at the age of 24. The book also details a series of heart-in-the-mouth near misses. Arce had to find excuses not to travel to London for Goldman Sachs because she knew leaving the country would expose her immigration status. She confided in a boyfriend but then discovered he was cheating on her and vowed to phone the woman concerned; he threatened: \u201cIf you call her, I\u2019ll call INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99a3f69f224d7125bfc6de749ad598a58160ccff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a3f69f224d7125bfc6de749ad598a58160ccff/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julissa Arce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julissa Arce: \u2018We do those jobs because we have to, those are the jobs that are available.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s a very painful moment because here was this person that I trusted with my life, that I thought had my back, that I thought loved me. The thing about that day that hurt me even more than him saying what he said is that I felt like I didn\u2019t have the ability to express full human emotion.</p> <p>\u201cThe way a normal human being reacts in a situation like that, rightfully so, when you\u2019re brokenhearted more than you ever thought you\u2019d be in your life, you scream and you yell and you act out. I didn\u2019t have that privilege. I had to swallow it all and just say OK, you win.\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, word came that Arce\u2019s father was dying. Her instinct was to fly straight home, but she realised that as soon as she crossed the border into Mexico, she would be giving herself a 10-year penalty. Her mother begged her not to come. She spoke to her father by phone two hours before he died. \u201cYou just feel so helpless because there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do and there\u2019s no way you can ever change what happened. You can never go back in time.\u201d</p> <p>Something had changed, however. Arce grew tired of Goldman Sachs and longed to return to Mexico to see her family, permanently ending her gilded cage existence in America. By now she had a much healthier relationship with a different boyfriend. He proposed marriage and she accepted. This enabled her to finally get a green card in 2009. The years of hiding were finally over, but not in the way she wanted.</p> <p>Arce muses: \u201cThe irony of my situation was so upsetting. The fact that my mum wanted to come to this country because she wanted to make sure her daughters never had to depend on a man. She would always tell me you\u2019ve got to be independent, you\u2019ve got to make your own money, be able to take care of yourself..\u201d</p> <p>And the marriage, buried in bureaucratic paperwork with no honeymoon, did not last, though the couple remain on friendly terms. \u201cWe were young and we never asked ourselves what does it really mean to be married. We had a problem and being married provided a solution to that problem. I read some of the reviews [of my book] that people have written on Goodreads and some people allude to me having got married only for the purpose of getting a green card. And that\u2019s not how it was.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was the first time since I was 14 years old I was really able to ask myself: what is it I want to do with my life?</p> <footer> <cite>Julissa Arce</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although Arce now has US citizenship, her mother\u2019s visa was revoked and she is banned for 10 years, while her sister is living undocumented in San Antonio with four American-born children. Her mother and sister have not seen each other for more than a decade. \u201cFinally I can have a passport that says I\u2019m American and I can vote and when people tell me I\u2019m a criminal, I can say no, I\u2019m an American citizen actually.

He\u2019s just said it loud and made it OK for everyone else to say it out loud. He has made it OK to be a racist.

  "<p>Theresa May has been urged to set an example to sexist employers and the British public by discarding heels and wearing flat shoes to formal meetings. </p> <p>As the Trades Union Congress (TUC) conference voted unanimously for the law to be changed \u201cto enable people to not be compelled to wear high heels at work\u201d, a delegate said the prime minister should wear pumps, flats or comfortable shoes at the despatch box. </p> <p>It follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/receptionist-sent-home-pwc-not-wearing-high-heels-pwc-nicola-thorp\">the case of Nicola Thorp</a>, a receptionist from Hackney, east London, who said she was sent home from work at a corporate finance company after refusing to wear high heels. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Penny Robinson, a GMB delegate at the conference, who seconded the motion, said May should put heels to one side and show that women can wear flats. \u201cOur new prime minister might be well known for her leopard-print kittens, her leather boots and of course her Jimmy Choos, but if she really wants to advance the cause for women in the workplace, there are two things she can do. </p> <p>\u201cThe first is to make a point of wearing pumps, flats and comfortable shoes for her cabinet, PMQs and for meeting all those EU leaders. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cLet the media see that you can be the most powerful woman in the country without needing to wear designer shoes to meet men\u2019s expectations. Women are still expected to wear completely inappropriate shoes every day just to make sure that the right image is portrayed for the employer.</p> <p>\u201cIf anything is truly going to change, we need to deal with the people at the very top. And luckily enough, we now have someone running the country who can set an example for the rest of us by making a point of wearing sensible shoes,\u201d she said. </p> <p>She added: \u201cThe second thing she could do is call a general election.\u201d <br></p> <p>Katie Collins, from the <a href=\"http://www.scpod.org/\">Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists</a>, who proposed the motion, said women were still reporting that employers enforce a dress code that enforces poor quality and uncomfortable footwear. \u201cApart from being extremely sexist, these policies can lead to long-term foot problems,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38ccab917a48041ef79e221d7862023086ff6b68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38ccab917a48041ef79e221d7862023086ff6b68/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picture of Theresa May in 2006 shows she is not averse to flatter shoe styles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A picture of Theresa May in 2006 shows she is not averse to flatter shoe styles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Graham/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wearing high heels can, she said, cause osteoarthritis while other footwear including flip-flops and sandals are responsible for a rise in the number of accidents on stairs in the summer. \u201cIt includes a case where an employee who was wearing open-toe shoes caught her toe on a filing cabinet, ripping the nail off. </p> <p>\u201cWe are not calling for a ban on high heels, sandals or flip-flops, we are calling for common sense and fairness in the workplace,\u201d Collins said. <br></p> <p>Thorp, 27, arrived on her first day at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in December in flat shoes but says she was told she must wear shoes with a \u201c2in to 4in heel\u201d.</p> <p>Thorp, who was employed as a temporary worker by PwC\u2019s outsourced reception firm Portico, said she was laughed at when she said the demand was discriminatory and sent home without pay after refusing to go out and buy a pair of heels.<br></p> <p>Portico said it set the uniform rules for staff but would review its guidelines.</p> <p>Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\">Fawcett Society</a>, the women\u2019s rights organisation, welcomed the TUC motion. \u201cThe current threshold in the law is women should not experience \u2018less favourable treatment\u2019 as a result of a dress code.

  "<p>Let us begin with a paradox: more people are in work than at any time in British history, yet British workers rank among the most insecure and stressed in Europe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/underemployment-corrosive-unemployment-on-rise\" title=\"\">They want more hours and better pay</a>. Key to all of this is an apparently new kind of employer, fuelled by billions in venture capital and marked by a new precarity among the people who work for them. The big names are well known to many of us. They deliver packages and takeaways up and down the country and pick up customers who want a lift. They include delivery group Hermes \u2013 which, it was revealed this week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/hermes-may-face-hmrc-investigation-into-allegations-of-low-pay\" title=\"\">faces a probe by Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs</a> \u2013 Deliveroo and Uber.</p> <p>Such businesses are often referred to as the \u201cgig economy\u201d, a term that summons up images of groovy, footloose, free-spirited work. The reality is far more pedestrian and often straightforwardly grim. This is piecework, in which drivers and couriers are paid by the ride or the drop. The wages are highly variable and the protections are threadbare. Some workers might welcome the flexibility and the stepping-stone to better opportunities. For others the gig economy is a trap \u2013 a poverty trap.</p> <p>Two months ago, the Guardian found that some couriers for Hermes were getting paid less than a living wage. Peter Jamieson, a driver for the company, recounted how his wife was diagnosed with inoperable cancer and he asked to swap delivery days on his rounds so he could attend her hospital appointments. \u201cThey told me everyone has problems \u2026 and I would never work for&#xa0;Hermes again \u2026 there was no compassion,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/11/hermes-driver-lost-rounds-asking-swap-days\" title=\"\">he said</a>.</p> <p>The gig economy includes some big names and has drawn in major investment; Hermes commands a fleet of 10,500 couriers such as Mr Jamieson. Deliveroo, which has also been hit by wildcat strikes by drivers, is one of the best-funded startups in Europe. Out of the 2.6 million people who have gained a new job since David Cameron moved into No 10, more than a third \u2013 900,000 \u2013 were classed as self-employed. Many of these were not would-be Richard Bransons and Alan Sugars \u2013 they were going off into the gig economy. Statisticians do not have a clue about the scale or the scope of the gig economy, just as they do not know&#xa0;precisely how many workers are on a zero-hours contract, that other totem of the new jobs market.</p> <p>The big trade unions that have been gathering at Brighton this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/brexit-dont-make-ordinary-workers-pay-tuc-urges-government\" title=\"\">for the TUC congress</a> have largely failed to reach out to this new casualised workforce. Meanwhile, politicians are only just waking up to the fact that the orthodoxy that both Conservatives and Labour have pushed for decades \u2013 that work always pays \u2013 is wrong. In modern Britain, someone can slog their guts out and still have to go to the food bank or rely on benefits to get by.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, <a href=\"http://www.frankfield.co.uk/upload/docs/Wild%20West%20Workplace.pdf\" title=\"\">this week\u2019s report</a> into the gig economy by Frank Field is to be welcomed. The MP for Birkenhead has seen how his own constituency lost its industry and the stable jobs that went with it, and got back insecure and low-paid work. His&#xa0;intervention should shame the new business secretary, Greg Clark, into conducting his own full inquiry, but makes some sound recommendations \u2013 chief among them that gig companies should \u201cguarantee minimum daily and weekly rates of pay\u201d.</p> <p>New laws do need to be made \u2013 but the old ones could also do with being tweaked and enforced properly. HMRC needs more cash and staff so that it can investigate whether employers are paying the minimum wage. With Hermes, the tax inspectors only got going after the Guardian\u2019s investigation. In&#xa0;other cases, they have been prompted by tiny unions such as the admirably scrappy Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain. While couriers are plainly not employees, it is false to claim that they are \u201cindependent contractors\u201d \u2013 however convenient it may be for their companies to do so. Better to have a presumption in law that they are \u201cworkers\u201d \u2013 and to grant them rights to statutory sick pay and redress against unfair dismissal.</p>",

  "<p>It hasn\u2019t been the easiest fortnight for David Davis. Last week, he got slapped down by Theresa May for making up government policy as he went along in the Commons;on Tuesday, he found that the Boundary Commission had put his parliamentary seat at risk. So the last thing the Brexit minister could have done with was an afternoon in front of the foreign affairs committee giving an update on his department\u2019s lack of progress.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the government may have a majority in the Commons to repeal any EU legislation that may be needed to implement article 50, it almost certainly doesn\u2019t in the Lords,\u201d said committee chair Crispin Blunt. \u201cWhat steps have your department taken to make sure there is no delay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Davis replied confidently. \u201cWe have a massive mandate. A very, very big mandate. Possibly the biggest mandate ever. So everything is going to be tickety-boo. Besides, everything is very complicated and I\u2019m certainly not going to spend any time hypothesising about anything as complicated as how the Lords might vote.\u201d</p> <p>Blunt suggested this could be considered negligence, but had more pressing matters to deal with. Such as why the letter he had written to the attorney general in late June enquiring whether all the necessary changes in EU law could be dealt with under a single act of parliament had only been answered that morning by Davis with a \u201cDear Crispin, I can\u2019t really answer as it\u2019s all terribly tricky, lots of love, David\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t really answer as it\u2019s all terribly tricky,\u201d said Davis, for once keeping to the letter of the letter. \u201cThe simple answer is that it might be and it might not be, depending on what happens in the negotiations that I can\u2019t tell you about as they are top secret. But I can tell you we will be going for the best deal we can possibly get, but if we don\u2019t get it then we will end up with something else. It\u2019s much more complicated than I had thought it would be.\u201d</p> <p>A more forensic committee might have asked Davis why he hadn\u2019t bothered to find out how complicated leaving the EU was going to be before telling everyone how easy it was going to be during the referendum campaign. But the foreign affairs committee doesn\u2019t possess many of the sharpest minds on the parliamentary block at the best of times, and with so many of its members being Brexit supporters it appeared hell-bent on being even less enquiring than usual in order to try and make Davis look a bit less hapless.</p> <p>Conservative Nadhim Zahawi wanted to know when the government would work out what it wanted from its EU negotiations. \u201cWhenever the prime minister says so, but probably some time in the new year,\u201d Davis replied, deliberately not specifying a month or even which new year. \u201cI can assure you, though, that anyone who wants a round table can have a round table. Let me make one thing clear: my job is to give the public what they voted for even if we lied about what they were voting for. I can\u2019t think of any way of making this more exhaustive and complicated, but if I can I will do it. The step between now and then will require qualification.\u201d</p> <p>To the untrained ear, this all sounded suspiciously as if Davis really didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on and was just waffling to kill time, but to Zahawi it was the model of clarity. Incredibly, this was almost the high point of the committee\u2019s proceedings. Conservative Andrew Rossindell was not in the slightest bit interested in any trade negotiations. He just wanted to know when Britain would get its old blue passports back. Little things please little minds.</p> <p>Daniel Kawczynski was even more desperate. He begged Davis to stop the EU forming its own army even though we were leaving the EU and would have no say in it one way or the other. It was almost as if the Conservative members of the committee were going out of their way to achieve the impossible: to make Davis look statesmanlike and on top of his brief by acting like half-wits themselves.</p> <p>The only real questioning came from Labour\u2019s Mike Gapes and Mark Hendrick, but Davis was content to go back to default waffle. He may or may not have been speaking in a personal capacity when he had said whatever he had said though he couldn\u2019t be sure he had said it until the prime minister had told him what was happening. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked out some answers,\u201d he offered as belated reassurance. \u201cOnly they\u2019re not the ones to the questions anyone has asked.\u201d</p>",

But, for perspective, that increase brings the median household income up to $56,516 a year, which is about where it was back in 1999. Adjusted for inflation, Americans today are bringing home 2.4% less than they were at the turn of the millennium.

  "<p>This isn\u2019t something that can be said very often, but the NCAA actually got something right for a change. On Monday, the oft-maligned governing body for college sports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/ncaa-north-carolina-anti-lgbt-law-hb2-college-sports\">announced</a> that it would be moving seven events, most notably the opening round of the men\u2019s basketball tournament, out of North Carolina due to the passing of House Bill 2 earlier in the year. The NCAA\u2019s decision comes several months after the NBA made the decision to move the all-star game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/21/nba-moves-all-star-game-charlotte-hb2-law\">from Charlotte</a> to New Orleans. </p> <p>The NCAA made it immediately clear that this was not a move they were making without putting much thought into it. In a <a href=\"http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/ncaa-relocate-championships-north-carolina-2016-17\">detailed press release</a>, the NCAA explained their decision to move all seven events scheduled to take place in North Carolina throughout the 2016-17 academic year. Most of their reasons detail the blatantly discriminatory nature of HB2, which makes it illegal for transgender individuals to use restrooms that differ from the sex on their birth certificate, invalidating local laws that would protect LGBT individuals while effectively legalizing governmental discrimination against them. All in all, it mostly reads as the NCAA taking a praiseworthy stance against LGBT discrimination.<br></p> <p>This is certainly how they\u2019re going to frame this decision, making a particular point in relating it back to their nominal role as an educational institution. NCAA president Mark Emmert, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2016/09/13/mark-emmert-ncaa-north-carolina-hb2-house-bill/90295710/?hootPostID=56f7447cebc8f9785bb9c8c4bebf6db2\">speaking with CBS This Morning</a>, said \u201cthis is an issue to an issue that\u2019s fundamental to higher ed ... Fairness and inclusion are at the heart of what the NCAA does and what universities do. For our university presidents, this was a proverbial no-brainer.\u201d</p> <p>That all sounds nice but the NCAA is, 501c3 nonprofit status notwithstanding, a business organization and, from that perspective, there was probably considerable more debate about this decision. First of all, it could end up damaging their relationship with a region that has been practically synonymous with college basketball for decades: no state has hosted <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/sports/ncaa-moves-championship-events-from-north-carolina.html?_r=0\">more tournament games</a> than North Carolina. While both Duke University and the University of North Carolina have <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/duke-unc-ads-state-support-of-ncaa-in-north-carolina-tourney-ban/\">released statements</a> supporting the NCAA\u2019s decision, they run the risk of alienating a significant percentage of customers.</p> <p>It\u2019s bigger than just North Carolina, though. The NCAA\u2019s announcement comes during a heated political climate dominated by discussions of bigotry and discrimination. Unsurprisingly, this decision has been received quite differently by those on opposite ends of the aisle. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Twitter feed blandly praised the NCAA\u2019s decision:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/775683074747199488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAA\">@NCAA</a> is right to pull tournament games from North Carolina because of the anti-LGBT HB2 law.

It\u2019s encouraging that this ultimately didn\u2019t dictate their decision.</p> <p>But they didn\u2019t make it in a vacuum. After breaking down the numerous ways HB2 was discriminatory and inconsistent with their stated beliefs, the NCAA acknowledges that there was also a logistical aspect at play. It became increasingly difficult to keep the events where they were because \u201cfive states plus numerous cities prohibit travel to North Carolina for public employees \u2026 which could include student-athletes and campus athletic staff.\u201d In other words, the fact that these states (New York, Minnesota, Washington, Vermont, Connecticut) barred government travel to North Carolina in the wake of HB2\u2019s passing forced their hand somewhat. <br></p> <p>It also probably isn\u2019t a coincidence that they made this decision after the NBA announced that it was moving the 2017 all-star game. It\u2019s impossible to imagine the board agreeing to move multiple championships if the NBA had decided it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to relocate a single event. The NCAA also knew that <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2016/04/13/135391/north-carolinas-discriminatory-h-b-2-threatens-more-than-half-billion-dollars-in-economic-activity/\">other businesses</a> had already decided to stop doing business there.<br></p> <p>Basically, every state government, business or organization that made the decision to stay out of North Carolina as long as this discriminatory law was in effect made it that much easier for the NCAA to take this rather drastic step. The hope now, at least for those who believe that applying economic pressure is the most effective way in getting HB2 rewritten or repealed altogether, is that this latest high-profile boycott will embolden others to join in.<br></p> <p>For that reason, the NCAA should be commended for taking a stance against discrimination here. Even if it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d in an ethical sense, it could still end up being a costly one for the NCAA, both in terms of the expense and hassle of actually relocating the events and in terms of the inevitable backlash to come.</p> <p> Of course, they do have plenty of experience in dealing with the latter, the only thing they will have to adjust to is being on the right side of criticism for once.<br></p>",
  "<p>The Football Pools, once a staple of the British Saturday teatime as families crowded around TVs and radios with fingers crossed for eight score draws, is to change hands in a near \u00a3100m deal. <br></p> <p>The National Lottery came close to killing off the pools, but 300,000 people still spend an average of just over \u00a33 a week in the hope of scooping the maximum prize of \u00a33m. </p> <p>The three big pools operators, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters merged between 2000 and 2007.

The pools says it has paid out \u00a33.2bn in prize money to more than 61 million people.<br></p> <p>Players, often in workplace syndicates, filled in paper coupons that they submitted by post or through an agent. The aim of the main game was, and still is, to predict eight score draws, although the pools now has various add-on games. </p> <p>After the harsh winter of 1963, when football matches were scrapped for three weeks running, the \u2018Pools Panel\u2019 was created to predict scores, and such was the intense interest they were broadcast live on BBC television. </p> <p>Robert James, senior lecturer in history at Portsmouth University, said: \u201cThe pools was significant because it gave the working class a sense of identity and community and of aspiration to something better by winning something. </p> <p>\u201cFootball was seen as the working class game and the pools helped give people a sense of community through leisure. They didn\u2019t have to be at the game to debate about it. The pools also helped legitimise gambling because initially gambling was illegal and was done through the bookie\u2019s runner and it was secretive and underhand.\u201d</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"416e30887606a3c2816a2e0572076c71eb51a583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/416e30887606a3c2816a2e0572076c71eb51a583/0_172_2772_1663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers check football pools coupons at the Littlewood\u2019s factory in Liverpool in 1947\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers check football pools coupons at the Littlewood\u2019s site in Liverpool in 1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images/Popperfoto Creative</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rival operations such as Vernons and Zetters sprang up and by the 1980s around one-in-four of the British population were doing the pools.

Combining the three pools was meant to strengthen the game against the National Lottery, which launched in 1994. </p> <p>But the pools struggled against the might of the lottery. It still had 10 million players in 1994, but this fell to 700,000 by 2007 and has halved again since. Sportech said it stabilised earnings in the first half of this year and decided the time was right to sell and focus on its US gaming businesses.</p> <p>Sportech said: \u201cThe board of Sportech believes that the proposed disposal represents an attractive opportunity to realise the value of The Football Pools following the implementation of its modernisation programme.\u201d</p> <p>A new company will float on the stock market after raising funds from investors.

Players select six numbers from 1 to 59 (previously it was 49) or pick Lucky Dip. Its other games include EuroMillions and Thunderball. Colin and Chris Weir from the Scottish town of Largs won \u00a3161m on EuroMillions in 2011, making them the biggest lottery winners in Europe. However, the price of a EuroMillions ticket will rise from \u00a32 to \u00a32.50 on 24 September.</p> <p><strong>People\u2019s postcode lottery</strong></p> <p>A charity lottery where, for \u00a310 a month, you use your postcode to try to win prizes. It claims that since 2005 players have raised more than \u00a3142m for charities and community projects. The most a single ticket can win is 10% of the draw revenue, up to a maximum of \u00a3400,000. Of every \u00a31 spent, a minimum of 30p goes to charity, 40p is used for prizes and 30p is used to cover the expenses in running the lotteries. In 2016 it expects to raise more than \u00a340m for charity. Novamedia, the parent company of People\u2019s Postcode Lottery, operates similar schemes in the Netherlands and Sweden.</p> <p><strong>The health lottery</strong></p> <p>This is not a national lottery: it\u2019s 51 local society lotteries, each representing one or more local authority areas across Britain, aimed at raising money for health-related good causes. Each local society lottery takes turns at participating. It costs \u00a31 to play each line, and there are 32,000 participating retailers, or it can be played online. Twenty pence in every \u00a31 goes to support good causes. The top prize, for matching five numbers, is equal to 10% of total ticket sales, capped at \u00a3100,000. Projects that receive funding include support for older people to keep fit, respite programmes to give carers a break, and healthy living initiatives.</p> <p><strong>Premium bonds</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/02/unhappy-returns-nsi-cuts-premium-bond-prizes\">Celebrated their 60th birthday</a> earlier this year \u2013 Harold Macmillan announced their launch on 17 April 1956.

After qualifying in medicine from the <a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/the_johns_hopkins_hospital/\" title=\"\">Johns Hopkins hospital</a> in Baltimore and receiving a master\u2019s in public health from the <a href=\"http://www.berkeley.edu/\" title=\"\">University of California at Berkeley</a>, he was employed by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" title=\"\">US Centers for Disease Control</a> (CDC). This was a time when those in the fight against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/malaria\" title=\"\">malaria</a> could celebrate considerable success, such as the eradication of disease from southern Europe, but were confronting significant challenges elsewhere, including concerns about the persistence of DDT in the environment and resistance to insecticides and antimalarial medicines.</p> <p>After an initial posting to El Salvador, Harrison moved to the <a href=\"http://www.uonbi.ac.ke/\" title=\"\">University of Nairobi</a>, where he founded a new CDC research station. He gained a solid grounding in both the technical and, arguably more importantly, political challenges involved in eradicating malaria. He would later move to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organisation\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation</a> in Geneva and back to CDC, where he became head of its parasitic diseases branch.</p> <p>By the early 1990s he was ready for a move to academia and became dean of the <a href=\"http://www.sph.tulane.edu/\" title=\"\">Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine</a> in New Orleans. Later in the 1990s, as dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, he led a major expansion in the school\u2019s activities.</p> <p>His time overseas had convinced him that schools of public health in northern countries would have to reach out to students who would never be able to find the time or resources to come to them. He initiated an ambitious distance learning programme that since its inception has trained more than 8,000 health professionals from more than 130 countries.</p> <p>Harrison also recognised the need for new approaches to the many complex challenges facing global health, including climate change, mass migration, conflict and political and economic transition. He encouraged the development of research centres that broke down the traditional barriers between disciplines and connected researchers with policymakers.</p> <p>After London, he returned to Washington to lead the US <a href=\"http://www.aspph.org/\" title=\"\">Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health</a>, applying many of the same principles that had been so successful in London. Harrison published more than 100 scientific papers and received many honours.</p> <p>He was found dead from stab wounds at the home he shared with his family. One of his sons has been charged with his murder. He is survived by his wife, Christine, and two sons.</p>",

Mike Ashley says he is committed to making conditions better for staff at Shirebrook. If he means what he says, he could start by cutting his ties with Transline Group who have not been candid or credible in their evidence to the Business Committee and, as we heard in our evidence sessions, have deducted money from low-paid workers without proper explanation and justification.

  "<h2><strong>Decca Aitkenhead: </strong><strong>\u2018Andy taught me a secret that very few students had been taught\u2019 </strong></h2> <p>In 1989, when I sat history A-level, had anyone asked me what I would remember about Andy Pickering\u2019s lessons, I would have given the wrong answer. The syllabus covered Tudors and Stuarts, the Reformation and so on, and the big question preoccupying my classmates and me was: \u201cWhen did people begin to stop believing in God?\u201d We simply couldn\u2019t get our secular minds around the idea that it hadn\u2019t occurred to anyone to be an atheist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f53bf5cec29cce936042a403affaa61045828ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f53bf5cec29cce936042a403affaa61045828ccd/0_1211_3024_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Decca Aitkenhead at school, in the sixth-form common room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Decca Aitkenhead at school, in the sixth-form common room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while I was busy badgering Andy to explain how atheism came about, I failed to notice that he was teaching me a skill I would use every single day of my life. Andy taught me how to approach an essay not as an opportunity to demonstrate how many facts I\u2019d managed to memorise, but as an exercise in presenting competing arguments. I learned how to devise two or more interpretations of a historical narrative, and to test them against each other in order to arrive at a conclusion. Andy didn\u2019t \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\">Michael Gove</a> might assume \u2013 teach me that facts were unimportant. On the contrary, I quickly learned that a thesis unsubstantiated by factual evidence would be marked an automatic fail. Instead, Andy taught me to identify salient facts, and deploy them to maximum effect to justify an argument. It was a total revelation.</p> <p>At university I discovered that this was a secret very few, even those from elite private schools, had been taught. When I landed an internship at my first newspaper, the editor asked me to create a new daily feature \u2013 The Big Debate \u2013 presenting two contradictory arguments about issues of the day, such as euthanasia or foxhunting and so on. \u201cBut this is easy!\u201d I remember thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s just what Andy taught me!\u201d It was on the strength of The Big Debate\u2019s success that my career in journalism began.</p> <p>I have been a journalist for more than 20 years now, and can still detect Andy\u2019s teaching in every single column, feature and interview I have ever written.</p> <h2><strong>Decca\u2019s teacher </strong><strong>Andy Pickering</strong></h2> <p><em>Programme manager, Strode College in partnership with Plymouth University</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"88b134e9fa4d0ab28c35569e9b885ce95c62aab0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88b134e9fa4d0ab28c35569e9b885ce95c62aab0/0_43_962_931/500.jpg\" alt=\"Decca Aitkenhead\u2019s history teacher, Andrew Pickering.\" width=\"500\" height=\"484\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Decca Aitkenhead\u2019s history teacher, Andrew Pickering.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember Decca \u2013 or Jessica, as she was known to the staff \u2013 as attentive and hard-working, and seeming to enjoy the challenge of making sense of obscure primary sources and unpicking historians\u2019 arguments. She didn\u2019t know it, but we were both learning the craft of being an effective student of history at the same time. They didn\u2019t worry over-much about methodology in school history classes when I was at school in the 1970s \u2013 we were crammed with facts and expected to devise our own ways of explaining them in exams. If they taught the rigorous science of analysis and the subtle art of interpretation at university in the early 80s, these passed me by. I remember, at this very early stage in my career, working hard at finding a formula for resolving the tricky business of planning and writing top-notch history essays. What I learned along the way, through the deconstruction of quality history writing, I passed on to Decca and her classmates. I have been trying to do the same for her successors ever since.</p> <h2><strong>Owen Jones: </strong><strong>\u2018I was a cocky git so I appreciated his no-nonsense attitude\u2019 </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"467e6bade699a208ed478a5453a1baa002584183\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/467e6bade699a208ed478a5453a1baa002584183/0_6_482_289/482.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Jones with a friend on his last day of school before sixth form.\" width=\"482\" height=\"289\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Jones with a friend on his last day of school before sixth form.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have always needed a bit of tough love. History was the subject I loved most, and went on to study at university. That ambition hung by a thread, though, when I spectacularly messed up my history AS exam. I was in my first year at Ridge Danyers sixth-form college in Stockport. In what can only be described as abject stupidity, I -misread the instructions and failed to answer two questions from the same section, thereby -failing the entire exam. I remember two creeping senses: panic, and a desire to punch myself in the face repeatedly. The college \u2013 with the support of my history teacher, Andy Dixon \u2013 wanted me to apply to Oxford University. A failed history exam was going to make that difficult. I plucked up the courage to tell him, and the response was curt: \u201cOh, you stupid bloody idiot!\u201d</p> <p>Andy Dixon was a blunt, but inspiring history teacher. As an argumentative so-and-so, it was an ideal subject for debating and discussing ideas, and that\u2019s what he nurtured. He encouraged my fascination with subjects such as the Spanish civil war and helped me put my beliefs in a broader historical context and understanding. I could be a cocky little git, so I appreciated his no-nonsense attitude. Fortunately, he helped explain to Oxford my screw-up, so I made it in the end. I\u2019ve ended up where I am today \u2013 for good or for ill \u2013 thanks to the efforts of teachers like Andy.</p> <h2><strong>Owen\u2019s teacher Andy Dixon</strong><br></h2> <p><em>Semi-retired history teacher</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7a444b420a078f9303ea53eb1c3ed7c5b72b484e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a444b420a078f9303ea53eb1c3ed7c5b72b484e/0_224_1936_1162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dixon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Jones\u2019s school teacher, Andy Dixon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Owen\u2019s fresh-faced looks made him appear younger than his contemporaries, but his total lack of reticence made him stand out as a confident, able and opinionated student. Owen did not fit into any standard category of A-level student. Perhaps surprisingly, he chose not to study A-level politics. Owen\u2019s political standpoint was obvious, but this did not prevent him making genuine friendships with lots of students with different views, or none. He was never on the educational conveyor belt, but was open to ideas, debates and arguments. Having Owen in a class meant there was never any shortage of argument. Debates about history and politics continued after the end of lessons. On one occasion, I had a very truncated lunch break due to an interminable argument about the role of Stalinism in the defeat of the Spanish Republic. He showed no deference to teachers, and a colleague had to ask Owen to leave a lesson because his \u201clively interventions\u201d were too disruptive of the learning of other students. He was enough of a conformist to always sit in the same seat in my lessons \u2013 although it was at the back!</p> <h2><strong>Hadley Freeman: </strong><strong>\u2018An easy option I was not.

It is no surprise that he persuaded me to come to his school, Cambridge Centre for Sixth-form Studies (CCSS): he was enthusiastic, laidback, inspiring, friendly, and, as a bonus, he had a Scottish accent that I thought exotic and my mother found impenetrable. Far more puzzling is why he agreed to take me on. I was not, to put it mildly, a promising prospect. I had just left hospital for the last time after eight admissions over a three-year period due to severe anorexia nervosa and I was, at this point, riddled with neuroses and enormously time-consuming OCDs, as well as being still pretty underweight. An easy option I was not. But I think Charlie has a soft spot for lost causes, and I wanted to keep up with my school year. So, having taken my GCSEs in a three-month crammer course while in hospital, I now needed to do my A-levels in a year, which is what CCSS offered.<br></p> <p>Like many people with anorexia, I was an obsessive student, chanelling my anxieties into my studies. But whereas some teachers would encourage that, Charlie wasn\u2019t having any of it. He encouraged me to think of my studies as fun, a heretofore unconsidered concept. But more than that, he urged me to do more than just study. He would casually let me know when a movie or play he thought I\u2019d like was on in town, and he suggested I start writing for myself, not just to do well in my A-Levels. In short, he told me to stop taking everything so seriously while also telling me to have more confidence in myself. I didn\u2019t entirely succeed in either but I still, 20 years on, remember his lessons. Only the best kind of teacher can get you to do that.</p> <h2><strong>Hadley\u2019s teacher Charlie Ritchie</strong><br></h2> <p><em>English teacher, Cambridge Centre for Sixth-form Studies </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e87cd0f2913e175ab4b9a83d3ff0b6e6b6805452\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e87cd0f2913e175ab4b9a83d3ff0b6e6b6805452/0_989_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hadley Freeman\u2019s school teacher Charlie Ritchie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hadley Freeman\u2019s English teacher, Charlie Ritchie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hadley was in my English group, where we went from Chaucer to Heaney in three fast-and-furious terms. My favourite kind of teaching. No time to hang about, but complete freedom to energise the texts in any way that would work for the pupils. I honestly remember smiling halfway through Hamlet with her class thinking \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m getting paid for this?\u201d</p> <p>Hadley was very focused, hardworking, and kept her own counsel, but in a small-group interaction she was equally gracious, funny and generous with the quite diverse mix of personalities involved (including mine). She was, of course, gifted and skilful in her writing, but her personal voice \u201coccasionally tended to the implicit\u201d as the examiners say, and when someone is already working flat out (and not necessarily in rude health), it is hard to ask them for more. One time I had to, and will not forget her waiting outside school as I came in at 8.30am. I knew what she had to say, and I knew what I had to say, and I knew we would be fine. A witty and genuine interlocutor, and a frail wee soul in a cold car park. With tough skills.</p> <h2><strong>Lola Okolosie: </strong><strong>\u2018You were expected to expel the waffle and have your own response\u2019 </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b97063497c8ed5f6f2a2f3a7025e88569396c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b97063497c8ed5f6f2a2f3a7025e88569396c91/0_320_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lola Okolosie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lola Okolosie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fiona Shaw/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of us will remember one teacher in particular. We carry vivid images of their gait and can recall the way in which they held a room. At their very best, they can be the most captivating of professionals. For me, it was Mrs Jones, my A-level English literature teacher, who had a huge impact on my school life.<br></p> <p>I was all set for studying sociology but Mrs Jones\u2019 lessons made me reconsider. There was her glamour and sense of style. With the red lipstick and chunky jewellery, she stood out, and made learning English in the tiny attic room we were allocated cool.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79750/dead-poets-society\">Dead Poet\u2019s Society</a>. We weren\u2019t her little lambs and that was what made her lessons so much fun. You were expected to expel the waffle and come to her with your own individual responses. My Nigerian upbringing, of adults being right and children being seen and not heard, hadn\u2019t really prepared me for accepting that my thoughts were valid, all by themselves.</p> <p>Mrs Jones inspired me because she resisted treating us like children. At times it felt a little bruising, but then the knowledge that she expected the absolute best from you made you believe you were, in some way, capable of it. By the time I began my undergraduate degree it felt like an anti-climax, we seemed to be covering old ground, well worn at sixth form. She collapsed the sense of distance that shrouds literary giants, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shakespeare\">Shakespeare</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnkeats\">Keats</a>, and made them seem as much ours as anyone elses.</p> <h2><strong>Lola\u2019s teacher Karen Jones</strong></h2> <p><em>Former assistant head at Ilkley grammar school<br></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"00f2e74f00be554dc78dff86d661cc092dd11d64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00f2e74f00be554dc78dff86d661cc092dd11d64/0_73_1136_682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lola Okolosie\u2019s English teacher, Karen Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lola Okolosie\u2019s English teacher, Karen Jones</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I still have all my notes on from the days when I taught Lola\u2019s group. Nowadays, all my lessons are electronically presented and stored on a hard drive but, perhaps rather quaintly, I have kept everything from that era. For these people were a special bunch: the sort of class you remember because you could recognise their potential; the sort of students who make the job worthwhile \u2013 the reason you came into teaching.</p> <p>We were timetabled to have our lessons in a tiny, dusty room with funny little seats that had swivel tables attached. It felt like a university seminar room. Our view looked out onto the school\u2019s front lawn and we could see Ilkley moor beyond. Looking through my papers now, I can see that I played on the undergraduate vibe: we spent ages talking, arguing and discussing and Lola loved to wrestle with the texts before writing her essays in her inimitable handwriting. I always tried to encourage her to be confident in developing her own responses and I enjoyed seeing what she made of the ideas. It was a privilege to teach her.</p> <h2><strong>Nosheen Iqbal: </strong><strong>\u2018I was in awe. So were the other teachers. So was my mum\u2019 </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a68bd70e981527f8d86e192b729ac70cd69e8631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a68bd70e981527f8d86e192b729ac70cd69e8631/0_40_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nosheen Iqbal and her media studies teacher, Malcolm Ellison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nosheen Iqbal and her media studies teacher, Malcolm Ellison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Media studies is, as snide cliche goes, a complete doss. The Mickey Mouse of A-levels where you actually get to, well, study Mickey Mouse\u2019s place in contemporary culture, or something. Except, one thing: Mr Ellison.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of a single teacher from my averagely rough comprehensive who has had such a profound effect on so many of my friends. Some, without even having directly taught them. But Mr Ellison was also the vice-principal of our now-defunct school on the edge of Peterborough and his classroom time was limited. We considered ourselves lucky to be his first test batch wading through a roll-call of French thinkers \u2013 Barthes, Baudrillard, Bataille \u2013 and applying Italian Marxist theory to our poncey breaktime chat about EastEnders.</p> <p>That was the real point, in any case: being taught to truly think. To be original. Given that he commanded so much authority and respect, it\u2019s funny that one of the things I remember most is his influence in making me question both. He taught us the history of rebellion: mods, rockers, punks, commies, hackers. When William Hague, then newly elected leader of the Conservative party, helicoptered in to make a visit to the school, rumour went round that lefty, motorcycling Mr Ellison refused to shake his hand.</p> <p>I was in awe. So were the other teachers. So was my mum. My parents were inordinately strict about my post-school social life, trading it for a liberal indulgence in all the music, films and books I could cram in my room. But a Mr Ellison-sanctioned excuse to go off and earnestly report from a local farmer\u2019s fair, make prototype podcasts on a four track or crappy fanzines was never questioned. I don\u2019t remotely doubt it\u2019s why I ended up where I did.</p> <h2><strong>Nosheen\u2019s teacher: Malcolm Ellison</strong><br></h2> <p><em>Vice-principal, Stanground College</em></p> <p>Nosheen was a star among a small cluster of stars in my first media studies cohort at Stanground College. It was a fun class to be in.<br></p> <p>She was always keen to engage in discussion and \u2013 at GCSE level, and even more so at A-level \u2013 Nosheen grasped complex ideas quickly. However, she never simply accepted these ideas, but would often test them out with comments such as: \u201cOK. But what if ...\u201d</p> <p>Nosheen dealt with theory confidently, but she really lit up when it came to practical work, becoming absorbed in it and going beyond what was required. She simply loved getting stuck in.</p> <p>From the start, she was passionately interested in popular culture, especially the music industry, and was a true asset in lessons. She would bring her knowledge to bear on the topic under discussion and enrich it with current and real-world examples.</p> <p>Was there ever a downside? Well, occasionally, she would need an extension to an essay deadline, but I\u2019m sure she has no such problem these days.</p> <h2><strong>Paula Cocozza: </strong><strong>\u2018One lesson was spent asking how we knew we existed\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"189a4105c9ae723d7beedda592f3e58248ff66fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/189a4105c9ae723d7beedda592f3e58248ff66fd/0_172_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Cocozza with her English teacher, Ges Hartley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Cocozza with her English teacher, Ges Hartley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He would enter the room swinging a briefcase, which he often slammed on the desk with a moody thud. The class bristled with expectation and dread. You never knew what you were going to get with Mr Hartley. He demanded concentration. Once, he stood on his desk and watched us file in, remaining statuesque long after we took our seats. Another time, he sang Elvis. It was rumoured that he had extended his coffee mug to the author of a disappointing essay, held his gaze, daring him to act, and when he didn\u2019t, let it smash on the floor.</p> <p>In his classes we hovered on the edge of adulthood. One lesson was spent investigating how we knew we existed. The question seemed to us idiotic. But Mr Hartley rebuffed all our proofs and, when the bell rang, we trudged out wearily, as if we had fought for our lives. That was our introduction to Descartes. He told us about Freud. \u201cIf Paula had a bad arm,\u201d he begun, \u201cFreud would say\u2026.\u201d Mercifully, he thought better of that one; the sentence was left hanging.</p> <p>Most of all, he gave me a love of books. I carried his reading list \u2013 typed over two sides of A4 \u2013 for years from the age of 12, the paper felting and furring as I ticked off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jdsalinger\">JD Salinger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/thomashardy\">Thomas Hardy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnsteinbeck\">John Steinbeck</a>. They were names I heard nowhere else. Ours was not a reading household, beyond the Avon catalogue (which I loved) and the Sun. But now I would stop at the library on my way home. I was spending more time alone with a book, but I felt so much less alone. My family had always veered towards work rather than education, and as my GCSEs approached I began to consider which apprenticeship to apply for. But books had taken hold and I enrolled instead for A-levels at the local sixth form. Mr Hartley unlocked worlds for me. I sidestepped the future.</p> <p>He left soon after, for a deputy headship elsewhere. On his last day, he handed us each a photocopied homemade card: a sketch of school with the Sussex downs behind. Inside was a limerick about \u201ca teacher in Goring / whose lessons were all very boring\u201d \u2013 and a note. Mine ended with the words \u201cand thanks for being you\u201d. At the time, I didn\u2019t even know I was me, but a door seemed to open right then to a different life.</p> <h2><strong>Paula\u2019s teacher Ges Hartley, head of English, Chatsmore Catholic high school, Worthing</strong></h2> <p>Paula had an intellectual hunger that was sufficient to command respect among her sometimes more verbally ostentatious and more physically dominant peers. She was quiet, but not intimidated. I am sure that I am not the only teacher of English who would, having collected in a mound of creative-writing assignments, surreptitiously ensure that, when marking commenced, at the bottom of the pile there would be something to savour. So that was the regular location of Paula\u2019s writings. Did I think I would have such a lasting impact on her? No. Does anybody? I wanted to influence her and others at the time, to develop a passion for learning, for thinking, for creativity; and you hope that will endure<br></p> <p>\u2022 Is there a teacher you\u2019ll always remember?

Indeed, some city mayors have actually already initiated their own versions of #catsnotads (see Tehran, below). </p> <p>Most of the time, however, advertising takeovers are the result of concerned citizen initiatives.

The shelters were all owned by JC Decaux, one of the world\u2019s largest outdoor advertising companies, and an official sponsor of COP21. Ads from official sponsors including Air France and GDF were swapped out with posters designed to <a href=\"https://streetartnews.net/2015/11/brandalism-600-ad-takeovers-in-paris.html\">make a statement</a> about greenwashing and the hypocrisy of many of the sponsor companies. \u201cWe knew about the impact of fossil fuels but publicly denied it \u2013 Mobil,\u201d read one advert. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry that we got caught \u2013 Volkswagen,\u201d read another.

  "<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency on Tuesday night condemned the hacking of a confidential database by a Russian cyber-espionage group which leaked the personal files of several top American athletes, including the tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams and the gymnast Simone Biles, and promised that it would soon publish \u201csensational proof\u201d of famous athletes taking doping substances.</p> <p>Documents published on the Fancy Bear website appeared to show that Serena Williams had taken the restricted drugs prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisone, hydromorphone and oxycodone between 2010 and 2015, while her sister Venus had taken prednisone, prednisolone, triamcinolone and formoterol. Biles, meanwhile, was given methylphenidate for attention-deficit disorder. In all cases, however, Wada confirmed that the athletes had committed no offence because they had been granted therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) by the relevant international sports federations and national anti-doping organisations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/wada-hackers-athletes-drug-testing-information\">Wada targeted by hackers seeking athletes' drug testing data</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The International Olympic Committee said it \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d the cyber attack which it said was \u201cclearly aimed at tarnishing the reputation of clean athletes\u201d and confirmed the athletes mentioned had not violated any anti-doping rules during the Rio Olympics.</p> <p>Venus Williams said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that her medical data has been \u201ccompromised by hackers and published without \u2026 permission\u201d. She said in a statement: \u201cI have followed the rules established under the Tennis Anti-Doping Program in applying for, and being granted, \u2018therapeutic use exemptions\u2019. The applications for TUEs under the Tennis Anti-Doping Program require a strict process of approval which I have adhered to when serious medical conditions have occurred.\u201d The 36-year-old added she was \u201cone of the strongest supporters of maintaining the highest level of integrity in competitive sport\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking about Biles, Steve Penny, president of USA Gymnastics, said: \u201cSimone has filed the proper paperwork per Usada and Wada requirements and there is no violation. The International Gymnastics Federation, the United States Olympic Committee and Usada have confirmed this.\u201d</p> <p>Biles added in a short statement on her Twitter page: \u201cI have ADHD and I have taken medicine for it since I was a kid. Please know, I believe in clean sport, have always followed the rules, and will continue to do so as fair play is critical to sport and is very important to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Simone_Biles/status/775785767855611905\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Having ADHD, and taking medicine for it is nothing to be ashamed of nothing that I&#39;m afraid to let people know.</p>&mdash; Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Simone_Biles/status/775785767855611905\">September 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/13/wada-russian-cyber-attack-espionage-group\">Wada admitted that the hackers had gained access</a> to its Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (Adams) database via a phishing attack using an International Olympic Committee created account for the Rio 2016 Games. Its director general, Olivier Niggli, insisted he \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d the violation and was \u201cvery conscious of the threat that it represents to athletes whose confidential information has been divulged through this criminal act\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWada condemns these ongoing cyber attacks that are being carried out in an attempt to undermine Wada and the global anti-doping system. Wada has been informed by law enforcement authorities that these attacks are originating out of Russia. Let it be known that these criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia further to the outcomes of the Agency\u2019s independent McLaren Investigation Report.\u201d</p> <p>The attack raises worrying questions for athletes\u2019 privacy as well as Wada\u2019s security systems. Last month Yuliya Stepanova \u2013 the key whistleblower for Wada\u2019s Independent Pound Commission that exposed widespread doping in Russian athletics \u2013 had her password for Adams illegally obtained. However, Wada insisted it was taking the attack seriously and was working with law-enforcement agencies to protect itself and its athletes from being hacked.</p> <p>Several figures in the anti-doping community told the Guardian they believed the hack was not only a retaliation against Wada, which published a scathing report on the Russian government\u2019s vast cover\u2011up of doping during the Sochi Winter Games in 2014, but also an attempt by the Russian authorities to persuade their own people that the problems in their country were just as bad elsewhere. Some of the strongest criticism came from Travis Tygaart, the head of Usada, who called the cyber attacks \u201ccowardly and despicable\u201d and reiterated that the athletes named had done nothing wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable that in the Olympic movement, hackers would illegally obtain confidential medical information in an attempt to smear athletes to make it look as if they have done something wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe athletes haven\u2019t. In fact, in each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication. The cyber-bullying of innocent athletes being engaged in by these hackers is cowardly and despicable. It is time for the entire international community to stand up and condemn this cyber attack on clean sport and athletes\u2019 rights.\u201d</p> <p>But Fancy Bear, which has links to its country\u2019s security agency GRU and has previously been accused of defacing Wada\u2019s website, accessing the private whereabouts details of Stepanova, and hacking into the Democratic National Committee, promised it would release more information in the coming weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/13/four-russian-athletes-sanctioned-ioc-failed-drugs-tests\">Four more Russian athletes sanctioned by IOC for failed drugs tests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are going to tell you how Olympic medals are won,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hacked World Anti-Doping Agency databases and were shocked with what we saw. We will start with the US team which disgraced itself by tainted victories. We will also disclose exclusive information about other national Olympic teams later. Wait for sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substance any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the British javelin thrower Goldie Sayers and the GB men\u2019s 4x400m relay team found out on Tuesday night that their fourth places at the 2008 Beijing Olympics would be upgraded to bronze after official confirmation that their Russian rivals have retrospectively failed drug tests.</p> <p>The IOC confirmed that the javelin silver medallist Mariya Abakumova and the 400m runner Denis Alexeev, a member of the bronze medal-winning relay team, had tested positive for the banned substance dehydrochlormethyltestosterone at the Games following the retesting of their samples earlier this year and as a result been disqualified and ordered to return their medals.</p> <p>The entire Russian relay team have been disqualified as a result of Alexeev\u2019s doping, meaning the British squad of Andrew Steele, Robert Tobin, Michael Bingham and Martyn Rooney will move up from fourth place. The IOC also announced that Inga Abitova, who finished sixth in the 10,000m in Beijing, had also failed a retrospective drug test, as has the cyclist Ekaterina Gnidenko, who finished eighth in the keirin at London 2012.</p>",
  "<p>Each year, I look so forward to Eid Al Adha \u2013 the holiest holiday for Muslims worldwide \u2013 but not this year. As I watched my daughters prepare for the celebrations with joy, I learned of a horrific crime. A 36-year-old woman dressed in traditional garb was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/muslim-woman-set-on-firenew-york-police-search\">set on fire</a> on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. She was the same age as me, walking in the city where I was born and raised. This comes at the heels of two Muslim women in Brooklyn who were <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-Attacks-2-Muslim-Women-Tries-to-Rip-Their-Hijabs-off-393012361.html\">physically assaulted</a> by a woman as they pushed their babies in strollers.</p> <p>As if this news wasn\u2019t enough, we also learned that a mosque in Fort Pierce, Florida, which Omar Mateen reportedly used to visit, had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/12/mosque-fire-arson-orlando-shooter-video\">set on fire</a>. They had to cancel their planned holiday celebrations as a result. How could I enjoy the day without thinking of them? Instead of celebrating as planned, the community in Florida has to explain to their children why someone would intentionally set their place of worship, their sanctuary, on fire the night before the highest holy holiday.</p> <p>These horrific acts follow the execution style murders of an imam and his assistant in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/imam-maulama-akonjee-fatal-shooting-new-york-muslim-community-funeral-thara-uddin\">Ozone Park</a>, and the stabbing of a 60-year old Muslim woman in Queens. These are only the stories that make the headlines. I don\u2019t think we know the extent of the impact, trauma and pain of Muslim communities nationwide.</p> <p>Muslim Americans found themselves caught in a conversation about how close Eid Al Adha was to the 15th anniversary of 9/11. Pundits wondered whether Muslims would alter their annual Eid celebrations for sensitivity purposes. This insinuation both disappointed and outraged me. Muslims, like any other faith community, deserve to be Muslim, and celebrate their high holy holidays. We would never ask that of any other faith community and it should never be asked or implied to Muslim Americans. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/12/mosque-fire-arson-orlando-shooter-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52yep\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2712283\"            data-video-name=\"Fire at mosque of Orlando shooter may be arson, say police \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/NBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d6cfcee4b013613fffc869\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/12/160912orlando2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/12/160912orlando2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11872644&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/12/mosque-fire-arson-orlando-shooter-video\">Fire at mosque of Orlando shooter may be arson, say police</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Muslim American communities are facing the most hostile civic and political environment since days, weeks and months after 9/11. Hate crimes against Muslims or those perceived to be Muslim has risen exponentially in the last year. All people of faith, Muslims included, should be able to practice their religion freely without fear and intimidation. Bigotry against Muslims has become the norm and often has no consequences. The irresponsible and rhetorical vilification of Muslims in this current election cycle is leading to violent acts against members of a faith community and it must stop. </p> <p>It is time for all Americans to speak out. When we allow one faith community to be targets then we open the doors for others to be targeted. I believe the worst is yet to come unless more people actively intervene with their voices, their votes and in public acts of solidarity with their Muslim neighbors. In a time of growing tensions we must uphold our fundamental freedom to worship in the land of religious freedom and its why I choose to be unapologetically Muslim every day. As a Muslim woman, not only is wearing my religious headscarf in public an act of faith, but it has become an act of courage. </p>",

Political inequality will be hard wired into the composition of the House of Commons.</p> <p>Take, for example, the difference between young and old. Nearly all (96%) of over 65s are on the register \u2013 just under two-thirds (65%) of 18-19 year olds are. This means that the boundaries will be drawn to give elder citizens more representation at the cost of younger citizens.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d7db06e4b013613fffccd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T11:01:47.017Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are two boundary commission articles worth reading.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-the-loser-in-musical-chairs-wwqckbz67\">Lewis Baston in the Times (subscription) says Labour will lose out most from the boundary changes.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, Labour are probably down by about 25 seats in England and Wales, with the Conservatives net losers by about 10 seats.

In Bristol West 82,067 voters are given the same democratic right as nearby Bath, with just 60,966 voters, while seats such as Arfon in Wales (37,739) are judged the democratic equal of north-west Cambridgeshire (89,991).</p> <p>Current boundaries are drawn up on data that in many cases dates back to 2000. By 2020, if we continue to rely on such out of date figures, then MPs will be representing seats woefully out of step with modern demographic changes.

The government wants to cut the size of the House of Commons from 650 MPs to 600 MPs and today we are getting draft plans for new boundaries for England and Wales. Labour is said to be overrepresented in the current House of Commons, on the basis of the number of voters per Labour constituency compared to number of voters per Conservative constituency, and if the changes are actually implemented, the Conservatives will almost certainly benefit. But the \u201cif\u201d is important. The Tories tried, and failed, to implement boundary changes in the last parliament and it is quite possible that rebel Tory MPs, unhappy about the prospect of losing their seats, could block the process again.</p> <p>Partly this is a story about electoral politics, and the way the voting system impacts on the Conservative/Labour battle. But redrawing boundaries means MPs end up fighting colleagues from the same party for the right to represent the new and most winnable constituencies. This is never an easy process at the best of times, but it poses a particular challenge for Labour, where some grassroots activists are looking for an opportunity to purge MPs disloyal to Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Here is our splash on the story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/corbyn-johnson-and-osborne-among-mps-hit-by-electoral-shakeup\">Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson and George Osborne among MPs hit by boundary shakeup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here you can read more details of the proposals in full.</p> <ul> <li>Here is <a href=\"http://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/2018-boundary-review-initial-proposals-launched/\">the press notice from the Boundary Commission for England. </a>And here is <a href=\"http://www.bce2018.org.uk/\">the consultation page, </a>where you can find details of the proposals constituency by constituency.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Here is<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37338042\"> a guide to the plans for Wales.</a> And here is <a href=\"http://bcomm-wales.gov.uk/?lang=en\">the Boundary Commission for Wales website.</a></li> </ul> <p>The plans for Northern Ireland were <a href=\"https://www.boundarycommission.org.uk/news\">published by the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland last week.</a> And <a href=\"http://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/\">the Boundary Commission for Scotland</a> is due to publish its proposals in October.</p> <p>Labour has been criticising the plans mainly on the grounds that they are not based on the most up-to-date electoral registration figures.

Instead, Herzog gives everyone a strange case of verbal diarrhoea. Shortly after being shown to her hostage quarters, Somerfeld takes a selfie with her tablet to check her appearance. \u201cLaura, you look a mess,\u201d she says to no one in the room. Ferres isn\u2019t a bad actor, but Herzog does her no favours by having her commit so wholeheartedly to a tin-eared script that boasts nary a flicker of nuance to help ground her journey.</p> <p>Shannon gets it even worse, saddled with airy musings only someone like Herzog, with his oft-imitated cadence, can sell. His best howler: \u201cTruth is the only daughter of time.\u201d Shannon strains to add weight to the dialogue, often yelling his lines, much as he did in Man of Steel to numbing effect.</p> <p>Salt and Fire eventually moves from the compound to the otherworldly landscape of the immense Uyuni salt flats, where Riley takes Somerfeld to argue that the formations she was assigned to examine are expanding so rapidly that they\u2019ll soon engulf the whole world. </p> <p>The development, while a tad overcooked, gives rise to the film\u2019s strongest section that mostly dispenses with chatter. Riley strands Somerfeld, along with two young blind boys, on a cactus island in the midst of the salt flats, leaving them to fend for themselves for no apparent reason. </p> <p>Herzog and cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger capture their most spectacular scenery since collaborating on<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/24/encounters-at-the-end-of-the-world-documentary-review\"> Encounters at the End of the World</a> (2007), which took them to Antarctica. The awesome terrain goes a long way to detract from the inertness of what came before, as does the finale which comes out of left field and features a sight gag both lighthearted and patently absurd given all that\u2019s transpired.

These are the norms that cause the underrepresentation of <a href=\"http://www.iop.org/publications/iop/2013/closingdoors/\">girls studying physics</a> at A-level and boys taking up careers in <a href=\"https://www.nursingtimes.net/why-are-there-so-few-men-in-nursing/849269.article\">nursing</a>. These norms mean that girls get teased for playing sport, an allegedly \u201cmasculine\u201d pursuit. These same norms feed into the idea that girls\u2019 bodies are inherently sexual and enticing to boys and men, who cannot control their desires.</p> <p>As educators, we have an important role in building cultures of consent and respect among our students. Here are three simple steps you can take in your classroom:<br></p> <h2>Challenge sexist language</h2> <p>When you hear a sexist comment, don\u2019t think of it as a drain on your subject teaching time, but a useful teachable moment. I\u2019ve certainly been guilty of responding with a cursory \u201cPlease don\u2019t use that language in my classroom\u201d, suggesting that the comment is mildly offensive and inconsequential, or \u2013 worse \u2013 not allowed within the formal teaching environment, but acceptable elsewhere. </p> <p>Blaming and shaming young people for saying such things only encourages them to say it in private, it doesn\u2019t stop it from happening. Instead, see these comments as opportunities to engage students in critical thinking: explore what was said, and why. This approach allows you to bring learning to all students in the class.</p> <p>Questions could include:<br></p> <ul> <li>What made you say that?<br></li> <li>Do you think it\u2019s true?<br></li> <li>Is there any evidence that it may not be the case?<br></li> <li>What do you think the consequences are of saying what you\u2019ve said?</li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/20/six-best-sex-education-programmes-around-the-world\">Six of the best sex education programmes around the world</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Deal with causes, not consequences</h2> <p>Imagine you are a headteacher and you are told that two boys sexually harassed a girl while they were all playing sport at lunchtime. What do you do? You could ban the mixed playing of sport going forward. This is a common response.<br></p> <p>But the root of the issue is not that the girls and boys were playing sport together. The problem was that, in this scenario, boys touched a girl non-consensually. Treating the symptom rather than the cause does not create a safe learning environment or healthy relationships. So what could be done instead?</p> <p>You need to engage the students responsible in a frank discussion about their behaviour. Help them to understand why what they did was harmful. <a href=\"http://www.rasasc.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Young-People-I-Heart-Consent-workshopsback-and-front.pdf\">Ensure that they understand the meaning of consent</a>.<br></p> <p>As for the victim of the harassment: it is imperative that they receive a clear message from staff that what happened was not their fault. They did not provoke the behaviour. They are not to blame.<br></p> <p>Your own school behaviour management policy will guide the punishment, but it is important that you don\u2019t ban the activity or environment where the harassment has taken place (whether it is girls and boys sitting next to one another in class or young people hugging in the playground). Doing so tells young people that sexual harassment is a result of an unsuitable activity or environment, not an unacceptable behaviour itself.<br></p> <h2>Examine your own assumptions</h2> <p>The way we engage with inequality shapes the learning of the young people we are teaching. Look at the way you treat girls and boys, and think about the assumptions you may be subconsciously bringing into the classroom. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/01/young-human-rights-reporter-competition\">How to teach ... human rights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need to interrogate why we do these things, and develop our skills and knowledge. Without doing this important work ourselves, as teachers and school leaders, we\u2019ll be unable to truly support young people to move beyond thinking these things too.</p> <p>To move away from a world that allows sexual harassment and violence to happen, we must ensure everyone\u2019s right to participate in education free from fear, in a culture underpinned by mutual respect. This can only be possible with well-informed educators who have taken the time to understand the the problem and support young people in engaging with the consequences.<br></p> <p><em>Rachael Curzons is a former teacher who works for the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/fearlessfutures\">Fearless Futures</a> social enterprise</em></p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

  "<p>Spain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/spains-gay-referee-football-abuse-jesus-tomillero\">first openly gay football referee</a> has received homophobic death threats after returning to the game months after quitting in the wake of abuse.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Jes\u00fas Tomillero, 21, was refereeing a game between CD Lasalle and Atl\u00e9tico Zabal in Andalus\u00eda\u2019s second division on Saturday when a Lasalle supporter told him to \u201cget off for being gay\u201d after he awarded a penalty to Zabal. </p> <p>The game was stopped and the man was removed but he managed to get back in and shout \u201cYou fucking faggot\u201d at Tomillero.</p> <p>Following the match - his second since returning - the referee started getting death threats on social media. \u201cYou son of a bitch. You messed with the club. We\u2019ll kill you with Aids, you faggot,\u201d read one.</p> <p>Another message, featuring a photograph of a handgun and bullets, said: \u201cNot long left to live, faggot.\u201d </p> <p>Tomillero said he had begun receiving the messages after posting details of what happened at the match.</p> <p>\u201cI go the first one about three o\u2019clock yesterday afternoon,\u201d he told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cIt said: \u2018Reporting this was a mistake, Jes\u00fas. The boss has put a price on your head.\u2019 There was a picture of a gun and a car and it said: \u2018Get ready for what\u2019s coming, faggot.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Tomillero said he was shocked by the abuse. \u201cI had a fit of nerves and didn\u2019t know what to do. But we got into a taxi and went to the police. They\u2019re investigating the case, not just here but all over Spain. There are police officers outside my house 24 hours a day, but I\u2019m still afraid and I don\u2019t know what could happen.\u201d</p> <p>He said he would not stop refereeing. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep on doing what I like doing, whatever it costs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am really, really scared.\u201d</p> <p>Tomillero, who came out last year, hung up his boots in May after the abuse became unbearable. The final straw came when someone shouted from the stands: \u201cThat\u2019s that poof who was on the telly \u2026 You can stick the goal up your arse, you fucking poof.\u201d</p> <p>Worse than the homophobic slurs themselves, Tomillero <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/spains-gay-referee-football-abuse-jesus-tomillero\">said at the time</a>, was the fact that everyone in the crowd then laughed.</p> <p>Spain has generally embraced sexual tolerance since the death of General Franco in 1975, and became the third European country to legalise same-sex marriage, in 2005. </p> <p>A survey conducted three years ago suggested Spain was the most accepting country in Europe when it came to homosexuality, with <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/\">88% of respondents</a> saying society should accept it. </p> <p>But prejudice remains a problem. According to statistics gathered by an equality group, in the Madrid region there is a homophobic attack <a href=\"http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/04/26/madrid/1461692985_335525.html\">every two days</a>. </p>",
  "<p>Nonhuman primates have long played a key role in life-changing medical advances. A recent white paper by nine scientific societies in the US produced a list of 50 medical advances from the last 50 years made possible through studies on nonhuman primates. These included: treatments for leprosy, HIV and Parkinson\u2019s; the MMR and hepatitis B vaccines; and earlier diagnosis and better treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome and breast cancer.</p> <p>The biological similarities between humans and other primates mean that they are sometimes the only effective model for complex neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s. More than 10 million people suffer from Parkinson\u2019s worldwide, and a recent study estimated that one in three people born in 2015 will develop dementia in their lifetime. Primate research offers treatments, and hope for future treatments, to patients and their families. Already over 200,000 Parkinson\u2019s patients have had their life dramatically improved thanks to deep brain stimulation surgery, which reduces the tremors of sufferers. This treatment was developed from research carried out in a few hundred monkeys in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>Given that primates are intelligent and sensitive animals, such research requires a higher level of ethical justification. The scientific community continues to work together to minimise the suffering of primates wherever possible. We welcome the worldwide effort to replace, refine and reduce the use of primates in research.</p> <p>We, the undersigned, believe that if we are to effectively combat the scourge of neurodegenerative and other crippling diseases, we will require the careful and considered use of nonhuman primates. Stringent regulations across the developed world exist to ensure that primates are only used where there is no other available model \u2013 be that the use of a mouse or a non-animal alternative \u2013 and to protect the wellbeing of those animals still required. The use of primates is not undertaken lightly. However, while not all primate research results in a new treatment, it nonetheless plays a role in developing both the basic and applied knowledge that is crucial for medical advances.</p> <p><strong>Professor Sir John Gurdon</strong><em> Winner of Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012 and Lasker Award in 2009</em></p> <p><strong>Professor Sir John Walker</strong><em> Winner of Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1997</em></p> <p><strong>Sir Colin Blakemore</strong> <em>Former Chief Executive of the Medical Research Council</em></p> <p><strong>Alim Benabid, MD, PhD</strong><em> Professor Emeritus of Biophysics at Joseph Fourier University, Joint Winner of the 2014 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award</em></p> <p><strong>Mahlon DeLong, MD</strong><em> Professor of Neurology at Emory University School of Medicine, Joint Winner of the 2014 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award</em><br></p> <p><strong>Michael Arthur</strong> <em>Professor, President &amp; Provost of University College London</em></p> <p><strong>Giacomo Rizzolatti</strong><em> Professor, Universita Delgli Studi Di Parma, Italy</em><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Miguel Nicolelis, PhD</strong><em> Professor of Neurobiology at Duke University, Director of Neuroengineering</em><strong><br></strong></p> <p><em>Signing on behalf of the listed organisations:</em></p> <p><strong>Jane F Reckelhoff, PhD</strong><em> President of the American Physiological Society</em><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Cindy Buckmaster, PhD</strong><em> President of Americans for Medical Progress</em><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>John Aggleton, PhD, FRS, FMedSci</strong><em> Professor, President of the British Neuroscience Association</em></p> <p><strong>Leonard Howell, PhD</strong><em> President, The College on Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc</em></p> <p><strong>Gregg Stanwood, PhD</strong><em> President of Developmental Neurotoxicology Society</em></p> <p><strong>Kirk Leech</strong><em> Executive Director of the European Animal Research Association</em></p> <p><strong>Hudson H Freeze, PhD</strong><em> President of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</em></p> <p><strong>Barry Everitt, FRS, Fmedsci</strong><em> President of the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies</em></p> <p><strong>Matthew Bailey</strong><em> Executive Vice President, Foundation for Biomedical Research</em></p> <p><strong>John Hogan, PhD</strong><em> Registrar at Newcastle University</em></p> <p><strong>David Eisner, DPhil</strong><em> President of The Physiological Society</em></p> <p><strong>Kenneth Sher, PhD</strong><em> President of the Research Society on Alcoholism</em></p> <p><strong>Hollis Cline, PhD</strong><em> Professor, President of Society for Neuroscience</em></p> <p><strong>Wendy Jarrett</strong><em> Chief Executive of Understanding Animal Research</em></p> <p><em>Signing in a personal capacity:</em></p> <p><strong>Christian Abee</strong><em> DVM, DACLAM, Professor and Chair, Department of Veterinary Sciences, MD Anderson Cancer Centre, University of Texas, USA</em></p> <p><strong>Moshe Abeles, PhD</strong><em> Professor of Neurophysiology, Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Centre, Bar-Ilan University, Israel</em></p> <p><strong>Alaa Ahmed, PhD</strong><em> Associate Professor of Integrative Physiology, University of Colorado Boulder, USA</em></p> <p><strong>Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles Ar\u00e9valo</strong><strong><em> </em>PhD</strong><em> Neuroscientist, Instituto Cajal, CSIC, Madrid, Spain</em></p> <p><strong>Yaneri A Ayala</strong><em> Postdoctoral Fellow.

  "<p>In the last week, America lost two pioneering transgender women entertainers: <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000793/\">Alexis Arquette</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0149288/\">The Lady Chablis</a>. Both died relatively young, Arquette at 47 and Chablis at 59. Then again, perhaps that\u2019s actually rather old, given the world they were born into: although there\u2019s no good data on life expectancies for trans and gender non-conforming people in the United States, <a href=\"http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf\">the statistics we do have</a> suggest that they face greater health concerns with fewer resources than their cisgender counterparts, and that they are therefore more likely to die younger as well. Yet both Arquette and Chablis lived outsized lives despite their short durations, and along the way, they managed to break barriers for transgender artists everywhere.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/08/the-lady-chablis-transgender-nightclub-star-dies\">The Lady Chablis, transgender nightclub star, dies aged 59</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the 1990s, if you wanted to see a trans actor on the big screen, you had remarkably few options. Despite a plethora of films with large transgender roles, ranging from the deplorable (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109040/\">Ace Ventura Pet Detective</a>), to the complicated (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEED91539F935A1575AC0A964958260\">The Crying Game</a>), to the tragic (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171804/\">Boys Don\u2019t Cry</a>), trans actors were almost entirely sidelined from major productions. Today, a small handful are gaining traction in mainstream film and television projects, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/14/laverne-cox-orange-new-black-transgender\">Laverne Cox</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fosters-transgender-tom-phelan-interview-808424\">Tom Phelan</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themyataylor?lang=en\">Mya Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsJamieClayton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Jamie Clayton</a> and <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/04/15/after-years-hiding-hollywood-trans-actress-trace-lysette-finally-liv\">Trace Lysette</a>. And if a cisgender actor does play a transgender character, there\u2019s bound to be some uproar, <a href=\"http://www.vibe.com/2016/09/michelle-rodriguez-transgender-reassignment-controversy/\">as there was when it was recently announced that Michelle Rodriguez would play a transgender assassin in the new Walter Hill film, (Re)Assignment</a>. </p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t even a conversation in the 90s, when Arquette and Chablis became two of the first trans actors to play trans roles in major mainstream films \u2013 Arquette as the gender non-conforming George (based on Boy George) in Adam Sandlers\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120888/\">The Wedding Singer</a> (1998), and Chablis as herself in the 1997 docu-thriller, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB3PdPMjeIY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hB3PdPMjeIY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Both women had nuanced, complicated and shifting understandings of their own genders. Perhaps reflecting the time in which they grew up, over the course of their lives both used (or had applied to them) a wide variety of labels, from \u201c<a href=\"http://kimwade1.com/?page_id=299\">drag queen</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.tgforum.com/wordpress/index.php/the-david-de-alba-interview-the-lady-chablis/\">female impersonator</a>\u201d, to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0907/24/lkl.01.html\">transgendered</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/news/182604_alexis_arquette_started_calling_herself_gender_suspicious_after_caitlyn_jenner_came_out/\">gender suspicious</a>\u201d. Yet no matter what words they used, both were always vocal advocates for trans people, rights and representation. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/alexis-arquette-obituary\">Alexis Arquette obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arquette had an open (and often salacious) relationship with the press. She was not shy about outing closeted celebrities, particularly ones taking queer roles or protesting other forms of discrimination but not trans/homophobia. She even made a documentary about her transition, 2007\u2019s Alexis Arquette: She\u2019s My Brother. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJhCJWsI0fg\">an outtake</a> posted to YouTube, Arquette declared \u201cNo one in my life or on the streets can say or do anything that\u2019s going to persuade me from becoming \u2026 who I am.\u201d Sadly, in the end, Arquette found the documentary process to be exploitative; it relied too much on \u201cHollywood types, from Psycho to the clown\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.out.com/entertainment/michael-musto/2015/01/19/alexis-arquette-sharon-osbourne-bruce-jenner-sex-jared-leto\">she told gossip columnist Michael Musto</a>. In that same interview, she mentioned another documentary project she had worked on, this time with Oprah Winfrey, which floundered when Arquette protested their obsession with sex reassignment surgeries, saying that \u201cif people want to know about that surgery, there\u2019s plenty of things on YouTube they can look up ... [This is] about myself, my career, my personal side\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT_BxSuSVVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aT_BxSuSVVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Arquette came to movie work early in her career, thanks in part to her famous family. The Lady Chablis, on the other hand, was a well-known performer in her hometown of Savannah, Georgia, but it wasn\u2019t until the publication of the true-crime book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (in 1994), that she gained wider notoriety. After spending over 200 weeks on the New York Times\u2019s bestseller list, the book was made into a film starring Kevin Spacey and a young Jude Law. Chablis was shocked when they asked her to audition for the role of herself. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/09/09/493319054/savannah-mourns-lady-chablis-from-midnight-in-the-garden-of-good-and-evil\">In an interview with NPR</a>, Chad Darnell, the film\u2019s casting director, recalls that she informed him \u201cthere\u2019s nobody else who can play me but me\u201d. When he suggested Whitney Houston, she slapped him so hard she drew blood \u2013 and got the role.</p> <p>\u201cI thought celebrity would change the way people looked at me,\u201d Chablis told <a href=\"http://www.savannahmagazine.com/2016/09/08/a-lady-after-midnight/\">Savannah Magazine</a> in 2013. She was hurt when people continued to refer to her as a drag queen, even long after the publication of her own memoir, Hiding My Candy, in 1997. In fact, the only label she ever truly embraced was the one she gave herself \u2013 The Lady Chablis. \u201cI just try to be who I am without all the labels people try to put on you,\u201d she told the reporter at Savannah Magazine.</p> <p>It was a sentiment Arquette would have agreed with. Over the course of her life, she used many different combinations of labels, genders and pronouns. Yet she was adamant that that didn\u2019t change her worth as a human being. \u201cLiving as a woman is different than living as a man,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0907/24/lkl.01.html\">she once told Larry King on CNN</a>. But regardless, \u201cI want to be equal to everyone else.\u201d </p> <p>Today, we are a little further down that road to equality thanks to pioneers like The Lady Chablis and Alexis Arquette, but our world is also a little dimmer without their light. The roles they won might seem small or stereotypical by today\u2019s standards, but they were exceptional 20 years ago. Rest in power, Goddess Chablis and Goddess Arquette.</p>",
  "<p>Household incomes in the US finally broke free of the recession in 2015, rising for the first time since the Obama election, the Census Bureau announced on Tuesday, but they still remained below levels before the recession.</p> <p>The bureau\u2019s annual report, the most detailed look at the financial health of US households to be released before the election, will be parsed by Democrats and Republicans in the weeks ahead and contained ammunition for both sides.</p> <p>There were 3.6 million fewer Americans living in poverty in 2015 than the year before, according the US Census.

On Wednesday, the Vote to End Hunger coalition plan to deliver a petition to Lester Holt, NBC newscaster and host of the first presidential debate, urging him to push the presidential candidates to address what they will do to alleviate poverty and end hunger in the US and worldwide. Holt will be moderating the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on 26 September.</p> <p>More than 42 million Americans, including 13.1 million children, struggled with hunger in 2015, the coalition said.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The drop in poverty and increase in household income was due to the strengthening labor market and growth in wages, according to Sheldon Danziger, president of Russell Sage Foundation.</p> <p>\u201cPoverty declined so much because employment increased steadily in 2015, with the annual unemployment rate at 5.3% compared to 6.2% in 2014. In addition, 21 states and the District of Columbia increased their minimum wage rates in 2015,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In both 2014 and 2015, the number of full time workers went up \u2013 with an additional 1.2 million men and 1.6 million women finding full time work in 2014 and another 1.4 million men and one million women finding full time work in 2015. This past month, the US economy added 151,000 jobs. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation \u2013 the longest streak on record. The US Federal Reserve has previously said that the labor market is nearing full employment.</p> <p>The data released on Tuesday also showed that gender wage gap still persists \u2013 with women earning about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2015. The gender wage gap has only decreased by one cent since 2014. While this is the smallest pay gap on record, it is no reason for celebration. </p> <p>\u201cWomen of America, if you are looking for a raise, don\u2019t get your hopes up: the wage gap closed by only a penny last year,\u201d said Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cWhile a small step forward is better than standing still, over a 40-year career women still stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars to the wage gap. And for many women of color, the cost of the lifetime wage gap will still exceed a million dollars. We can\u2019t afford to close this gap one penny at a time.\u201d </p> <p>Black women working full time earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by white men.

At the <a href=\"http://www.everydaysexism.com/\">Everyday Sexism Project</a>, we\u2019ve heard from an IT worker whose less experienced male colleagues outline basic computer functions to her in meetings, an engineer who had a man try to explain solar panels to her and a woman who dealt with a customer slowly spelling out her own company policies to her while calling her \u201choney\u201d.</p> <p>The witty responses to such situations can raise a smile \u2013 such as the time one Twitter user tweeted about men explaining things to her, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/voldemortsbicep/status/720238299814625280\">only to have a man respond with a classic mansplain</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tweet from voldemortsbicep\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/voldemortsbicep&quot;&gt;@voldemortsbicep&lt;/a&gt; i&amp;#39;m so sorry but this was truly perfect &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qswbc5rHc5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qswbc5rHc5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; ktkins (@voldemortsbicep) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/voldemortsbicep/status/720238299814625280&quot;&gt;April 13, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But there is a serious underlying issue here. These interactions are the visible manifestation of societal assumptions about women\u2019s inferiority in intellectual and professional situations. They represent the same ingrained stereotypes that lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/mar/20/highereducation.uk5\">women being less frequently promoted</a> or hired for certain jobs. </p> <p>The same issues are at play when women find themselves being spoken over in the workplace, when a client directs every question to a junior male colleague or when a woman makes a suggestion in a meeting and is ignored, only for the same idea to be voiced by a male colleague, to loud agreement, moments later. It is what writer <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/10-ways-society-can-close-the-confidence-gap_b_5200419.html\">Soraya Chemaly has described as</a> \u201cgood old-fashioned sexism expressed in gendered socialization and a default cultural preference for institutionalized male domination of public life\u201d.</p> <p>However, as Chemaly points out, the way to fix it isn\u2019t simply to suggest that women need to be more assertive, as we are often told. The problem doesn\u2019t spring from hesitant women wringing their hands and dithering until a heroic man rides in and provides an explanation. The aforementioned astronaut, astrophysicist, Marine Corp veteran and Olympic cyclist hardly fit that description. </p> <p>No, it arises when men are brought up in a world that teaches them that their knowledge and opinions are worth more than those of a far more qualified woman. It happens when some men act on these ingrained assumptions. And its impact, particularly in the workplace, can go far beyond the initial annoyance. The only way to stop it is to change the narrative that sets up male contributions as superior in the first place, not to \u201ctrain\u201d women to deal with it later on.</p> <p>In the meantime, here is a good rule of thumb for overenthusiastic men on Twitter to follow: if she\u2019s wearing a Nasa spacesuit, take a minute to consider whether you really want to tell her how to do her job. Or,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/omearan/status/774215701707919365\"> as one tweeter put it</a>, \u201cThis lesson went well, I think. But you should have told her to smile more. Women love that.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Sitcoms, in the UK at least, are rarely written by renowned standups \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/19/jo-brand-going-forward-preview\">Jo Brand</a> is an exception, as are self-penned star vehicles Miranda and Count Arthur Strong. Plays by comedians are thinner still on the ground. But last week I saw both a sitcom pilot by James Acaster (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07v6hnc\">We the Jury</a>) and a play by Liam Williams (<a href=\"http://www.fightinthedog.co.uk/travesty/\">Travesty</a>). I was eager to see whether those standups\u2019 unmistakeable voices are as funny, or as striking, in others\u2019 mouths.</p> <p>We the Jury is derived from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/14/james-acaster-at-edinburgh-festival-review-a-mindbending-comedy-cracker\">Acaster\u2019s 2015 show Represent</a>, which ostensibly recounted his experience of jury service. I say ostensibly because Acaster is a slippery customer. His standup isn\u2019t recognisably autobiographical: his jury service routine felt like a loopy metaphor and was probably fiction. But he clearly felt it had legs, because now we have a TV half-hour on the same subject, starring Ed Easton (of sketch troupe Gein\u2019s Family Giftshop) as dorky cinema worker William, whose dream comes true when he\u2019s summoned to sit on the jury at a croupier\u2019s murder trial. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/10/diane-morgan-comedy-genius-on-playing-philomena-cunk\">Diane (Philomena Cunk) Morgan</a> and Vivienne Acheampong \u2013 seen lately in Rainbow Class on the Edinburgh fringe \u2013 co-star as fellow jurors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/09/james-acaster-at-edinburgh-festival-review-gags-pleasance-courtyard\">James Acaster at Edinburgh festival review \u2013 blissful gags about modern life's minutiae</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you\u2019re a fan of Acaster\u2019s standup, as I am, you can\u2019t watch We the Jury without playing back at least a few of its lines in his own fastidious Kettering tones. I can easily imagine an Acaster routine about the phrase (which crops up here) \u201cYou\u2019re a poet and you don\u2019t know it\u201d \u2013 he\u2019d get 10 good minutes out of that. As for the trial of an auctioneer that was open and shut double-quick because the witnesses were all auctioneers, and they speak really fast? Well, that crack bears its maker\u2019s mark very visibly indeed.</p> <p>The show\u2019s brand of heightened reality, too, is analogous to the not-quite-real world Acaster occupies in his standup. But it\u2019s less successful. Onstage, Acaster is totally in control of his askew reality, and of the vast importance assumed there by trivial things. In his pilot, the tone feels less certain: it\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re meant to find William this much of a berk, given that everyone else seems pretty juvenile too.</p> <p>That may come, if We the Jury ever sees the light of a series. No such possibility for Travesty, a self-contained two-hander stage play from Williams, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/10/liam-williams-review-edinburgh-festival-2014-capitalism\">whose 2014 show Capitalism</a> so blazingly and black-comically articulated anti-capitalist impotence and generational despair. Travesty traces a relationship from genesis to death throes and beyond. It\u2019s not a comedy \u2013 and yet Williams\u2019 voice is more recognisable here than Acaster\u2019s in We the Jury. The romantic-depressive outlook is recognisably his; so too the existential cri de coeur underpinning a play about a man only briefly rescued by love from life\u2019s meaninglessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be7fdffc947f8027d4a87e399dab1fc3f44fa473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be7fdffc947f8027d4a87e399dab1fc3f44fa473/0_353_5596_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travesty by Liam Williams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Existential cri de coeur ... Pierro Niel-Mee and Lydia Larson in Travesty by Liam Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Haigh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike in Acaster\u2019s pilot, there\u2019s a character here who feels like a proxy for Williams. OK, so Ben is played by a woman (Lydia Larson; the play is cross-cast, although it\u2019s not clear why). But he speaks like Williams; you\u2019d swear Larson has adopted some of Williams\u2019 diffident mannerisms, and at one point the character even punches a wall, recalling Williams walloping the ceiling until his fist bled in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/08/liam-williams-edinburgh-festival-review-comedy-laughing-horse-free-sisters\">2015 show Bonfire Night</a>. There are countless jaundiced-philosophical turns of phrase that sound like the authorial voice (\u201cLove shouldn\u2019t be mediated through consumption\u201d, and so on). The problem is that the second character, Anna, has far less personality. And also that, unlike in Williams\u2019 standup, there\u2019s too little countervailing humour.</p> <p>What makes Williams exciting as a comedian is the unresolved tensions between depression and still-flickering faith, between finding himself tragic and finding himself ridiculous. In a sense, his standup voice is made up of several competing voices, those waging the arguments in his head. In Travesty, only one of those voices is loudly heard, and for the want of the others, a more conventional bland of bleakness wins out.</p> <p>Watching the two \u2013 the sitcom and the play \u2013 reminded me of how difficult and delicate it is to hone a strong comic voice, and how we can\u2019t assume it\u2019s easily transferable. Acaster has spoken about the evolution of his own stage persona; he didn\u2019t emerge fully formed, as those of us who saw his early work can attest. It\u2019s just as difficult to develop the skills required of a playwright or sitcom writer \u2013 notwithstanding that Acaster and Williams\u2019 achievements as writer-performers give them a pretty good head-start. At their best, We the Jury and Travesty offer glimpses of two inimitable comic voices. In neither case is it enough to (yet) produce work anywhere near as accomplished as their standup.<br></p> <h2>Three to see</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cde2c30339d5728b58fecd1a5b28fbe36c962bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cde2c30339d5728b58fecd1a5b28fbe36c962bf/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shape-shifters \u2026 The Pajama Men.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shape-shifters \u2026 The Pajama Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Pajama Men</strong><br></p> <p>A UK tour kicks off for one of the great double-acts in world comedy: the shape-shifting, darkly comic impro-sketch originals Mark Chavez and Shenoah Allen.

She also supports research on addiction and substance abuse, as part of an overall plan to address these problems in American society. </p> <p>In addition, there is an overall goal of enhancing technology and innovation, which goes hand-in-hand with science. Clinton has also outlined a plan to protect animals and wildlife, and ensure that national parks and protected wildlife areas are not privatised. Finally, she has cobbled together a substantial plan to deal with the threat of climate change and global warming.

His comments about spreading out vaccine doses come from the annals of superstition, rather than informed views. There is no scientific evidence in support of the notion that vaccine doses, or the times between vaccines, affect autism; indeed, years of trials, data, research, experience and statistics have brought us to the current <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/\">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunization/Pages/Immunization-Schedule.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:+No+local+token\">American Association of Pediatrics</a> recommendations for vaccines. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/feb/22/making-the-meningitis-b-vaccine-available-for-all-children-makes-sense\">Making the meningitis B vaccine available for all children makes sense | Jenny Rohn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s approach is not science, it is bunk.<br></p> <p>A lot has also been said about the health of each of the two candidates, with Clinton and Trump at 68 and 70 years of age, respectively. Indeed, Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent pneumonia diagnosis and cancellation of her schedule for the next few days highlights the mortality of aging presidential candidates. So it would be worthy to look at statements made by the vice presidential candidates. </p> <p>While Democrat Tim Kaine is largely in line with Clinton, Republican Mike Pence has made statements that may even outdo those of Trump. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/15/mike-pence-donald-trumps-vp-pick-smoking-doesnt-kill.html\">Time for a quick reality check</a>,\u201d wrote Pence. \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill. Two out of every three smokers doesn\u2019t die from a smoking-related disease.\u201d </p> <p>So according to Pence, smoking doesn\u2019t kill, but a third of the smoking population DOES die from smoking. Am I missing something? It sounds like it\u2019s definitely time for Mr Pence to do a reality check.</p> <p>This upcoming election is like no other election in US history. Far more important than mere policy is the foundation on which science is based: truth. Science is, for the most part, objective, built on facts and the most likely explanation that those facts can provide at any given time. As more facts arise, models can be modified or expanded. Or revised altogether. But any model/theory/hypothesis must always fit the facts. And while all politicians tend to embellish and bend facts to some degree, more than any candidate ever in US history, Trump has been ignoring facts and promoting falsehoods. </p> <p>Paul Krugman of the New York Times wrote a recent opinion piece called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/opinion/donald-trumps-big-liar-technique.html\">Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Liar\u2019 Technique</a>. In this article, Krugman outlines how Trump repeatedly lies about points that are demonstrably false, and when challenged, merely repeats them. As one of many examples, he notes how Trump insists that he was against the war in Iraq \u2013 and yet, the only on-record statement he made prior to the invasion was that he was for it. Or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\">Trump\u2019s assertion that he saw thousands of cheering Muslims in Jersey City after 9-11</a>. It is Krugman\u2019s hypothesis that the sheer volume of lies has saturated and overwhelmed the American public and journalists. It is almost to the point where journalists no longer challenge yesterday\u2019s lies because they are so busy dealing with today\u2019s new round of lies.</p> <p>Trump, however, is not only adept about lying; he is a master of innuendo-based conspiracy theories. He will frequently use openings such as \u201cPeople tell me that \u2026\u201d to spread false rumours and lies. He will talk about President Obama\u2019s reaction to the murderous attack at the Orlando night-club and use phrases such as \u201cThere\u2019s something going on,\u201d as if suggesting that the president was part of a conspiracy involved in the mass shooting. And then drift away and watch his surrogates promote the conspiracy.</p> <p>A candidate who has such a loose and irreverent relationship with the truth will not be good for science, whether or not he has a solid policy to support science \u2013 and Trump does not. But science serves as a microcosm for everything else. </p> <p>If a candidate refuses to accept the advice of the vast majority of the most knowledgeable experts in a scientific field, such as those who have debunked any relationship between autism and vaccines, then why would this candidate pay any heed to foreign policy experts with regard to international affairs? Or experienced generals with regard to military issues? Indeed, Trump has already stated, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-intelligence-briefings.html?_r=0\">I know more than the generals about ISIS</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most serious concern about the Trump candidacy is that it heralds a new era that some are calling \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth_politics\">post-truth politics</a>\u201d. Once the truth has become irrelevant to the American electorate, scientists may as well pack up their microscopes and test tubes and look for other careers. However, with two months until the election, there is still time to campaign for facts, truth \u2013 and yes, science.</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve published nine books and all nine experiences have been unique. Yet there are two questions you get asked every single time, over and over again (by journalists, but also by normal people).<br></p> <p> The first question is always: \u201cHow did you come up with this idea?\u201d My most honest answer would be to admit that I don\u2019t know, or that I can\u2019t remember, or that I do remember but I don\u2019t want to say. But because this (totally reasonable) question is asked so persistently, I inevitably manufacture a semi-cogent response that feels halfway plausible, and I repeat that response until it feels like the true answer. I suppose it\u2019s possible that this rote reply is the true answer, and that I simply needed to work through the inquiry 25 times before realising this was the case. For example: whenever people ask me how I came up with the idea behind But What If We\u2019re Wrong? I almost always mention watching a specific TV series (Cosmos) while simultaneously reading about the life of a specific author (Herman Melville).</p> <p>Now, those two synchronised events did occur, and they seem like a plausible genesis for a workable idea. But part of me suspects I\u2019d actually been thinking about the concept of collective wrongness unconsciously for 30 years, and that this serendipitous moment was just the first time I decided to write a book about it. Maybe what I classify as the inception of the idea is actually the conclusion to that idea. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t think most people who pose this question are particularly interested in the answer. It just seems like the proper thing to ask someone who\u2019s written a book.</p> <p> The second question is (to me) more fascinating, even though it seems far simpler: \u201cHow long did it take you to write this?\u201d It\u2019s a query that raises a lot of ancillary questions about the entire process. Am I writing if I\u2019m just thinking about writing, or is writing only the mechanical typing? Does stoically staring at a blank computer screen for two hours while drinking Mountain Dew count as creativity? If I come up with the vague idea for a novel in 1996 but don\u2019t write a word until autumn 2016, did the novel take 20 years or six months?</p> <p> I never know when the writing starts.</p> <p> This is further complicated by the fact that it often feels like my books are still being written even after they\u2019ve been released into the public and can no longer be altered. I recognise this makes no sense. When a book is physically assembled and made available in bookstores, it should be finished. The text is trapped under ice. Everything should be over. But in my experience, that is never the case. Once I\u2019ve published a book, I\u2019m asked an avalanche of questions about what certain passages suggest, or what my motives were, or if my work is autobiographical or metaphorical or was composed while on drugs. This is amplified by other people who write about my books and assert what they believe to be true about what I\u2019ve published, and then I\u2019m asked to respond to those arbitrary assertions. Obviously, these post-publication thoughts don\u2019t change what is typeset on the page. But to people who read these auxiliary sentiments before they read the book itself \u2013 and even to those readers who don\u2019t encounter these sentiments until after they\u2019ve finished \u2013 the book is contextually changed. Not a lot, but a little. Even if they disagree with what\u2019s being alleged, they can\u2019t un-know that this intellectual position exists. So it always feel like I\u2019m writing all my books in perpetuity, every time someone asks me a question about anything I\u2019ve written in the past. If I were smarter, I\u2019d live as a recluse. But I can\u2019t do it. </p> <p> I once saw a Black Sabbath promotional poster from the 1970s that declared: \u201cMore good reviews than most. More bad reviews than all.\u201d I relate to this. I\u2019m shocked by how often my books are reviewed, which (I know) I\u2019m supposed to be happy about, regardless of what the reviewers claim. But it will never stop seeming weird, despite the fact that I\u2019ve spent most of my life reviewing the works of others. It\u2019s a zero-sum game. Unless you\u2019re totally unknown, the content of a review has almost no influence on book sales; a great high-profile review will cause sales to negligibly spike upward for a week or two, but a really bad high-profile review paradoxically generates an almost identical commercial impact. My best-reviewed books have sold the fewest copies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/06/lisa-ls-hilton-maestra-erotic-bestseller-fiction-film\">LS Hilton: 'Everyone hated my erotic thriller'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, there\u2019s always an intangible sense that the response to a book somehow shapes what it actually is, and the more attention a book gets, the more it seems to drift away from whatever you originally imagined. This is disappointing. Of course, the goal of any good publisher is to get as much attention for a book as possible, which means a book only becomes successful when the author completely loses control over what that book means and what it signifies. The central contradiction between writing and publishing is that the former is a way to construct a reality, and the latter is a process of losing control over reality. But you can\u2019t complain about this, because this is how it goes: the disappointment is what they pay you for.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Melville publishes Moby-Dick in 1851, basing his narrative on the real-life 1839 account of a murderous sperm whale nicknamed \u201cMocha Dick\u201d. The initial British edition is around 900 pages. Melville, a moderately successful author at the time of the novel\u2019s release, assumes this book will immediately be seen as his masterwork. But the reviews are mixed, and some are contemptuous (\u201cIt repels the reader\u201d is the key takeaway from one of the very first reviews in the London Spectator). It sells poorly \u2013 at the time of Melville\u2019s death, total sales hover below 5,000 copies. The failure ruins Melville\u2019s life: he becomes an alcoholic and a poet and eventually a customs inspector. When he dies destitute in 1891, one has to assume his perspective on Moby-Dick is something along the lines of: \u2018Well I guess that didn\u2019t work. Maybe I should have spent fewer pages explaining how to tie complicated knots.\u2019 For the next 30 years, nothing about the reception of this book changes. But then [the first world war] happens and \u2013 somehow and for reasons that can\u2019t be totally explained \u2013 modernists living in postwar America start to view literature through a different lens. There is a Melville revival. The concept of what a novel is suppose to accomplish shifts in his direction and amplifies with each passing generation, eventually prompting people (like the 2005 director of Columbia University\u2019s American studies programme) to classify Moby-Dick as \u2018the most ambitious book ever conceived by an American writer\u2019. Pundits and cranks can disagree with that assertion, but no one cares if they do.</p> <p>Now, there\u2019s certainly a difference between collective, objective wrongness (eg: misunderstanding gravity for centuries) and collective, subjective wrongness (eg: not caring about Moby-Dick for 75 years). The machinations of the transitions are completely different. Yet both scenarios hint at a practical reality and a modern problem. The practical reality is that any present-tense version of the world is unstable. What we currently consider to be true \u2013 both objectively and subjectively \u2013 is habitually provisional. But the modern problem is that re-evaluating what we consider \u2018true\u2019 is becoming increasingly difficult.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>But What If We\u2019re Wrong? by Chuck Klosterman is published by Amberley Books at \u00a314.99. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/but-what-if-we-re-wrong.html\">It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a312.29</a>.</p>",

According to regulators, as many as 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts could have been opened without customers\u2019 consent. </p> <p>\u201cWe are doing this because we want our customer to have full confidence that we are focused on their best interests. We deeply regret what happened and we are committed to making it right,\u201d Richele J Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in an email. </p> <p>As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo agreed to hire a consultant to review its sales practices and refund the fees paid by consumers on the accounts that were opened without their permission. So far, customers have been refunded $2.6m in unwarranted fees. According to the bank, \u201caccounts refunded represented a fraction of 1% of the accounts reviewed, and refunds averaged $25\u201d.</p> <p>The issue of unauthorized duplicate accounts was first reported by the Los Angeles Times in 2013.

  "<p>The Liberal Democrats are to push an amendment to scrap the counter-extremism scheme Prevent and propose replacing the term \u201cBritish values\u201d with \u201cuniversal democratic values\u201d in any successor strategy.</p> <p>Alastair Carmichael, the party\u2019s home affairs spokesman, said the party had reached a point where it could no longer support the programme, which it worked to revise while in government and which the home affairs select committee said had become too toxic within communities to work effectively.</p> <p>\u201cBluntly, there comes a point where even the most optimistic government minister has to be prepared to look at the evidence and say it\u2019s not working, it\u2019s not achieving what we set out to achieve and it\u2019s counter-productive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In particular, Carmichael said the party believed a continued emphasis on the term \u201cBritish values\u201d in a counter-extremism strategy had an adverse effect. \u201cEvery time I hear anybody talking about British values, my toes curl, because it\u2019s not very British to talk about it,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cBut what do we mean by British values?

Again, that\u2019s not the case. </p> <p>\u201cSo what you are saying [is], here is something that defines us as British, and if you don\u2019t share my view, somehow you are not completely British.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/23/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-schools-demonising-muslim-children\">'You worry they could take your kids': is the Prevent strategy in schools demonising Muslim children?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Lib Dems will pursue scrapping Prevent via a Lords amendment to the counter-extremism and safe-guarding bill. The programme, which began under the Labour government, targets people vulnerable to the influence of extremism, and places a statutory duty on schools, prisons, local authorities and NHS trusts to report concerns. </p> <p>The long-delayed counter-extremism bill, intended to set out an agenda that is distinct but parallel to Prevent, was criticised in July by the joint committee on human rights, which found the core issues were too vague, including the phrases \u201cnon-violent extremism\u201d and \u201cBritish values\u201d. </p> <p>A motion to scrap Prevent will also be presented to the party conference in Brighton this weekend, proposing to replace it with a more community-focused strategy with \u201ca more positive name such as Engage\u201d \u2013 a proposal first made by the select committee report. </p> <p>The strategy recommends removing absolute control over the policy from the Home Office and putting it within the remit of the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p> <p>The strategy recommends an open debate with extremists, rather than immediate criminalisation, and the promotion of credible grassroots voices, as well as recognition of the impact of UK foreign policy on certain communities. </p> <p>\u201cIt is important for the government to engage with and explain to domestic communities who have links to affected areas why foreign intervention is supported by the UK \u2013 especially where this includes the involvement of British armed forces,\u201d the proposal says. </p> <p>Carmichael said the current strategy \u201cstill clings to the notion that people at desks in Whitehall know best \u2026 This is was always going to be particularly vulnerable to that. This is the point to draw the line and start again.\u201d<br></p> <p>The former Scottish secretary, who now holds the Lib Dems\u2019 sole seat in Scotland, said it had to be recognised that people like himself did not have the credibility within minority communities to properly tackle radicalisation and extremism recruitment by hate preachers like Anjem Choudary.</p> <p>\u201cThese people need to be tackled, marginalised and put in a proper context,\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cAs a 51-year-old white man from the north of Scotland, I\u2019m not necessarily the person to do that, for a late teens male who is susceptible to the messages of people like Choudary. Who are you going to listen to? It\u2019s not going to be me.\u201d</p> <p>Carmichael said the party, which is languishing at about 8% in the opinion polls, knew the pledge to scrap Prevent would not win favourable \u201cDaily Mail headlines\u201d, but he hoped it would appeal to people who had once been the party\u2019s core voters, particularly teachers and students. </p> <p>\u201cThe NUS, NUT, teachers, who have been previously very receptive to a Liberal Democrat message \u2013 there are people to whom this will have a resonance. I hope it\u2019s not quite as nakedly cynical as that, but we have a lot of work to do to claw back ground that we lost, and talking to various sectoral interests about things that they understand to be problematic is part of that. </p> <p>\u201cDo I think this will be the silver bullet to win us back 60 MPs? Possibly not. But it is important stuff, in a space not many people in politics are willing to occupy.\u201d</p> <p>The proposal is unlikely to have much traction with the Home Office, where Theresa May led an overhaul of the policy in 2011. That review led to one of the most bitter cabinet battles between David Cameron and his then deputy, Nick Clegg, who opposed any strategy predicated on the notion that non-violent extremism eventually incubates terrorism \u2013 a position Carmichael said the party still held. </p> <p>Carmichael admitted it would be difficult for the new home secretary, Amber Rudd, to tackle the issue. \u201cAre you prepared to take on the dinosaurs in your own party, the headline writers of the Daily Mail, and do the right thing that might seem kind of counter-intuitive \u2026 The jury\u2019s out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said they were committed to the programme. <strong>\u201c</strong>Prevent is making a positive difference, we are working in partnership with local communities and grassroots organisations to challenge poisonous extremist narratives and safeguard our young people and our society. We now have more than 550,000 frontline public sector workers trained since 2011 to recognise the signs of radicalisation so that they know what steps to take.</p> <p>\u201cThis has led to more than 1,000 people being supported through Channel, the voluntary, confidential programme for people vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve done it but if we want players such as Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez to sign new deals we\u2019re going to have to show we\u2019re making progress. A win in Paris would also send out a message against a PSG side who, on paper, look slightly weaker than they did last season. </p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The key to a successful campaign is to keep the likes of \u00d6zil and Sanchez fit. We must also stop conceding sloppy goals and losing to teams we\u2019re expected to beat \u2013 like we did last season. We\u2019ve made two really good defensive signings in Granit Xhaka and Shkodran Mustafi. I\u2019m hoping they both step up when it matters. We have goals in us but really need to shore up at the back. <em><strong>Marc Nellis</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f2abaa6d34f551d4c0b44c4bda9af2a4b8ff1b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f2abaa6d34f551d4c0b44c4bda9af2a4b8ff1b5/0_0_3000_2185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"728\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Shkodran Mustafi shore up Arsenal\u2019s defence?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid </h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong><em> </em>Winners<em><br></em></p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? H</strong>aving come so close to winning the competition in two of the last three seasons, my hope is to win it this time. We\u2019ve made a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/29/noisy-neighours-leganes-atletico-madrid-real\"> slow start</a> to the Primera this season, but the Champions League is a competition that suits Atl\u00e9tico, and Diego Simeone can play a very canny tactical game in the knockout stages. I think the team can go all the way this season. A repeat of last season\u2019s final but with the opposite result would go down well!</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The defence has been rock solid for some time, so the key will be at the other end of the pitch. Will the likes of K\u00e9vin Gameiro and Antoine Griezmann be able to nick enough goals to allow Atleti to progress? I suspect they will, especially as I expect Gameiro to show better form in front of goal than Jackson Mart\u00ednez managed in his spell at the club. Additionally, I really hope that progress in this season\u2019s competition won\u2019t be decided by Juanfran\u2019s penalty-taking abilities. <strong><em>Will</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7bcd72d41534e0b3a1f10737fce36fc599ae1ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7bcd72d41534e0b3a1f10737fce36fc599ae1ec/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atletico Madrid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Gameiro celebrates after scoring against Alaves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Carlos Hidalgo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Barcelona</h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Winners</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>The key will be winning Group C. After that, we should have no problem in the round of 16 and quarter-finals. Semi-finals should be our minimal goal, with an added expectation of getting to the final and win the title again. Hopes are high.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> Having Lionel Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar fit and healthy is going to play a crucial part. I also think the club have invested well in the squad over the summer. This should increase our chances of success both domestically and in Europe. <strong><em>Jordi Brunet Espuela</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18133e65a0401613272d6305dfcfe58d29a58207\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18133e65a0401613272d6305dfcfe58d29a58207/0_0_2526_1564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barcelona\" width=\"1000\" height=\"619\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Messi celebrates with Neymar after scoring against Sevilla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manu Fernandez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Basel </h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Round of 16</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>We usually do well against English clubs in the Champions League, so while matching PSG will be a stretch, we can cause a nervy-looking Arsenal problems. There\u2019s no real pressure on us to do well and that will work in Basel\u2019s favour.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> For us to have a successful campaign we need to work hard as a team and be compact at the back. We can\u2019t afford to concede any sloppy goals. <strong><em>Botteron</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4af748a3b97a131b672343a842d2f9409e6be44a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af748a3b97a131b672343a842d2f9409e6be44a/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Matias Delgado and Basel get through a tough looking Group A?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Matias Delgado and Basel get through a tough looking Group A?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Hofmann/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bayer Leverkusen<em> </em><br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Quarter-finals</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> We should be aiming to top Group E, with Tottenham the only real serious challengers for the top spot. Monaco and CSKA Moscow look beatable, although travelling to Russia is always tough. I would possibly take a draw there as long as we get all three points in our home game. I\u2019m looking forward to the trip to London.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> If we do well in the group stage, there\u2019s nothing to suggest we won\u2019t be able to reach the quarter-finals at the very least. Our attack of Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Kevin Volland is as good a strikeforce as any on their day. And our Slovenian midfield genius Kevin Kampl will do a great job as always. I have high hopes for the team this year. <strong><em>Albert R\u00f6pke</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c15a5b55fbdaa7a73c804ed0df1efd053b8e62d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c15a5b55fbdaa7a73c804ed0df1efd053b8e62d9/0_0_2478_1652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Kevin Volland in action against Borussia Moenchengladbach on the first day of the new Bundesliga season at the stadium at Borussia-Park in Moenchengladbach, Germany, 27 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Volland in action against Borussia Moenchengladbach on the first day of the new Bundesliga season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maja Hitij/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bayern Munich<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong><em> </em>Final</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Carlo Ancelotti is here to do what Pep Guardiola couldn\u2019t manage \u2013 win the Champions League. Naturally injuries will play a major factor but our squad looks better and Ancelotti\u2019s laid back approach seems better suited to the team. In fairness, I would be satisfied with a final appearance but anything less would have to be seen as a failure.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>Injuries have been key for us in recent campaigns, but it\u2019s particularly crucial to keep J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng fit. Without him our defence looks worryingly slow. A little bit of me is hoping to see Javi Mart\u00ednez pushed back into midfield as I have fond memories of him playing there in 2013 persist. Arturo Vidal is looking like he has become central to our side. I am very much looking forward to his performances this season. <strong><em>Jonny</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84b19c6c8be3494a81176956e8bbdb3386487a8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84b19c6c8be3494a81176956e8bbdb3386487a8a/0_0_4688_2872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng signs autographs at a recent sponsorship event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng signs autographs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixathlon/SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Borussia Dortmund</h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong><em> </em>Quarter-finals</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> After a year\u2019s absence it would be nice to re-establish ourselves on the main European stage. That\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t enjoy our Europa League campaign last season, until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/liverpool-borussia-dortmund-europa-league-report\">painful defeat against Liverpool</a> in the quarter-final. Every professional sports team is constantly changing. Dortmund are no exception from that rule. We had a terrific domestic season last year and have signed very well since the departure of Mats Hummels.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>Thomas Tuchel is one of the best coaches in Europe and, with experienced international players such as Marco Reus and Andr\u00e8 Sch\u00fcrrle, the BvB should surely pass the group stage. The players will need to stay hungry for each of the group games though; there\u2019s no room for complacency. If all goes to plan, anything less than the quarter-finals this season will be a disappointment. <strong><em>Jens</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aecbd673620911152616a80ac4c2eb1428c972a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aecbd673620911152616a80ac4c2eb1428c972a1/0_0_4434_2910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Borussia Dortmund are back in the Champions League after a one year absence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Borussia Dortmund are back in the Champions League after a season in the Europa League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Meissner/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach</h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong><em> </em>Group stage</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> I expect us to fall well short of the knockout stage. Getting the better of both Barcelona and Manchester City will be too tough a challenge for us. We should be able to leave Celtic behind us and reach the Europa League though, which would be a fantastic achievement.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>Our team cannot only play possession football but our pacey wingers mean we\u2019re also extremely dangerous on the counter-attack. In recent years Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach have been a bit naive when playing against the big teams. If they\u2019re able to play a bit smarter and keep their concentration throughout the full 90 minutes this time around, they might even be able to exceed expectations. For now though I\u2019m keeping my feet on the ground. <strong><em>Dominik Marcel van Treel</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"539754ed77ca2899baf1cf73d7db9a2badbfc47b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539754ed77ca2899baf1cf73d7db9a2badbfc47b/0_0_4224_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CL\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borussia Monchengladbach players celebrate with their fans after defeating Young Boys in the Champions League qualifiers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixathlon/SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Benfica<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Quarter-finals</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>I expect Benfica to make it through a group featuring Besiktas, Dynamo Kyiv and Napoli. Last year we managed to beat finalists Atletico Madrid, who were in our group, so this year it may be easier navigating our way out of Group B.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>As the most expensive signing from one Portuguese club to another, Rafa Silva comes from Braga with a big reputation and a rightfully earned one. His acceleration and overall intelligence is something that we will be needing following Renato Sanches\u2019s departure. We managed to keep defender Victor Lindel\u00f6f, who will only get better following his great performances last year. Truth be told Benfica are a club that constantly have a huge turnout of players year in and year out,so every year it seems we start from scratch. This time around our most potent attackers Konstantinos Mitroglou and Jonas have also stayed. <strong><em>Miguel </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"606e00e0cfa3588cf535bc940b457c76d82db7e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/606e00e0cfa3588cf535bc940b457c76d82db7e6/0_0_2800_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benfica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonas in action for Benfica against CD Nacional Funchal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rui Silva/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Besiktas<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Round of 16<br></p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> While Group B looks very competitive, Besiktas have a well structured and balanced team that can get through it. We are constantly improving and have a good mix of talented young players who are capable of exciting the crowd and internationally experienced players who can keep the team grounded when concentration and discipline is needed.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> The performance of our defenders is key. Also, if midfielder O\u011fuzhan \u00d6zyakup and promising Brazilian Anderson Talisca find the right tune, Besiktas could surprise football fans across Europe with their displays. The group is also tricky and balanced group. Benfica, Dynamo Kiev and Napoli are also well organised and tough teams. However, in a group with no clear favourites Besiktas could progress. <strong><em>Devin Bahceci</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b828f11c099ce60523be7eb5f0ad3b59673c43f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b828f11c099ce60523be7eb5f0ad3b59673c43f/0_0_4096_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Besiktas\u2019 Gokhan Tore celebrates with fans after winning the Turkish Super League Championship earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gokhan Tore celebrates with fans earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cem Turkel/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Celtic</h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Group stage </p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> Having experienced three years out of the competition, the fact that Celtic have made it is an achievement in itself. Not only does this bring some serious financial gain to the coffers, it will bring a rocking atmosphere back to Parkhead. This was missing during the dreary and highly unproductive years of Norwegian head coach Ronny Deila. </p> <p>Despite all his flaws, Brendan Rodgers has seemed to reinvigorate our team with smart signings such as Kolo Tour\u00e9 and hot prospect Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, along with re-establishing a swagger to our attacking displays which was desperately lacking under Deila. Ten goals in the first three games of the new season demonstrates the excitement that he has brought back to our football. With some nervy and stuttering performances against minnows in the playoffs (losing the first leg to Gibraltar\u2019s Lincoln Red Imps was not a highlight!), Celtic will find it extremely difficult to compete with the highly talented Borussia Monchengladbach, the financial might of Manchester City and the little team from Catalonia called Barcelona. </p> <p>Our defensive ineptitude will be sorely tested against teams of this calibre, especially in our away performances which in the playoffs were meek and timid. Rodgers also has a poor record on the European stage, with Liverpool\u2019s dreadful exit in the 2014 Champions League highlighting his team\u2019s lack of coherent defensive structure and plan. So although I think that it will be highly unlikely that we get out of the group, I am just thrilled to have high-quality football back at Parkhead with a quality manager. You never know, we could pull a surprise against one of the big boys!</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>In order to have any chance at getting out of the group, Leigh Griffiths needs to replicate the form that he has demonstrated both for Hibernian and Celtic. His goals will be sorely needed for us to be competitive against this horrendously tough group. Tom Rogic has been terrific for us since his return from injury and his creative spark in the centre of the pitch will be very important. <strong><em>Adam Winters</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00f38078b89ea0bdd0211cc4271542e756b6442b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00f38078b89ea0bdd0211cc4271542e756b6442b/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coach Rodgers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendan Rodgers celebrates at the end of the qualifier against Hapoel Beer Sheva.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>CSKA Moscow<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Quarter-finals</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> Our head coach Leonid Slutsky had a dreadful summer with Russia at Euro 2016, but we\u2019re delighted he chose to return to CSKA. With him in charge we could aim for the quarter-finals, like we did during his first epic campaign in 2009.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>We need to be strong at the back, and the defensive belt of goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev and central defenders Vasili Berezutskiy and Sergei Ignashevich need to be much more solid than it was for the national team in France. We have a strong midfield containing Bibras Natcho, a fit again Alan Dzagoev, Roman Eremenko, Pontus Wernbloom and Zoran Tosic. Aleksei Ionov\u2019s season-long loan from poor relegated Dynamo Moscow can also be a game changer. <strong><em>L dos Santos</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a62b63e243c8f8a70d8f1e115be33d7eb550e84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a62b63e243c8f8a70d8f1e115be33d7eb550e84/0_0_3142_2030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CSKA Moscow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pontus Wernbloom celebrates after scoring against Zenit St Petersburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Demianchuk/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Club Brugge<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Round of 16</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Club Brugge are in the Champions League group stage for the first time in 11 years. We\u2019re happy with the draw too; there are no superpowers in Group G and it looks like anyone could beat anyone. While we want to make the most of our chance, I\u2019d be happy with keeping one of the other teams behind us and qualify for the Europa League. But I imagine that, aside from Porto, fans from the other teams all think their team have done well to get so far and are happy to bow out in the group stage. But someone has to progress and I don\u2019t see why it can\u2019t be us.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>Head coach Michel Preud\u2019homme was a legend as a player and is held in high regard after getting us into this year\u2019s competition. The only real worry for Brugge fans is that we\u2019ve struggled domestically this season. Three defeats in six league games is well below par and nowhere near the level that earned us the Belgian Pro League title last season. Keep an eye out for our impressive Colombian winger Jose Izquierdo who has recently returned from injury. He has the ability to cause our opponents lots of defensive headaches. I\u2019m going to stay optimistic and say we\u2019ll sneak through, before falling down to earth with a bump at the Nou Camp in the earliest knock-out stage. <strong><em>Louis</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04d2bd5f95088d6083e82cea9875fe24a767969\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b04d2bd5f95088d6083e82cea9875fe24a767969/0_0_2434_1573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Club Brugge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdoulay Diaby celebrates after scoring for Brugge against RSC Anderlecht.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virginie Lefour/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FC Copenhagen<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Group stage</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Our main objective has to be maintaining the brilliant home record in the club\u2019s fourth Champions League appearance. In the nine games played at Parken we have won five of them \u2013 defeating Manchester United, Celtic, Rubin Kazan, Panathinaikos and Galatasaray \u2013 drawn three \u2013 against Benfica, Barcelona and Juventus \u2013 and only lost once \u2013 against Real Madrid. The flipside of this must be to rectify our awful away record, where we have come away with just the one victory and eight miserable defeats.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>Keeping Parken a fortress will require maximum concentration at the back, with some individual brilliance in attack. We have a multinational group of younger players, and almost everyone is playing for their national sides. Coach Stale Solbakken has steadied the ship after coming back from his unsuccessful spells at Cologne and Wolverhampton. He has the Champions League experience the younger players lacks. If Copenhagen can win one of the home matches and avoid defeat in the two others it should be possible to see European football at Parken next spring in the Europa League \u2013 but my hopes are not much higher than that. Having said that, I\u2019m very happy with being teamed up with Leicester City, Porto and Brugge. The draw could not have been more favourable for us and we\u2019ll have a chance against all of them. <strong><em>Lars B\u00f8gegaard</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb827f8666d5c9073d1354af8b82faaa57db719b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb827f8666d5c9073d1354af8b82faaa57db719b/0_0_3081_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FC Copenhagen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"778\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stale Solbakken and his players celebrate after advancing to the group stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakis Savvides/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dinamo Zagreb<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Group stage</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Last season\u2019s Champions League campaign was extremely disappointing. A 2-1 home victory against Arsenal 2-1 was as good as it got as we finished fourth in the group. Having scraped through to a tough looking Group H by narrowly overcoming Red Bull Salzburg, my hopes of reaching the knockout stage is zero.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The form of our attacking midfielder Ante Coric will be absolutely key if we\u2019re to get any goals, but it will take a miracle to avoid another group stage debacle. Our team is that weak. <strong><em>Igor</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ee1d5333f64c674b97602ee703aa5cc73e63fa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee1d5333f64c674b97602ee703aa5cc73e63fa4/0_0_3488_2294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dinamo Zagreb\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dinamo Zagreb players before their playoff against Red Bull Salzburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GmbH/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dynamo Kyiv<em> </em><br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Round of 16</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Last year was a fantastic campaign for Dynamo as they reached the knockout stages for the first time since 1998-99. The renaissance under Serhiy Rebrov has been brilliant, with two titles and the European run. So the hope is that they will once again make it out of the group, although this time it may be more difficult given the level of the opposition.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The key to Champions League success is winning at home. The group is really difficult with four evenly balanced sides. Ukraine is traditionally a difficult place for opposition sides to visit and Dynamo will need to make the NSC Olympiyskyi a fortress if they want to qualify. Dynamo earned five of their 11 points at home in the previous campaign and will need to improve on this to qualify this time around. The form of Andriy Yarmolenko will also be crucial. Dynamo have held on to their key man despite him signalling his desire to leave. <strong><em>Peter Chymera</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1e29a3e2b1f34d3b931ff9b50edc2149e40c64f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1e29a3e2b1f34d3b931ff9b50edc2149e40c64f/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dynamo Kyiv\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serhiy Rebrov will be hoping to take his team to the knockout stages for the second year running.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Juventus<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Semi-finals</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Winning the competition would be perfect but I\u2019d settle for a semi-final spot. With the shrewd acquisitions the club have made this summer, we\u2019re in prime position to launch a decent Champions League campaign. Over the years we\u2019ve lost key players in Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba, but replacements such as Miralem Pjanic, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Dani Alves and Juan Cuadrado have settled in nicely. The return of Kwadwo Asamoah could essentially be looked upon as a new signing.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The consistency of Higua\u00edn up front will be vital. He didn\u2019t impress in his previous European spells at Real Madrid and Napoli. He needs to establish a goalscoring partnership with Paulo Dybala. I\u2019m not convinced this is the man to lead the club to Champions League glory. The midfield of Pjanic, Sami Khedira and Claudio Marchisio looks excellent though, and has softened the loss of Pogba considerably. Dani Alves has bags of experience and Mario Manduzkic, Mario Lemina and Stefano Sturaro give the squad sufficient depth for a long campaign. We\u2019ll do well in the competition this year. <strong><em>Hamza</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0709dc62ac5b9d3c2d2b3bd3bd1d32a6cd10dfe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0709dc62ac5b9d3c2d2b3bd3bd1d32a6cd10dfe7/0_0_3500_2290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juventus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juventus players celebrate against Lazio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Rossi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Legia Warsaw<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Group stage</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> Legia have qualified for the Champions League group stage for the first time since the club\u2019s tournament debut back in 1995. They are the first Polish club to do so since 1996, so it\u2019s a great success for Legia and for Polish football. We\u2019re in a very demanding group \u2013 Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Sporting will all fancy maximum points against us \u2013 so it\u2019s going to be extremely hard. </p> <p>It won\u2019t come as a shock if Legia lose most of their matches, but I hope we\u2019ll see some good competitive games. It\u2019s also hard to be optimistic considering Legia\u2019s domestic results this season so far. After eight games in the league, we\u2019re closer to the bottom of the table than the top. We had a lot of luck in the Champions League qualifying rounds too.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> We do have some great players. Our Hungarian centre forward Nemanja Nikolics scored 28 goals in the league last season, Michal Pazdan was one of Poland\u2019s best defenders at Euro 2016 and our veteran goalkeeper Arkadiusz Malarz is the heart of the team. Even if the club finishes bottom of the group, the six group matches will be a great opportunity for our devoted (and loud!) fans to show off their amazing choreographies, flags and other elements that earned them notoriety in their national league. We are in for some epic spectacles that will be remembered for years to come. <strong><em>Lukasz</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b43f72a18faadbac78de1d85b45034c37c51a309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b43f72a18faadbac78de1d85b45034c37c51a309/0_0_4924_3152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LegiaWarsaw fans raise scarves and light flaresduring their Champions League qualifier against Dundalk at the Polish Army Stadium, Warsaw, 23 Aug 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legia Warsaw fans during their qualifier against Dundalk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Press Focus/SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Leicester City<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Round of 16</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Some journalists and pundits have pitying our draw for the lack of a \u201cbig team\u201d but I\u2019m with the majority of fans, who couldn\u2019t be happier. Three fun cities that are relatively close and, more importantly, Leicester have a real chance of progressing. My hopes are to have the same level of excitement as last season, even if it all ends in Group G.<br></p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The key to us performing well will be other teams underestimating us and allowing us to play on the break. We have ridiculous pace and have added depth to the squad, which will allow us to do well in Europe as well as in the league. I\u2019ve just had a my first child so I\u2019m waiting for a good moment to tell my girlfriend that I\u2019m going to all six group games. <strong><em>Tom</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09b8adb24b4a1768f3ce7f34e063ef336e1fa0ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b8adb24b4a1768f3ce7f34e063ef336e1fa0ca/0_0_5184_3448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leicester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Schlupp, Riyad Mahrez and Danny Simpson in training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Imag</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ludogorets</h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Group stage</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>It\u2019s been three years since our memorable run into the last 16 of the Champions League, when the team produced memorable wins over PSV and Dinamo Zagreb in the group stages, and eliminated Lazio in the first knock-out round. Valencia consequently proved too strong over two legs. </p> <p>Since then we have been very disappointing in the Champions League, finishing bottom of our group two seasons ago while not even making it past the second qualifying round last year. So it\u2019s good to be back in the Champions League, although hopes and expectations are paper thin.</p> <p>Our only realistic hope is finishing third and qualifying for the Europa League. That might sound a bit defeatist but realistically Arsenal and PSG are much too strong for us. We\u2019ll need to have a \u201ccup final mentality\u201d every other week and it just isn\u2019t possible. We\u2019ll aim to draw our home games against PSG and Arsenal, while beating Basel at least once. Whatever happens I\u2019ll be at all three homes games in Sofia cheering the team on. <em><strong>Teodor Stoynov</strong></em></p> <h2>Lyon<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Round of 16<br></p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Group H looks highly competitive. Juventus and Sevilla will surely be favourites to progress as they both have a good recent history in European tournaments. We\u2019ll be looking to upset the odds a little bit though, but my expectations before the tournament are low. We should focus on winning our three homes games and try to put on three good away performances in the hope that will get us a few bonus points. Then we\u2019ll see where we can go from there.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>We may have kept hold of Alexandre Lacazette, but he has rejected a contract extension at Lyon so will be on the move sooner rather than later. It\u2019s important this doesn\u2019t overshadow any performances on the pitch and that Nabil Fekir and Lacazette can find the required rhythm. Defensively we need to stay solid and alert if we are to have any chance. It\u2019s a tall order but Lyon will do their best to progress from the group stages. <strong><em>Aditya</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8844aecb266e8b5424f452451bd429a43962567f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8844aecb266e8b5424f452451bd429a43962567f/0_0_4092_3081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lyon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nabil Fekir in action for Lyon against Dijon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Desmazes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Manchester City </h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Winners</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Anything but semi-finals will be a failure. My hopes this season are to win the thing. We have the squad and now, after years of searching, we have the manager. I could take a semi-final exit if we have played well and battled hard, a massive improvement on our damp-squib exit last year. Winning Group C is our first priority. It all depends on our head-to-heads with Barcelona.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>Keeping Sergio Ag\u00fcero fit is essential. Every year he has his injury-laden few months. This normally coincides with the heavy fixture list around early Christmas and it takes time for him to find form again. Hopefully now with Leroy San\u00e9 in the team, the burden can be passed occasionally to keep Sergio fresh for those important away days in Europe. Just as important is making sure we find a solid defensive partnership. Whether that be John Stones and Vincent Kompany or Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, they need have a good understanding by the business end of the season. <strong><em>Ben Anthony</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c994004e5f244407ced3874cd043ed6617d56fa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c994004e5f244407ced3874cd043ed6617d56fa8/0_0_2056_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leroy Sane warms up during a training session ahead of the Champions League qualifier against Steaua Bucharest, 23 Aug 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leroy San\u00e9 in training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: McNulty/JMP/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Monaco<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Winners</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> Ideally I\u2019d like us to win the competition. Our squad isn\u2019t as talented as the \u201cgolden generation\u201d of 1986-87, but it\u2019s decent enough to progress deep into the tournament.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> I have faith in head coach Leonardo Jardim and players like goalkeeper Danijel Suba\u0161i\u0107 will be key to our success. The good times in European football might well be coming back to Stade Loius II this season. <strong><em>Ahmed al-Mansour</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bac391be1dabae1bc322e6f18012a20f523c8948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bac391be1dabae1bc322e6f18012a20f523c8948/0_0_4000_2615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monaco\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic in action against Paris Saint-Germain in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Napoli <br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Round of 16</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>This will be Napoli\u2019s third time in the Champions League in the last five seasons. The last time, under Rafa Ben\u00edtez, Napoli went out despite picking 12 points from their group stage matches \u2013 the only time that ever happened in the tournament\u2019s history. This season expectations are slightly higher, and we expect to progress through Group B relatively easily. But the team is very young so anything can happen.<br></p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> Our ability to defend when under pressure will be the major factor in deciding how far Napoli will go. <strong><em>Giannivo</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4dd854c57dfb1d8c9f0d3d296d45423c2835315\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4dd854c57dfb1d8c9f0d3d296d45423c2835315/0_0_2178_1611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marek Hamsik\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marek Hamsik celebrates after scoring against Palermo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Palazzotto/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Paris Saint-Germain<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Semi-finals<br><br><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Many supporters suggest we are weaker than last season after the loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and a stuttering start to the season. We scraped unconvincing wins against Bastia and Metz before deservedly losing to Monaco before the international break. The latest league game, a 1-1 draw against Saint-Etienne, was hardly convincing either. But with Edinson Cavani and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda returning for the Arsenal game, we should be stronger than our recent league form suggests. Hatem Ben Arfa is frustratingly inconsistent, but this is nothing new.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>If we can get off to a good start against Arsenal, I think we\u2019ll top Group A easily. Particularly as I fancy Arsenal to do one of their specials and drop points away to either Basel or Ludogorets \u2013 or both! In the knockout stages I\u2019d like to see some real progress and only a run into the last four of the competition would leave me completely satisfied. <strong><em>Robert</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed5563e1322e9c99a967df090e8b4bbc4f3f33c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5563e1322e9c99a967df090e8b4bbc4f3f33c1/0_0_5136_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Saint-Germain players take part in a training session on the eve of the UEFA Champions League match against Arsenal at the Ooredoo training centre in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, outside Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paris Saint-Germain players take part in a training session before their match against Arsenal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Porto<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Round of 16<br></p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Realistically I hope we get out of the group and do not meet a European giant until the quarters. The team has improved from last season but it lacks the aggression and discipline required to grind out results. Our defence is slightly improved compared to last year. Brazilian attacking midfielder Ot\u00e1vio and striker Andre Silva can link well, and Yacine Brahimi deciding to stay was positive one. Loan signing \u00d3liver Torres looks exciting and we have enough quality to get out of Group G. We\u2019re still unlikely to trouble any of the big teams though. <strong><em>Daniu</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4fead663132562fad8b826e2f0984e8d834909c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4fead663132562fad8b826e2f0984e8d834909c/0_0_4408_3019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FC Porto players celebrate after scoring a goal against Sporting CP at Estadio Jose Alvalade on August 28, 2016 in Lisbon, Portugal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FC Porto players celebrate after scoring a goal against Sporting CP at Estadio Jose Alvalade on August 28, 2016 in Lisbon, Portugal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>PSV Eindhoven<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Group stage</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>Group D looks too strong for us to progress any further sadly.

Zidane knows how to cope with a squad that is very similar to that of the previous season and his early days as first-team coach have been excellent. There\u2019s no reason he can\u2019t inspire the side to at least have an honest attempt at retaining the trophy.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The key will be in the progress of Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz, who have stepped up from the youth team in a year in which Real Madrid haven\u2019t been allowed to sign anybody. It doesn\u2019t bother me that we have hungry young players challenging the more experienced players though. Both those young players can become extremely useful. <strong><em>Alberto</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb58352f79cddb572a14888e37469d7a38f49ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb58352f79cddb572a14888e37469d7a38f49ca0/0_0_3447_2276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cristiano Ronaldo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cristiano Ronaldo and team-mates in training this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angel Martinez/Real Madrid via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>FC Rostov</em><br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Group stage </p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>I was lucky enough to witness FC Rostov\u2019s incredible run in the Russian Premier League last season. It was nothing short of sensational considering their resources. I hope we can make a good showing of ourselves, but both Bayern and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid will be of a different calibre to any team Rostov have ever faced before. Qualifying for the knockout round is out of the question. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible to think we can get the edge over PSV and take third spot and a Europa League place.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The key to everything at Rostov is team spirit. There\u2019s a great camaraderie among the players and staff; they all seem so happy just to be there. We\u2019re a disciplined unit and strong on the counter-attack. Good performances will be needed, not just from star players Ecuadorian midfielder Christian Noboa, Iranian striker Sardar Azmoun and Dmitry Poloz, but from absolutely everyone.</p> <p>My worry is that, while Rostov have kept many players over the summer, they\u2019ve lost three of their defenders. Bastos went to Serie A side Lazio, Ivan Novoseltsev left for Zenit Saint Petersburg and Boris Rotenberg departed for Lokomotiv Moscow. How a team which relied so much on their defence will cope without these players remains to be properly seen. <strong><em>Dampz</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66ecf3d1bc140b6bc654de21117b534eddbc9340\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66ecf3d1bc140b6bc654de21117b534eddbc9340/0_0_4972_3106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FC Rostov\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saeid Ezatolahi, Alexander Yerokhin, Cesar Navas, Khoren Bairamyan and Alexandru Gatcan celebrate after beating Ajax in qualifying.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Matytsin/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sevilla<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Round of 16</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> Sevilla will find it tough to go through from Group H. Tough, but not impossible. Despite a good start in La Liga this season and some promising signings in the summer, the club is not used to playing against first-class European teams every week. I hope they can face whoever they have to with dignity and professionalism.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> The key point will be to stick with a self-confident starting XI. Experienced footballers such as Samir Nasri and Vitolo can have a huge influence on the rest of the team if they feel inspired on the night. In our home games we need to control the game from start to finish because it will be tough to pick up the required points in Turin and Zagreb on our travels. <strong><em>Rober</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"533e09266d91fc9d228f81f43836d27764c01d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/533e09266d91fc9d228f81f43836d27764c01d02/0_0_3264_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sevilla\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vitolo protests to the referee beside Sevilla coach Jorge Sampaoli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sporting Lisbon<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go?</strong> Round of 16</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes?</strong> If Sporting can win the third match against Dortmund at home, we have a good chance of getting to the last 16. The worst case scenario should be third place and a spot in the Europa League.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed? </strong>The club was able to do some good business in the last few days of the summer transfer window, bringing in Joel Campbell from Arsenal, Dutch forward Bas Dost from Wolfsburg, Elias from Corinthians and Lazar Markovic on loan from Liverpool. If these players settle well, together with the three Portuguese European Champions, Rui Patricio, Adrien Silva and William Carvalho, Sporting have a good chance of causing a slight upset and qualifying for the last 16. The first two games at home against Legia Warsaw and Dortmund will be key. <strong><em>Antonio</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28cb686ce1286ba3f38f29c5b9ce89f711c7bdd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28cb686ce1286ba3f38f29c5b9ce89f711c7bdd9/0_0_2952_1778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sporting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"602\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gelson Martins celebrates with team-mates after scoring during the league against Porto in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tottenham Hotspur<br></h2> <p><strong>How far will you go? </strong>Quarter-finals</p> <p><strong>What are your hopes? </strong>I\u2019m very positive for once. In the group draw I either wanted some European heavyweights to test ourselves properly or what we\u2019ve got \u2013 a couple of the weakest opponents from pots one and two. The away games will be testing. Moscow is never an easy place to visit but CSKA aren\u2019t such a European force these days. Let\u2019s just hope the recent Euros fan fighting is not repeated. We\u2019ve a good recent record against Monaco, drawing away and hammering them at home in last season\u2019s Europa League, while Bayer Leverkusen gave us Dimitar Berbatov 10 years ago. Let\u2019s hope they remain as generous.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be very disappointed not to qualify from the group. I have no delusions of actually winning the thing but think we should be aiming for a quarter-final spot and ideally a big scalp along the way. If you\u2019re going to be in it, then it\u2019s only really interesting if you can test yourself against the best.</p> <p><strong>What do you need to succeed?</strong> Organisation and workrate are key and these are Potch\u2019s magic ingredients that has allowed the undoubted talent to bloom so far. Having in-form key players will also help enormously.

  "<p>Campaigners have attacked the government for rejecting calls by MPs for greater action on air pollution, as severe pollution episodes were predicted for parts of the UK this week.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\">MPs warned in April</a> that dangerously high pollution in British cities was a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d, and told ministers to take further measures, including more clean air zones and a diesel scrappage scheme.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmenvfru/665/665.pdf\">its formal response</a> on Tuesday, officials claimed that the government was already spending heavily on cleaner transport and that it plans to consult on a framework for clean air zones later this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe will introduce new, tougher targets which will drive down air pollution from all sources, reducing transboundary pollution and significantly reducing the number of premature deaths across the EU caused by poor air quality,\u201d said the response.</p> <p>The MPs had wanted all cities to be able to charge polluting vehicles instead of just the five which government is planning to allow. But officials responded: \u201cLocal authorities can take action as and when necessary to improve air quality and we encourage them to do so.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201c[The government] has established the UK as a global leader in ultra low-emission vehicles. We are one of the largest and fastest growing markets in Europe and last year around one in five battery electric cars sold in the UK was built in the UK\u201d.<br></p> <p>It also flatly rejected the idea of a diesel scrappage scheme: \u201cWe have considered the use of scrappage schemes ... and have concluded that this may not be an appropriate and proportionate response.\u201d</p> <p>The publication came as <a href=\"https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/forecasting/\">the environment department warned of \u201cvery high\u201d air pollution</a> \u2013 the worst on the scale \u2013 in and around Hull on Wednesday, and \u201chigh\u201d pollution across much of northern England.

In <a href=\"https://greenallianceblog.org.uk/2016/09/12/a-strategy-to-solve-air-inequality-and-keep-britain-moving/\">an article on the Green Alliance thinktank\u2019s blog</a>, Stephen Heidari-Robinson said that: \u201c[court action] focuses on compliance with EU standards for just one pollutant, rather than addressing the problem holistically to save lives\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWorse, it encourages the belief that Brexit can simply sweep away the problem (it can\u2019t). Second, it sets up a zero sum game \u2013 ban cars, save lives \u2013 when, to solve the problem with the consent of the population, we need to improve air quality and maintain mobility. And, third, it scares the hell out of officials who might end up in court and diverts their attention towards feeding the legal document monster.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement ClientEarth chief executive, James Thornton, said court action was a last, but necessary, resort. \u201cIt is necessary ... particularly when tens of thousands of lives are at risk because an intransigent government persistently fails to comply with the law, which is where we find ourselves on air pollution in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWhat sort of democracy would we be living in if we as citizens have to comply with the laws put in place by government, but ministers can ignore them when they feel like it? Many autocrats enjoy such an ability to ignore the law. But since Magna Carta, we have committed to live under the rule of law, government and citizen alike.\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The government is being urged to take immediate action to prevent millions of families from having their lives put at risk from faulty and potentially deadly tumble driers which have sparked a series of fires in the UK.</p> <p>Labour backbencher <a href=\"http://www.andyslaughter.co.uk\">Andy Slaughter</a> will use a House of Commons adjournment debate on Tuesday to warn that lives could be lost unless domestic appliances found to be faulty are taken out of use and urgently recalled.</p> <p>The Hammersmith MP said the government had failed to stand up to the \u201cpowerful industry lobby\u201d representing white goods manufacturers. He urged ministers to instruct Whirlpool and other companies to change their advice to customers and insists that faulty appliances that may cause fires be recalled and replaced. </p> <p>The Hammersmith MP will single out the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/19/fire-crews-tackle-blaze-at-shepherds-bush-tower-block-london\">blaze in Shepherd\u2019s Bush</a>, London \u2013 in his constituency \u2013 which ripped through an18-storey block of flats and took 120 firefighters to put out. It was allegedly started by a faulty Indesit (owned by Whirlpool) tumble dryer that was subject to \u201ccorrective action\u201d by the manufacturer and due to be seen by an engineer.<br></p> <p>Ahead of the debate, Slaughter said: \u201cDespite this incident, and others like it, Whirlpool are continuing to advise consumers that it is safe to use their tumble dryers, and are offering free repairs or a replacement machine for a reduced price. However, given that these machines clearly pose a serious risk to life and property, Whirlpool\u2019s response is highly inadequate, and possibly dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>The he London Fire Brigade, UK\u2019s biggest, advised consumers to stop using tumble dryers that are subject to product recall or safety notices following the blaze. Its Total Recalls campaign, Which? and \u2018Expect it\u2019s safe\u2019 set up by solicitors Leigh Day who represent many of the victims of white goods fires, have offered similar advice.</p> <p>Whirlpool is in the process of replacing or repairing 4.3m potentially faulty machines across the UK \u2013 under the brand names Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda and Proline \u2013 after identifying a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/24/indesit-and-hotpoint-issue-fire-risk-warnings-over-tumble-dryers\">safety defect </a>in November. More than 810,000 machines have since been repaired or replaced, Slaughter added, leaving more than 3m households still at risk.</p> <p>On 19 August, Debbie Defreitas was in the kitchen of her home on the seventh floor of Shepherds Court, when she became aware of a burning smell and, because her Indesit tumble dryer was the only device switched on, unplugged it and pulled it from the wall. Firefighters who came to the scene found the fire had already taken hold. Over 100 families were evacuated and 26 given temporary accommodation in hotels. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhat is most remarkable is that apart from three minor injuries, no one was hurt in the blaze, though the trauma, especially for those who witnessed the worst of the fire, may well have a longer-term effect,\u201d Slaughter will say in the debate. \u201cWe await the publication of investigations into the Shepherds Court fire, but one thing is already clear; Mrs Defreitas was following to the letter the advice given her by Whirlpool. Despite a fault affecting millions of dryers supplied by the company\u2019s brands, they continue to tell customers \u2018you may continue to use your tumble dryer whilst waiting for the modification, however, we require that you do not leave your dryer unattended during operation\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Whirlpool said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cThe safety of consumers is our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that the tumble dryer modification programme is carried out in a safe and timely manner. We urge everyone who owns an Indesit, Hotpoint or Creda dryer manufactured between April 2004 and September 2015 to check if their dryer is affected and then register for a free modification if it is. They can do this using the model checker on two websites we have created,<a href=\"https://safety.hotpoint.eu/\"> Safety.hotpoint</a> and<a href=\"https://safety.indesit.eu/\"> Safety.indesit</a>, or our freephone helpline on <a href=\"tel:0800%20151%200905\">0800 151 0905</a> for the UK or 1800 804320 for Ireland.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>The votes are in for this month\u2019s Reading group, and after a close contest featuring nominations for more than a dozen of HG Wells\u2019s novels, not to mention a good number of short stories, Tono-Bungay has come out on top.</p> <p>This is a decision that Wells himself might have liked. Tono-Bungay is an often funny book, but its author took it far more seriously than he did most of his output. \u201cI have to admit that the larger part of my fiction was written lightly and with a certain haste,\u201d he confessed in his autobiography, but he singled out Tono-Bungay as one of the exceptions.</p> <p>It took him longer to write, for a start. Wells turned out classics such as The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds in a matter of months, but he worked on Tono-Bungay over a number of years. Admittedly, he also turned out quite a few other books at the same time, but the fact that he started it in 1906 and it was only serialised (by Ford Madox Ford in his English Review) in late 1908 was fairly unusual. </p> <p>Wells said that he saw Tono-Bungay as a book on \u201cDickens-Thackeray lines\u201d and that \u201cI shall never come as near to a deliberate attempt upon The Novel again as I did in Tono-Bungay\u201d. He published his autobiography in 1934 (some of it anyway; <a href=\"https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571247189-h-g-wells-in-love.html\">an extra volume about his sex life came out posthumously</a>). That was a good 12 years before his death, but he never did manage to produce a more complete and successful conventional novel. </p> <p>Mind you, even for Tono-Bungay, \u201cconventional\u201d probably isn\u2019t the right word. Wells also wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even Tono-Bungay was not much of a concession to Henry James and his conception of an intensified rendering of feeling and characterisation as the proper business of the novelist. It was an indisputable Novel, but it was extensive rather than intensive. That is to say it presented characters only as part of a scene. It was planned as a social panorama in the vein of Balzac.</p> </blockquote> <p>That reference to Henry James needs some explanation. An interesting thing about HG Wells is that no matter how famous he became, no matter how successful and no matter how influential, he always carried a chip on his shoulder (one of several things he has in common with George, the hero of Tono-Bungay). Wells never felt entirely accepted as a man of letters, possibly because he came from a more humble background than most successful Edwardian writers. And partly because, even at the turn of the 20th century, there was a certain snobbery about people who wrote about scientific ideas and philosophical and historical concepts rather than the higher emotional life of the mind. A snobbery it would be easy to suggest was embodied by Henry James.</p> <p>Although, as often, Wells was being slightly unjust to James in that autobiographical quote. Certainly, if you look at one of James\u2019s relatively early essays on the art of fiction, he\u2019s more lenient than Wells suggests. He asks, for instance (with typical deliberation): \u201cWhat is character but the determination of incident? What is incident but the illustration of character? What is a picture or a novel that is not of character?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://public.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/artfiction.html\">If you read the rest of that essay</a>, you\u2019ll discover many more delicate, thoughtfully ambivalent ideas about the importance of character. And, if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll also discover you\u2019ve got something of a headache: the James sentence is, as Wells famously described it, \u201ca delicate creature swathed in relative clauses as an invalid in shawls\u201d.</p> <p>Wells\u2019s prose was always more forceful and direct, his writing more fun to read. Which is possibly why James also stuck the knife into his one-time friend (and close neighbour while Wells was writing Tono-Bungay). The American wrote an article in the Times Literary Supplement in 1914 lumping Wells in with a generation of authors producing \u201caffluents turbid and unrestrained\u201d. Wells responded by dedicating a whole chunk of his experimental novel Boon to making fun of James and those relative clauses, and having a \u201ccomplimentary\u201d copy delivered to James at the Reform Club on Pall Mall. James was mortified. He wrote a stiff letter to Wells complaining about the fact that Wells had found him so \u201cfutile and void\u201d. There followed a desperate and sad exchange in which Wells tried to claim that Boon was nothing more than \u201ca waste-paper basket\u201d and reasserted his admiration for James. But James pointed out that the contents of wastepaper baskets weren\u2019t normally published, condemned Wells\u2019s bad manners and drew a line under their friendship. James died soon after, leaving Wells smarting \u2013 and prickly ever after.</p> <p>All of which explains why Wells was at once so keen to have Tono-Bungay measured against James\u2019s yardstick \u2013 and so ambivalent about what that actually meant. I\u2019m not entirely sure either. But at least that odd quote shows the special feeling Wells had for this book and proves his desire for it to be taken seriously. Hopefully, by the end of this month on the Reading group we\u2019ll also have a clearer idea about those characters and how \u201cintensively\u201d they\u2019ve been rendered, not to mention the social panorama into which Wells said he put them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/13/hg-wells-visions-of-the-future-remain-unsurpassed\">HG Wells\u2019s prescient visions of the future remain unsurpassed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until then, of course, the thing to do is to take the advice of another of Wells\u2019s famous friends (and later on his enemy, too) DH Lawrence: \u201cRead, read Tono-Bungay, it is a great book.\u201d</p> <p>To further that end, we have five copies of <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/60368/tono-bungay/\">the Penguin Classics edition</a> to give away to the first five readers from the UK to post \u201cI want a copy please\u201d, along with a nice, constructive comment in the comments section below.

  "<p>Edward Snowden has set out the case for Barack Obama granting him a pardon before the US president leaves office in January, arguing that the disclosure of the scale of surveillance by US and British intelligence agencies was not only morally right but had left citizens better off.</p> <p>The US whistleblower\u2019s comments, made in an interview with the Guardian, came as supporters, including his US lawyer, stepped up a campaign for a presidential pardon. Snowden is wanted in the US, where he is accused of violating the Espionage Act and faces at least 30 years in jail. </p> <p>Speaking on Monday via a video link from Moscow, where he is in exile, Snowden said any evaluation of the consequences of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\">leak of tens of thousands of National Security Agency and GCHQ documents in 2013</a> would show clearly that people had benefited.</p> <p>\u201cYes, there are laws on the books that say one thing, but that is perhaps why the pardon power exists \u2013 for the exceptions, for the things that may seem unlawful in letters on a page but when we look at them morally, when we look at them ethically, when we look at the results, it seems these were necessary things, these were vital things,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think when people look at the calculations of benefit, it is clear that in the wake of 2013 the laws of our nation changed.

On Monday he said that at that time he expected a \u201cdark end\u201d in which he was either killed or jailed in the US.</p> <p>More than three years on, he appears cheerful and relaxed. He has avoided the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/30/bradley-manning-wikileaks-judge-verdict\">fate of fellow whistleblower Chelsea Manning</a>, who is in solitary confinement in the US. Snowden is free to communicate with supporters and chats online late into the night. </p> <p>His 2.3 million followers on Twitter give him a huge platform to express his views. He works on tools to try to help journalists. He is not restricted to Moscow and has travelled around Russia, and his family in the US have been to visit him.</p> <p>But Snowden still wants to return to the US and seems confident, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that it will happen. \u201cIn the fullness of time, I think I will end up back home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the officials, who felt like they had to protect the programmes, their positions, their careers, have left government and we start looking at things from a more historical perspective, it will be pretty clear that this war on whistleblowers does not serve the interests of the United States; rather it harms them.\u201d</p> <p>Snowden attracts lots of conspiracy theories. Early on, he was accused of being a spy for China and then a Russian spy. In August a cryptic tweet followed by an unusual absence prompted speculation that he was dead. He said he had simply gone on holiday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765136486417231872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZgIkapmcOC\">pic.twitter.com/ZgIkapmcOC</a></p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765136486417231872\">August 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There had also been rumours that his partner, Lindsay Mills, had left him, which would have been embarrassing as their romance occupies a large part of the Stone film. Snowden said \u201cshe is with me and we are very happy\u201d.</p> <p>His revelations resulted in a global debate and modest legislative changes. More significant, perhaps, is that surveillance and the impact of technological change has seeped into popular culture, in films such as the latest Jason Bourne and television series, such as the Good Wife.</p> <p>Snowden also welcomed \u201ca renaissance of scepticism\u201d on the part of at least some journalists when confronted by anonymous briefings by officials not backed by evidence.<br></p> <p>He warned three years ago of the danger that one day there might be a president who abused the system. The warning failed to gain much traction, given that Obama\u2019s presidency seemed relatively benign. But it resonates more today, in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s response to <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12298664/trump-dnc-hacking-power\">the Russian hacking of the Democratic party</a>: that he wished he had the power to hack into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.</p> <p>If Obama, as seems likely, declines to pardon Snowden, his chances under either Clinton or Trump would seem to be even slimmer. He described the 2016 presidential race as unprecedented \u201cin terms of the sort of authoritarian policies that are being put forward\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, many candidates in the political mainstream today, even pundits and commentators who aren\u2019t running for office, believe we have to be able to do anything, no matter what, as long as there is some benefit to be had in doing so. But that is the logic of a police state.\u201d</p> <p>He is even less impressed by the British prime minister, referring to Theresa May as a \u201ca sort of Darth Vader in the United Kingdom\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/theresa-may-review-snoopers-charter-surveillance-powers-concession\">whose surveillance bill</a> is \u201can egregious violation of human rights, that goes far further than any law proposed in the western world\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f843a406cd94dcc82a8f788f4eec6758e743458d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f843a406cd94dcc82a8f788f4eec6758e743458d/0_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May and Edward Snowden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snowden has criticised May\u2019s surveillance bill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snowden was initially berated by opponents for failing to criticise the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but he has become increasingly vocal. It is a potentially risky move, given his application for an extension of asylum is up for renewal next year, so why do it?</p> <p>\u201cWell, it would not be the first time I have taken a risk for something I believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a complex situation. Russia is not my area of focus. It is not my area of expertise. I don\u2019t speak Russian in a fluent manner that I could really participate in and influence policy. But when something happens that I believe is clearly a violation of the right thing, I believe we should stand up and say something about it.</p> <p>\u201cMy priority always has to be my own country rather than Russia. I would like to help reform the human rights situation in Russia but I will never be well placed to do so relative to actual Russian activists themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Might he end up as part of a US-Russian prisoner exchange, with Putin possibly more amenable to the idea if Trump was in power? \u201cThere has always been the possibility that any government could say, \u2018Well, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of human rights, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of law, it will be beneficial to use this individual as a bargaining chip\u2019. This is not exclusive to me. This happens to activists around the world every day.\u201d</p> <p>He said he saw the Stone film as a mechanism for getting people to talk about surveillance, though he felt uncomfortable with other people telling his story.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/28/edward-snowden-nsa-trailer-oliver-stone-thriller-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ty9f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2495625\"            data-video-name=\"Snowden: the trailer for Oliver Stone\u2019s thriller \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Open Road Films\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5721dac1e4b02c55b6401323\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/28/160428snowden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11443130&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/28/160428snowden_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/28/160428snowden_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/28/160428snowden.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/28/edward-snowden-nsa-trailer-oliver-stone-thriller-video\">Snowden: the trailer for Oliver Stone\u2019s thriller</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Snowden has toyed with writing his memoirs but has not made much progress.

  "<p><br>Saturday 3 September, 6.30am, and my alarm clock goes off far too early. I\u2019m in a B&amp;B in England\u2019s Lake District, and I\u2019ve had hardly any sleep, tossing and turning and fretting all night. I groan, swear, and growl to my room mate and swimming partner in crime, Hilary: \u201cWhy the hell am I doing this?\u201d It\u2019s a rhetorical question \u2013 I certainly don\u2019t want an answer. She laughs. I look out of the window into the rugged countryside below. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not raining. Yet.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\">We are here, in the middle of nowhere, because six months ago, with much bravado, we signed up to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.chillswim.com/\">Chillswim Coniston</a>, an open-air swim . At 5.25 miles \u2013 around 8.5km \u2013 the lake, Coniston Water, is the third longest lake in the Lake District.</p> <p>As always before these things, I\u2019m impossibly anxious, grumpy and cross with myself for entering. I force down some porridge, grimacing the whole time. Poor Hilary is probably battling her own pre-event nerves, but mine are definitely shouting the loudest at the breakfast table.</p> <p>Soon we are at a local school in the town of Coniston, for pre-race registration: queueing up to collect timing chips for our ankles, bands with race numbers for our wrists, swimming caps that indicate which wave we are swimming in, and tow floats that we must tether to our waists to aid visibility in the water. The school is a hive of activity, not least because over 600 swimmers have signed up. </p> <p>Swimmers start boarding buses to take them to the other end of the lake for the start. The race is set off in waves \u2013 with slowest starting first. My wave is boarding the bus. I give Hilary a stiff hug and frown and say, ominously, \u201cSee you on the other side,\u201d as I board.</p> <p>As the buses travel the length of the lake, I try to not pay attention to how far it seems. The bus is full of swimmers chattering nervously. I try to join in but am not finding it very easy. I hate this bit. The bus stops by the side of a road and we spill out into the fresh air and pick our way, bare footed, through a field to the start of the race.</p> <p>The race director briefs us for the event and we\u2019re off. There is no gun, or mass start, we just gently queue to get into the water, walk over a timing mat, dive or shuffle in, and start to swim. And so it begins.</p> <p>I always hate the start. I\u2019m pumping with adrenalin, I swim into people and they into me. I can\u2019t get my rhythm. And then inevitably everyone streaks off ahead and I feel utterly utterly disconsolate. Why the hell am I putting myself through this? Again? Seriously, Sally!</p> <p>There is a wide open section to the first mile marker. I curse every single person who told me this is a beautiful swim. I want to get out. I will get out. I can get out. I pass the first mile marker. OK. There is then a beautiful section between an island and the side of the lake which is calm and interesting, and I feel a tiny bit better. The first feed station (a little boat, where volunteers will hand us cups of energy drink) is at 1.5 miles. There are exit points at each feed where you can \u201cDNF\u201d or withdraw yourself from the race. I look at the shore where medics are waiting to help people who want to stop. I sigh and swim on. I swim to the next mile marker quite happily. At the second feed I realise it\u2019s 2.5 miles in and I\u2019m almost half way. I take a feed and swim on.</p> <p>My left shoulder suddenly really hurts. I\u2019ve never had a sore shoulder while swimming before. The next mile is a complete slog. I\u2019m being overtaken by more and more people. As I come to the 3.5 mile feed I again eye up the medics on the shore and contemplate a DNF. But as I\u2019m feeding I notice the wind has really picked up. There is a strong tailwind, which will help. I decide to carry on. Instead of swimming in towards the shelter of the shore, as some have, I head further into the more exposed bit of the lake and have a great half an hour or so body surfing the waves. I stretch my stroke out further and glide on the waves. The wind is lifting my feet and pushing me along. I love it. I reach the 4 mile marker and know that it\u2019s almost over. I take another feed and head towards the final mile marker, and for home. Finally, well over 4 hours after I started, I\u2019ve finished my swim and stagger up the finish ramp to cheering.</p> <p>At 5.25 miles, swimming Coniston is not an insubstantial challenge. Most people will take between three and four hours to complete it. Despite this, over 600 people took part, making it one of the longest mass participation swims in the UK. Unlike some other rival events, you don\u2019t need to be a member of any swimming organisation to take part \u2013 you just pay a one-off entrance fee. What\u2019s more the swim is billed more as a \u201csportif\u201d event \u2013 with the emphasis on completion rather than racing (although, of course, some people swim to win). And while the majority choose to wear wetsuits \u2013 only around 80 out of 600 didn\u2019t \u2013 all are welcomed. All of these factors mean that many people who probably wouldn\u2019t have ever contemplated swimming such a long distance are signing up to challenge themselves.</p> <p>At the start, waiting to enter the water, I was one of the handful of people who had chosen to swim in just a swimming costume. A wetsuit-clad person beside me looked me up and down and, nodding approval, said: \u201cYou\u2019re a real swimmer\u201d. I felt proud, and slightly superior. I have long held a healthy scepticism for wetsuit swimming and feel sad that almost everyone thinks that it\u2019s an essential bit of kit for swimming outdoors.</p> <p>However, I can\u2019t argue with the popularity of Chillswim Coniston. I can\u2019t argue with the sheer number of people who have challenged themselves to swim a long way in fairly grisly conditions and spend several hours swimming in the rain and cold. I can\u2019t argue with the camaraderie of sharing the journey with swimmers of all shapes and sizes and ages and abilities, of knowing that probably many people were just as miserable as I was but still toughed it out. I can\u2019t argue that it\u2019s a bloody long way to swim for anyone. I can\u2019t argue with the popularisation of swimming long distances. Quite frankly, we were all real swimmers on Saturday.</p> <p><br><em>Despite all of the misery and grumbling, Sally has already signed up for a 9k swim in Wales next July and is contemplating swimming the length of Ullswater (7 miles) next year \u2013 it\u2019s one of the few lakes in the lake district that she hasn\u2019t swum \u2026<br></em><em><br></em><em>For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.chillswim.com/\">chillswim.com</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Amid a startling array of weaponry and defensive gear, several exhibitors at Urban Shield, the annual northern California police exhibition, were displaying robots similar to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/10/dallas-police-reveal-details-of-bomb-carrying-robot-it-used-as-last-resort\">model that was used to kill</a> the gunman who fatally shot five Dallas officers in July.</p> <p>\u201cYou could do the same thing with our robot,\u201d said Dan Murphy of ICOR Technology.

Either way, the bad guys are going down.\u201d</p> <p>Both ICOR and Tactical Electronics sell robots to the military and to law enforcement.

  "<p>Amber Amour sat on the floor of the bathroom, waiting for the man who had just raped her in the shower to put his clothes on and leave.</p> <p>She was angry, shaken, disgusted, hurt. She had little faith that the criminal justice system would do anything to help her. But she wasn\u2019t helpless. </p> <p>\u201cI was like, well, I have myself,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI have my followers \u2013 I should at least be able to count on them.\u201d</p> <p>Amour took a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/-Wv1aZCykc/\">photo of herself</a>. Her face is a mask of anguish. She is huddled on the ground, clasping her knees to her chest, tears sliding down her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cI have all those fucked-up feelings that we get after rape,\u201d she wrote in the caption, \u201cshame, disgust, suffering. I\u2019m here, alone, and any DNA has been wiped away in the shower. The South African police will just roll their eyes when I walk in. Feeling sicker than ever now.\u201d</p> <p>She hit publish and shared the image with her 20,000 Instagram followers. </p> <p>Over the next few hours, the 27-year-old returned to Instagram to publish a chronicle of rape\u2019s aftermath. In <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/-Zf2fQCyv7/\">another photograph</a>, her knees poke out of a hospital gown. Her feet are in stirrups. Her body is a crime scene. </p> <p>\u201cMy view of the rape kit,\u201d Amour wrote. \u201cThank you all for being so loving &amp; supportive during this time \u2026 For those who wish to BLAME ME or any other survivor out there, I want you to know that you are the very reason that I am so brutally honest.\u201d</p> <p>For every supportive \u201cwithout consent it is rape\u201d response to Amour\u2019s posts, there was at least one \u201cthis bitch is a liar\u201d. Social media is an imperfect tool for responding to a crime that has been around for thousands of years.</p> <p>But an increasing number of women are using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other platforms for justice they say they cannot find in a court of law. Arguing that the legal system can treat them worse than a rapist, they are taking control of their stories, warning other women and exacting very public punishment.</p> <p>The mainstream media has covered allegations of sexual assault against porn actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/04/how-stoya-took-on-james-deen-and-broke-the-porn-industrys-silence\">James Deen</a>, poet <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/is-this-the-end-of-the-era-of-the-important-inappropri-1765684275\">Thomas Sayers Ellis</a>, rock star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/26/michael-gira-swans-accused-larkin-grimm\">Michael Gira</a>, music publicist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/20/dirty-projectors-amber-coffman-sexual-harassment-allegation-heathcliff-berru\">Heathcliff Berru</a>, Tor developer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/06/jacob-appelbaum-tor-denies-assault-allegations\">Jacob Appelbaum</a>, and comedians <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/cale-hartmann-responds-to-beth-stellings-claims.html\">Cale Hartmann</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/improv-comic-banned-ucb-theatre-rape-allegations-article-1.2755492\">Aaron Glaser</a> \u2013 all of which originated in social media postings. </p> <p>The risks, however, are great \u2013 and the protections few \u2013 for the survivors and the men they accuse online. Critics call the accusers \u201cdigital vigilantes\u201d. At least one website allows anonymous women to accuse men by name. Those who post damning accusations open themselves up to costly libel suits. </p> <p>\u201cHonestly, the comments, they were worse [than the police] because they were ongoing,\u201d Armour said. \u201cMy story is ongoing. I\u2019m constantly being bombarded with dozens and dozens of messages telling me that it was all my fault.\u201d </p> <p>Not surprisingly, most people who are raped do not turn to law enforcement for help. For every 1,000 rapes in America, 344 are reported to police, 63 reports lead to an arrest, 13 cases get referred to prosecutors, and seven will lead to a felony conviction, according to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\">Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network</a>. Only six rapists out of 1,000 will be put behind bars.</p> <p>\u201cEven with the advances we\u2019ve made, going through the justice system is an ordeal and still, most rapists are not convicted,\u201d said Patti Giggans, executive director of the advocacy group Peace Over Violence, which got its start 45 years ago as the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Rape shield laws in most states protect victims from having their past sex lives introduced as evidence. But turning to the justice system forces people who have been raped to relive the trauma. And even when victims are willing to go to trial, prosecutors generally will not take cases that boil down to the victim\u2019s word against the suspect\u2019s.</p> <p>By turning to social media, Giggans said: \u201cThere\u2019s no trial, no real way to have any kind of judicial rendering. That\u2019s part of the reason [people] do it. One could say that it is a form of vigilantism.\u201d</p> <p>A form with deep historical roots. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, activists in Los Angeles would go into the workplaces of men they believed to be batterers and harass them on behalf of abused women.</p> <p>Public shaming has been used \u201cin every society for a thousand years at least\u201d, said Catherine Fisk, a professor of law at University of California, Irvine. \u201cThere are lots of people throughout history who have used speaking out when they felt the legal system was not protecting their rights.\u201d </p> <p>While historical vigilantes may have been armed with pitchforks and torches (or pamphlets), digital vigilantes threaten their targets\u2019 Google search results. </p> <p>Daniel Trottier, an assistant professor of media and communication at Erasmus University Rotterdam, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-016-0216-4\">describes</a> the impact of such campaigns as \u201cweaponised visibility\u201d: an intentional violation of the target\u2019s privacy through the widespread (and likely permanent) dissemination of negative facts. </p> <p>The destruction of a person\u2019s online reputation is no small thing in an age when every employer, landlord and potential romantic partner relies on Google as a free and easy background check. </p> <p>And it\u2019s not only the intended targets who are harmed. </p> <p>Whitney M Phillips, an assistant professor at Mercer University and the author of a <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-we-cant-have-nice-things\">book</a> on internet trolls, said that while she unequivocally supports the right of survivors of sexual assault \u201cto share their stories however they choose, whenever they choose, wherever they choose, with whomever they choose\u201d, she is wary of the unintended consequences of social media vigilantism.</p> <p>\u201cSomething that you do or say or post now can be taken and recombined and re-harnessed for negative ends and without your knowledge or consent. It sets people up to be re-violated, and if the original harm is violation, that\u2019s really scary.\u201d</p> <p>Or, as singer-songwriter and musician Larkin Grimm put it: \u201cFirst you get raped by a person, then you get raped by the media, then you get raped by the commenters. Then, if you take it to the justice system, they\u2019re going to rape you too.\u201d</p> <p>Grimm used Facebook on 25 February to accuse Thomas Sayers Ellis \u2013 a prominent poet and the leader of the band Grimm was playing in at the time \u2013 of sexual harassment. </p> <p>\u201cI do not believe in Facebook witch-hunts or mob justice,\u201d she <a href=\"http://www.brooklynvegan.com/larkin-grimm-ac/\">wrote</a>, but she had turned to social media after attempting to report the harassment to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and being informed that, as a freelancer, she had no legal recourse. </p> <p>After she posted the allegations, Grimm said several of her bandmates accused her of \u201clynching\u201d Ellis, who is black. She decided she could no longer remain silent about another incident that she had kept secret for eight years and posted on Facebook that, in 2008, the frontman of the band Swans, Michael Gira, had raped her. </p> <p>The fallout from both allegations was explosive. The music press quickly picked up on the allegation against the rock star. (Gira <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mgira/posts/10201368018239159\">initially called</a> the allegations \u201ca slanderous lie\u201d and later issued a <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/63799-swans-michael-gira-issues-statement-on-rape-accusations-larkin-grimm-responds/\">statement</a> characterizing the incident as \u201ca consensual romantic moment that fortunately was not consummated\u201d and an \u201cill-advised tryst\u201d. He declined to comment for this article.) </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the literary world, a \u201ccollective\u201d of anonymous writers submitted a lengthy dossier of allegations against Ellis to Vida, a non-profit organization best known for its annual publication of the gender breakdown of bylines in magazines.</p> <p>Vida <a href=\"http://www.vidaweb.org/statements-against-silence/\">published</a> the \u201csample of de-identified disclosures\u201d on its blog, characterizing the allegations as a \u201ca system of disturbing sexual and professional misconduct within and beyond learning spaces\u201d. The allegations range from the criminal (anal rape) to the obscure (a lengthy diary of a relationship that concludes with an account of bad but consensual sex). </p> <p>Grimm says the torrent of online abuse after her allegations went viral was in some ways worse than being raped.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time my phone buzzed, I would get a rush of adrenaline and my heart would start pounding, as if someone set off a load of fireworks,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWhereas the aftermath of being raped was just depression. This was like I felt constantly under attack and like my life was at risk.\u201d </p> <p>*****</p> <p>Grimm and others who turn to social media for justice are at risk in many ways. Their online targets could sue them for defamation. Even if the accused rapists lose in civil court, the rape victims would have to spend money to defend themselves. The details of the alleged attack would be aired publicly and the victims would have to relive the trauma.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the damage to men accused of rape. The US legal system is based on the concept that people accused of crimes have the right to defend themselves and face their accusers. Even though <a href=\"http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/the_voice_vol_3_no_1_2009.pdf\">rigorous studies</a> have shown that only 2% to 8% of rape reports are false, that\u2019s little comfort to the wrongly accused.</p> <p>\u201cThe judicial system is a terrible way to solve these problems, but it\u2019s the best one we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Nina Ginsberg, a vice-president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. \u201cUnless you\u2019re talking about an out-and-out violent rape where someone is physically captured and raped, these are really complicated cases.\u201d</p> <p>At best, the justice meted out by internet vigilantism is uneven. For some, the professional consequences are swift and substantial. </p> <p>Deen was dropped by several porn companies, Appelbaum by several internet security organizations. Ellis, the poet, was <a href=\"http://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/education/university-of-iowa/2016/05/10/iowa-writers-workshop-thomas-sayers-ellis-jezebel-vida-university-poetry/82375208/\">removed from the classroom</a> at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop and appears to have dropped out of the literary scene entirely, though he continues to perform with his band. Glaser has been \u201cblackballed\u201d by the New York comedy scene and has had to move back in with his parents, his attorney said. </p> <p>Cale Hartmann\u2019s ex-girlfriend, comedian Beth Stelling, posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/_2AwgCQzty/\">photographs of bruises</a> on Instagram with a caption alleging that she had been \u201cverbally, physically abused and raped\u201d by the comedian. Hartmann gave a rare post-allegation <a href=\"https://www.compoundmedia.com/shows/the-gavin-mcinnes-show-184/578d8881fb72820d750207d1/\">interview</a> to Gavin McInnes, the co-founder of Vice Media who hosts a podcast on Compound Media. (Hartmann declined to speak with the Guardian.)</p> <p>Six months after Stelling\u2019s allegations went viral, Hartmann said his career was in ruins, he had been abandoned by his friends, and he had to leave LA to live \u201cwith my mommy in Philadelphia\u201d. </p> <p>Ultimately, Hartmann complained that he had not be able to defend himself in court. \u201cPlease, please go to the police,\u201d he said. \u201cTake me to court. Try to put me in jail. I would love that.\u201d </p> <p>Given the rate of successful US rape prosecutions, it is no surprise that he would prefer an official trial to a digital one.</p> <p>But for others, serious allegations seem not to have had much material impact.</p> <p>After releasing a new Swans album in June, Gira sat for interviews with the likes of <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/06/swans-michael-gira-on-dissolving-his-bands-current-lineup\">Vanity Fair</a> without facing questions about the rape allegations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Gira\u2019s accuser, Grimm, has found that sharing her story has undone years of work building her reputation as a musician. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me to be known as an artist,\u201d she said. \u201cNow if people Google me, they get my rape story.\u201d </p> <p>Despite all of the backlash she has faced, however, Amour said that she would not do anything different today.</p> <p>\u201cMe telling my story was my own form of justice,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it. I don\u2019t regret anything.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The man sitting next to me on a Montreal bus in the late 1950s was reading a newspaper printed on the incredibly thin paper used at the time for air mail. I was utterly fascinated and asked him about the paper. He had finished with it, gave it to me, and I have been reading the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a> ever since.</p> <p>I start with World roundup, then scan all the pages for an overview, then go back to read what first caught my attention. In-depth articles are my favourite; they get underlined and comments scribbled in the margins. Old copies of the paper end up at the cottage, to be read by visitors. My Guardian Weekly is indispensable as potent ammunition for winning debates with conservatives. I taught geography and urban planning at the University of Toronto and often used the Guardian Weekly for current affairs background to some of my lectures.</p> <p>I\u2019m now retired and live in Oakville, a Toronto-region suburb. When I read the Guardian Weekly in our coffee shops here I get some puzzled looks because the paper doesn\u2019t look Canadian. But many people do recognise it since there is a large ex-pat British community here. I love it when I get co-conspiratorial nods of approval.</p> <p>Oakville is an affluent town that typically votes Conservative.

  "<p>There are many reasons to criticise James Cameron\u2019s record-breaking weepie Titanic but one of the most frustrating reminders of its success lies in Hollywood\u2019s repetitive treatment of historical tragedies ever since. Not that the director invented the formula of placing a love triangle in the middle of adversity, but he showed that it could be extraordinarily profitable \u2013 and movies from Pearl Harbor to Pompeii have tried desperately to replicate the package.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/denial-review-rachel-weisz-holocaust-david-irving-toronto-film-festival\">Denial review \u2013 Rachel Weisz makes heavy weather of Holocaust courtroom drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hotel Rwanda director Terry George has found himself another devastating, and far less covered, genocide to focus on, but in order to warrant the extravagant scale, a romantic trio has been placed front and centre. The film starts in Armenia in 1914 and follows Michael (Oscar Isaac), a man working in an apothecary, who dreams of becoming a doctor. But to afford the fees, he gets betrothed to a local woman and uses the dowry to go to school in Constantinople. Once he arrives, he quickly falls for Ana (Charlotte Le Bon) but \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 she\u2019s already in a relationship. Her boyfriend is the fiery Chris (Christian Bale), an American journalist reporting on the growing tensions between Turkey and Armenia. As Michael and Ana get closer, war breaks out and the three find themselves in the middle of a terrifying situation.</p> <p>There\u2019s something rather dusty about The Promise as George pushes his characters through a string of soapy machinations that feel incredibly familiar. But there\u2019s also something rather comfortingly reliable about it as well and, while a tad workmanlike, his solid direction ensures that the drama is mostly involving. It also helps that the Armenian genocide is a relatively unexplored period of history and makes for a horrifying backdrop. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk4TivbNVUM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pk4TivbNVUM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Subtlety isn\u2019t the film\u2019s strong point \u2013 with certain lines of dialogue (\u201cI\u2019m going to slaughter everyone on this mountain!\u201d) proving to be hilariously on the nose and Bale forced into some rather hammy scenes of rage. Isaac fares a little better and it\u2019s refreshing at least for his character not to be a natural born fighter (there\u2019s one rather nicely observed scene where he struggles to load a gun) but his chemistry with Le Bon is nonexistent. This proves to be problematic given the film\u2019s focus on romance, and one does wish that there were more context provided to the conflict itself and a wider view of the atrocities taking place. </p> <p>But rather like Russell Crowe\u2019s similarly creaky directorial debut The Water Diviner last year, there\u2019s something to enjoy about its traditional brand of storytelling, devoid of any irony. There are definitely more interesting and satisfying films to be made about the Armenian genocide and this is never going to become a Titanic-sized success \u2013 but it\u2019s a solid, if overly soapy, drama.</p>",

Alfons Flores\u2019s over-dominant set is a vortex of crucifixes, its swirling shape reminiscent of Gustave Dor\u00e9\u2019s illustrations for <a href=\"http://www.worldofdante.org/gallery_dore.html\">Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy</a>, reminding us that we are in a living purgatory. The big ritual scenes allude both to the Spanish Inquisition and the Ku Klux Klan, yet the imagery and stagecraft sometimes prove distracting. Norma lives in a modern flat from which religious artefacts have been removed, and where her children watch Watership Down on TV, though the sight of her daughter bouncing around on a <a href=\"https://www.retrostyler.com/junior-space-hopper/?utm_medium=googleshopping&amp;utm_source=bc&amp;gclid=CL-2_oCCjM8CFQoW0wodqpAAhw\">space hopper</a> gets in the way during her big reconciliatory duet with Adalgisa. The most remarkable image comes during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK2LwLyZAlc\">Casta Diva</a>, when a huge censer is swung out from the stage over the front rows of the auditorium. But Bellini demands absolute theatrical stillness at this point, and we don\u2019t really need it at all.</p> <p>Musically one is similarly left in two minds. The production was planned as a vehicle for Anna Netrebko, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/26/soprano-anna-netrebko-withdraws-royal-opera-norma\">withdrew from the proceedings in April</a> on the grounds that her voice had \u201cevolved in a different direction\u201d from Bellini\u2019s music. Yoncheva, her replacement, is singing the immensely demanding title role for the first time, and not all of it works. Exquisite lines, particularly in her first duet with Ganassi, alternate with some lunged coloratura and effortful high notes. Her characterisation is as yet imperfectly realised and the Medea-like extremes of the first act finale elude her. But she is affecting in the final scenes, when the emotional frenzies gradually drain away and Bellini resorts to a drastic simplicity of expression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54a66a1aa112e4f8aa20c1c40d5aa4b2a26ca989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54a66a1aa112e4f8aa20c1c40d5aa4b2a26ca989/0_370_5328_3196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vlada Borovko (Clotilde), Brindley Sherratt (Oroveso), Niamh Worrell, Sonya Yoncheva (Norma) and Joseph Calleja (Pollione) in Norma by Bellini at the Royal Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vlada Borovko (Clotilde), Brindley Sherratt (Oroveso), Niamh Worrell, Sonya Yoncheva (Norma) and Joseph Calleja (Pollione) in Norma by Bellini at the Royal Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Calleja, handsome-sounding, is naturally more at home in this music, his voice ringing easily through his arias, his characterisation growing in depth as the performance progresses.

  "<p>Liverpool Riverside is frequently cited as the most fractious constituency on Merseyside. Some local members have complained that they are put off by the divisive nature of constituency Labour party (CLP) meetings, while others blame the area\u2019s MP, Louise Ellman, saying she is out of step with the views of members.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/membership-timeline/embed.html\" data-alt=\"timeline\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/membership-timeline/embed.html\">timeline</a> </figure>  <p>Readers suggested that I spoke to Ellman, who represents the Labour and Co-operative party, and is one of the MPs who supported the vote of no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn. Originally from Manchester, Ellman had a long track record in council politics in Lancashire before becoming an MP in 1997. We met last week in her office in parliament.</p> <p>She told me that she welcomed the influx of new members into the party, and blamed the fractious nature of meetings in her constituency on a handful of the CLP\u2019s roughly 2,000 members.</p> <p>The divisive nature of Riverside CLP meetings seems to centre on Ellman\u2019s lack of support for Corbyn, but also the Israel-Palestine issue, which is often raised. </p> <p>Ellman, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement and vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, has complained officially about what she said were antisemitic remarks at CLP meetings. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/156227/hard-left-activists-target-jewish-mp-terrifying-campaign-abuse\">Jewish Chronicle reported the complaints</a>, which it said were believed to have been led by \u201cactivists from the hard-left group Momentum\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Below is the transcript from our meeting.</p> <p><strong>Ewen MacAskill: Someone in the Labour party in Liverpool said that Riverside is the most fractious of the CLPs and I just wonder if you agree with that and whether it has always been like that or is this a sort of recent phenomenon?</strong></p> <p><strong>Louise Ellman: </strong>\u201cYeah, well, it is very recent. It hasn\u2019t always been like that. I can talk about since I was elected in 1997. I mean, before that, I think,the answer is probably yes, because it was a centre of Militant Tendency. I think it probably was. But since 1997 until very recently it\u2019s been a very constructive constituency, members engaged, always been connected with the community, campaigning with local community groups and working very hard to rebuild the trust of local communities after Militant Tendency.</p> <p>\u201cBecause when Militant collapsed people just wouldn\u2019t vote Labour in Liverpool. They voted Lib Dem. And we had to regain people\u2019s trust \u2026 Labour lost control of the council. Lib Dems were riding high and it took a long time to rebuild the trust with local people. Riverside Labour party was a very constructive force in doing that. People engaged, [were] out in the community campaigning all the time. Within the constituency, the nature of politics is that people have different views and opinions but debates were always held in a very comradely way. Different views were expressed but we felt we were all working together. And that has changed a great deal very recently.\u201d</p> <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">When did the change take place?</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt changed after the last general election. We got a lot of new members, as you know. I think a lot of those new members are very enthusiastic, very keen and it is great to see so many people enthused about politics. But I do think there are a number of individuals among them who are really committed to creating dissent and conflict, and have created very antagonistic situations. Most people are not doing that. But there are a number who are. And it is very unpleasant.\u201d</p> <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">What do you think is driving them? You said they\u2019re disruptive but what motivates them?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of young people, very keen and enthusiastic. They are not doing that. People who are doing this are more interested in destroying than building. I think they want to depict Riverside CLP as run by people who are inactive and uninterested and they want to present themselves as people who want to be positively engaged. And, in fact, the reverse is true.\u201d</p> <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Did this predate Jeremy Corbyn? Was it a result of the election?</strong></p> <p>\u201cNo, It was after. It was after the general election. It all is since Jeremy became leader. Most of the people I am talking about, when they start to speak, preface their comments with \u2018I am a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019. And many of them say \u2018I am only here because of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/=louise_e_quotes/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Louise Ellman Quote\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/=louise_e_quotes/embed.html\">Louise Ellman Quote</a> </figure>  <p><strong>What kind of issues do they raise? Or what kind of things do they say?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThey seem to be obsessed on Middle East issues. I have been reading your articles and Sarah Byrne \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/jul/20/labour-liverpool-meeting-new-members-new-expectations-video\">a Riverside Labour member who complained about the confrontational nature of the CLP meetings</a> \u2013 said to you that it gets \u2018shouty\u2019 \u2026 about Palestine.\u201d</p> <p><strong>It is a good phrase.</strong></p> <p>\u201cWhich seems to be true. That seems to be obsessive with a small number of people. And in general \u2013 and again I stress this is a minority of people I am talking about \u2013 but they set the tone of what is happening and try to be dismissive of councillors who are doing very hard work. Riverside has been a very active party. We built trust with the electorate. One of the things that concerns me is \u2026 that the people, the community are hardly ever mentioned.</p> <p>\u201cConversations are solely about members and elected representatives. But the community of people who are not necessarily active at all are hardly mentioned when really that is who we are working for.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How many members are there in the CLP?</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt keeps changing. I think we have got about 2,000 at the moment. But that might have changed.\u201d</p> <p><strong>So what number are we talking about out of that 2,000? When you say it is a minority?</strong></p> <p>\u201cWe are probably talking about eight or nine people, something of that order, who set the tone. A lot of people who have joined are new to politics and it is great to see that. I think they see the whole of politics as being about protest and do not see protest as part of political activity, and I always like to see a result from protest and look to change things. I think many of them think protest in itself is their objective.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Is there any personal abuse at CLP meetings themselves? Or does it come on social media?</strong></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into too much detail about the meetings. But it is a very unpleasant atmosphere that has been created.\u201d </p> <p><strong>The Jewish Chronicle reported that you were subjected to antisemitic remarks. Where did these come from?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThere were some remarks which I regard as antisemitic made to me at a meeting and a complaint has been made so I don\u2019t want to say any more about that. But you have read what was in the Jewish Chronicle. I think that did depict the meeting.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Someone said to me one of the reasons Riverside is so fractious is because you have larger number of students than say Wallasey or Birkenhead.</strong></p> <p>\u201cI think the whole lot of the new members are enthusiastic and it is great to see that. But I think those small number of people who are intent on creating dissent, some of those are people who have been in the party before or been in other political parties. The people creating this atmosphere are not necessarily young people at all. I would not want to say that. Some of the people have been involved before or involved in other parties, other groups and see an opportunity to come back.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The (Riverside) CLP nominated Jeremy Corbyn by 117 to 37. And yet last year they nominated Yvette Cooper. That is a huge change.</strong></p> <p>\u201cWell, that perhaps reflects the change in membership \u2026\u201d</p> <p><strong>There is this divide between CLPs, some of them anyway, and the parliamentary Labour party (PLP). You do not feel an obligation to reflect the CLP vote?</strong></p> <p>\u201cNo. I am a representative. I am not a delegate. I am elected by tens of thousands of people in Riverside and I also have responsibility to the constituency \u2013 but I cannot be instructed by people who turn up at a particular meeting. I listen. I have always attended every CLP meeting. I have produced a written report as well as speaking to it and answering questions. And I am accountable but I do not follow CLP instructions.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Are there any issues over the last nine months or a year, say over Syria or Trident?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThere was a vote on Syria and the decision was that I should exercise my conscience and that was fully debated in the CLP. Varying views were expressed and I did vote for action on Isis and that followed a resolution that said that. Trident was also debated and no position was taken on that, and it was resolved that we should engage with the review which at that time was being carried out by Maria Eagle. Both of those topics were the subject of resolutions at the CLP, and fully debated and voted on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>On the antisemitism, I think you said you would like to see more action taken. What kind of action would you like to see taken?</strong></p> <p>\u201cI want to see action against people \u2013 and this is not exclusive to Riverside at all, it is the Labour party generally \u2013 where comments of an antisemitic nature are dealt with immediately, without people having to campaign. I think some slow progress is being made.\u201d</p> <p><strong>It seems strange to me as an outsider \u2013 I am not a member of the Labour party or any other party \u2013 that somebody with antisemitic views would join the Labour party. It is not my experience of Labour members.</strong></p> <p>\u201cWell the evidence is there from statements which have been made by people either at meetings or on social media. Antisemitism in the left is not a new phenomenon. It has always been around. But in recent years it has become acceptable, apparently more acceptable, in the Labour party. That is what has to be stopped.\u201d</p> <p><strong>When you say it has always been there, I have always associated the early days of the Labour party with Jewish intellectuals. So they have always been integral to the Labour party.</strong></p> <p>\u201cYes. They have, but that does not mean there have not been other people around.\u201d</p> <p><strong>On the party\u2019s ruling national executive (NEC), there was that election a few months ago and there is now a solid pro-Corbyn majority. That kicks in this October. If Jeremy Corbyn wins the leadership contest, what do you think will happen then?</strong></p> <p>\u201cWell we will have to see. People do not always form one bloc on all subjects. Often people have different views on different topics. I don\u2019t think you can make assumptions.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What are you thinking of?</strong></p> <p>\u201cJust in general. You have just said to me there is a pro-Corbyn bloc there. Well what does that mean? There might be a majority that supports Jeremy Corbyn. That does not mean that on every issue that comes up on the NEC all those people will vote the same way. So let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/louise_e_quotes_two/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Louise Ellman quote 2\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/louise_e_quotes_two/embed.html\">Louise Ellman quote 2</a> </figure>  <p><strong>If Corbyn wins, does the size of his majority matter?</strong></p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just wait and see.\u201d</p> <p><strong>He has got the leadership, he has the NEC maybe.

  "<p>The word \u201cturnover\u201d, which has until now applied to The Great British Bake Off only as a technical challenge, has become an instruction to its fans. The news that the show will pitch its tent at Channel 4 from next year has raised two main questions. Can it work on another channel? And how on earth did this happen?</p> <p>The question of how the show will look post-2017 became considerably more complex with the announcement that Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins will not be joining the big-money move to Channel 4, rolling out a typical bread-related pun about not \u201cgoing with the dough\u201d, which seemed to suggest that Love Productions (the independent company that invented and owns the show) was being greedy. Mel and Sue may have been influenced by the fact that a previous move from Channel 4 to ITV in 1999 stalled their career.</p> <p>Channel 4 and Love may bravely tell themselves that Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood are more crucial to the brand, and that is true. But signing up the expert duo becomes vital now \u2013 and the new presenters will of course shape attitudes to the Channel 4 launch, if the new quartet is perceived to be a petit four beside the original lineup. The show\u2019s new home will also be acutely aware, from the BBC\u2019s recent experience with Top Gear, of the instability of a format without its familiar faces.</p> <p>Some have suggested that ad-breaks at Channel 4 will ruin the experience. But the Bake Off format has already been adapted to many countries with commercial structures, and the BBC already uses little films about the histories of cakes and biscuits as internal breaks, which could be removed without much loss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/13/sue-perkins-and-mel-giedroyc-to-leave-great-british-bake-off\">Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc to leave Great British Bake Off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Understandably, though, the fact that up to 13 million viewers will suddenly be told to change channel for their favourite show has caused oven-hot indignation on social media. Shock has been expressed at the BBC having so little control over the destiny of one of its brand-name programmes.</p> <p>But this is the way television has gone. Although the Sunday night stand-off between shows such as Poldark and Victoria is still conventionally seen as a fight between BBC and ITV, both were actually made by the same independent producer, Mammoth Screen. This trend \u2013 known as \u201cpublisher broadcasting\u201d \u2013 was introduced to Britain with the launch of Channel 4 in 1982, but, encouraged by successive Conservative and Labour governments, has increasingly spread to ITV and now the BBC.</p> <p>Of the BBC1 trinity of hit autumn franchises \u2013 Bake Off, The Apprentice and Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 the only one wholly owned by the BBC is Strictly, a clever reboot of Come Dancing, which had run since the 1950s. The Apprentice is originally an American format, from which Donald Trump recently became the first TV presenter to take leave of absence to run for US president. Bake Off was invented by Love, which just secured a far better deal from Channel 4. The Voice has just moved from BBC1 to ITV in similar circumstances, although amid rather less dismay.</p> <p>The ownership of shows has not always been straightforward: the original Come Dancing was created by an external impresario, Miss World mogul Eric Morley, but he needed a TV company to make it. The rise of independent production has removed that barrier. And the BBC will only become less likely to own its hits under a stipulation in the current government white paper on the future of the BBC that almost 100% of its non-news output (rather than, as before, a minority) should be available for external commercial tender on a \u201ccompete and compare\u201d basis that assesses commercial and cultural value.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c5c0b1e33ca9c66f17d038542383d12e9197d40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c5c0b1e33ca9c66f17d038542383d12e9197d40/0_24_4171_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The fact that 13 million fans will suddenly have to change channel for their favourite show has caused oven-hot indignation on social media.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fact that 13 million fans will suddenly have to change channel for their favourite show has caused oven-hot indignation on social media.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/BBC/Love Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the case of Bake Off, the BBC has a reasonable case to feel that, having been loyal to the show, some might have been returned. And, although there is always difficulty in delineating the exact creative input between the company that makes a show and the network that screens it, Bake Off has reflected some crucial BBC values: one Reithian \u2013 Mary and Paul are, in a light way, educational about their skills \u2013 and one more recent, in the commendable diversity of the contestants.</p> <p>Those qualities, though, seem unlikely to be reduced at Channel 4, which remains a public service broadcaster. A more pressing issue, then, is whether the BBC\u2019s structure discourages creativity. </p> <p>It often seems that the best and most original ideas \u2013 especially in entertainment \u2013 on the BBC have been brought by (and therefore have to be bought from) independent companies. The next director general needs to take a hard look at why this is the case.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off\">Great British Bake Off moves to Channel 4 as BBC negotiations collapse over fee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Certainly a young upstart might conclude from the celebrity and lifestyle of major independent producers such as Burnett, Simon Cowell and Jan De Mol (Big Brother) that it is more rewarding to create and sell formats than make them in-house and share control, ownership and income. This means that if, as a BBC staff producer, you had an idea for a new show, the inescapable logic is that you should leave your job, set up an independent production company and then ask the BBC to buy it from you.</p> <p>Even more worrying is whether those on staff feel enough incentive to develop successful concepts. An independent producer who fails to come up with enough great ideas risks losing their job and their house; a senior BBC manager running an unproductive department is likely to be moved to new responsibilities at equivalent income or even, in some cases, be handed output from more industrious units.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s 19,000 staff base and generally benevolent employment practices are impressive from a moral and trade union perspective, but you don\u2019t need to be a zealous free-marketeer to wonder whether, in a TV environment that is increasingly deregulated and international, the corporation\u2019s structures ensure the best ideas get made at maximum value to the licence-payer. Next time a show sells like hot cakes, in the way that Bake Off has, it needs to be the BBC\u2019s own. </p>",
  "<p>Sitting at the Turkish onyx bar in a red Make America Great Again baseball cap, lawyer Ben Garmer looked around the spacious atrium of the newly opened Trump International Hotel in Washington on Monday and proclaimed it \u201cgorgeous\u201d.</p> <p>Such hats are a rare sight in Washington, and even rarer in its most august hotels. But this is now effectively the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s sovereign territory, the embassy of Trumpistan, planted just half a dozen blocks from the White House. Win or lose in November\u2019s presidential election, his name is spelled out in gold letters on Pennsylvania Avenue, arguably the most famous street in the nation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa0949cf1f5ebb1d72da2a92c279f72142ae888b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa0949cf1f5ebb1d72da2a92c279f72142ae888b/0_0_775_620/500.jpg\" alt=\"The distance between the White House and the Trump International Hotel in Washington.\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The distance between the White House and the Trump International Hotel in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mapb</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inside the historic former post office, the taste is restrained by Trump standards. Yes, there are chandeliers, gold rails and gold-rimmed glass tables evocative of the blingy hotels that Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi used to build. There is The Spa by Ivanka Trump. But the gaudy flamboyance of Las Vegas or Palm Beach has been dialled down to cream and grey walls \u2013 as befits understated Washington.</p> <p>The hotel opened its doors at 2pm on Monday after a two-year, $200m renovation. There was little fanfare: Trump and his family will attend a predictably grand opening ceremony next month. While the tycoon himself stayed away, there was a typical menu of divisiveness and surrealism.</p> <p>By 4.30pm, some 38 protesters had lined up outside the hotel to form a human wall in response to Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall on the Mexican border. They made speeches through a megaphone, chanted \u201cNo Trump, no KKK, no racist USA!\u201d and hoisted placards and banners that said, \u201cWe\u2019ll build a wall against racism &amp; bigotry\u201d and \u201cImmigrants &amp; Muslims are welcome here \u2013 Trump Hotel is NOT!\u201d</p> <p>In a district where Trump was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/marco-rubio-trounces-donald-trump-in-washington-dc-presidential-primary\">badly beaten by Marco Rubio</a> and John Kasich in the Republican primary, some passing motorists tooted their horns in support of the protesters. Nearby, Savas Mendoza, a Mexican-born US citizen, continued to work on the building\u2019s exterior and said he was being paid $40 an hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b997e2b10e6bfad81952c1ffed2a34132b8f736d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b997e2b10e6bfad81952c1ffed2a34132b8f736d/0_60_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in front of the newly opened Trump International Hotel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather in front of the newly opened Trump International Hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A handful of Trump supporters had also turned up. Johnny Rice, 49, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the candidate\u2019s face, blew a shofar (ram\u2019s horn). A woman in a cowboy hat positioned herself in front of the protesters and held box lids scrawled with the words \u201cI\u2019m a deplorable\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">referencing a recent Clinton gaffe</a>) and \u201cThere\u2019s a new sheriff in town and his name is Donald Trump.\u201d Two burly security guards told her to leave.</p> <p>Meanwhile, most bizarrely, a man in a full-length duck suit with bright orange hair prowled the scene. So did a man in tuxedo, bow tie and pig mask. Watching it all was a statue of founding father Benjamin Franklin, who now finds himself in permanent close proximity to the Trump brand.</p> <p>As this hot and anguished street scene played out against a backdrop of sawing and sandpapering, the inside of the hotel provided an air-conditioned refuge for the 1%. Liveried staff, racially diverse, glided under industrial steel girders and the dramatically high glass roof with canap\u00e9s and sparkling Trump wine. Of the hotel management, an affable Frenchman and urbane Irishman chatted to journalists. A steady trickle of guests arrived at check-in with luggage but were less willing to be interviewed about their first impressions.</p> <p>The hotel is nine stories tall and has 263 rooms, including 35 suites. Rooms start at an average of $895 a night. For the presidential inauguration in January of either Trump or Hillary Clinton, the biggest suite will cost $12,000 per night and must be booked for a minimum of five nights. Whether the presidential ballroom gets used that night probably depends on the outcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abd8b557a505765574becbd2974df3f8dd86670c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abd8b557a505765574becbd2974df3f8dd86670c/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Staff members meet in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel just after it opened.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff members meet in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel just after it opened.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, helped negotiate a 60-year lease with the US government and oversaw the building\u2019s revamp and design. It is housed in Washington\u2019s third-tallest building, the 1899 Old Post Office, built in the Romanesque Revival architectural style. The interior still contains an old brass letter box and some framed handwritten correspondence from that era amid lilies, TV screens and shiny marble floors. The clock tower is 315ft (96m) high and will offer tourists panoramic views. </p> <p>Garmer, the lawyer in the Make America Great Again hat, said: \u201cTransforming this building from what it was to now is amazing. I was here a couple of years ago. There was a lousy food court downstairs.\u201d</p> <p>Of the protesters, he said: \u201cI was a little nervous walking across the street wearing this hat. It\u2019s just noise, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>This is aspirational, one-day-you-can-be-rich-too Trump. In one corner stands a Brioni suit store.

  "<p>The FBI\u2019s national crime data for 2015 \u2013 which is expected to show a substantial overall increase in murders \u2013 will be released on the morning of the first presidential debate, likely providing a dramatic new talking point for Donald Trump. </p> <p>For months, Trump has been pointing, ominously, to rising violence in Chicago and other cities, and arguing that Americans are at risk and that Democrats have failed black Americans in particular.</p> <p>How large the nationwide murder increase might be for all of 2015 is still unclear, but some estimates would make the increase the largest since 1990, or even 1968. </p> <p>Whatever the precise nationwide increase is, criminologist Richard Rosenfeld said, it will almost certainly be \u201ca much larger rise in homicide than we\u2019ve seen in many, many years\u201d.</p> <p>Trump, who has branded himself the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d, pledged in his July speech at the Republican national convention that \u201cthe crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cInner-city crime is reaching record levels,\u201d he tweeted in late August. \u201cAfrican Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!\u201d </p> <p>Barack Obama and other Democrats have pushed back that overall crime and murder fell to historic lows during Obama\u2019s presidency, and that the troubling murder increase has been concentrated in just a few cities. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide/\" data-alt=\"US homicide rate\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide/\">US homicide rate</a> </figure>  <p>Murders increased nearly 17% across the nation\u2019s 56 largest cities in 2015, Rosenfeld found in a justice department-funded <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249895.pdf\">study</a> published in June. The increase was \u201creal and nearly unprecedented\u201d, Rosenfeld concluded.<br></p> <p>Rosenfeld\u2019s study found the murder increase was mostly driven by an even smaller number of cities \u2013 just 10 \u2013 including Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee and Washington DC. Other cities, including New York and Los Angeles, continue to see murder numbers at or close to historic lows. </p> <p>Even with a sharp national uptick in murders in 2015, violence in the US will still be at historic lows. The country is dramatically safer than it was in the early 1990s, when close to 25,000 Americans were murdered every year. In recent years, even as the population has grown, the number of murders has fallen to close to 14,000 a year. <br></p> <p>While the steepest decrease in violence came in the late 1990s, murders have continued to fall during Obama\u2019s two terms, according to FBI data, with more than 2,000 fewer Americans murdered in 2014 than they were in 2008, the year before Obama took office.</p> <p>An uptick in murders in the nation\u2019s 30 largest cities was not accompanied by spikes in overall crime or violent crime, a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/crime-2015-final-analysis\">preliminary analysis</a> of crime data by the Brennan Center concluded.</p> <p>Rosenfeld projected that 2015\u2019s national increase could be as high as 13% \u2013 a very rough estimate, he said \u2013 while Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Justice Program, projected that the increase might be between 6% and 12%. </p> <p>If nationwide murders rose 6% over all of 2015, that would be the greatest single-year percentage increase since 1990, according to FBI murder data. If murders rose 13%, that would be the largest percentage increase in murders in the last half-century, larger even than 1968, when murders rose 12.75%.</p> <p>But overall murders would have to spike 73%, not 6%, to actually put the US back at the record-breaking murder totals of the early 1990s. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-pct-change/\" data-alt=\"US homicide rate percent change\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-pct-change/\">US homicide rate percent change</a> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the murder increases in a few large cities have been devastating and historic.</p> <p>In Baltimore, 130 more people were murdered in 2015 than in 2014, driving the city\u2019s homicide rate to its <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-deadliest-year-20160101-story.html\">highest ever level</a>. So far this year, Baltimore\u2019s higher levels of violence have continued, with roughly the same number of <a href=\"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/Summarized-Crime-Data-By-District-Week-35/4nh3-w6zf\">non-fatal shootings </a>this year than last year through 2 September, and only a slightly lower number of homicides.</p> <p>James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he was skeptical of how significant the murder uptick in 2015 might be.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a one year increase ... and it\u2019s an increase from the lowest level we\u2019ve had in 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo some extent, we\u2019re a victim of our own success.</p> <p>\u201cIf you go on a crash diet and you lose 50lbs and then you put on a couple, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re fat.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/thomas-abt\">Thomas Abt, a Harvard Kennedy School</a> researcher who worked on violence prevention policy for the state of New York and in Obama\u2019s justice department, said he expected that the release of the FBI\u2019s 2015 data would \u201cchange the narrative\u201d about urban homicide. </p> <p>\u201cIt will be no longer possible to deny that the increase is real, significant, and nationwide in scope,\u201d he said. </p> <p>As urban homicide received more attention, he said, he hoped the conversation on how to address the problem would explore the relationship between gun violence, police reform, and mass incarceration. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not a crime wave, as some conservatives say. This is a specific issue with urban violence,\u201d Abt said. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite appropriate to be concerned. It\u2019s not appropriate to panic.\u201d</p> <p>The same statistics that could bring more attention to the devastating violence in Baltimore and Chicago could also be used for fear-mongering, other experts said. </p> <p>Overstating crime increases \u201cdrives unnecessary panic and fear, and people in the public, and politicians, don\u2019t make good decisions when it\u2019s coming from a place of fear as opposed to a place of reason,\u201d said Chettiar. </p> <p>\u201cI imagine Trump will continue making the same statements that he\u2019s making, which have been exaggerating the increase in murders,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one thing that I would hope is there would be more of an effort to fact-check him by the debate moderators or by Secretary Clinton.\u201d <br></p> <p>While the media has put Trump\u2019s crime claims in context, Chettiar said, she thought other politicians had not yet been forceful enough in questioning his analysis. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not a crime wave, as some conservatives say.

And of course there was an added benefit to marrying his new bride in Fleet Street. He could yet again thumb his nose at the Guardian luvvies who had tried so hard to bring him down with the phone-hacking story.\u201d</p> <p>After 42 years in journalism, most of it working for News Corp Australia, Mitchell explains he wanted to provide some balance to the \u201coften hysterical discussion\u201d about the Murdoch family and their media empire, which he says are often denigrated by the Guardian, ABC and Fairfax Media in Australia.<br></p> <p>The Queensland journalist, who edited Brisbane\u2019s Courier Mail and the Australian newspaper for 24 years and now writes a media column in the Australian, describes his relationship with the media proprietor as not close but \u201cfriendly and trusting\u201d and says they are of a like mind. \u201cThe unvarnished truth is that I did not need Rupert directing me,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my campaigns were my own and they were usually my own ideas.

And with Austria now taking the lead on arguing for an Australian-style system, it\u2019s now Germany that is isolated.\u201d</p> <p>But Orb\u00e1n\u2019s vision goes far beyond simply repelling immigrants. In a speech made last year, Orb\u00e1n hailed what he saw as the demise of liberal Europe. \u201cWe are experiencing now the end of an era: a conceptual-ideological era,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told supporters last autumn. \u201cPutting pretension aside, we can simply call this the era of liberal babble. This era is now at an end.\u201d</p> <p>A week ago, Orb\u00e1n continued this argument at a press conference with the rightwing Polish politician Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, in which he called for Europe and its institutions to be reworked in favour of a rightwing vision. \u201cWe are at a historic cultural moment,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n. \u201cThere is a possibility of a cultural counter-revolution right now.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has used his first speech to pour scorn on modern climate science, call for Australia to leave the United Nations and question the reliability of data from Australian government departments and agencies.</p> <p>He railed against the level of taxation in Australia and thanked his colleagues in the <a href=\"http://www.galileomovement.com.au/\">Galileo Movement</a>, such as Ian Plimer, the radio host Alan Jones and the late professor Bob Carter, for their constant questioning of climate science. He said he loved to ask questions to get to the truth, like Socrates.</p> <p>And he promised voters he would represent their interests, rather than worry about what \u201cthe establishment\u201d wants. </p> <p>\u201cAll of us, as One Nation senators, are going to say the things that need to be said and do the things that need to be done,\u201d he said on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not worried what the establishment says about us.

  "<p>The chief enforcer of television quality and standards at regulator Ofcom is set to leave after just five months after being forced to choose between his job and his outside work as a journalist. </p> <p>As the watchdog prepares to take on greater regulation of the BBC, it has emerged that a legal wrangle broke out earlier this summer when the former Economist editor Bill Emmott was told by Ofcom that writing or speaking about national or international public policy matters would be at odds with his role as chair of its content board.</p> <p>It is understood that Ofcom said that, although Emmott\u2019s role there was part time, he was writing more than they had thought he would and that they were concerned that one of his articles may one day be used as evidence of bias or a conflict of interest in a future court case.</p> <p>Sources say Emmott argued that his outside interests had been cleared when he joined in January. However Ofcom insisted his two roles, as a writer and chair of the content board, were incompatible.</p> <p>With the power to deal with viewers\u2019 concerns about offensive or inaccurate TV shows and advise on fining channels that breach broadcasting rules, <a href=\"http://%20https//www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/complaints-channel-4-news-hijab-the-sun-kelvin-mackenzie-fatima-manji\">Ofcom\u2019s content board deals with some of the most sensitive areas of television and radio</a>.</p> <p>The abolition of the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/media/bbc-trust\">BBC Trust</a> at the end of the year under the terms of the new BBC charter gives the regulator new powers to oversee the corporation, including its editorial standards \u2013 a notoriously tricky area, particularly when it comes political programming.</p> <p>Emmott was appointed in January when it was already suspected that the government wanted Ofcom to take on more regulation of the BBC, but since the white paper in May confirmed the move the regulator has felt under greater scrutiny.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/content/about/how-ofcom-is-run/content-board/Code-of-Conduct.pdf\">Ofcom content board members are part-time but bound by a strict code of conduct</a> that includes them having to declare conflicts of interest due to other roles.</p> <p>However, the code says that \u201cstrong links with the broadcasting industry\u201d are allowed \u201ccertain paid employment\u201d which \u201cmay be permissible so long as it is open and accounted for and any conflict of interest is declared and discussed at a content board meeting before each relevant agenda item\u201d.</p> <p>It is not suggested that Emmott has breached any of the codes.

  "<p>John Ford shot Monument Valley, Wes Anderson shoots highly stylized interiors and, if Nick Cannon continues to make films like King of the Dancehall, historians will note him for his worshipful appreciation of the female posterior.

And adapting to a new culture is, to a degree, what this lighthearted and agreeable story is all about. Cannon\u2019s Tarzan is a New Yorker just finishing a five year prison sentence. His ill mother (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2016/jul/24/from-michael-caine-to-whoopi-goldberg-how-celebs-chose-their-stage-names\">Whoopi Goldberg</a>) has bills up to the wazoo, so Tarzan heads down to his cousin Toaster in Kingston (an almost unrecognisable Busta Rhymes) to work out a low-level drug running scheme.</p> <p>But this is not a Scarface-like saga. Tarzan just wants enough money to make things right (Mum needs surgery, if you can believe it) but what he really needs is the love of his neighbour Maya (remarkable newcomer Kimberly Patterson). Maya is a Bishop\u2019s daughter and steadfastly chaste, but that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t get rambunctious at the dancehall. The way to her heart is to learn the moves, so Tarzan joins up with a crew of ridiculously buff guys, takes off his shirt and starts getting in rhythm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/feb/12/reggae-dancehall-artwork-wilfred-limonious\">King of the dancehall: the reggae art of Wilfred Limonious \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The nightlife scenes are euphoric and sensual, and Cannon has the good sense to let them play out at length. Scenes of Tarzan and Toaster busting each other\u2019s chops are terrific, especially when the sourpuss aunt who \u201chasn\u2019t smiled since 1979\u201d is giving them guff as she serves them rice and peas. Everyone but Tarzan speaks in a patois so thick the film uses subtitles and Jamaican music legend Beenie Man acts as something of a Greek chorus. Even though the screenplay is loaded with cliche and its twists are absurd and predictable, when it settles into a groove there is a terrific sense of place. Somehow, the far-fetched nature of the plot still rings true.</p> <p>The third act of the film ties itself up in some ridiculous mob boss scenes (Peter Stormare plays a European who likes to tell stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/23/the-clash-10-of-the-best\">Paul Simonon of the Clash</a>) and while many may turn their nose up at this sharp tonal turn, it feels in line with the low budget regional filmmaking from the 1970s. The 1972 Jimmy Cliff vehicle The Harder They Come is clearly something of an influence here.</p> <p>For all the oogling on the dance floor, the gaze does go both ways, and there is something of a respectful message to women. For every patriarchal utterance of \u201cyou\u2019re my girl\u201d there\u2019s a willingness to respect Maya\u2019s decision to keep things slow in the bedroom. But the dancehall is a fire pit, and naturally the picture ends with a battle royale in which Tarzan (who only just started to learn his moves) has to save the world with his sweat-glistening abs and thrusting pelvis. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m calling a travel agent to book a trip to Jamaica. </p>",

  "<p>Apple\u2019s iOS 10 will begin hitting iPhones, iPads and iPod touches on Tuesday, and it\u2019s the biggest overhaul it has had in years. Here are 10 things that have changed.</p> <h2>1.

You can send stickers, \u201cTapback\u201d reactions, transitions (think along the the lines of magic ink) - animations, rich links, larger emojis and best of all, \u201cemojification\u201d which looks at what you\u2019ve written and allows you to tap on words to substitute for emojis.</p> <p>You can also draw or write on the screen and use third-party apps directly within Messages. It\u2019s like Facebook Messenger but with end-to-end encryption.</p> <h2>2. Notifications</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9ff78e49ce5fab196e585c701da003b7da5c033\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9ff78e49ce5fab196e585c701da003b7da5c033/0_0_3726_2208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ios 10 notifications\" width=\"1000\" height=\"593\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">iOS 10 gives notifications a much-needed overhaul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest visual change to iOS 10 is the new rich notifications and quick reply features that have made them much more useful. You no longer have to open the app to view videos, photos and reply. All you have to do is tap on the notification to launch the app or force press to popup a preview.</p> <p>You can also force press on the clear button in the notification shade to clear all notifications, which, frankly, should have been there from the beginning. Clearing them individually still requires a swipe and a tap on the clear button, but you can delete emails straight from the expanded notification, so that\u2019s progress. </p> <h2>3. Lockscreen</h2> <p>Along with notifications, the lockscreen has been made more useful. The widgets from the \u201ctoday\u201d pull-down can now be viewed with a swipe right on the lockscreen. The same bunch of widgets is available on a swipe right on the home screen, where Siri\u2019s app suggestions used to be, with Siri\u2019s suggestions moving to a pull down on the home screen.</p> <p>You can also now set your phone to light up when you lift it. The raise to wake makes accessing the widgets and notifications easier without accidentally unlocking your phone with a home button press.</p> <h2>4. Delete stocks (and other Apple apps)</h2> <p>You can now \u201cdelete\u201d Stocks and most other Apple apps.

  "<p>NWA\u2019s first EP was called Panic Zone. Released in 1987, it features Dope Man, a song written by a teenage Ice Cube that foreshadowed the group\u2019s sound and image to come. It alternately glamorizes and condemns the drug pusher and his lifestyle, ending with a stern warning voiced by Mexican-American rapper Krazy Dee: \u201cYou sold crack to my sister and now she\u2019s sick / But if she happens to die because of your drug / I\u2019m putting in your culo a .38 slug.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Dr Dre, the group\u2019s main producer, it was his first use of the \u201cfunky worm\u201d, the high-pitched, irresistible Moog synthesizer sound whose name was coined from a song by the 70s funk group Ohio Players. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/mar/17/george-clinton-listen-conversation-with-alexis-petridis\">George Clinton: funk legend talks to Alexis Petridis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sound was next heard on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/09/nwa-admitted-to-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-at-ceremony-mired-by-bad-blood\">NWA\u2019s second full-length album</a>, 1991\u2019s Efil4zaggin (Niggaz 4 Life spelled backward), the first gangsta rap album to hit No1. Efil4zaggin marks a great leap forward in Dr Dre\u2019s production skills. Whereas their previous album Straight Outta Compton was all over the place sonically, Efil is mostly unified in its doomsday grooves. Always into Something is a slow-building sonic masterpiece, kicking off with a spoken word MC Ren introduction and a quick Dre verse before unveiling the alien-sounding, high-pitched synthesizer sound, similar to the \u201cfunky worm\u201d. In the studio, Dre was hoping to capture the magic of Parliament-Funkadelic member Bernie Worrell\u2019s eerie, melodic keyboard sounds, and so he had engineer Colin Wolfe go out and buy a Moog.</p> <p>Following the album Dre left NWA and its label Ruthless Records, owing to a money dispute with Eazy-E, who owned the label, and NWA\u2019s manager, Jerry Heller. Dre recorded the first half of his solo debut The Chronic (which came out near the end of 1992) at his Calabasas house, in a bedroom he\u2019d converted into a studio. After a fire there, the rest was made at Solar\u2019s Galaxy studios, where he made use of a state-of-the-art SSL console, a huge, futuristic mixing board with pre-programmable \u201cflying faders\u201d capable of automatically adjusting itself to your preferred settings. \u201cIt was like the Starship Enterprise,\u201d producer Rhythm D, who worked with Death Row for a time, told me. </p> <p>Yet it was still the pre-digital era, and so they edited on analog tapes, literally cutting them by hand. \u201cYou would mark the tape with a grease pencil and then use a razor blade,\u201d remembered Chris \u201cThe Glove\u201d Taylor, an engineer and musician on the album.</p> <p>More than ever, Dre was finding inspiration in Parliament-Funkadelic. He again used the Moog to create both a chunky bass effect using different settings and the \u201cfunky worm\u201d squeal. It\u2019s that enchanting, high-pitched whine that is the signature sound of The Chronic. It\u2019s melodic, it\u2019s somewhat terrifying, it instantly makes your ears prick up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1c7c285e20aea5569e0e79c478cd83db213b060\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1c7c285e20aea5569e0e79c478cd83db213b060/0_76_4400_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone Pictures USA / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was also the perfect, terrifying sound for Chronic diss track Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody\u2019s Celebratin\u2019). The song\u2019s venom was directed at Eazy\u2011E, starting with a skit preceding the video, in which Eazy is portrayed by comedian AJ Johnson as a locs-clad, Jheri-curled Uncle Tom being sold a load of BS from Heller, played by portly Interscope executive Steve Berman. Over the bass-rattling, slow funk track, Dre took direct aim at Eazy: \u201cUsed to be my homie, used to be my ace / Now I want to slap the taste out your mouth / Make you bow down to the Row / Fuckin\u2019 me, now I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 you, little ho. Eazy was no longer respected by his own people, he went on, and should watch his back because he might get smoked.\u201d</p> <p>Backed by emerging rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, the album featured Dre sampling or interpolating a half dozen songs from either Parliament or Funkadelic, sister groups that were both led by George Clinton. Dre\u2019s genius was realizing how well they\u2019d combine with rap lyrics. Part of the connection was emotional. P-Funk\u2019s psychedelic rock was cutting edge, but to those who grew up in the 70s it was also warm and nostalgic, the soundtrack to back-yard parties and civil rights rallies. Combining it with the rough-and-tumble lyrics of gangsta rap merged the hard and the soft, the light and the dark. The sound was called G-funk \u2013 gangsta funk \u2013 and it would come to dominate hip-hop for years.</p> <p>What made G-funk so effective? An LA musician named D\u00e2m-Funk \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/03/dam-funk-snoop-dogg-stones-throw-hudson-mohawke-ariel-pink\">a keytar-toting funk revivalist who collaborated with Snoop on the 2013 album 7 Days of Funk</a> \u2013 put it well. He told me that, for many who grew up on Parliament-Funkadelic, the sound came to symbolize a halcyon time before crack cocaine came along in the early 80s and decimated the inner city. D\u00e2m-Funk cites Funkadelic\u2019s 1979 song Not Just (Knee Deep), which Dre would later sample for a Tupac track, as \u201calmost like the end credits rolling on a certain era.</p> <p>\u201cBecause, before that, there wasn\u2019t crack,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd then that era came, and a lot of people got lost after that. You can almost feel it in the music that something was on the horizon ... It symbolizes happiness and sadness. That\u2019s what the funk is.\u201d</p> <h2>Who invented G-funk?</h2> <p>Who invented G-funk? Though Dr Dre is its most famous purveyor, the question is controversial.</p> <p>DJ Quik, who emerged in the early 90s, has long been injecting serious funk into his hip-hop, and was undoubtedly influential on Dre\u2019s sound. But it was the Ruthless gangsta rap group Above the Law that would directly claim credit for the G-funk sound, offering as evidence their early 1993 sophomore album Black Mafia Life. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a7a24dafa6f7cd6d0aef809ae768c92da581a7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a7a24dafa6f7cd6d0aef809ae768c92da581a7f/0_164_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"D\u00e2m-Funk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">D\u00e2m-Funk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That work wasn\u2019t a massive hit like The Chronic, but the albums bear some clear similarities: Nuthin\u2019 But a G Thang echoes Above the Law\u2019s Never Missin\u2019 a Beat, for example, while their Pimp Clinic and Dre\u2019s Let Me Ride both borrow from Parliament-Funkadelic\u2019s take on the spiritual Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and, let me ride.</p> <p>Black Mafia Life was released in early 1993, about two months after The Chronic, but, according to many accounts, was finished beforehand. \u201cG-funk was our style of music,\u201d said Above the Law collaborator Kokane, adding that group producers Cold 187um and KMG the Illustrator forged the sound.</p> <p>During Dre\u2019s final months at Ruthless, he worked on NWA\u2019s Efil4zaggin while Cold 187um was simultaneously working on Black Mafia Life, and the pair often sounded each other out. It was during this period that he fashioned the G-funk sound, said Cold 187um. \u201cThe only thing I can say is that G-funk was my theory,\u201d he said. Dre \u201cutilized it and made lots of money and commercialized it, and I never got credit for it. All I wanted was my credit. I don\u2019t think he was being malicious. I think he heard a hot sound and then he used it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All I wanted was my credit. I don\u2019t think he was being malicious. I think he heard a hot sound and then he used it</p> <footer> <cite>Cold 187um</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many agree with this version of events, including Eazy-E. \u201cDre stole that style,\u201d he told writer Phyllis Pollack. \u201cDre stole stuff from Above the Law, Black Mafia Life\u2019s Never Missing a Beat.\u201d NWA promoter Doug Young agreed that Above the Law had the sound first. But Dre, he added, deserves credit for turning G-funk into the powerhouse it became. \u201cWhen you listen to that stuff to this day, it still holds up because of the sonics of the production,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The dispute caused tension between Ruthless and Death Row to nearly boil over. In February 1993, at an industry event called the Urban Network Power Jam held at the Marriott Hotel near LAX, Cold 187um angrily approached Warren G, Dr Dre\u2019s stepbrother. Warren G would later become famous for his song with Nate Dogg, Regulate, and had worked closely on The Chronic. Warren had also previously stayed, for a time, at Cold 187um\u2019s crash pad in Colton, California, along with members of Above the Law. Warren and Cold187um had previously been friendly, but now there was tension in the air. According to Cold187um, a dispute erupted:</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucked up how motherfuckers just integrated our style into they shit and created The Chronic,\u201d Cold 187um said. \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing to do with that, that\u2019s between you and Dre,\u201d Warren responded.</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute man, I let you stay at my house, I let you be a part of my family, and you treat me like this?\u201d said Cold 187um. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got nothing to do with that, you ain\u2019t got nothing to do with me no more.\u201d</p> <p>Warren was accompanied by fellow Death Row affiliates Snoop Dogg, Lil\u2019 \u00bd Dead, and others. Cold 187um was backed by artists including Eazy-E and an artist Eazy was recruiting at the time \u2013 Tupac Shakur, about two years before he signed with Death Row. </p> <p>The camps got to barking at each other, and before long everyone reached for their guns. \u201cThere were 15 of them, and about 25 to 30 of us,\u201d remembered Charis Henry, Eazy-E\u2019s assistant. \u201cIt was a standoff. It was the most nerve-racking thing imaginable.\u201d No one pulled the trigger. A bodyguard named Hollywood \u2013 who had worked with both camps \u2013 interceded. \u201cI need you, Death Row, to turn around, drop your guns, and walk out the door,\u201d he said, in Henry\u2019s recollection. \u201c[Eazy], I need you to wait for 15 minutes, and then take yourself home.\u201d Both sides complied, and the situation resolved peacefully.</p> <p>The G-funk drama was far from over, however. </p> <h2>\u2018You rollin\u2019 with Ruthless\u2019</h2> <p>Producer Rhythm D smelled the stench of defeat when he walked into Eazy\u2011E\u2019s Norwalk home around this time. Morale was low. Bodyguards were lying around on couches, while Ruthless affiliates watched LaserDiscs from Eazy\u2019s library or were out driving his luxury cars. The house boasted a top-of-the-line studio, armed with equipment like a brand new E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and sampler. But nobody was using it.</p> <p>Rhythm D had come over to play Eazy his beats. It was something of an audition for the tall, light-skinned South Central producer, whose career was on the rise thanks to his hit track for Los Angeles rapper Paperboy, Ditty. During his brief dalliance with Death Row, Rhythm D also made a song for the Deep Cover soundtrack called Down with My Nigga, featuring rapper Paradise. But he was broke and anxious for his next payday. To Eazy\u2019s house he brought with him a green tackle box. Rather than fishing lures, it held a floppy disk of his beats.</p> <p>While Rhythm cued up his songs, Eazy ducked into the shower. He seemed to have only half his mind on the proceedings. Undaunted, Rhythm plugged in his speakers and played a beat. It featured him and producer Battlecat going back and forth, trying to outdo each other with samples. The track had a wild energy about it, which Eazy felt immediately. He jumped out of the shower, hair all crazy, throwing on a towel and running into the room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f0c2d68f918c5aa2941a1d6e48fd6b3e7054ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0c2d68f918c5aa2941a1d6e48fd6b3e7054ef4/5_0_595_744/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jerry Heller with Eazy-E of NWA.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerry Heller with Eazy-E of NWA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruthless Record</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou rollin\u2019 with Ruthless,\u201d he exclaimed, signing Rhythm to a deal on the spot. Rhythm immediately moved into the house and got to work. Now that Dre was gone, his job description was Ruthless\u2019s newest in-house producer.</p> <p>Rhythm quickly realized he would have to do more than just make songs \u2013 he was going to have to shake Eazy out of his creative coma. He wasn\u2019t himself lately. The conflicts with Dre and Death Row leader Suge Knight had taken a toll.</p> <p>Eazy\u2019s first instinct was to craft a diss record scathing enough to send Dre scurrying under a rock. But his timing was bad. In this pre-YouTube era, rap beef moved at the speed of molasses. Eazy\u2019s last EP, 5150: Home 4 tha Sick, came out just a few days before The Chronic dropped, and didn\u2019t address Dre by name. It sold only a bit more than 500,000 copies, a flop considering Eazy\u2019s previous platinum sales history. </p> <p>Rhythm D had sat in on The Chronic recording sessions and had a strong feeling that G-funk was about to take over. After much arguing, he convinced Eazy that their Fuck wit Dre Day response should include the haunting new gangsta sound. But what about the song\u2019s message? How could they hit Dre back where it hurt?</p> <p>Rhythm lit up a fat one and got to thinking. Sure, Dre was practically untouchable right now, from a musical perspective. But there was a big difference between sounding like a gangsta and being a gangsta. To the guys in the streets, this was not incidental.</p> <p>They needed to convince these guys that Dre was phony, an opportunist. After all, not long ago, while Eazy was out selling crack and getting into trouble, Dre was dancing on stage and wearing makeup and fitted suits in his first group, called World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru. Eazy was authentic. He was real. It was time to drive that point home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13a7b57957fde28c547070896c5db8721580b250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a7b57957fde28c547070896c5db8721580b250/166_595_2085_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rhythm stayed up all night one night in 1993, fashioning the template for the song that would become Real Muthaphuckkin G\u2019s, or, on the radio, Real Compton City G\u2019s.</p> <p>Mirroring the tempo of Dre Day, the track also features a high-pitched Moog squeal. But it sounds even more intimidating, owing largely to Eazy\u2019s performance. The pace of Real Muthaphuckkin G\u2019s suited him, and his own eerie instrument-a \u201cdemonic, gnome type of voice\u201d, Rhythm D called it \u2013 fit the track\u2019s tone. And so, in the studio, Eazy launched into a series of disses and rebuttals. (\u201cAll of the sudden Dr Dre is the G thang / But on his old album covers he was a she-thang\u201d).</p> <p>The song also took aim at Snoop Dogg (Tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper) and featured Eazy-E\u2019s newest, toughest recruits: Dresta, who had recently emerged from prison for assault, and who wrote the hook and Eazy\u2019s verses, and Dresta\u2019s younger brother BG Knocc Out. Both of them were Nutty Blocc Crips whom Eazy met through a connection from Watts\u2019s Jordan Downs projects. </p> <p>The song\u2019s accompanying EP It\u2019s On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa contained a photo of Dre in his snug\u2011fitting doctor\u2019s outfit from his World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru photo shoot, with arrows pointing out his eye shadow\u201d, \u201ceyeliner\u201d, \u201clipstick\u201d, and \u201csequins\u201d. In an era before Google, the mere existence of this photo probably came as a surprise to many Dre fans.</p> <p>The disses were disingenuous at times. The stuff about Dre\u2019s glam days overstated, and besides Eazy knew about all of that when he signed on with Dre for NWA, and it didn\u2019t bother him back then.</p> <p>The particulars aside, one thing was clear: Eazy was back on message, and had his swagger back. It\u2019s On reinvigorated Eazy, selling more than 2m copies.</p> <p>So, who won this G-funk showdown, Eazy or Dre? You could say they both did, as it reignited both of their careers. But one could argue that hip-hop ultimately lost, as their dispute had far-reaching consequences, foreshadowing the murders of Tupac and Biggie. </p> <p>Previously, rap confrontations had been about who was superior on the microphone. The Eazy v Dre battle, however, was about who was the toughest in real life.

The current contract, for garrison support and welfare services at both Manus and Nauru until February 2017, is worth almost $2.2bn.</p> <p>The report said the department failed to demonstrate value for money in either of the initial limited tender processes or in the subsequent open tender process, which began in 2015 and was abandoned on 29 July 2016, after the department failed to assure a steering committee its renegotiated agreement with Transfield represented value for money.</p> <p>\u201cProcurement is core business for commonwealth entities and the deficiencies have resulted in higher than necessary expense for taxpayers and significant reputational risks for the Australian government and [the department],\u201d it said.</p> <p>The audit said the failures in the open tender process, conducted under the Abbott-Turnbull government, were of \u201cmost concern,\u201d finding the department allowed Transfield to negotiate a $1.1bn increase in the value of the contract without checking whether it had the authority to agree to that increase or whether other tenderers could best that price.</p> <p>It said that was of particular concern because the department had been explicitly ordered to reduce the cost per head of running the centres.</p> <p>According to figures provided by the department, the average cost per head declined from $698,000 in 2012-13 to $529,000 in 2015-2016 but, when you exclude capital expenditure from that calculation, the cost had actually gone up from $427,000 to $464,000.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/79a3be7b-0b3c-4aab-9e3a-a5c6aecf15fe\">a statement on Tuesday</a>, the department said its conduct \u201cmust be considered in the context of the unique operational environment [it] faced at the time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe department met the requirement of the government of the day in an environment that was high-tempo and complicated by logistics and procurement activities in foreign countries,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cDelegates were required to make decisions on complex matters within very short timeframes. It remains the department\u2019s position that decisions taken in this period were reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>The department said Australia\u2019s immigration detention network was under \u201cconsiderable strain\u201d from the arrival of almost 7,000 asylum seekers by boat in the first seven months of 2012 and said it acknowledged that \u201cdecision-making processes in this complex and rapidly evolving environment were not adequately documented\u201d.</p> <p>The department said it accepted the audit office\u2019s recommendations and had already begun to update its computer systems to allow for better record-keeping.</p> <p>Dutton said the Coalition was \u201cworking steadfastly to clean up Labor\u2019s monumental mess\u201d and called on Labor to \u201cacknowledge that its incompetent performance placed an impossible burden on the public service\u201d, saying department and Australian Border Force staff deserved an apology from the opposition leader, Bill Shorten.</p>",

Contrary to Coalition suggestion that they would find the crossbenchers easier to negotiate with, this coming together clears the way for Labor and the Coalition to do more deals down the track. You can argue over the specific policy items \u2013 such as cuts to Arena \u2013 but in my opinion the signs of compromise are a good thing. It breaks the deadlock on the shocking tribalism that inhabited the 43<sup>rd</sup> parliament under Tony Abbott as opposition leader. It clears the way for more centrist policies. It also is an acknowledgement that oppositions, present and future, can take part constructively in policy formulation. Labor thanked the Coalition. The Coalition thanked Labor.</strong><br></li> <li><strong>The future of the plebiscite remains in doubt, notwithstanding the Coalition cabinet and party room ticking off on public funding for the yes and no cases, a committee system to dole out the funding and a date: February 11. Labor still hasn\u2019t said whether it will vote against the plebiscite legislation even though it doesn\u2019t support the poll and said it could cause suicides. The Liberal senator Dean Smith has flagged he could not support the plebiscite bill.</strong></li> <li><strong>Late today, the parliament was arguing about the standing orders. These are the parliamentary rules. Labor has accused the Coalition of trying to change the rules after it lost the votes on September one. Christopher Pyne, leader of the house, says it is no such thing \u2013 the recommendations came from previous committee reports.</strong></li> </ul> <p>I am going to have to leave it there ...</p> <p>Thanks to the brains trust <strong>Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy </strong>and<strong> Gareth Hutchens</strong>.

There were long nights, I\u2019m told, weighing up the approach to an election against Turnbull, who was basking in political sunshine and flowers. The immediate decision was whether to go with Labor\u2019s electorally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/11/the-10-big-issues-of-election-2016-how-coalition-labor-and-greens-policies-compare\">risky negative gearing policy</a>. But it seemed to reflect a larger decision as to whether to die on his feet or live on his knees, as <strong>Peter Garrett</strong> would sing. Obviously, with nothing to lose, Shorten declared \u201cduck it\u201d and started <em>behaving</em> as though he had nothing to lose. </p> <p>History records that from December last year, Turnbull\u2019s stocks began to fall and Shorten\u2019s began to rise.</p> <p>Segue to the Newspoll this morning, released in the Oz.

Yet while Mr Turnbull remains the preferred prime minister by 43 per cent to Mr Shorten\u2019s 31 per cent, after spending a week overseas attending summits with world leaders, satisfaction with his performance is at its lowest level since he took power. Only 34 per cent of voters say they are satisfied with Mr Turnbull\u2019s performance as prime minister, \u00adalmost half the 60 per cent satisfaction peak he reached late last year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, obviously, there is a whole lot more at play for Turnbull. But for the outside observer, Turnbull continues to looked like a trapped man, trapped by his party\u2019s right and racked by indecision. If he were free, would he have a different agenda? We may never know. </p> <p>As of last night, the conservatives have just insisted on funding for the yes and no cases for the same-sex marriage plebiscite \u2013 a figure I am told is $7.5m for each side. The date of the vote will be 11 February, if the party room agrees. Given the guy did not want a plebiscite and supports marriage equality, it is a long way down off that horse. </p> <p>Next, the news. Strap yourself in. Party-room meetings coming up.

  "<p>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have any support structure that becomes a barrier to getting back to work for both men and women.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m discussing a new <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/women-and-equalities-committee/news-parliament-2015/pregnancy-and-maternity-report-published-16-17/\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> showing that each year 54,000 women face some form of maternity discrimination with Nora Senior, UK and Ireland chair of Weber Shandwick, who recently stepped down as president of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).<br></p> <p>The report highlights a clear problem facing UK business. Despite the changes to parental leave legislation and greater awareness of how to retain women after they\u2019ve had children, it seems the rhetoric isn\u2019t being put into practice. Senior agrees with the key finding of the report, that climbing the corporate ladder is much, much harder if you\u2019re a woman with children, and feels this is down to timing and childcare options.<br></p> <p>She wants the government to look at how it funds childcare. At the moment funding only starts when a child is three, and so anyone acting as a chief caregiver of children could be out of the workforce for three years.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/31/mps-urge-better-job-protection-for-expectant-and-new-mothers\">MPs urge better job protection for expectant and new mothers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGovernment has to look at putting in place better childcare facilities,\u201d she says. \u201cIf women do take time out to care for family they are then out of the office for a longer period of time and find it hard to come back.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Senior, the role business plays in the retention of women comes down to two things; an understanding of how to engage employees and the reality that for many small businesses their priority is simply staying afloat, not gender equality.<br></p> <p>\u201cBusinesses should look at how they maintain contact and bring women back into the workforce. One way for this is looking at the tech available, looking at flexible working options \u2026 [Also], one of the biggest ways to retain staff is training, they see a career path that is going to upskill them and they see a career path within the company. More needs to be done to encourage and incentivise training.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think at the moment staying in businesses is a bigger priority and profitability will always come first. Being able to keep your business trading with a profit line is a bigger issue. Small businesses don\u2019t have the time to sit down and work out policies and training programmes that support women, or even men.\u201d<br></p> <p>This lack of time and infrastructure is an issue that comes up in different guises again and again. Her time running the BCC allowed Senior to work with businesses at all different sizes and stages of their development, and in a range of political climates, but she clearly thinks there are some problems that are perennial. As someone with a languages background and a role that requires constantly advising international clients she\u2019s understandably interested in the UK\u2019s export market, although she is surprisingly sanguine about Brexit.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of issues that were present before Brexit and are still present. Our economy is underperforming, we need to think about incentivising smaller businesses to enter into export, how do we get those businesses access to finance etc. We have infrastructure challenges around getting goods in and out of the country, as well as local issues such as transport and access to skilled labour. From there you look at local planning and houses, because businesses need a workforce that can live around them. There are lots of challenges.\u201d<br></p> <p>How does she think the change of prime minister will affect the future of British business?<br></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a cohesive international trade strategy, Theresa May has created an international trade department, but I don\u2019t think we have collectively moved forward in a cohesive manner on [this agenda] and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see an upward swing in export. That\u2019s a challenge for the UK economy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Senior\u2019s eyes have always been set firmly outside the UK. She did a degree in languages to \u201cescape and travel the world\u201d but after she found a job with a UK-based company promotion after promotion kept her in the country. She makes up for this by using all the technology at her disposal to work with international clients.<br></p> <p>\u201cA lot of companies I work with are doing work across the world so a lot of my time is spent on Skype helping them roll out international programmes. Tech helps you operate more easily in a global environment, when you have the mobile connectivity and the speed that\u2019s needed.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/15/self-employed-women-disadvantaged-by-maternity-leave-says-report\">Self-employed women disadvantaged by maternity leave, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This last comment seems like a small dig at the UK\u2019s plans around this.

She points out that the UK is Europe\u2019s biggest online shopper, so the opportunity for digital businesses is huge, but we need to have the infrastructure in place.<br></p> <p>She\u2019s the sort of woman who you\u2019d trust with infrastructure and planning. She describes herself as always having been able to multi-task, and as well as juggling a big job at Weber Shandwick and presidency of the BCC, she also lives between Nottingham and Edinburgh with her husband and daughter.<br></p> <p>\u201cCommunication is at the heart of everything, I have a brilliant support team both at work and at home. My husband and I have a military approach to our diaries, so we make sure one of us is at home for our daughter.\u201d<br></p> <p>It is common for businesswomen to be asked about their home lives in a way a man simply wouldn\u2019t be, so it\u2019s not surprising that she gives a brief overview but doesn\u2019t go into much detail. I suspect she\u2019d rather I hadn\u2019t asked the question at all; maybe she\u2019s right. </p> <p>When I ask her if there\u2019s anything she wanted to talk about that I haven\u2019t mentioned she brings up the need to show young girls the options available to them. She wants to see more successful women speaking about their experiences in schools, in literature and in the media.

  "<p>Every Thursday evening, Tel Aviv\u2019s city hall is transformed. The windows light up, each becoming a \u201cpixel\u201d on a giant screen measuring 3,000 square metres. A pair of 1.5 metre joysticks is installed outside in Rabin Square; whoever gets there first can play what is probably the world\u2019s biggest game of Tetris.</p> <p>The stunt is designed to draw attention to the upcoming DLD Tel Aviv Innovation Festival, which starts later this month. While admittedly fun, and a good advertisement for the innovation festival, the giant game \u2013 which also becomes Snake or Pong at different times \u2013 is (somewhat ironically) not particularly innovative. Back in 2001, <a href=\"http://blinkenlights.net/\">Project Blinkenlights</a> lit up Haus des Lehrers in Berlin\u2019s Alexanderplatz, allowing people to use their Nokia handsets to play Pong. Since them, students at <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/718009.stm\">Brown</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/17846363\">MIT</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfzXcrvQU7Q\">Kiel</a> have pulled similar stunts. You can even play <a href=\"https://www.kingscross.co.uk/granary-squirt\">Snake on the fountains</a> in London\u2019s Granary Square.<br></p> <p>Nor, it must be said, does Tel Aviv\u2019s Tetris intervention do much for the city. Turning city hall into a video game probably isn\u2019t an effective way to get people interested in what happens within. And with room for only two players at a time, it hardly encourages broader interaction. Even 2004\u2019s Pac-Manhattan (which was surely an inevitability, given the strength of that wordplay), which saw five players in a control room guide five players dressed as Pac-Man characters through the New York City streets, got more people and places involved.<br></p> <p>So is there more to these stunts than PR?<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztIUlOUsaA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5ztIUlOUsaA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Despite what this year\u2019s Pokemania might suggest, games have long been central to public spaces. A few years after the first world war, the Italian town of Marostica hosted the first of what would become a biennial game of <a href=\"http://www.marosticascacchi.it/en/#1\">chess played with human pieces</a>, reenacting the (potentially fictional) story of a medieval lord who ordered his daughter\u2019s two suitors to play for her hand. Earlier this year, the Boris Johnson-endorsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/jan/19/boris-johnson-rendered-as-minecraft-character-to-promote-london-games-festival-video\">Games London</a> temporarily installed a giant Monopoly board in Trafalgar Square, with the familiar locations replaced with notable years in the history of UK video game development.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of a gimmick to get attention from some of the press and from passersby,\u201d admits Michael French, Games London\u2019s senior games programme executive.

Two teams of children faced off across the river Thames in a game of <a href=\"http://muftigames.com/games-compendium/massive-battleships/\">Massive Battleships</a>, making their moves by holding up signs at which their opponents, on the other side of the river, peered through binoculars.

Now that GameCity has opened the fun-filled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/2016/apr/29/uk-culture-games-policy-continue-conference\">National Videogame Arcade</a>, Nottingham is a city of games all year round.</p> <p>As well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/10/art-data-digital-city\">encouraging people to pay more attention to the challenges facing their city</a>, Gramazio thinks that games can get us to pay more attention to each other. Citizens of Hildesheim and Oberhausen, Germany, can play games with strangers on the opposite side of a pedestrian crossing via prototypes of a new kind of traffic-light button called <a href=\"http://urban-invention.com/\">ActiWait</a> (though the promise to \u201cconvert boring waiting times into positive experiences\u201d smacks of dystopian science fiction). </p> <p>Big events like the yearly <a href=\"https://improveverywhere.com/missions/the-mp3-experiments/\">MP3 Experiments</a>, for which thousands of people download an MP3 of instructions and gather for synchronised play, and 2012\u2019s <a href=\"http://hideandseek.net/projects/the-new-year-games/\">New Year Games</a>, in which two teams competed in challenges such as throwing paper aeroplanes at invisible musicians and stealing ribbons from a man dressed as a minotaur, bring thousands of people together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e38e4ea6dc28b86c588ab56675e50474c8fdee10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e38e4ea6dc28b86c588ab56675e50474c8fdee10/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children dressed as Pikachu play Pokemon Go in Mexico City on 21 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children play Pokemon Go in Mexico City on 21 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One morning in July 2010, outside the National Theatre, Londoners played a game called <a href=\"http://www.815agency.com/indexhibit/index.php?/projects/pass-the-impossibly-large-parcel-ii/\">Pass the Impossibly Large Parcel</a>. Each layer of the parcel, when unwrapped, revealed \u201cprizes\u201d in the form of costume items. Players wore them before they went about their day \u2013 a kind of tribal identification, marking you on the tube or the office as a member of a secret club. Those who took part in the early days of Pokemon Go phenomenon will recognise that feeling of camaraderie. The game\u2019s sense of community has manifested in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/pokemon-go-gathering-san-francisco\">9,000-strong gatherings</a>, and charitable play such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tylerkonersman/status/753809499933204481\">dropping lures outside hospitals</a> so that sick kids can catch Pokemon from their beds. </p> <p>One of the most common complaints about cities is that the crowds can leave one feeling lost and lonely. Games counter that by connecting us to each other and the spaces in which we play. Tetris in Tel Aviv might be a bit of a damp squib, but only because it had a deeper potential. \u201cPlaying is a thing that we usually do in places that feel like they\u2019re ours \u2013 like we\u2019re safe there,\u201d says Gramazio. \u201cHaving that happen in a city, where people are wandering through, can make me as a player feel more at home.\u201d</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> to join the discussion</em></p>",

The first idea disappears \u2013 but it has an important place because it\u2019s the thing that pushed you. </p> <p>A woman called Pepa is going to have a definitive conversation with her lover, who is leaving her. When you split up with someone you are on the verge of a breakdown, you are about to lose control. She goes out in search of him and things happen: her apartment fills up with people who have a range of different problems. At first Pepa resents all these people, but in the process of helping them, she realises she has got over her own problem. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A woman friend recognised herself in the film \u2013 and did not like what I\u2019d done</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wanted to find a way of joking about my own problems, and those of a close woman friend. It was about taking a painful point of origin and converting it into something comical and fun. My woman friend recognised herself in the film \u2013 and did not like what I\u2019d done.</p> <p>I wanted a pop-art kind of set, with pastel colours. If I\u2019d had the money and the contacts, I would have asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney\">David Hockney</a> to design it. The chickens Pepa kept on her terrace wandered freely around the set. I was surrounded by animals in my youth. I liked the nostalgia of that \u2013 but put in a Madrid penthouse.</p> <p>Shooting took about eight weeks. It wasn\u2019t easy: there was a lot of conflict.

I wasn\u2019t sure she would even stay and finish the film. </p> <p>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown is a key film in my life. It went all over the world and opened up doors for me.

I had moved there with my pop-punk band and he came to see us perform. He was about to shoot <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093412/\">Law of Desire</a> and asked me about my dress: it was very sexy. He wanted to get one for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/03/features.gilestremlett\">Carmen Maura</a>, who was playing a transgender actress in the film. I said, \u201cI made it myself\u201d, and he offered me a small part in the film. </p> <p>After that, he wrote the part of Marisa for me for in Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. It felt more like being an actor because, unlike in Law of Desire, my character had nothing to do with my real life. She did not dress like me. Marisa [who comes to Pepa\u2019s apartment with her boyfriend, who happens to be Pepa\u2019s lover\u2019s son] drinks gazpacho filled with sleeping pills and falls asleep. At the beginning I was like: \u201cMy goodness, I\u2019m not doing anything here!\u201d </p> <p>One day, I was told I had to come to the set because they needed to film my legs on a sunlounger as the camera panned across Pepa\u2019s terrace. \u201cI have to go just to lie down?\u201d I thought. \u201cThis is the role of an actress?\u201d I was very heavy with Pedro, always saying: \u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d He would say: \u201cWhat are you going to do? When people are asleep, they\u2019re asleep!\u201d Eventually he said: \u201cOK, you\u2019re going to have a dream. And you\u2019re going to have an orgasm. Then you won\u2019t be a virgin any more, as the dream is going to be so real for you.\u201d I said: \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d</p> <p>I enjoyed every minute of the film. With Pedro, it\u2019s always like playing. He writes female characters so well because he comes from a matriarchy. His mother was very important, very creative. He loves women. He understands our world and the way we see life. </p> <p>\u2022 The Almod\u00f3var Collection, six of the director\u2019s early films, is out on 19 September.</p>",

  "<p>Back in the 1840s, contracting pneumonia was a risk to America\u2019s presidential and political health.

But in practice, there is little precedent and perhaps only a narrow window for such a dramatic change of heart for either party.</p> <p>Vice-presidential candidates were changed during the campaigns of 1912 and 1972, both with relatively little consequence, but <a href=\"http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/20431\">no presidential nominee has ever dropped out</a>, and the approach of early voting deadlines in a number of states makes it hard to imagine how this would work smoothly today.</p> <p>In the case of the Democratic National Committee, its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.democrats.org/Downloads/DNC_Charter__Bylaws_9.17.15.pdf\">rules stipulate</a> that a \u201cspecial meeting to fill a vacancy on the national ticket shall be held on the call of the chairperson, who shall set the date for such meeting\u201d. But the wording also allows a rules committee to set its own approach, and such a procedure may reopen barely healed wounds in the party, with supporters of Bernie Sanders arguing that he would have the clearest mandate to step in, while the party leadership and White House would be likely to favour Vice-President Joe Biden. </p> <p>Given time, either Biden or Sanders could prove effective at appealing to the working-class independents drawn to Trump. Both have shown a populist appeal sometimes seen as lacking in the Clinton campaign, which already has a far less certain lead in the polls than many Democrats would like at this stage.</p> <p>Some in the Clinton campaign may prefer that her vice-presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, step into any vacuum, particularly as the campaign messaging might then require less of an abrupt change. But even this alternative could cede vital momentum to Trump at a tricky time in the race for the White House.</p> <p>Many states would require court intervention to waive registration deadlines, something that could leave Republicans with the option <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/if-hillary-had-to-leave-the-ticket-this-is-how-a-n.html\">of legal challenge</a> if they wanted to frustrate the process or preferred to retain Clinton as an opponent.</p> <p>But the biggest obstacle would be apportioning votes that had already been cast for one of the existing candidates. Many states allow absentee balloting from early October, and some, such as North Carolina, started as early as last Friday.</p> <p>With a deadlocked supreme court and highly charged congressional atmosphere, a late change could result in a mess to compare to the 1841 Harrison succession row.</p>",
  "<p>I hate to disappoint you folks, but unless we stretch the topic to breaking point this address will not be about \u201ccommunity and belonging.\u201d In fact, you have to hand it to this festival\u2019s organisers: inviting a renowned iconoclast to speak about \u201ccommunity and belonging\u201d is like expecting a great white shark to balance a beach ball on its nose.<br></p> <p>The topic I had submitted instead was \u201cfiction and identity politics,\u201d which may sound on its face equally dreary. </p> <p>But I\u2019m afraid the bramble of thorny issues that cluster around \u201cidentity politics\u201d has got all too interesting, particularly for people pursuing the occupation I share with many gathered in this hall: fiction writing.

Earlier this year, two students, both members of student government, threw a tequila-themed birthday party for a friend.

Administrators sent multiple emails to the \u201cculprits\u201d threatening an investigation into an \u201cact of ethnic stereotyping.\u201d Partygoers were placed on \u201csocial probation,\u201d while the two hosts were ejected from their dorm and later impeached. Bowdoin\u2019s student newspaper decried the attendees\u2019 lack of \u201cbasic empathy.\u201d </p> <p>The student government issued a \u201cstatement of solidarity\u201d with \u201call the students who were injured and affected by the incident,\u201d and demanded that administrators \u201ccreate a safe space for those students who have been or feel specifically targeted.\u201d The tequila party, the statement specified, was just the sort of occasion that \u201ccreates an environment where students of colour, particularly Latino, and especially Mexican, feel unsafe.\u201d In sum, the party-favour hats constituted \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d</p> <p>Curiously, across my country Mexican restaurants, often owned and run by Mexicans, are festooned with sombreros \u2013 if perhaps not for long. At the UK\u2019s University of East Anglia, the student union has banned a Mexican restaurant from giving out sombreros, deemed once more an act of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d that was also racist.</p> <p>Now, I am a little at a loss to explain what\u2019s so insulting about a sombrero \u2013 a practical piece of headgear for a hot climate that keeps out the sun with a wide brim. My parents went to Mexico when I was small, and brought a sombrero back from their travels, the better for my brothers and I to unashamedly <em>appropriate </em>the souvenir to play dress-up. For my part, as a German-American on both sides, I\u2019m more than happy for anyone who doesn\u2019t share my genetic pedigree to don a Tyrolean hat, pull on some leiderhosen, pour themselves a <em>weisbier, </em>and belt out the Hoffbrauhaus Song.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ultimate endpoint of keeping out mitts off experience that doesn\u2019t belong to us is that there is no fiction.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But what does this have to do with writing fiction? The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear: <em>you\u2019re not supposed to try on other people\u2019s hats</em>. Yet that\u2019s what we\u2019re paid to do, isn\u2019t it? Step into other people\u2019s shoes, and try on their hats.</p> <p>In the latest ethos, which has spun well beyond college campuses in short order, any tradition, any experience, any costume, any way of doing and saying things, that is associated with a minority or disadvantaged group is ring-fenced: look-but-don\u2019t-touch. Those who embrace a vast range of \u201cidentities\u201d \u2013 ethnicities, nationalities, races, sexual and gender categories, classes of economic under-privilege and disability \u2013 are now encouraged to be possessive of their experience and to regard other peoples\u2019 attempts to participate in their lives and traditions, either actively or imaginatively, as a form of theft.</p> <p>Yet were their authors honouring the new rules against helping yourself to what doesn\u2019t belong to you, we would not have Malcolm Lowry\u2019s Under the Volcano.

Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law, Susan Scafidi, a law professor at Fordham University who for the record is white, defines cultural appropriation<em> </em>as \u201ctaking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else\u2019s culture without permission. This can include unauthorised use of another culture\u2019s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc.\u201d</p> <p>What strikes me about that definition is that \u201cwithout permission\u201d bit. However are we fiction writers to seek \u201cpermission\u201d to use a character from another race or culture, or to employ the vernacular of a group to which we don\u2019t belong? Do we set up a stand on the corner and approach passers-by with a clipboard, getting signatures that grant limited rights to employ an Indonesian character in Chapter Twelve, the way political volunteers get a candidate on the ballot?</p> <p>I am hopeful that the concept of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d is a passing fad: people with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life. </p> <p>But this latest and little absurd no-no is part of a larger climate of super-sensitivity, giving rise to proliferating prohibitions supposedly in the interest of social justice that constrain fiction writers and prospectively makes our work impossible. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seriously, we have people questioning whether it\u2019s appropriate for white people to eat pad Thai.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, the majority of these farcical cases of \u201cappropriation\u201d have concentrated on fashion, dance, and music: At the American Music Awards 2013, Katy Perry got it in the neck for dressing like a geisha.

Turnabout, then: I guess that means that as a native of North Carolina, I can ban the Thais from eating barbecue. (I bet they\u2019d swap.)</p> <p>This same sensibility is coming to a bookstore near you. Because who is the appropriator par excellence, really? Who assumes other people\u2019s voices, accents, patois, and distinctive idioms? Who literally puts words into the mouths of people different from themselves? Who dares to get inside the very heads of strangers, who has the chutzpah to project thoughts and feelings into the minds of others, who steals their very souls? Who is a professional kidnapper? Who swipes every sight, smell, sensation, or overheard conversation like a kid in a candy store, and sometimes <em>take notes </em>the better to purloin whole worlds? Who is the premier pickpocket of the arts? </p> <p>The fiction writer, that\u2019s who.</p> <p>This is a disrespectful vocation by its nature \u2013 prying, voyeuristic, kleptomaniacal, and presumptuous. And that is fiction writing at its best. When Truman Capote wrote from the perspective of condemned murderers from a lower economic class than his own, he had some gall. But writing fiction takes gall.</p> <p>As for the culture police\u2019s obsession with \u201cauthenticity,\u201d fiction is inherently inauthentic. It\u2019s fake. It\u2019s self-confessedly fake; that is the nature of the form, which is about people who don\u2019t exist and events that didn\u2019t happen. The name of the game is not whether your novel honours reality; it\u2019s all about what you can get away with.</p> <p>In his 2009 novel Little Bee, Chris Cleave, who as it happens is participating in this festival, dared to write from the point of view of a 14-year-old Nigerian girl, though he is male, white, and British. I\u2019ll remain neutral on whether he \u201cgot away with it\u201d in literary terms, because I haven\u2019t read the book yet. </p> <p>But in principle, I admire his courage \u2013 if only because he invited this kind of ethical forensics in a review out of San Francisco: \u201cWhen a white male author writes as a young Nigerian girl, is it an act of empathy, or identity theft?\u201d the reviewer asked. \u201cWhen an author pretends to be someone he is not, he does it to tell a story outside of his own experiential range. But he has to in turn be careful that he is representing his characters, not using them for his plot.\u201d</p> <p>Hold it. OK, he\u2019s necessarily \u201crepresenting\u201d his characters, by portraying them on the page. But of course he\u2019s using them for his plot! How could he not? They are his characters, to be manipulated at his whim, to fulfill whatever purpose he cares to put them to.</p> <p>This same reviewer recapitulated Cleave\u2019s obligation \u201cto show that he\u2019s representing [the girl], rather than exploiting her.\u201d Again, a false dichotomy. </p> <p>Of course he\u2019s exploiting her. It\u2019s his book, and he made her up. The character is his creature, to be exploited up a storm. Yet the reviewer chides that \u201cspecial care should be taken with a story that\u2019s not implicitly yours to tell\u201d and worries that \u201cCleave pushes his own boundaries maybe further than they were meant to go.\u201d</p> <p>What stories are \u201cimplicitly ours to tell,\u201d and what boundaries around our own lives are we mandated to remain within? I would argue that any story you can <em>make </em>yours is yours to tell, and trying to push the boundaries of the author\u2019s personal experience is part of a fiction writer\u2019s job. </p> <p>I\u2019m hoping that crime writers, for example, don\u2019t all have personal experience of committing murder. Me, I\u2019ve depicted a high school killing spree, and I hate to break it to you: I\u2019ve never shot fatal arrows through seven kids, a teacher, and a cafeteria worker, either. We make things up, we chance our arms, sometimes we do a little research, but in the end it\u2019s still about what we can get away with \u2013 what we can put over on our readers. </p> <p>Because the ultimate endpoint of keeping out mitts off experience <em>that doesn\u2019t belong to us </em>is that there is no fiction. Someone like me only permits herself to write from the perspective of a straight white female born in North Carolina, closing on sixty, able-bodied but with bad knees, skint for years but finally able to buy the odd new shirt. All that\u2019s left is memoir.</p> <p>And here\u2019s the bugbear, here\u2019s where we really can\u2019t win. At the same time that we\u2019re to write about only the few toys that landed in our playpen, we\u2019re also upbraided for failing to portray in our fiction a population that is sufficiently various. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m hoping that crime writers, for example, don\u2019t all have personal experience of committing murder.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My most recent novel The Mandibles<em> </em>was taken to task by one reviewer for addressing an America that is \u201cstraight and white\u201d. It happens that this is a multigenerational family saga \u2013 about a white family. I wasn\u2019t instinctively inclined to insert a transvestite or bisexual, with issues that might distract from my central subject matter of apocalyptic economics. Yet the implication of this criticism is that we novelists need to plug in representatives of a variety of groups in our cast of characters, as if filling out the entering class of freshmen at a university with strict diversity requirements.</p> <p>You do indeed see just this brand of tokenism in television. There was a point in the latter 1990s at which suddenly every sitcom and drama in sight had to have a gay or lesbian character or couple. That was good news as a voucher of the success of the gay rights movement, but it still grew a bit tiresome: <em>look at us, our show is so hip, one of the characters is homosexual! </em></p> <p>We\u2019re now going through the same fashionable exercise in relation to the transgender characters in series like Transparent and Orange is the New Black.</p> <p>Fine. But I still would like to reserve the right as a novelist to use only the characters that pertain to my story.</p> <p>Besides: which is it to be? We have to tend our own gardens, and only write about ourselves or people just like us because we mustn\u2019t pilfer others\u2019 experience, <em>or </em>we have to people our cast like an <em>I\u2019d like to teach the world to sing </em>Coca-Cola advert?</p> <p>For it can be dangerous these days to go the diversity route. Especially since there seems to be a consensus on the notion that San Francisco reviewer put forward that \u201cspecial care should be taken with a story that\u2019s not implicitly yours to tell.\u201d</p> <p>In The Mandibles, I have one secondary character, Luella, who\u2019s black. She\u2019s married to a more central character, Douglas, the Mandible family\u2019s 97-year-old patriarch. I reasoned that Douglas, a liberal New Yorker, would credibly have left his wife for a beautiful, stately African American because arm candy of color would reflect well on him in his circle, and keep his progressive kids\u2019 objections to a minimum. But in the end the joke is on Douglas, because Luella suffers from early onset dementia, while his ex-wife, staunchly of sound mind, ends up running a charity for dementia research. As the novel reaches its climax and the family is reduced to the street, they\u2019re obliged to put the addled, disoriented Luella on a leash, to keep her from wandering off.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I confess that this climate of scrutiny has got under my skin.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Behold, the reviewer in the Washington Post, who groundlessly accused this book of being \u201cracist\u201d because it doesn\u2019t toe a strict Democratic Party line in its political outlook, described the scene thus: \u201cThe Mandibles are white. Luella, the single African American in the family, arrives in Brooklyn incontinent and demented. She needs to be physically restrained. As their fortunes become ever more dire and the family assembles for a perilous trek through the streets of lawless New York, she\u2019s held at the end of a leash. If The Mandibles is ever made into a film, my suggestion is that this image not be employed for the movie poster.\u201d </p> <p>Your author, by implication, yearns to bring back slavery.</p> <p>Thus in the world of identity politics, fiction writers better be careful. If we do choose to import representatives of protected groups, special rules apply. If a character happens to be black, they have to be treated with kid gloves, and never be placed in scenes that, taken out of context, might seem disrespectful. But that\u2019s no way to write. The burden is too great, the self-examination paralysing. The natural result of that kind of criticism in the Post<em> </em>is that next time I don\u2019t use <em>any </em>black characters, lest they do or say anything that is short of perfectly admirable and lovely.</p> <p>In fact, I\u2019m reminded of a letter I received in relation to my seventh novel from an Armenian-American who objected \u2013 why did I have to make the narrator of We Need to Talk About Kevin<em> </em>Armenian? He didn\u2019t like my narrator, and felt that her ethnicity disparaged his community. I took pains to explain that I knew something about Armenian heritage, because my best friend in the States was Armenian, and I also thought there was something dark and aggrieved in the culture of the Armenian diaspora that was atmospherically germane to that book. Besides, I despaired, everyone in the US has an ethnic background of some sort, and she had to be something!</p> <p>Especially for writers from traditionally privileged demographics, the message seems to be that it\u2019s a whole lot safer just to make all your characters from that same demographic, so you can be as hard on them as you care to be, and do with them what you like. Availing yourself of a diverse cast, you are not free; you have inadvertently invited a host of regulations upon your head, as if just having joined the EU. Use different races, ethnicities, and minority gender identities, and you are being watched.</p> <p>I confess that this climate of scrutiny has got under my skin. When I was first starting out as a novelist, I didn\u2019t hesitate to write black characters, for example, or to avail myself of black dialects, for which, having grown up in the American South, I had a pretty good ear. I am now much more anxious about depicting characters of different races, and accents make me nervous. </p> <p>In describing a second-generation Mexican American who\u2019s married to one of my main characters in The Mandibles, I took care to write his dialogue in standard American English, to specify that he spoke without an accent, and to explain that he only dropped Spanish expressions tongue-in-cheek. I would certainly think twice \u2013 more than twice \u2013 about ever writing a whole novel, or even a goodly chunk of one, from the perspective of a character whose race is different from my own \u2013 because I may sell myself as an iconoclast, but I\u2019m as anxious as the next person about attracting vitriol. But I think that\u2019s a loss. I think that indicates a contraction of my fictional universe that is not good for the books, and not good for my soul.</p> <p>Writing under the pseudonym Edward Schlosser on Vox, the author of the essay \u201cI\u2019m a Liberal Professor, and My Liberal Students Scare Me\u201d describes higher education\u2019s \u201ccurrent climate of fear\u201d and its \u201cheavily policed discourse of semantic sensitivity\u201d \u2013 and I am concerned that this touchy ethos, in which offendedness is used as a weapon, has spread far beyond academia, in part thanks to social media. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The left\u2019s embrace of gotcha hypersensitivity inevitably invites backlash.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why, it\u2019s largely in order to keep from losing my fictional mojo that I stay off Facebook and Twitter, which could surely install an instinctive self-censorship out of fear of attack. Ten years ago, I gave the opening address of this same festival, in which I maintained that fiction writers have a vested interest in protecting everyone\u2019s <em>right </em>to offend others \u2013 because if hurting someone else\u2019s feelings even inadvertently is sufficient justification for muzzling, there will always be someone out there who is miffed by what you say, and freedom of speech is dead. With the rise of identity politics, which privileges a subjective sense of injury as actionable basis for prosecution, that is a battle that in the decade since I last spoke in Brisbane we\u2019ve been losing.</p> <p>Worse: the left\u2019s embrace of <em>gotcha </em>hypersensitivity inevitably invites backlash. Donald Trump appeals to people who have had it up to their eyeballs with being told what they can and cannot say. Pushing back against a mainstream culture of speak-no-evil suppression, they lash out in defiance, and then what they say is pretty appalling.</p> <p>Regarding identity politics, what\u2019s especially saddened me in my recent career is a trend toward rejecting the advocacy of anyone who does not belong to the group. In 2013, I published Big Brother, a novel that grew out of my loss of my own older brother, who in 2009 died from the complications of morbid obesity. I was moved to write the book not only from grief, but also sympathy: in the years before his death, as my brother grew heavier, I saw how dreadfully other people treated him \u2013 how he would be seated off in a corner of a restaurant, how the staff would roll their eyes at each other after he\u2019d ordered, though he hadn\u2019t requested more food than anyone else. </p> <p>I was wildly impatient with the way we assess people\u2019s characters these days in accordance with their weight, and tried to get on the page my dismay at how much energy people waste on this matter, sometimes anguishing for years over a few excess pounds. Both author and book were on the side of the angels, or so you would think.</p> <p>But in my events to promote Big Brother, I started to notice a pattern. Most of the people buying the book in the signing queue were thin. Especially in the US, fat is now one of those issues where you either have to be <em>one of us</em>, or you\u2019re the enemy. I verified this when I had a long email correspondence with a \u201cHealthy at Any Size\u201d activist, who was incensed by the novel, which she hadn\u2019t even read. Which she refused to read. No amount of explaining that the novel was on her side, that it was a book that was terribly pained by the way heavy people are treated and how unfairly they are judged, could overcome the scrawny author\u2019s photo on the flap.</p> <p>She and her colleagues in the fat rights movement did not want my advocacy. I could not <em>weigh in </em>on this material because I did not belong to the club. I found this an artistic, political, and even commercial disappointment \u2013 because in the US and the UK, if only skinny-minnies will buy your book, you\u2019ve evaporated the pool of prospective consumers to a puddle.</p> <p>I worry that the clamorous world of identity politics is also undermining the very causes its activists claim to back. As a fiction writer, yeah, I do sometimes deem my narrator an Armenian. But that\u2019s only by way of a start. Merely being Armenian is not to have a character as I understand the word. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should be seeking to push beyond the constraining categories into which we have been arbitrarily dropped by birth.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Membership of a larger group is not an identity. Being Asian is not an identity. Being gay is not an identity. Being deaf, blind, or wheelchair-bound is not an identity, nor is being economically deprived. I reviewed a novel recently that I had regretfully to give a thumbs-down, though it was terribly well intended; its heart was in the right place. But in relating the Chinese immigrant experience in America, the author put forward characters that were mostly Chinese. That is, that\u2019s sort of all they were: Chinese. Which isn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>I made this same point in relation to gender in Melbourne last week: both as writers and as people, we should be seeking to push beyond the constraining categories into which we have been arbitrarily dropped by birth. If we embrace narrow group-based identities too fiercely, we cling to the very cages in which others would seek to trap us. We pigeonhole ourselves. We limit our own notion of who we are, and in presenting ourselves as one of a membership, a representative of our <em>type</em>, an ambassador of an amalgam, we ask not to be seen.</p> <p>The reading and writing of fiction is obviously driven in part by a desire to look inward, to be self-examining, reflective. But the form is also born of a desperation to break free of the claustrophobia of our own experience. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/white-woman-black-hairstyle-cultural-appropriation\">Why the fuss over a white woman having a black hairstyle? | Sede Alonge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spirit of good fiction is one of exploration, generosity, curiosity, audacity, and compassion.

So it\u2019s more than possible that we write from the perspective of a one-legged lesbian from Afghanistan and fall flat on our arses. We don\u2019t get the dialogue right, and for insertions of expressions in Pashto we depend on Google Translate.</p> <p>Halfway through the novel, suddenly the protagonist has lost the right leg instead of the left one. Our idea of lesbian sex is drawn from wooden internet porn. Efforts to persuasively enter the lives of others very different from us may fail: that\u2019s a given.

Rich knows as well as anyone there are many lefts, not one homogeneous movement. Unfortunately for Britain, representatives of the darkest left factions control Labour and much of the trade union movement, and dominate the intelligentsia. On the rare occasions when they are challenged, they say \u201cI am not antisemitic, I am just anti-Zionist\u201d \u2013 an excuse that mirrors the protestations of the <em>Daily Mail</em> that it is not against ethnic minorities, just anti-PC. Rich uses it as key to understanding the strange history of how a leftwing movement many Jews&#xa0;once supported became an unsafe&#xa0;space.</p> <p>Zionism is the nationalist belief that the Jews should have a homeland. Once a controversial idea among European Jews, it turned into common sense as fascism grew. What, in these circumstances, does anti-Zionism mean? From the 1970s on, opponents of Israel had to decide whether anti-Zionism meant a fulfilment of Palestinian national rights via a two-state solution which recognised that Palestine was the focus of competing Jewish and Arab nationalisms, or whether it required them to support a war to the death, which would lead to an ethnically and (with the rise of Sunni fundamentalism) confessionally pure state. The question is rarely asked, let alone answered. Today\u2019s Palestine solidarity movements lack the guts to say openly that they want an end to Israel, and instead argue for the right of Palestinians to return to Israel, which would destroy it as a Jewish state.</p> <p>I suppose it is possible to agitate for the destruction of the world\u2019s only Jewish country without being a racist. Rich shows in the 1970s there was at least an awareness of the danger of slipping into reactionary politics. The far left tried to ban Jews speaking at universities and supported violence, but it very rarely talked in Hitlerian tones of a vast Jewish conspiracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/30/observer-view-on-labour-antisemitism-crisis\">The Observer view on Labour\u2019s antisemitism crisis | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anti-fascism died when Islamist utopianism annihilated socialist utopianism.

By contrast, at a pro-Palestinian rally led by Corbyn in 2002, supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood handed out newspapers instructing marchers that man was on Earth to serve God, and Muslims and non-Muslims could not be treated equally in an Islamic state. All of a sudden, and without anything resembling a debate, the loudest voices in the British and world left were on the side of men whose prejudices, not only against Jews, but against women, homosexuals, secular societies, and human rights, combined the worst theology of the seventh century with the worst ideology of the 20th.</p> <p>If Rich has a fault, it is that as a rational historian, he cannot speculate on the psychological appeal of left antisemitism. Novelists would notice the attraction of an authorised racism to leftists, who in other respects are highly constrained in what they can say by speech codes. They would find that a prejudice that endorsed fascism as well as 2,000 years of Christian polemics and persecutions fitted far-left political beliefs rather well.

It is possible for poor children to shatter glass ceilings after receiving a comprehensive education. Take inner London, where I grew up, which has no grammar schools.

The IFS finds that children from deprived backgrounds are <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8469\" title=\"\">much less likely</a> to attend existing grammar schools than better-off children are, even high-achieving poor pupils, while those who don\u2019t pass the 11-plus do much worse than in a comprehensive system. But in inner London, about half the pupils eligible for free school meals achieve five or more GCSEs at A* to C, double the proportion outside London.

One of my schoolmates has just become a senior lawyer at one of the best law firms in the world. Another has just announced another successful year as a graphic design entrepreneur. A third is now progressing rapidly after joining his company as an apprentice. I would not have achieved at school if it hadn\u2019t been for the influence of able peers acting as role models for me and the entire school. For any young black boy growing up in a poor community (where role models are not in plentiful supply) it would be dangerous to understate that particular benefit of comprehensive education. Grammar schools would cream off many such role models.</p> <p>Forcing new grammars to admit a minimum number of disadvantaged students is not the answer, either. No quota system could guarantee that disadvantaged students would thrive in that environment and would probably have to lower entry requirements in order to ensure the requisite number of poorer pupils.

  "<p>You\u2019re effectively using the essential ingredients of cannabis right now. You and everyone else. That\u2019s because our brains, and other parts of the body, have a natural endocannabinoid system that is now known to assist with how we deal with pain, the control of movement, the protection of the brain after damage and a host of other functions. Our increasing knowledge of this natural endocannabinoid system now gives a solid scientific rationale for why cannabis has so many positive medicinal effects. And as well as this recently understood scientific rationale, there is a substantial body of clinical evidence that medical cannabis works. My review of that evidence is published today by the <a href=\"http://www.drugpolicyreform.net/\" title=\"\">UK all-party parliamentary group on drug reform</a> as part of their inquiry into medical cannabis.</p> <p>My challenge to the government is to have the political courage to accept the scientific rationale, accept the evidence and move to legalise access to medical cannabis under prescription here in the UK as a matter of urgency.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cannabis has been a useful medicine for centuries, with known use dating back to 4000BC in ancient China</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Currently, the government has cannabis classified as a <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/3998/schedule/1/made\" title=\"\">Schedule 1 drug</a>, a classification for substances judged to have no medicinal value. This is irrational and incoherent. The evidence is plain to see and has been compelling enough for a large <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/dec/11/uruguay-marijuana-laws-around-world\" title=\"\">number of countries to legalise access</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/15/cannabis-marijuana-medicine-law-growing\" title=\"\">medical cannabis</a> including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/02/health.healthandwellbeing\" title=\"\">Netherlands</a>, Germany, Spain and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/09/medical-marijuana-families-move-to-colorado-epilepsy\" title=\"\">25 US states</a>.</p> <p>My report shows that there is strong evidence that medical cannabis helps with chronic pain; spasticity (common, disabling and painful after stroke or brain injury and common in those suffering from multiple sclerosis, as examples); for nausea and vomiting, especially during chemotherapy; and for the management of anxiety. There is also evidence of usefulness in sleep disorders, for appetite stimulation (in HIV, for example), fibromyalgia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/medical-marijuana-legalization-us-american-legion-veterans\" title=\"\">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, severe childhood epilepsies, bladder problems and even for control of some cancers. The list goes on.</p> <p>And this issue matters to a lot of people. Estimates by the campaign group <a href=\"http://www.endourpain.org/\" title=\"\">End Our Pain</a> put the number of people in the UK taking cannabis primarily for medical reasons at one million. Many have found that \u201cregular\u201d prescription medicines just don\u2019t work for them, or have debilitating side-effects. As access to cannabis in the UK is illegal, all these people are at risk of prosecution. These people would be regarded as patients in those countries with a more enlightened approach, but here they risk being treated as criminals.</p> <p>The usefulness of medical cannabis is unquestionable; but is it safe? Certainly there are some potential short-term effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, balance problems and sometimes confusion. These effects, however, are largely induced by the psychoactive component \u2013 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This is the chemical that causes the \u201chigh\u201d sought by recreational users. The other main chemical is cannabidiol (CBD), which is neither illegal nor psychoactive and indeed counters the effects of THC. That\u2019s why medical cannabis will be produced in controlled conditions to ensure the right balance between CBD and THC.</p> <p>Much more powerful and potentially dangerous prescription medicines are prescribed routinely by doctors. Every drug prescribed has positive and negative effects and the doctor\u2019s job is to weigh those risks and benefits, explain that balance to the patient and allow an informed choice. It would be no different in the case of medical cannabis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/09/medical-marijuana-families-move-to-colorado-epilepsy\">Expots: medical marijuana draws parents to US for their children's treatments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What about the threat of long-term problems, such as triggering schizophrenia? The evidence is conflicting but nevertheless some cannabis products (mainly those high in THC) can induce transient symptoms similar to the symptoms of schizophrenia and exacerbate symptoms in individuals already suffering from psychosis. I would expect a doctor not to prescribe medical cannabis in such cases.</p> <p>Cannabis has been a useful medicine for centuries, with known use dating back to 4000BC in ancient China. It was also widely used in ancient Indian, Greek and Roman cultures. Medicinal use was first properly documented by Dioscorides in the first century AD. It has certainly gone through periods of being in and out of fashion. A particular period of enthusiasm was during the 19th century when, for example, Sir John Russell Reynolds recommended it for period pain suffered by Queen Victoria.</p> <p>The government now has the scientific rationale and the evidence. And through the campaigning efforts of End Our Pain and others, we have the powerful personal testimonies of those that are suffering. Let\u2019s act. Let\u2019s legalise access to medical cannabis now.</p>",

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>So now we know (even if we\u2019d long suspected it): we\u2019re going to be kept in the dark. For the time being at least, the government is not going to be saying anything much about what its Brexit strategy will be, or how it is progressing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-questions-uk-eu-single-market-pmqs\">Pressed repeatedly in parliament last week</a> on the question of whether its preferred Brexit deal would include full membership of the EU\u2019s single market, prime minister Theresa May could not have been much clearer (or more non-committal): </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new relationship will include control of the movement of people from the EU into the UK, and it will include the right deal for the trade in goods and services ... It would not be right for me or this government to give a running commentary on negotiations.</p> </blockquote> <p>In case there should be any doubt, she then said it again: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is about developing our own British model. So we will not take decisions until we are ready. We will not reveal our hand prematurely. And we will not provide a running commentary.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brexit minister David Davis went further, telling the House of Lords EU select committee that because the government did not want to give away its negotiating position he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/brexit-talks-may-be-most-complicated-negotiation-ever-says-minister\">\u201cmay not be able to tell [parliament] everything\u201d</a> \u2013 even in private hearings: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can entirely see accountability after the event, that\u2019s very clear. [But] in advance, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for parliamentarians to micro-manage the process and wouldn\u2019t give us an optimum outcome for the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the meantime, tantalising glimpses of what Brexit might imply in practice continue to emerge. Like the possibility that British citizens may have to apply for permission \u2013 and pay \u2013 to visit the continent.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/britons-may-have-to-apply-to-visit-europe-under-eu-visa-scheme\">The Guardian reported on Saturday</a> that a planned EU visa waiver scheme based on the US ESTA system \u2013 which requires travellers to request advance authorisation to travel in exchange for a fee \u2013 could apply to British holidaymakers and business travellers after Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"570646b36c59a418ec18ba36e083662152b4b5ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570646b36c59a418ec18ba36e083662152b4b5ef/0_95_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The home secretary, Amber Rudd, on The Andrew Marr Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked by Andrew Marr on his Sunday morning TV show whether this could indeed be the case, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/amber-rudd-britons-might-need-to-pay-for-permission-to-visit-eu\">home secretary Amber Rudd, said that yes, it could</a>: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly desirable, but we don\u2019t rule it out because we have to be allowed a free hand to get the best negotiations. It\u2019s a reminder that this is a two-way negotiation. The EU ... will be considering their negotiations with us, just as we are with them. </p> </blockquote> <p>Rudd also said the government was considering work permits for EU nationals in Britain as a possible way to control immigration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it seems one or two members \u2013 specifically, the hardcore Brexiters \u2013 of the cabinet are not yet fully on-board with the prime minister\u2019s instructions to keep schtum, refrain from provide running commentaries and avoid revealing the government\u2019s hand.</p> <p>They also have a clear idea of the Brexit they want: hard, and fast. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">Davis needed putting in his place</a> last week after he told MPs it was unlikely that Britain would stay in the single market. Downing Street said he was \u201cexpressing his personal opinion\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly, the international trade minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">Liam Fox, drew fire</a> when he said British business had grown \u201cfat and lazy\u201d and company executives would rather play golf than get out and clinch the new export deals the country will need. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-declines-to-endorse-liam-fox-attack-on-fat-and-lazy-uk-firms\">Downing Street also pointedly declined to endorse his opinion</a>. </p> <p>Boris Johnson, finally, took the fairly remarkable step for a foreign minister of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/boris-johnson-backs-brexit-pressure-campaign-change-britain\">endorsing Change Britain, a new cross-party campaign of prominent pro-Brexit politicians</a> (think Gisela Stuart and Michael Gove) aimed at pressuring the government into delivering on leaving the EU in the way they would like \u2013 namely gaining full control over \u201claws, borders, money and trade\u201d.</p> <p>(Change Britain, incidentally, ran into early difficulties after it quietly dropped one of the key pre-referendum pledges of its predecessor organisation Vote Leave: that Brexit could see an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge\">extra \u00a3350m a week spent on the NHS</a>. Labour MPs instantly demanded the group \u201ceither admit it was a lie and apologise, or justify it and explain when it is coming\u201d.)</p> <p>Further increasing the pressure on May, the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/10/theresa-may-should-invoke-article-50-within-weeks-says-john-whit/\">said in an interview with the Telegraph </a>that the prime minister should invoke article 50 \u2013 setting in motion the formal two-year leaving process \u2013 within weeks, rather than waiting until next year.</p> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>And the pressure isn\u2019t just coming from diehard Brexiters: May met the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, to discuss the UK\u2019s future relationship with the remaining EU-27. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu\">Hinting at rising impatience on the continent, he told her Britain should get on with leaving as soon as possible</a>: \u201cThe ball is in your court.\u201d </p> <p>Emmanuel Macron, the former banker and economy minister who is having a tilt at the French presidency, also said Britain should get out soon. What\u2019s more, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/uk-financial-firms-cant-sell-to-eurozone-after-brexit-says-emmanuel-macron\">he told the Guardian</a> that the City\u2019s crucial passporting rights \u2013 which allow UK-based financial institutions to sell across the eurozone \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be preserved unless the Britain contributes to the EU budget and that no concessions could be made on freedom of movement to boot.</p> <p>The (in theory) pro-British Danish prime minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen told Bloomberg he was urging his EU colleagues to make sure Britain doesn\u2019t end up with a good deal:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to be extremely careful that the side that leaves doesn\u2019t get particular competitive advantages on its way out.

squabbling over the balance of immigration versus trade and whether UK businesses are doing their bit, Brexit is arguably shaping the direction of British politics in other ways.</p> <p>For example,

been rationalised by some as the prime minister seeking to assuage the right of her party, which might be about to see some disappointments over what Brexit actually ends up meaning.</p> <p>There are also repercussions for Labour, with Owen Smith going further even than his previous promise to seek a referendum on the specific Brexit deal by <a

Most importantly, it will upend our trading relationships with Europe and the rest of the world. Only 15% of UK total trade is with countries that are neither members of the EU, nor covered by an EU trade agreement that is in force or under negotiation ... And where is the government on all of this? Not even at first base. Ministers must make their plans for Britain\u2019s trading relationships clear as soon as possible.

It was clever shorthand for \u201cnon-racist yet rigorous-sounding alternative to the status quo\u201d chosen because it seemed meritocratic (points are earned) and culturally digestible (Australia is a friendly, Anglophone cousin country) ... Thus are we confronted with the Conservative Eurosceptics, tongue-tied but blinking smugly in the glare of referendum victory, holding a blank piece of paper where they should have answers on immigration.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/david-davis-european-union-brexit-statement-commons\">Prospect magazine, Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform</a> demonstrates that in his remarks about Britain not needing to be a member of it, David Davis shows he really does not understand the nature and importance of the EU\u2019s single market to Britain\u2019s economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He is plain wrong to contend that Single Market membership has no impact on UK trade with the rest of the EU. All the evidence suggests that the UK exports far more to the EU than can be explained by geographic proximity and income levels: the CER estimates that Britain\u2019s membership of the Single Market has boosted British trade with the EU by 55%. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Tweet of the week</h2> <p>A pleasingly continental cracker, in my humble opinion, from the LRB bookshop:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LRBbookshop/status/771391358598873089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">brecht sit means brecht sit <a href=\"https://t.co/61bYFDkbTI\">pic.twitter.com/61bYFDkbTI</a></p>&mdash; LRB Bookshop (@LRBbookshop) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LRBbookshop/status/771391358598873089\">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>",
  "<p>There\u2019s an uprising within the gig economy: making a stand over pay packages is catching on. This summer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/uber-driver-employment-tribunal-minimum-wage\">Uber drivers have taken the firm to an employment tribunal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/deliveroo-workers-strike-again-over-new-pay-structure\">Deliveroo couriers withdrew their labour</a> over plans to move them to a payment per delivery rather than an hourly rate, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/26/uber-ubereats-drivers-vow-to-take-pay-protest-to-london-restaurants\">UberEats couriers took action over pay</a>.<br></p> <p>Importantly, UK employment law differentiates between workers, employees and the self-employed. The distinctions matter because workers and employees have certain rights, such as entitlement to the national minimum wage and paid annual leave. Employees also have additional rights, such as the right to statutory sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal (normally subject to two years\u2019 service). Self-employed contractors have no such rights.<br></p> <p>This is separate from HMRC\u2019s definition of self-employment, and an individual may be considered to be self-employed for tax purposes while the courts might find that they are in fact a worker or employee. </p> <p>The drivers who have been in court and the couriers who have been protesting are all classed as self-employed by the firms who pay them. As a result they aren\u2019t entitled to the various rights such as the national minimum wage and sick pay. The Uber drivers\u2019 case will decide on their status under existing employment law, but as the number of people in the gig sector grows, it\u2019s time to ask whether the law is protecting those who it needs to protect.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/gig-economy-zero-hours-contracts-ethics\">The gig economy is here to stay. So making it fairer must be a priority | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The starting point is that in law there must be \u201cmutual obligation\u201d for a contract to actually exist, irrespective of the type of status. This basically means that each party must have an obligation to fulfil their part of the deal. Examples could be a decorator agreeing to paint a house for a set fee or a courier agreeing to deliver something for a fixed sum. In both cases, the parties would have an obligation to perform their side of the bargain.<br></p> <p> For worker status, the individual must also be obliged to provide work or services personally, rather than sending another person in their place. They must not be providing the work or services as a business.</p> <p> For employee status, again the work or service must be being done by the person under contract, but there also needs to be an element of control by the employer over the employee. Control in this context could mean, for example, whether or not the individual is bound by a disciplinary policy. Other factors for determining status could be considered, too.</p> <p> The key thing is that what is written in the contract does not determine employment status. It\u2019s what is happening in practice that counts. Unscrupulous businesses operating in the gig economy may deliberately refer to a \u201cself-employed\u201d status in contracts, hoping that this will put people off from questioning their rights, but the courts look beyond the wording. Also, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/25/deliveroo-workers-contracts-ban-access-to-employment-tribunals\">clauses in contracts preventing individuals from bringing claims</a> if they wish to challenge their employment status would most likely be unenforceable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/26/will-we-get-by-gig-economy\">The \u2018gig economy\u2019 is coming. What will it mean for work? | Arun Sundararajan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In deciding status, the courts will look at what is happening within the organisation, and make a decision based on the specific circumstances.<br></p> <p> One of the big problems for people working in the gig economy is that shift arrangements are commonplace, and there may not always be \u201cmutual obligation\u201d for the periods between the shifts. The obligation on either side would usually exist once a shift is offered and accepted, as there would then be a promise of work and a promise of payment. But it may not arise between the shifts if there is no duty to offer a shift or agree to one. This could mean that the individual is not considered a worker or employee for the intervening periods. If that is the case, they wouldn\u2019t during that time, say, be able to accrue statutory holidays or clock up service for the right to bring an unfair dismissal claim. </p> <p> Remember, even if \u201cmutual obligation\u201d is found, other status issues could arise, such as whether the individual can send someone instead of them to do the work, and the question of who is exercising control.</p> <p> The law ought to be reviewed, given that more and more people are working within the gig economy and losing out on rights. </p> <p> However, it\u2019s not going to be easy to make changes. Why? Because there will always need to be \u201cmutual obligation\u201d for a contractual relationship to exist. And if it can\u2019t be found in those intervening periods between work, people will lack rights. Also, the law has to recognise the distinction between those who are effectively controlled by an organisation (employees), those who have slightly looser arrangements (workers) and those who are genuinely in business sacrificing rights for greater flexibility (the self-employed).</p> <p><em>\u2022 Matt Gingell is a partner at Gannons solicitors and specialises in employment law</em></p>",
  "<p>They say patience is a virtue. But fans of elite netball across Australia, including this one \u2013 so excited about the inaugural all-Australian league in 2017, featuring teams aligned to AFL and NRL clubs and to be screened in prime time on free-to-air \u2013 are nearly all out of patience after months of uncertainty and an information vacuum.<br></p> <p>Netball, Australia\u2019s No1 female participation sport, is riding an unprecedented wave of popularity, as evidenced by recent sell-out crowds for the Quad Series against New Zealand, South Africa and England and last year\u2019s world record-breaking World Cup in Sydney, but fans have been short-changed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/two-new-faces-in-diamonds-squad-for-constellation-cup-series\">Two new faces in Diamonds squad for Constellation Cup series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/19/netball-australia-announce-league-with-three-new-teams-and-five-year-tv-deal\">announced the new league in May</a>, the game\u2019s governing body, Netball Australia, has revealed little detail about the competition before its scheduled start in February. That will hopefully change on Wednesday, when a press conference has been called at which those elusive details are finally expected to be made public.</p> <p>This is what we do know so far: the new league, sans New Zealand teams, will include the five ex-ANZ Championship teams; the West Coast Fever, Adelaide Thunderbirds, Melbourne Vixens, NSW Swifts and Queensland Firebirds; as well as new sides affiliated with AFL teams Collingwood and Greater Western Sydney and the NRL\u2019s Melbourne Storm, which will base a team on the Sunshine Coast.</p> <p>Under a five-year deal with Channel Nine and Telstra described as the \u201cmost significant broadcasting rights agreement in the history of Australian women\u2019s sport\u201d, two of the four games each round will be live on free-to-air television, with live streaming and delayed TV for all other games.</p> <p>Netball Australia has announced unlimited imports for the 10 member squads and that the unpopular \u201ctwo-point\u201d goal will not be introduced next year. </p> <p>Yet the list of \u201cunknowns\u201d up until this point is much longer. The league has yet to to announce a name or a naming rights sponsor, although it won\u2019t be the banking giant, ANZ, which ended its nine-year association with the game last week and is backing the new elite netball competition across the Tasman.</p> <p>The draw hasn\u2019t been released, despite several clubs selling memberships. And although it\u2019s believed to be \u201cvery close\u201d, the collective player agreement is not finalised and the salary cap, previously $270,000 a roster, but expected to be significantly more next year, is still a secret. This means the trade period hasn\u2019t officially begun and contracts cannot be signed, although the rumour mill is already in overdrive.</p> <p>If the talk is to be believed, the Vixens have lost captain and Australian Diamond wing attack Madi Robinson and young shooter Alice Teague-Neeld to Collingwood, as well as England international Geva Mentor and Robinson\u2019s sister, Kelsey Browne, to the Sunshine Coast.</p> <p>The Noeline Taurua-coached Queensland team is said to have poached West Coast Fever shooter Caitlin Bassett, widely regarded as the best netballer in the world, as well as Kiwi gun Laura Langman and Swifts shooter Steph Wood, who made her Diamonds debut in the recent Quad Series. Bassett is also rumoured to have met with the Pies.</p> <p>Collingwood, to be coached by Kristy Keppich-Birrell, look like the biggest winner, in line to sign Diamonds starting centre Kim Ravaillion, cult figure Sharni Layton, shooter Caitlin Thwaites, recently capped defender April Brandley and midcourter Ashleigh Brazill, as well as Robinson and Teague-Neeld<strong> \u2013 </strong>nearly a full set of Diamonds.</p> <p>The Greater Western Sydney team, which will be led by former Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic coach Julie Fitzgerald, is rumoured to be in talks with English goaler Jo Harten and Swifts pair, midcourter Kim Greene and shooter Susan Pettitt.</p> <p>But, at least until lunchtime on Wednesday, it\u2019s all been a pantomime, with players, managers and clubs refusing to confirm or deny rumours or reports, because the trade period technically has not begun. Several clubs have issued vaguely worded statements in response to media speculation, but fans have been none the wiser about how their team \u2013 and league \u2013 will look in less than six months. They deserved better.</p> <p>A quick glance at club Facebook pages or online forums dedicated to the game reveals palpable frustration at what has been a stagnant situation. A quick sample: \u201cNetball Australia needs to get their s*** together and finish the collective bargaining agreement!\u201d, \u201cI expected better from Netball Australia\u201d, \u201cso disillusioned by this new comp, that I have zero desire to watch it\u201d, and \u201csadly, I won\u2019t be even thinking of re-signing (for membership) until the team is announced\u201d.</p> <p>The vacuum that was created by the lack of information has been filled \u2013 to the brim \u2013 with half-truths and innuendo. Fans are assuming Collingwood will smash through the salary cap, without knowing what the cap is, players\u2019 reputations and loyalty are being questioned, clubs\u2019 professionalism is being called into question for allegedly not being able to hold on to star players. And everyone is hamstrung to debate it because they don\u2019t have the facts.</p> <p>Bianca Chatfield, former Vixen and Diamond, who is representing the players through the Australian Netball Players\u2019 Association in the negotiation with Netball Australia, says a deal is \u201creally\u201d close, but admitted late on Monday there were \u201ca lot of unknowns for everybody\u201d at that point.</p> <p>\u201cIt has certainly been a long process, but all of the girls have been united and passionate about making sure this will be the best competition for any female athlete anywhere,\u201d Chatfield says. \u201cThese things take a lot of time and there are a lot of moving parts, especially with three new teams coming into the league.</p> <p>\u201cThe competition will be better than we have ever seen before. And it\u2019s awesome to see netball being treated as a professional sport, for maybe the first time.\u201d</p> <p>Just as the players and clubs have had to be patient, Chatfield asked for fans\u2019 patience. \u201cThere are lots of unknowns for everyone involved in the sport at the moment, but once it\u2019s all announced, there will be lots of excitement,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The players, governing body and fans all have one thing in common \u2013 they want the best netball competition in the world, with the best-paid players. Let\u2019s hope Wednesday\u2019s announcement answers the pertinent questions and allows fans to get back to being excited about the brave new world of netball. Better late than never. </p>",

Faith schools are strong class segregators, on average taking a third fewer free-school-meals children. Already a quarter of state places in England and Wales are in <a href=\"http://accordcoalition.org.uk/2016/08/02/faith-school-admissions-found-to-be-socio-economically-exclusive/\">faith schools</a>, in this least religious country.

How does this fit with religious de-radicalisation?</p> <p>None of this looks like a safe pair of hands taking back control in a country beleaguered by uncertainty. May seems set on answering the wrong questions in the wrong way, adding to splits and divisions. Her only piece of good luck is the disappearance of any credible opposition \u2013 but she looks well on her way to filling that void with alternative opposition groups within her own party.</p>",

During the elimination final between Brisbane and Gold Coast, rugby league reached peak hysteria when the NRL\u2019s much-maligned bunker made a decision, went to the board and got the call 100% correct \u2013 and people bayed for their blood.</p> <p>See the incident in your head: it\u2019s the 10th minute, Broncos centre Jordan Kahu bangs away down the left before Konrad Hurrell tackles him almost on the line. Kahu reaches around to plant the ball on the try-line but Hurrell kicks the ball from Kahu\u2019s grasp. The referee on the spot, Gerard Sutton, who can see the ball hasn\u2019t been planted, signals \u201cNo Try\u201d but throws the decision off to the bunker to check what exactly happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/09/broncos-dump-gold-coast-from-nrl-finals-after-bunker-controversy\">Broncos dump Gold Coast from NRL finals after bunker controversy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, you can\u2019t kick the ball out of someone\u2019s hands. You can\u2019t kick at an opponent, period. If you do it\u2019s a penalty. If you do it in the act of someone about to slam the ball over the try-line and score a try, it\u2019s a penalty try. It\u2019s in the rules. There\u2019s no \u201cinterpretation\u201d. It\u2019s black-and-white. End of story. Yet it wasn\u2019t end of story. It was the story.</p> <p>For there we were looking at replays when Peter Sterling \u2013 who along with Phil Gould would be considered the great sage of Channel Nine\u2019s talking heads \u2013 said: \u201cOne thing we know for sure, it\u2019s not a try.\u201d Gloriously, less than a beat of a butterfly\u2019s wing later, the Kentucky Fried Chicken big screen flashed it up: \u201cTRY\u201d. Penalty try, in fact. And underneath the posts Sutton went. \u201cThat\u2019s not a penalty try,\u201d opined sideline man Brad Fittler. \u201cAt what point in our history did that become a try?\u2019\u2019 asked Gould.</p> <p>And the Titans-leaning Twitter-sphere agreed. And there followed a thousand mad memes and malarkey, and ill-founded opinion, and such-forth in these immediate, connected, ever-babbling modern times.</p> <p>Yet to answer Gould\u2019s question, it became a try when someone put it in the rule book and asked referees to adjudicate according to that rule book. For there it is in Section 15.1.a under \u201cPlayer\u2019s Misconduct\u201d. \u201cA player is guilty of misconduct if he trips, kicks or strikes another player.\u201d In Section 6 there\u2019s this: \u201cThe referee may award a penalty try if, in his opinion, a try would have been scored but for the unfair play of the defending team.\u201d</p> <p>So there you go. Penalty try. You can\u2019t kick your opponent, even if you\u2019re only trying to kick the ball. And you definitely can\u2019t complain about adjudicators ruling according to the rules of the game.</p> <p>Afterwards Gould tweeted: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt more deflated after calling a game of football. I didn\u2019t care which team won tonight. But I care for the game.\u201d</p> <p>Darryl Brohman was similarly flat: \u201cI am absolutely deflated after calling that game. The officiating and the technology has absolutely ruined what I thought would be a beauty.\u201d</p> <p>Now, these men have a case. For the referees in the particular fixture (and indeed throughout the weekend) made mistakes. Corey Oates leapt onto David Mead\u2019s back in the middle of a contest for a bomb and Mead was penalised when Oates landed hard. James Roberts lashed out with his boot at a prone Ryan Simpkins. You\u2019re not allowed to do that, it\u2019s in Section 15. Yet Roberts played the ball and the Broncos scored in the next play, and they couldn\u2019t go to the bunker because play-the-ball can\u2019t be checked. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/nrl-match-officials-too-scared-to-make-a-call-says-josh-morris-after-defeat\">NRL match officials 'too scared to make a call', says Josh Morris after defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were other errors, and the Broncos got the rub of them but that, people, is life. Mistakes happen. In rugby league, in sport, in business, in the even greater game of all called life. They always have and they always will. There was never a golden era of refereeing; Bill Harrigan made errors, Greg Hartley made errors. Kevin Roberts, Keith Page, whoever watched Dally Messenger tossing the ball over the line, they all made mistakes. </p> <p>The NRL\u2019s administrators, in their efforts to appease fans and media and hysterical, shrill kooks everywhere, have thrown a heap of money at this bunker business, and it <em>has </em>resulted in less errors. By rewinding the game in real time and checking on things, adjudicators are able to get most things right. More than they did, anyway. Yet, ironically, counter-intuitively, rugby league is not a better game because of it. You would think it would be, but it\u2019s not. For in an effort to \u201cperfect\u201d the game, officialdom has slowed it down. And each seminal play is dissected to the last pixel in a $2 million tech-heavy off-site bunker. And those adjudicators do get most things right. They <em>are </em>consistent. It\u2019s at the expense of common sense, occasionally, but you can\u2019t demand consistency and whine when you get it. </p> <p>Another repercussion of getting things mostly right is that those mistakes that are made \u2013 on-field, in the bunker \u2013 are highlighted manifold. And when that happens, everyone loses their mind.</p> <p>Corey Parker is nigh-on the oldest and wisest man still bumping ugly on the league field. He was on radio after the Titans match saying video adjudication is a side of the game that needs to be \u201ccleaned up\u201d. And he didn\u2019t mean wiped out. He meant tinkered with, to make it more correct, again. But he\u2019s wrong, for on that path lies more madness. </p> <p>Trying to \u201cclean up\u201d rugby league (read: make it perfect) has led to where we are now. The game is slowed down. There are long moments of waiting. On-field referees are adjudicating on how their decision will affect the game (and how their performance is later marked by a jury of their peers). They\u2019re covering themselves by sending most everything upstairs. And who could blame them? Whether they get it right or wrong, they\u2019re yelled at anyway. </p> <p>So to hell with perfect, to hell with clean. There can never be clean. Rugby league needs to brush video replays for all but grounding. And then everyone needs to learn acceptance. Fans, media, players, everyone, has to accept there will be errors. And to just move on, and acknowledge that in the hurly burly of a game of footy that referees are human and make mistakes, as do players, officials, fans, talking heads in the box, every last one us.</p> <p>Yet instead the NRL will continue on a doomed, Quixotic quest for perfection in a game that never can be perfect because it\u2019s played by humans who are not and never will be. And thus the game will be slowed. And refs will still get calls wrong and we\u2019ll yell at them and each other when they do. And there we\u2019ll be, eating our own head.</p>",

Let Hillary and I sit there and just debate because I think the system is being rigged so it\u2019s gonna be a very unfair debate, and I can see it happening right now because everyone\u2019s saying that he was soft on Trump. Well now the new person\u2019s gonna try to be really hard on Trump just to show, you know, the establishment what he can do. So I think it\u2019s very unfair what they\u2019re doing.

At the average standard variable rate of 7.8% that meant a monthly repayment of $1,682. </p> <p>In July the average new mortgage was $370,500 and at an average mortgage rate of 5.4% the repayment for such a loan is $2,263 a month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mortgages during Glenn Stevens' governorship of the RBA\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cvER7/4/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The increase in repayments are not so dramatic when you take into account inflation. In 2016 dollars, the 2006 mortgage repayments are $2,106 a month \u2013 still $157 a month less than they are now. </p> <p>It all serves to reinforce not just the massive increase in the cost of housing over the past 10 years, but also just how changed the economy has become. </p> <p>Those average mortgage rates of 9.6% would now absolutely kill the economy. At that rate, the average mortgage repayments for a $370,500 loan would be (hold your breath) $3,273 a month. </p> <p>What does this mean? Well firstly, forget having to pay interest rates like we did prior to the GFC. It would be almost impossible to imagine such rates occurring again in the next 20 years. </p> <p>To have the conditions where the economy required rate to be raised by 4% or more, would mean GDP growing well above average for a good five or six years straight. It took six years of our biggest investment boom in history for the average mortgage rate to go from 6.05% in 2002 to 9.6% in 2008.</p> <p>It means should the economy require a bit of a slowing (I know, hard to remember such a need) the RBA would only need to slightly touch the brakes, in order to put significant hurt on Australian mortgage holders. </p> <p>To get to the same real mortgage repayments as occurred at the peak in 2008 when the rate was 9.6%, rates now would only need to be raised to 6.85% - which would only need the cash rate to be raised to around 3%. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/22/scott-morrison-is-losing-his-negative-gearing-modelling-war\">Scott Morrison is losing his negative gearing modelling war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Things have changed so greatly that for the RBA to get mortgage repayments up to where they were raised to <em>prior</em> the GFC, the RBA would now need only to raise them to the level they were cut to <em>during</em> the GFC. </p> <p>But the level of mortgage repayments also highlights the difficulties for the RBA when it comes to stimulating the economy. </p> <p>In the midst of the GFC, the lowest the average mortgage repayment in 2016 dollar terms was $1,992 a month. To reduce repayments to that (assuming no increase in the average mortgage size), would mean the mortgage rate would need to be dropped to around 4.15%.</p> <p>That would require the RBA cutting the cash rate to 0.25% - and that is assuming the banks pass on the full rate cut. </p> <p>This doesn\u2019t really give you much room to move. </p> <p>In such a context it is thus not surprising that despite cuts to interest rates in the past six months, the latest <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/5609.0Main+Features1Jul%202016?OpenDocument\">housing finance figures</a> show a significant cooling:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Owner-occupier housing finance - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EFzKX/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Cutting rates at this point is a bit like pushing a piece of string. </p> <p>From last May when the RBA began to once again cut interest rates, the average new mortgage has increased by 10% and the average repayments for those mortgages has risen by 9%.</p> <p>Now the growing size of new mortgages doesn\u2019t affect those already with a loan. Such people just get the benefit of the rate cut. As a result, while overall housing debt to disposable income ratio is at a record high, our debt interest payments have stayed relatively stable:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Housing debt and interest payments to income ratios\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a2s64/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But even here we can see we are paying a lot more of our income in interest repayments than we were in the 1990s and early 2000s, and roughly the same as we were during her GFC.</p> <p>It means even with further rate cuts, new home buyers will be taking on historically high levels of debt.</p> <p>Thus when Philip Lowe takes over as governor of the RBA next week, he is faced with a much different economy and monetary situation that Glenn Stevens. </p> <p>He undoubtedly has much more powerful brakes than Stevens had at his disposal; but his accelerator power is much diminished. </p>",
